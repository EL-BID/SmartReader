DEBUG:root:VideoAre the robots coming for government jobs According to Bill Eggers the answer is yes sort of Eggers who runs Deloitte s Center for Government Insights said at a Nov 29 FCW event on government modernization that 20 to 30 percent of all work activities will soon be automatable thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence He pointed to a Deloitte study of the federal workforce that found 4 3 billion hours are spent each year on a wide range of task and activities A huge share of those hours is devoted to essentially moving paper he said while relatively little time goes to coaching and other sorts of human activities But the study also found that four out of five of the most labor intensive activities have either a medium or high automation potential Eggers said That could allow for reductions in certain parts of the workforce he noted but it also frees up time for critical higher value work and the chance to deliver better service by giving the human workforce AI powered support Studies have repeatedly shown Eggers said that it s the human machine pairing that gives the best results he said The full video of Eggers half hour talk which explores the larger implications for government as AI becomes the new electricity is available below Note This dual screen video recording is best viewed when expanded to the full browser window For more

publication has been defining and informing the senior management agenda since 1964 Our learning programs help organizations accelerate growth by unlocking their people s potential Automation and artificial intelligence AI are transforming businesses and will contribute to economic growth via contributions to productivity They will also help address moonshot societal challenges in areas from health to climate change At the same time these technologies will transform the nature of work and the workplace itself Machines will be able to carry out more of the tasks done by humans complement the work that humans do and even perform some tasks that go beyond what humans can do As a result some occupations will decline others will grow and many more will change While we believe there will be enough work to go around barring extreme scenarios society will need to grapple with significant workforce transitions and dislocation Workers will need to acquire new skills and adapt to the increasingly capable machines alongside them in the workplace They may have to move from declining occupations to growing and in some cases new occupations This executive briefing which draws on the latest research from the McKinsey Global Institute examines both the promise and the challenge of automation and AI in the workplace and outlines some of the critical issues that policy makers companies and individuals will need to solve for Automation and AI are not new but recent technological progress is pushing the frontier of what machines can do Our research suggests that society needs these improvements to provide value for businesses contribute to economic growth and make once unimaginable progress on some of our most difficult societal challenges In summary Beyond traditional industrial automation and advanced robots new generations of more capable autonomous systems are appearing in environments ranging from autonomous vehicles on roads to automated check outs in grocery stores Much of this progress has been driven by improvements in systems and components including mechanics sensors and software AI has made especially large strides in recent years as machine learning algorithms have become more sophisticated and made use of huge increases in computing power and of the exponential growth in data available to train them Spectacular breakthroughs are making headlines many involving beyond human capabilities in computer vision natural language processing and complex games such as Go These technologies are already generating value in various products and services and companies across sectors use them in an array of processes to personalize product recommendations find anomalies in production identify fraudulent transactions and more The latest generation of AI advances including techniques that address classification estimation and clustering problems promises significantly more value still An analysis we conducted of several hundred AI use cases found that the most advanced deep learning techniques deploying artificial neural networks could account for as much as 3 5 trillion to 5 8 trillion in annual value or 40 percent of the value created by all analytics techniques Exhibit 1 Deployment of AI and automation technologies can do much to lift the global economy and increase global prosperity at a time when aging and falling birth rates are acting as a drag on growth Labor productivity growth a key driver of economic growth has slowed in many economies dropping to an average of 0 5 percent in 2010 2014 from 2 4 percent a decade earlier in the United States and major European economies in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis after a previous productivity boom had waned AI and automation have the potential to reverse that decline productivity growth could potentially reach 2 percent annually over the next decade with 60 percent of this increase from digital opportunities AI is also being used in areas ranging from material science to medical research and climate science Application of the technologies in these and other disciplines could help tackle societal moonshot challenges For example researchers at Geisinger have developed an algorithm that could reduce diagnostic times for intracranial hemorrhaging by up to 96 percent Researchers at George Washington University meanwhile are using machine learning to more accurately weight the climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AI and automation still face challenges The limitations are partly technical such as the need for massive training data and difficulties generalizing algorithms across use cases Recent innovations are just starting to address these issues Other challenges are in the use of AI techniques For example explaining decisions made by machine learning algorithms is technically challenging which particularly matters for use cases involving financial lending or legal applications Potential bias in the training data and algorithms as well as data privacy malicious use and security are all issues that must be addressed Europe is leading with the new General Data Protection Regulation which codifies more rights for users over data collection and usage A different sort of challenge concerns the ability of organizations to adopt these technologies where people data availability technology and process readiness often make it difficult Adoption is already uneven across sectors and countries The finance automotive and telecommunications sectors lead AI adoption Among countries US investment in AI ranked first at 15 billion to 23 billion in 2016 followed by Asia s investments of 8 billion to 12 billion with Europe lagging behind at 3 billion to 4 billion Even as AI and automation bring benefits to business and society we will need to prepare for major disruptions to work Our analysis of more than 2000 work activities across more than 800 occupations shows that certain categories of activities are more easily automatable than others They include physical activities in highly predictable and structured environments as well as data collection and data processing These account for roughly half of the activities that people do across all sectors The least susceptible categories include managing others providing expertise and interfacing with stakeholders Nearly all occupations will be affected by automation but only about 5 percent of occupations could be fully automated by currently demonstrated technologies Many more occupations have portions of their constituent activities that are automatable we find that about 30 percent of the activities in 60 percent of all occupations could be automated This means that most workers from welders to mortgage brokers to CEOs will work alongside rapidly evolving machines The nature of these occupations will likely change as a result Automation will displace some workers We have found that around 15 percent of the global workforce or about 400 million workers could be displaced by automation in the period 2016 2030 This reflects our midpoint scenario in projecting the pace and scope of adoption Under the fastest scenario we have modeled that figure rises to 30 percent or 800 million workers In our slowest adoption scenario only about 10 million people would be displaced close to zero percent of the global workforce Exhibit 2 The wide range underscores the multiple factors that will impact the pace and scope of AI and automation adoption Technical feasibility of automation is only the first influencing factor Other factors include the cost of deployment labor market dynamics including labor supply quantity quality and the associated wages the benefits beyond labor substitution that contribute to business cases for adoption and finally social norms and acceptance Adoption will continue to vary significantly across countries and sectors because of differences in the above factors especially labor market dynamics in advanced economies with relatively high wage levels such as France Japan and the United States automation could displace 20 to 25 percent of the workforce by 2030 in a midpoint adoption scenario more than double the rate in India Even as workers are displaced there will be growth in demand for work and consequently jobs We developed scenarios for labor demand to 2030 from several catalysts of demand for work including rising incomes increased spending on healthcare and continuing or stepped up investment in infrastructure energy and technology development and deployment These scenarios showed a range of additional labor demand of between 21 percent to 33 percent of the global workforce 555 million and 890 million jobs to 2030 more than offsetting the numbers of jobs lost Some of the largest gains will be in emerging economies such as India where the working age population is already growing rapidly Additional economic growth including from business dynamism and rising productivity growth will also continue to create jobs Many other new occupations that we cannot currently imagine will also emerge and may account for as much as 10 percent of jobs created by 2030 if history is a guide Moreover technology itself has historically been a net job creator For example the introduction of the personal computer in the 1970s and 1980s created millions of jobs not just for semiconductor makers but also for software and app developers of all types customer service representatives and information analysts Partial automation will become more prevalent as machines complement human labor For example AI algorithms that can read diagnostic scans with a high degree of accuracy will help doctors diagnose patient cases and identify suitable treatment In other fields jobs with repetitive tasks could shift toward a model of managing and troubleshooting automated systems At retailer Amazon employees who previously lifted and stacked objects are becoming robot operators monitoring the automated arms and resolving issues such as an interruption in the flow of objects While we expect there will be enough work to ensure full employment in 2030 based on most of our scenarios the transitions that will accompany automation and AI adoption will be significant The mix of occupations will change as will skill and educational requirements Work will need to be redesigned to ensure that humans work alongside machines most effectively Automation will accelerate the shift in required workforce skills we have seen over the past 15 years Demand for advanced technological skills such as programming will grow rapidly Social emotional and higher cognitive skills such as creativity critical thinking and complex information processing will also see growing demand Basic digital skills demand has been increasing and that trend will continue and accelerate Demand for physical and manual skills will decline but will remain the single largest category of workforce skills in 2030 in many countries Exhibit 3 This will put additional pressure on the already existing workforce skills challenge as well as the need for new credentialing systems While some innovative solutions are emerging solutions that can match the scale of the challenge will be needed Our research suggests that in a midpoint scenario around 3 percent of the global workforce will need to change occupational categories by 2030 though scenarios range from about 0 to 14 percent Some of these shifts will happen within companies and sectors but many will occur across sectors and even geographies Occupations made up of physical activities in highly structured environments or in data processing or collection will see declines Growing occupations will include those with difficult to automate activities such as managers and those in unpredictable physical environments such as plumbers Other occupations that will see increasing demand for work include teachers nursing aides and tech and other professionals As intelligent machines and software are integrated more deeply into the workplace workflows and workspaces will continue to evolve to enable humans and machines to work together As self checkout machines are introduced in stores for example cashiers can become checkout assistance helpers who can help answer questions or troubleshoot the machines More system level solutions will prompt rethinking of the entire workflow and workspace Warehouse design may change significantly as some portions are designed to accommodate primarily robots and others to facilitate safe human machine interaction The occupational mix shifts will likely put pressure on wages Many of the current middle wage jobs in advanced economies are dominated by highly automatable activities such as in manufacturing or in accounting which are likely to decline High wage jobs will grow significantly especially for high skill medical and tech or other professionals but a large portion of jobs expected to be created including teachers and nursing aides typically have lower wage structures The risk is that automation could exacerbate wage polarization income inequality and the lack of income advancement that has characterized the past decade across advanced economies stoking social and political tensions Most countries already face the challenge of adequately educating and training their workforces to meet the current requirements of employers Across the OECD spending on worker education and training has been declining over the last two decades Spending on worker transition and dislocation assistance has also continued to shrink as a percentage of GDP One lesson of the past decade is that while globalization may have benefited economic growth and people as consumers the wage and dislocation effects on workers were not adequately addressed Most analyses including our own suggest that the scale of these issues is likely to grow in the coming decades We have also seen in the past that large scale workforce transitions can have a lasting effect on wages during the 19th century Industrial Revolution wages in the United Kingdom remained stagnant for about half a century despite rising productivity a phenomenon known as Engels Pause PDF 690KB after the German philosopher who identified it In the search for appropriate measures and policies to address these challenges we should not seek to roll back or slow diffusion of the technologies Companies and governments should harness automation and AI to benefit from the enhanced performance and productivity contributions as well as the societal benefits These technologies will create the economic surpluses that will help societies manage workforce transitions Rather the focus should be on ways to ensure that the workforce transitions are as smooth as possible This is likely to require actionable and scalable solutions in several key areas There is work for everyone today and there will be work for everyone tomorrow even in a future with automation Yet that work will be different requiring new skills and a far greater adaptability of the workforce than we have seen Training and retraining both midcareer workers and new generations for the coming challenges will be an imperative Government private sector leaders and innovators all need to work together to better coordinate public and private initiatives including creating the right incentives to invest more in human capital The future with automation and AI will be challenging but a much richer one if we harness the technologies with aplomb and mitigate the negative effects James Manyika is chairman and

including identifying opportunities to incorporate automation focusing on emerging and mission critical skills reskilling and redeploying employees to high value work activities and creating career paths in the government that will best fit workforce planning needs In the fourth installment of the GovExec LIVE series we sat down with leaders from across the government to discuss strategies for

JorgensenWind back the clock to 1971 Jane a freshly minted college graduate joins the government as a clerk Jane s work consists largely of entering information into databases and creating reports which requires her to spend the better part of her work day seated at a terminal near a mainframe computer that fills an entire room Jane and her colleagues are expected to be at their desks from 9 a m to 5 p m five days a week Jane is grateful to have a steady 9 to 5 job and plans to spend her entire career with her agency Flash forward 40 years and meet Jane s grandson Ian He carries a slim tablet wherever he goes which has more computing power than the mainframe with which Jane worked Ian is constantly tethered to the Internet and works 24 7 from wherever he is Ian expects to switch from project to project and office to office as his career develops and his interests evolve If he feels he has reached the limit of his ability to learn or grow in one role he will look elsewhere for a new opportunity What if the government could give Ian the opportunities and experiences he seeks The GovCloud concept proposed in this paper would restructure government workforces in a way that takes advantage of the talents and preferences of workers like Ian who are entering the workforce today The model is based on a large body of research from interviews with public and private sector experts to best practices from innovative organizations both public and private This is the first generation of people that work play think and learn differently than their parents They are the first generation to not be afraid of technology It s like the air to them Don Tapscott author of Grown Up DigitalThis report details trends in work and technology that offer significant opportunities for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the government workforce It lays out the GovCloud model explaining how governments could be organized to take advantage of its flexibility It examines how work would be performed in the new model and discusses potential changes to government HR programs to support GovCloud Other sections provide resources for executives including a tool to help determine cloud eligibility steps they can take to pilot the cloud concept and future scenarios illustrating the cloud in action The GovCloud model represents a dramatic departure from the status quo It is bound to be greeted with some skepticism Without such innovation however governments will be left to confront the challenges of tomorrow with the workforce structure of yesterday The details of the GovCloud model are open for debate The purpose of this paper is to jumpstart that debate Forty years ago more than half of employed American adults worked in either blue collar or clerical jobs Today less than 40 percent work in these same categories and the share continues to shrink 1 Jobs requiring routine or manual tasks are disappearing while those requiring complex communication skills and expert thinking are becoming the norm 2 Increasingly employers seek workers capable of creative and knowledge based work We should ask ourselves whether we re truly satisfied with the status quo Are our workday lives so fulfilling and our organizations so boundlessly capable that it s now pointless to long for something better Gary Hamel author of The Future of ManagementThe next generation of creative knowledge workers has already entered the job market These Millennials came of age in a rapidly and radically changing world They are the first true digital natives They have grown up with instant access to information through technology As such Millennials have considerably different expectations for the kind of work they do and the information they use The pursuit for variety in work has led Millennials to cite simply needing a change as their top reason for switching jobs 3Advances in technology have also changed the actual ways in which people perform work The ability to crowdsource tasks is one example of this change Since its founding in 2001 volunteers have produced and contributed to over 19 million articles in 281 languages on Wikipedia 4 Built around this concept a burgeoning industry is developing around microtasking dividing work up into small tasks that can be farmed out to workers Amazon s Mechanical Turk rolled out in 2005 allows users to post tasks to a platform where registered workers can accept and complete them for a small fee When this paper was written more than 195 000 tasks were available on Mechanical Turk 5Such technologies may offer suitable possibilities for the public sector Microtask a Finnish cloud labor company maintains Digitalkoot a program that helps the Finnish National Library convert its image archives into digital text and correct existing errors It does so with volunteered labor participants simply play a game in which they are shown the image of a word and then must type it out to help a cartoon character cross a bridge In doing so they are turning scanned images into searchable text greatly improving the search accuracy of old manuscripts 6 At present more than 100 000 people have completed over 6 million microtasks associated with this project 7As the pace of computing power and machine learning increases professors Frank Levy and Richard Murnane contend that more tasks will move from human to computer processing 8 Skeptics need look no further than IBM s Watson a computer that can answer questions posed in natural language In February 2011 Watson defeated two all time champions of the quiz show Jeopardy This was not solely a publicity stunt IBM hopes to sell Watson to hospitals and call centers to help them answer questions from the public 9Around the globe more and more governments are looking to increase telework among employees In 2010 the U S government passed legislation calling for more telework opportunities for government employees Likewise the Australian government in order to attract and retain information and communications technology workers instituted a teleworking policy in 2009 requiring agencies to implement flexible work plans 10 Other countries including Norway and Germany are also focusing on flexible work arrangements to improve public sector recruiting 11 In Canada the government has an official telework policy that recognizes changes are occurring in the public service workforce with a shift towards more knowledge workers and encourages departments to implement telework arrangements 12Cloud definitionsCloud computing Internet based computing whereby shared resources software and information are provided to computers and other devices on demand like electricity AmazonCrowdsourcing Neologistic compound of crowd and outsourcing for the act of taking tasks traditionally performed by an employee or contractor and outsourcing them to a group of people or community through an open call to a large group of people a crowd asking for contributions WikipediaGovCloud A new model for government based on team collaboration whereby workforce resources can be surged to provide services to government agencies on demand GovLabSource Frank Levy and Richard J Murnane The New Division of Labor How Computers are Creating the Next Job Market Princeton Princeton University Press 2004 p 50 Figure 1 Trends in routine and non routine tasks in the U S 1960 200213These are all powerful steps in the right direction for employees whose natural work rhythms are not locked into 9 to 5 Some companies have taken telework one step further British Telecom is pushing the concept of agile working through its Workstyle Project where employees decide what work arrangements best suit them rather than a rigid definition by location and hours BT Workstyle is one of the largest flexible working projects in Europe with over 11 000 home based workers BT has found that its home enabled employees are on average 20 percent more productive than their office based colleagues 14Similarly U S electronics retailer Best Buy experimented with a Results Only Work Environment ROWE In a ROWE what matters is not whether employees are in their office but rather that they complete their work and achieve measurable outcomes In a ROWE salaried employees must put in as much time as is actually needed to do their work no more no less The decline in routine and manual tasks and the rise of new ways of working is not isolated to the private sector In 1950 the U S federal workforce largely comprised clerks performing repetitive tasks About 62 percent performed these tasks while only 11 percent performed more white collar work By 2000 those relationships were reversed Fifteen percent performed repetitive tasks compared to 56 percent in the white collar categories 16 Similarly in 1944 the number of workers in the UK civil service considered industrial totaled 505 000 By 2003 this number fell to 18 200 with non industrial workers reaching 538 000 in 2004 17 And in Canada in 2006 knowledge based workers represented 58 percent of federal workers in the Core Public Administration up from 41 percent 11 years earlier 18The swelling ranks of non industrial government workers indicate a shift in public sector jobs toward creative collaborative and complex work The workforce structure however designed for clerks of the last century remains largely the same With limited flexibility to distribute resources governments often address change by creating new agencies and programs This can be seen following major events like the outbreaks of the Avian flu and SARs in the past decade 9 11 and the financial crisis of 2008 Source United States Office of Personnel Management A Fresh Start for Federal Pay A Case for Modernization April 2002 p 5 http www opm gov strategiccomp whtpaper pdfFigure 2 The changing U S federal workforce 1950 200015Given increasing budgetary pressures and burgeoning national debts the conventional model of creating new agencies or permanent structures in response to new challenges is unsustainable This is exacerbated by our inability to accurately predict future needs and trends Consider a 1968 Business Week article proclaiming that the Japanese auto industry isn t likely to carve out a big share of the market for itself or the president of Digital Equipment Corporation who in 1977 said t here is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home 19The world is full of experts who attempt to predict the future and fail 20Instead of endeavoring to predict the future governments can choose to create a flexible workforce that can quickly adapt to future work requirements To accomplish this the government can learn from a game changing concept in the technology world cloud computing Major organizations and small startups alike increase their flexibility by sharing storage space information and resources in a cloud allowing them to quickly scale resources up and down as needed Why not apply the cloud model to people The creation of a government wide human cloud could provide significant benefits including A cloud based government workforce or GovCloud could include workers who perform a range of creative problem focused work Rather than being slotted into any single government agency cloud workers would be true government wide employees This section outlines the organizational structure of the GovCloud model which rests on three main pillars a cloud of government workers thin executive agencies and shared services Most government workforce models tend to constrain workers by isolating them in separate agencies Consider the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom and the subsequent slaughter of more than 6 million pigs sheep and cattle The problem of an impacted food supply is complicated In most countries multiple agencies focus on agriculture food production and public health In the United Kingdom the army and even tourism ministries were impacted by the outbreak as agencies became overwhelmed by the number of animals in need of disposal and by the cordoning off of tourist areas to prevent the spread of the disease Yet the structure of government agencies often confines employees to work in information silos creating inherent operational inefficiencies In a cloud workforce model experts in each area could be pulled together to support remedies and propose coordinated corrective measures I want someone saying Did you know that the Ministry of Justice is doing that or could you piggy back on what the communities department is doing or had you thought about doing it in this way You ve got to get away from thinking about centralized command and control Dame Helen Ghosh Permanent Secretary UK Home Office 21The FedCloud modelThe GovCloud model could become a new pillar of government comprising permanent employees who undertake a wide variety of creative problem focused work As needed the GovCloud model could also take advantage of those outside government including citizens looking for extra part time work full time contractors and individual consultants Cloud workers would vary in background and expertise but would exhibit traits of free agent workers self sufficient self motivated employees who exhibit a strong loyalty to teams colleagues and clients Daniel Pink author of Drive The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us argues that 33 million Americans one quarter of the workforce already operate as free agents 22According to the white paper Lessons of the Great Recession from Swiss staffing company Adecco contingent workers those who chose non traditional employment arrangements23 are expected to eventually make up about 25 percent of the global workforce 24These more autonomous workers according to Pink are better suited to 21st century work and are more productive even without traditional monetary incentives 25The fluid nature of the cloud can provide significant benefits The nature of the cloud teams forming and dissolving as their tasks require encourages workers to focus on specific project outcomes rather than ongoing operations Thin agency structures could lead to Greater use of shared services could allow the federal government to The need to support some ongoing missions will remain of course These missions will be carried out by thin agencies Under the cloud concept federal agencies would remain focused on specific missions and ongoing oversight These agencies however would become thinner as many of their knowledge workers transfer into the cloud Thin agencies could also create opportunities to streamline organizations with overlapping missions Employees working in thin agencies could fall into two main categories GovCloud could change the highest levels of public sector workers as we know them today The Senior Executive Service in the United States Permanent Secretaries and Directors General in the United Kingdom and Australia all such senior officials could rotate between agencies shared services and the cloud which would reflect the original intent behind many of these high level offices giving executives a breadth of experience in roles across government to help develop shared values and a broad perspective An important benefit of rotation would be the ability to tap into cloud networks to assemble high performing teams To further focus agencies on specific missions many of their back office support functions could be pulled into government wide shared service arrangements The use of shared services in government has come and gone in waves usually dictated by fiscal necessity Most countries in Europe as part of their e government strategies have placed increased focus of late on developing shared services whether through an executive agency or a CIO as well as working with EU coordination activities And while the decentralized governments of some EU countries such as Germany make shared services more difficult these countries are using states and agencies to pilot innovative approaches 27Other efforts around the world include the U S e Government Act of 2002 which examined how technology could be used to cut costs and improve services More recently the New Zealand government appointed an advisory group in May 2011 to explore public sector reform to improve services and provide better value In their report Better Public Services the advisory group recommended the use of shared services to improve effectiveness in a variety of government settings including policy advice and real estate 29 Following up on this three New Zealand agencies the Department of the Prime Minister the State Services Commission and the Treasury announced in December 2011 that they would share such corporate functions as human resources and information technology 30 And though shared services in Western Australia were shut down other projects in South Australia are moving ahead and already showing savings 31In August 2011 the government of Canada announced the launch of Shared Services Canada a program that seeks to streamline and identify savings in information technology Among its first targets is something as mundane as email But with more than 100 different email systems being used by government employees the potential savings and boost to efficiency could be significant Not only do these incompatible systems cost money by requiring individual departments to negotiate and maintain separate licenses and technical support it also makes it difficult for government employees to communicate with one another and with the public And with no single standard ensuring the security of information transmitted over email becomes more challenging Shared Services Canada will move the government to one email system as well as consolidate data centers and networks ultimately looking for anticipated savings of between CA 100 million and CA 200 million annually 28While the idea of using shared services is not a novel one it is central to the GovCloud model The GovCloud model envisions building upon effective practices and those shared services already in operation to deliver services like human resources information technology finance and acquisitions government wide Workers in these shared services would include subject matter experts in areas like human resources and information technology as well as generalists who support routine business functions The potential for shared services continues to grow As seen with IBM s Watson and Microtask s Digitalkoot new technologies provide an opportunity to accelerate the automated delivery of basic services Some agencies already have begun capitalizing on these trends For example NASA has moved its shared service center website to a secure government cloud facilitating greater employee self service and helping to reduce demand on finite call center resources 32This decision tool is designed to help leaders determine which employees are appropriate for each of the three structures in the GovCloud model the cloud thin agencies and shared services To the cloud GovCloud Project LifecycleManaging employees in the cloud will require governments to reinvent human resource management Individual and team performance evaluations career development pay structures and benefits and pensions would need to change to support GovCloud This section examines possibilities for HR reinvention including performance management career development workplace flexibility and benefits Employees working in the cloud would require an alternative to determine pay and career advancement The government could take its cues from the gaming world and evaluate cloud workers with a point system The manager as we know it will disappear to be replaced by a new sort of business operative whose expertise is assembling the right people for particular projects Daniel Pink author of Free Agent Nation 33An HR management system that incorporates the accumulation of experience points XP through effective work on cloud projects training education and professional certifications could replace the tenure centric models for cloud employees As employees accumulate XP they could level up and take on additional responsibilities in future projects Workers in the cloud could earn XP in four ways After some high profile incidents slow responses to outbreaks of foot and mouth disease flooding that may have been preventable and a farming subsidy system that seemed to result in more chaos than aid the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs DEFRA was looking to reinvent itself In 2006 the department launched DEFRA Renew One of its key goals was to bring the department s policymaking closer to actual delivery to create more responsive processes Organized mainly by policy with fixed teams DEFRA had been unable to redeploy resources as needed in response to a crisis As part of DEFRA Renew a new operating model was implemented that used flexible resourcing where staff were assigned to specific projects for fixed periods This allowed management to measure and build the required capabilities and competencies needed and to allocate resources efficiently to improve overall service quality New roles were also created to support sustainable staff development and resource management in the new model To create buy in for such a fundamental culture shift within the department a facilitative approach to decision making was employed Change management programs and mentoring were extended to all levels of the department including leadership New mechanisms such as approval panels for resources and the use of business cases also worked to push changes among staff and promote collaborative behavior DEFRA Renew was widely recognized as a key enabler in the department meeting required efficiency improvement targets set by the UK government DEFRA moved to a more project based approach with fewer staff in core teams According to Dame Helen Ghosh former Permanent Secretary of DEFRA they could be more responsive now that the management board won t be made up of director generals with individual policy silos 34Just as XP could be gained through learning new skills it could be lost in the following three ways Any serious discussion about creating a new class of government employees requires a fresh look at employee benefits and compensation For example XP could be used to help determine workers salaries but additional research into alternative pension and benefit programs is needed While any discussion on compensation could be contentious a healthy debate among stakeholders from across the government should be welcomed As new roles emerge in the cloud so too could new career paths Career emphasis could move away from time served in a particular pay grade and toward milestones that are meaningful for employee development Each worker may have different career aspirations For instance not all workers aspire to management some may seek to master a particular subject area instead Career advancement in the cloud would not equate to moving up a ladder but rather moving along a lattice Lattice GovCloud ModelHere s how the lattice could work for Ian who we met in the introduction Think of the lattice as a jungle gym The best opportunities to broaden your experience may be lateral or even down Look every which way and swing to opportunities Pattie Sellers Fortune editor at largeCathleen Benko and Molly Anderson the authors of The Corporate Lattice argue that the corporate ladder is giving way to a lattice that accommodates flatter more networked organizations improves the integration of career and life focuses on competencies rather than tenure and helps increase workforce loyalty 35 The lattice metaphor allows employees to choose many ways to get ahead It is unlikely that all workers will thrive in the new GovCloud environment right out of the gate As such it would be important to assess a worker s readiness before placing her in GovCloud and providing training on core competencies critical to cloud success There could also be opportunities to start workers especially those at earlier stages of a career within an agency or shared service to build up expertise in some area before graduating to the cloud Once in the cloud new workers could be paired with mentors who are more experienced to help navigate the cloud experience itself There should be an emphasis on continuous learning in the cloud It would be important for cloud workers to continue to refine their skills develop additional expertise and adapt to new ways of working Not only could continuous learning affect workers career mobility by increasing the depth and breadth of their skills but it could also impact their salary and level by increasing their XP Learning and development in the cloud could take on many themes of next learning Next learning focuses on creating personalized learning experiences that leverage the latest technologies and collaborative communities to deliver education and learning programs that build knowledge bases and promote learning as a focus and passion not just a checkbox in a career 36To broaden cloud worker skills and the ability to handle multiple tasks and work on a variety of projects cloud learning could include the following principles 37In the cloud careers and expertise will be built in new ways and work will be something we do rather than a place we go to As such the cloud will give workers more control over their schedules and workloads By creating a flexible workplace governments could shed a significant amount of physical infrastructure and create shared workspaces Many buildings could be converted into co located spaces teams could use collaboration spaces or videoconferencing centers Some workers might rarely set foot in a government building instead conducting cloud tasks at home and interacting with project teams virtually With advancing communications and mobile technology distance no longer hinders collaboration It no longer matters whether all workers are at an office between 9 a m and 5 p m what matters is whether project teams produce results and whether everyone contributes A more flexible workplace could also take advantage of resources governments might not otherwise have access to Some retiring workers may not want to quit working altogether and a flexible model could be an enticing way to keep their expertise on retainer Alternatively the model could take advantage of would be government employees unwilling to relocate or unable to work a regular schedule By increasing flexibility governments could increase their available resource pool allowing agencies to access the skills and knowledge they need when they need it For an example of how a retiree could interact with the cloud see Appendix C National Security Case Study Don t think governments will ever take to the cloud At the U S Department of State the idea could soon be a reality The Office of eDiplomacy is preparing to pilot a cloud component to its e internship model for American students as part of the Virtual Student Foreign Service VSFS beginning this year The VSFS currently offers e internships to U S university students of multiple month duration By using a new micro volunteering platform State Department offices and embassies around the world will be able to create non classified tasks that take anywhere from a couple of minutes to a couple of days to complete Each task will be tagged by region and or issue and will automatically populate the profiles of students who have indicated those interests Students can then select the tasks that interest them the most or that fit into their schedule To see that the most pressing work is performed first offices and embassies will be able to prioritize their tasks so critical items appear at the top of the queue Imagine a small embassy preparing for a high profile multilateral meeting The preparations for such an event could be daunting for a small staff The power of the cloud could augment an individual embassy s capacity to prepare for a major event and ensure that related items are performed ahead of those that are less critical While there are plenty of incentives for participating in the VSFS micro volunteering platform from an impressive line on a student s resume to the chance to make a difference by working on topics of interest thought is being put into how to creatively incent high performance One idea is to simply invoke students competitive spirit Competition could be encouraged by a monthly leader board which results in bragging rights and potentially even a low cost but high impact reward Transparency is also key to competition with ratings available to State Department staff and other cloud interns and the ability to make short thank you notes from embassies publicly available interns would be keen to make a good impression The potential applications of this type of program are significant Imagine if offices throughout the State Department could tap into the language and cultural expertise of the thousands of foreign national staff members around the globe Providing a platform for those employees to contribute even a small amount of time to discreet tasks that require their expertise could unlock a world of knowledge 38Creating the GovCloud model will require bold leadership and the ideas and initiatives of entrepreneurial executives While a GovCloud model may be years in the making agencies can begin adopting cloud concepts today The GovCloud concept is designed to be versatile as well as applicable to a wide range of entities Depending on your organization government executives wishing to employ GovCloud may choose to apply the concept first to a unit before expanding to other branches or divisions entire agencies or the whole of government Often GovCloud principles are most effectively implemented as part of a larger reform program within a particular agency as with the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs Renew program as described earlier in this report On a smaller scale the UK Cabinet Office used flexible resourcing FR in its Economic Reform Group ERG with a staff of about 400 as part of its cost reduction plans Using a simple database that it had developed and a strong program of communications FR is now used and embraced by all core ERG employees with strong clear ownership from the top another key implementation factor Says Ian Watmore the UK Cabinet Office s former permanent secretary FR means we are able to deploy people much more quickly to priority projects 40Figure 3 outlines how GovCloud can apply to a variety of organizations Most government workforces haven t undergone a broad restructuring in decades In that time the world has been transformed by computers the Internet and mobile communications To respond to a variety of challenges governments have created scores of new organizations However in today s world of budget cuts and increased fiscal scrutiny the constant creation of new permanent structures is not sustainable The GovCloud model could offer a new way to use government resources A cloud of government wide workers could coalesce into project based teams to solve problems and separate when their work is done This could allow governments to concentrate resources when and where they are needed By using this model in conjunction with thinner agencies and shared services governments can reduce back office redundancies and let agencies focus on their core missions This model capitalizes on the work preferences of Millennials the future government workforce who value career growth over job security or compensation 41 The GovCloud model allows employees to gain a variety of experiences in a shorter amount of time and to self select their career direction To support GovCloud governments could establish the processes by which cloud teams would form work and dissolve New ways to evaluate performance and help workers gain skills and build careers should be considered Today s employee classification system stresses job descriptions and time in service this could be transformed with an XP model that emphasizes the individual s ownership of his or her career The GovCloud model will undoubtedly be controversial Many stakeholders from governing bodies to public employee unions must weigh in to shape the future government workforce The transition to a cloud model will not happen overnight or maybe even in the next five years but the conversation starts today Charlie Tierney is a Manager in

industries and it s only a matter of time before it transforms more of them Given that many governments continue to grapple with tight budgets and suppressed staffing levels it s worth considering whether they might one day rely more on automation and technology to carry out tasks performed by humans Recent studies have shed some light on what this might look like particularly in the public sector Automation has already made some forays into government Kirke Everson a KPMG intelligent automation consultant cited chatbots utilized in call centers as an example He suggested that automation could soon replace personnel who perform repetitive back office tasks such as eligibility checks and other procedures following a defined set of rules Government is ripe for automation Everson says But if it requires a large amount of judgments or human interaction maybe you don t start there In the U K an estimated 861 000 public sector jobs could be automated by 2030 according to an analysis by Deloitte and Oxford University Administrative and operative roles which account for 27 percent of the public workforce were identified as having the highest probability of being automated These types of jobs are already declining and the report projects their numbers in the U K to fall further from 87 000 in 2015 to only 4 000 by 2030 A separate Oxford University study examined U S job occupations deeming about 47 percent of total employment in both government and the private sector to be at risk of computerization Some public sector roles considered most vulnerable included library workers postal service clerks and transportation inspectors all positions with highly repetitive tasks Many of the other occupations researchers identified were especially common in transportation These included bus drivers and subway or streetcar operators as well as highway maintenance workers tablecaption font size 11px margin bottom 30px line height 1 2em important The probability of computerization ranges from 0 to 1 with higher values representing more tasks potentially completed by computers Numbers shown for predominately public sector occupations Source The Future of Employment How Susceptible are Jobs to Computerisation by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A Osborne But does this mean large numbers of public employees will one day be out of work Historically industrialization and improvements in technology haven t caused higher long term unemployment It s unknown whether this time will be any different though with economists offering different predictions for automation s effects Neil Reichenberg who heads the International Public Management Association for Human Resources views it more as a shift It s not so much cutting staff as it is moving people to more strategic higher level work he says While technology has already reshaped countless occupations across just about every segment of the economy it hasn t yet prompted the complete elimination of many types of jobs Consider teachers who employ greater use of educational software programs in classrooms These and other types of public employee positions haven t vanished but they do require greater tech skills than in years past Although some might associate automation with armies of robots it s computers that are most responsible for redefining work these days A recent Brookings Institution report assessed digitization or the degree of computer skills and related knowledge typically required of various occupations Several public sector jobs that required few digital skills in 2002 now mandate at least mid level proficiency of computers or other devices Parking enforcement workers and compliance officers for example might have relied entirely on paper records not long ago Today the Brookings data suggests digital skills for these occupations have jumped considerably over the past decade Source Brookings analysis of O Net OES and Moody s data In some ways automating various aspects of jobs could prove to be more difficult in the public sector than in the private sector Unions Reichenberg says will likely oppose efforts expected to result in job losses Last year the union membership rate for government workers was more than five times that of the private sector Still if automation offers governments ways to cut costs without sacrificing quality of services they ll likely consider it Resources remain limited Revenues aren t expected to grow much and total state and local government employment is still below levels reached a decade ago In some jurisdictions automated processes or technologies could enable governments to provide services that otherwise wouldn t be available It s inevitable Reichenberg says If you look at the way we do work

Weekly thought leadershipABOUTPRIVACYCONTACTADVERTISE 2019 All rights reserved e RepublicThe President s Management Agenda intertwines agencies and initiatives governmentwide in a strategy to overhaul federal IT data management and workforce infrastructures But few agencies have the potential to feel that impact like the Office of Personnel Management Tasked with bringing more IT and cybersecurity talent into the government at a time when both are in high demand globally the agency must also navigate the fundamental reshaping of the government s civilian workforce which is increasingly being fueled by the emergence of technologies like artificial intelligence and automation In its Federal Workforce Priorities Report released last week OPM estimates that 45 percent of work activities could be automated today based on technology available in 2016 and five percent of all federal jobs could be done completely by machines That leaves the agency at a crossroads in how it shapes the future of the federal workforce and the services it will provide said Don Kettl a professor at the University of Maryland s School of Public Policy and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution This will not be your mother and father s OPM by the time we are done for sure he said The idea of managing an OPM purely on the basis of trying to create rules to make the existing system work will be a pretty bad fit for the system we know we are going to need To capitalize on a seismic change in the nature of work combined with a shrinking federal workforce the Trump administration and OPM have proposed an initiative to reskill some existing federal workers to into higher value work activities jobs while leveraging automation technology to streamline administrative functions As part of the PMA the Office of Management and Budget and its Office of Federal Procurement Policy will identify three areas suited for automation and develop pilots for them by the first quarter of 2019 By the second quarter of 2019 OMB will develop a plan to reskill federal workers impacted by automation efforts while an OPM pilot will assess the skills those employees will need The results of those pilots could be pivotal for agencies looking to stretch their budget said Mallory Barg Bulman vice president of research and evaluation at the Partnership for Public Service Bulman said a January 2018 report conducted by the Partnership and the IBM Center for The Business of Government found federal entities like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Air Force were already leveraging AI to gain efficiencies in how they collect data and navigate acquisition rules and regulations Federal agencies are looking for ways to do more with less she said The places where we ve seen it be successful are places where agencies have taken routine and tedious tasks and really found ways to automate it But even with the capabilities and resources gained by automation the emphasis placed on employee skills and the ability to recruit and retain those employees becomes greater and that s where OPM s role in reskilling and training becomes even more pronounced The truth is providing opportunities for training can really be a profound retention tool Bulman said When we looked at the Best Places to Work in the Federal Government scores for the Senior Executive Service members particularly those who were new to the SES and on the younger end training was the most powerful predictor of their intent to stay But because the PMA tries to tackle government s most difficult challenges in order to modernize it Kettl said OPM s role will be paramount We try to think broadly about the strategic role of government and the strategic transformation of its workforce to make that happen This is a very big deal he said It s something that s very important very fundamental and something that will require a very fundamental rethinking of the role of OPM in particular along the way ImpactoApril 30 2018 by Luis Miguel Castilla Leave a CommentThe uncertainty of the future of work naturally raises a number of questions It is no wonder Argentina put it on the agenda as one of three priorities to be discussed at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires Will its impact be the same across the globe What jobs will be most affected What new skillsets will be required But above all how can governments prepare and what role can Multilateral Development Banks play All four leading regional development banks recently came together in Washington to present some key perspectives regarding the jobs of the future which can be found in the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives Here are a few worth considering On the one hand Emerging Europe Developing Asia Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean are witnessing how robotics automation and artificial intelligence are lowering costs and increasing productivity providing an opportunity for accelerated growth Countries like Estonia have taken the lead in digital technology youth in Nigeria and Ethiopia are harnessing technology to boost yields in agriculture in Vietnam and Bangladesh Information and Communication Technologies ICT is boosting the service industry and across Latin America and the Caribbean smartphone adoption is expected to reach beyond 70 by 2020 On the other hand as a result of this new wave of technological advances known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution a series of myths emerge that it is important to clarify Myth 1 All regions will be impacted in the same way The truth is that technology will be adopted at varying speeds depending on the region s economic development and demographic trends An aging population in Emerging Europe will face different challenges than Africa where 12 to 15 million young people enter the job market each year Myth 2 Mass unemployment is unavoidable The truth is that the jobless rate will be lower than originally expected Mass unemployment is unlikely to become a reality But the shifts in job opportunities will certainly require flexibility and access to new training tools which may in turn be provided by technology itself Myth 3 Automation will replace all human jobs and tasks The truth is that automation only takes place where it is both technically and economically feasible A human workforce will still be required in most sectors particularly those such as health and education At the same time it would be foolish to ignore the genuine threats of unemployment and increased income inequality that the rapid expansion of new technology will generate Above all as Multilateral Development Banks the question we need to be asking is how can governments ease the transition What can governments do to ensure that the largest number of people possible benefit from this transition Policymakers can take four actions to ease the adoption of technology while mitigating potentially adverse effects on jobs and incomes Multilateral Development Banks certainly have their own role to play not only by acting as think tanks for initiatives on how to capitalize on new technologies and mitigate their negative effects but also in coordinating global or regional policy responses strengthening partnerships between policymakers and employers to jointly identify and address challenges Our products and services will need to adapt A recent IDB health project in the Dominican Republic which uses drones to link remote rural clinics with hospital laboratories is a prime example of this Change will also take place within our workforce Outsourcing the IDB s human resources department from Washington to Costa Rica to ensure efficiency and reduce costs was certainly a step in the right direction It is important that we take the time to seriously identify the opportunities and risks the 21st century global job market presents so that together we can help shape the future of work In the meantime we must also remain relevant for our customer base and at the forefront of innovation Whether we succeed or not is up to all of us Downlaod the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives hereFiled Under Beyond development effectiveness Tagged With labor

in ensuring the long term future success of UK industry In line with this it has acknowledged that one of its grand challenges is putting the UK at the forefront of the AI and data revolution In fact comments from Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond have suggested that large swathes of government activity will soon be performed by AI and automation to free up time for human civil servants Automating some aspects of government jobs will result in savings and efficiencies However there are concerns that public sector workers will be at risk of losing their jobs to AI and automation in the next decade Think tank Reform estimated early last year that 250 000 of the UK s five million public sector workers risk losing jobs to AI and automation in the next 15 years Speaking to a House of Lords committee in 2017 Hammond said The government is looking at how it can apply artificial intelligence There are very significant areas of government activity which involve relatively low level decision making which will be highly susceptible to AI probably over a relatively short period of time which does present the tantalising possibility of being able to drive some real productivity enhancement in the delivery of government processes The truth is that automation in the public sector is already developing at a rapid pace New initiatives range from implementing AI and automation into day to day bureaucratic tasks such as form filling and applying for patents to using facial recognition technologies to verify the identity of individuals entering the UK But it s time to stop viewing AI and automation as an existential threat to our livelihoods Far from replacing people AI and automation will transform the workplace as menial tasks and some non routine jobs are digitalised through AI and process automation enabling greater efficiency while taking away some of the strain of day to day tasks In its industrial strategy report the UK government rightly realised we are at one of the most important exciting and challenging times in the history of global enterprise Importantly that report highlights that Britain is well placed to benefit from this new Industrial Revolution This digital revolution will be powered by humans increasing reliance on AI and automation Set to impact almost every sector of British industry AI and automation is here to stay Organisations are turning to digital transformation to boost innovation and enhance user experience and AI and automation will play a major role in this change While some jobs may disappear or evolve along the road to automation there is considerable opportunity for innovation and change AI and automation can give government departments both at the national and local level much faster access to sophisticated insights Combining this technology and big data will allow them to make better decisions more quickly for a greater number of citizens This ability to rapidly adapt to and drive new innovations is part of what allowed Britain to prosper and develop so quickly during the first industrial revolution After all as the government goes on to note in the industrial strategy report We are an open enterprising economy built on invention innovation and competition We have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business with high standards respected institutions and the reliable rule of law We have achieved near historic levels of employment We are a crossing point for the world because of our geographic position the English language our strong ties our openness to ideas and our vibrant culture Driving an automated future offers a wide range of benefits Not least is the prospect of boosting productivity across all of Britain s leading industries from high tech post industrial manufacturing through to the creative industries sector The UK s industrial strategy has already identified the four grand challenges in the years ahead as artificial intelligence and big data clean growth the future of mobility and meeting the needs of an ageing society Astute investments in AI and automation can enable huge productivity boosts UK consumers are already beginning to recognise that more organisations are embracing this technology and the advantages it can offer including within the public sector In fact after surveying 2 000 UK consumers on their attitudes towards AI and automation in government last year OpenText found that two thirds of UK citizens 66 per cent believe this technology will be introduced into government services within 20 years with 16 per cent claiming that this could happen in the next two years The same poll revealed less fear and uncertainty about the introduction of AI and automation in government than many headlines suggest The majority of those surveyed were not concerned about the implementation of this technology in government with over a quarter 26 per cent going as far as claiming AI and automated technologies would be able to make better decisions than most elected representatives though they would prefer for final decisions to be made by a human Many respondents recognised the immediate benefits of the technology A fifth 20 per cent felt that updating processes by bringing in AI and automation would lead to less admin and form filling Additionally 24 per cent pinpointed reduced waiting times as a major advantage while 19 per cent thought that there would be fewer errors in government as a result of the effective implementation of AI and automation This research shows increasing acceptance of AI and automation as a method to improve services but Britain still has some way to go to fully embrace its potential The UK ranked lowest 16 per cent across the countries surveyed when asked if AI and automated technology would be working in government in the next five years showing more hesitance around its uptake than countries such as France 24 per cent the Netherlands 28 per cent and the USA 22 per cent AI and automation will transform the workplace and bring a wide range of benefits to all sectors including the public sector With the potential to increase the speed efficiency and effectiveness of a wide range of government services AI and automated technologies cannot be ignored While the technology already exists the key challenge over the next few years will be gaining trust amongst both public sector employees and British citizens Mark Baillie director public sector UK Ireland OpenText Image Credit Razum ShutterstockSign up below to

Global Institute the business and economics research arm of McKinsey Company Published October 29 2018The SpotMini robot trapped in a room with its mate looks uncannily like a dog well maybe a mutant dog with a canary yellow body and a proboscis sticking out where its head should be The robot confidently scurries to the door raises itself to the perfect height and then uses its appendage to press down the handle Pulling open the door the robot allows its mate to be first across the threshold before the two of them make their dash for freedom Such is the content of a short video by Boston Dynamics that has gone viral since it was released in February Reactions to it on social media have ranged from amusement soon they ll be opening our fridges and stealing our beer to alarm this is how we die It is the latest evidence of recent remarkable advances in robotics and artificial intelligence robots can now perform backflips and ride bicycles and machines empowered by AI are able to analyze X ray images better than expert radiologists and to teach themselves to play the ancient game of Go better than world champions Yet the dog clip is also powerful because it conjures up a more worrisome vision of robots on the loose beyond the control of us humans Thus it plays into a powerful angst laden contemporary narrative about technology and the future of work and maybe even of mankind itself What really are the risks from this new wave of technology And will the opportunities these advances bring with them outweigh those risks To address such questions about the future it is useful indeed necessary to look to the past Technology has for centuries both excited the human imagination and prompted fears about the effects Back in 1589 Queen Elizabeth I of England refused to grant a patent to a stocking frame invented by one William Lee because Her Majesty was concerned about the effect of the contraption on the livelihoods of those who knitted stockings by hand The Luddite weavers in Britain and silk workers in Lyons France famously staged revolts in the early 19th century against new automated looms that threatened their skilled and well paid jobs And in the realm of fiction imagination has run riot since the Czech writer Karel Capek coined the word robot from a Slavic word for work in his 1920 play Rossum s Universal Robots a k a RUR which ends with the destruction of mankind As one of Capek s characters explains Robots are not people Mechanically they are more perfect than we are they have an enormously developed intelligence but they have no soul Almost a century later that same concern about soulless hyper intelligence infuses not just movies like The Matrix and mind bending video series like Philip K Dick s Electric Dreams but also warnings about AI and its potential consequences expressed by Elon Musk and the late Stephen Hawking among others Back in the 1950s the German philosopher Martin Heidegger fretted about the risk that humans would become enslaved by the technologies we rely on With the rise of machines able to mimic many human traits from speech albeit still falteringly to facial recognition already significantly more accurately than humans that time appears to be much closer Yet when we switch from philosophy to economics we find a very different story a long historical record of innovation that shows technological change has been overwhelmingly positive for productivity and surprisingly benign when it comes to employment Job displacement has occurred in waves first with the structural shift from agriculture to manufacturing and then with the move from manufacturing to services Throughout productivity gains generated by new technology have been reinvested and the GDP bounce from that productivity eventually raises consumption and on balance increases the demand for labor In McKinsey s research we have sought to quantify this trend and its net impact in several ways For example we looked at the very big picture what happened to employment as productivity grew over the past 50 years We found no tradeoff between the two for 100 percent of continuous 10 year periods in the United States technologically driven productivity gains have gone hand in hand with rising employment Even when measured in one year snapshots productivity and employment have risen together four years in five The personal computer provides an iconic case to support the compatibility of technological progress with job growth We measured how many jobs were lost and how many gained in the United States between 1980 and 2015 as a result of the diffusion of computer technology Several hundred thousand bookkeepers and auditing clerks secretaries and typists did lose their jobs But the overall balance was strongly positive the desktop laptop computer created more than 19 million jobs in industries ranging from computer hardware to enterprise software to online retail sales against the loss of about 3 5 million jobs a net gain of 15 7 million That figure amounts to 18 percent of all the net U S employment created in the period almost one in five jobs Something similar happened with the invention of the automobile which destroyed the horse and buggy business but gave rise to a wealth of new sometimes unimagined products from petroleum based synthetic rubber to motels That said we ignore those left along the way at our peril For the many workers who are displaced painful transitions are a reality In Britain during the industrial revolution starting in about 1800 wages of the masses stagnated for almost a half century despite a strong surge in productivity that enriched the owners of capital a phenomenon often referred to as Engels pause because it was first noted by the German philosopher who co authored with Karl Marx The Communist Manifesto Wages picked up again as the fruits of productivity gains eventually trickled down to workers But eventually can be a long time the Luddites fears were not entirely unfounded And once again today the link between productivity gains and wage growth seems bent if not broken U S median hourly compensation rose only 11 percent from 1973 to 2016 even as hourly labor productivity grew by 75 percent While it is natural to focus on labor displacement through technology one element often overlooked in the discussion of the future of work is the number of jobs that are neither lost nor gained but fundamentally changed for reasons that are hard to predict History again provides some examples When ATMs became as common as vending machines in the 1970s the number of bank tellers actually increased That s because the new technology reduced the costs of processing individual transactions giving the banks incentives to open more branches to meet local demand for other financial services The tellers primary tasks changed from cashing checks and taking deposits to providing advice and selling securities mortgages and the like To be sure this tale is not yet complete with the rise of online banking the demand for tellers has again waned and so their numbers have thinned especially after the 2008 financial crisis But modern economies are nothing if not dynamic and the only certainty is change There s a similar story to be told about jobs and information technology Thanks to the internet and some ingenious software anyone can now dig up information at the blink of a cursor Yet the need for data analysis has exploded even as the need for data gathering clerks and the like has plummeted And so the number of information analysts of the genus homo sapiens has quintupled since 1980 to about two million today This largely comforting history isn t much help in determining whether this time will be different To the point the rise of ever more sophisticated technologies especially artificial intelligence that can be brought to bear on any number of tasks is likely to usher in a new age of rapid workforce transitions The McKinsey Global Institute recently estimated that in our fastest automation adoption scenario as many as 375 million workers worldwide or about 14 percent of the global workforce will need to switch occupational categories by 2030 in order to avoid obsolescence Even if the pace of adoption is slower as in our midpoint scenario some 75 million workers will need to switch occupational categories in the next 10 to 15 years Among the work most vulnerable to automation jobs that require routinized physical activity in a predictable setting and collecting and processing data Some aspects of the current technological transformation seem in line with that of previous eras the rise of computers for example and earlier epochs of technical change such as the diffusion of the steam engine that transformed work across multiple sectors of the economy simultaneously Every new wave of automation seems remarkable at the time and AI is not the first technology to chip away at cognitive tasks Since the birth of computerized spreadsheets in the 1980s machines have tackled ever more sophisticated problems that previously required human brainpower Still other aspects of the new technologies do seem qualitatively different from previous waves of innovation The rate of technological change today is strikingly rapid and while hard to measure appears to be accelerating Consider in this regard the development of deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques based on neural networks the exponential increase in computing capacity made available through the cloud and the sheer volume of data that can be generated These advances are driving AI for example enabling the development of autonomous vehicles but also heralding breakthrough applications such as a heightened ability to diagnose disease with non invasive techniques Accordingly the share of jobs that could be automated could also be larger than historical precedents suggest That said we see no evidence to date suggesting that the time it takes for new technologies to be diffused throughout the economy is shrinking Looking at a range of high value technologies over the past 60 years from airbags to MRI machines to smartphones we find that the pace of adoption hasn t changed It still takes between 5 and 16 years to reach 50 percent adoption and 5 to 28 years to reach 80 percent adoption Even highly popular social media applications do not beat this clock Facebook for example was begun in 2004 and had attracted more than 2 2 billion followers 13 years later but the untapped market remains vast Consider too that new technology is rarely applied to a blank canvas a variety of economic and social factors play a big role in determining the pace of adoption They include the cost of developing and deploying the hardware and software labor market dynamics the regulatory environment and social acceptance Computer algorithms in state of the art technology aircraft can do just about anything asked of them without a helping hand but we still insist on humans in the cockpit for peace of mind And who wants to be cared for in a hospital solely by a robot We remain disconcerted by the uncanny valley the term coined by the Japanese robotics guru Masahiro Mori to characterize that unsettling feeling people may experience when facing humanoid robots Indeed for tech luminaries ranging from the MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson to the former Google chairman Eric Schmidt the future of work looks set to be not a tale of machines replacing humans but of machines complementing humans in the workplace The rise of AI and the ascendance of self learned algorithms whose logic can be hard to explain pose some arguably unique problems A recent report from a who s who of experts on the malicious use of AI lists a number of the darkest scenarios from political manipulation through hyper personalized disinformation campaigns to a major increase in sophisticated computer hacking attacks For now AI pioneers including Google DeepMind s chief executive Demis Hassabis are clear that while machines are proving formidable in specific areas such as games we remain a long way away from the time when they will have mastered a general artificial intelligence enabling them to think and act like humans And a number of groups including Stanford University s AI100 with which I am associated are trying to look ahead to study and anticipate how AI will affect the way people live work and play long into the future The challenges here for policymakers and business leaders worldwide are significant We will need to institute retraining of workers on a scale we have not seen for generations We will need to rethink and adapt our social systems to help hundreds of millions of workers affected by the new technologies hopefully handling it better than we have handled globalization in providing both new forms of income and job transition support We will need to find ways to tame the wilder unpredictable side of AI For their part CEOs will need to rethink their organizational structures and processes to take advantage of the technologies and the performance enhancing effects they can have or risk ending up in the recycle bin of business history While all of this may seem intimidating it is still the best way forward We should embrace automation technologies for the productivity benefits they bring even as we deal proactively with the workforce transitions that will accompany adoption Given that demographic trends increased longevity low birth rates are rapidly increasing the dependent population our societies really need that productivity boost Beyond the prosperity and employment these technologies will create there will be other societal benefits new moonshots as we use the power of AI to tackle daunting problems from cancer to climate change We can already see one of the key challenges that of worker retraining or reskilling as some like to call it advancing to the top of the corporate agenda and in some countries also receiving renewed political attention In our recent work on the skills that will be needed by the workforce we found that demand will rise sharply not just for technological skills of all kinds but also for social and emotional skills that is leadership and empathy with customers as well as for higher cognitive skills linked to creativity and complex information processing Business leaders tell us that they believe finding the right talent to help implement automation is critical to their future financial performance and they expect companies to take the lead in the skills upgrade that is required Some firms are already putting in place large scale retraining initiatives AT T is using external education providers including for example Udacity At SAP the German enterprise software company the focus is on in house efforts to create learning journeys for thousands of employees including engineers who need to acquire softer skills as their roles change to service customers directly Walmart has set up more than 100 academies in the United States that provide hands on training for positions that include customer service managers and online grocery pickup While welcome these disparate retraining efforts are barely a start Given the scale of the occupational and skill shifts that we see coming in the next decade much more will need to be done and not just by business Governments and educational establishments working together with philanthropic foundations will of necessity be part of the mix Foundations have the advantage of being able to test innovative programs as pilots and will not face the disadvantage of concern that workers with new skills will subsequently jump ship for a new employer As a starter governments will need to reverse the 20 plus year decline in spending on labor related services no small task in light of tight government budgets and in the United States reflexive opposition to government intervention They will also need to be more flexible in order to adapt to the rapidly changing workplace Mobility is one key yet labor markets have become markedly less dynamic in recent years In the United States for example job reallocation rates have declined by 25 percent since 1990 This is the time to test ideas such as portable benefits that are owned by workers and not tied to particular jobs or companies Technology itself can help facilitate greater mobility especially digital platforms turbocharged by AI that enable matching of people to jobs But we also need to rethink some basic assumptions In order for changing jobs across sectors to become a common practice companies will need to agree on definitions and qualifications for specific skills And a major debate is overdue about credentialing Today higher education encourages the world to judge graduates by their subject knowledge rather than by their skills in problem solving and creative thinking skills that will be especially valuable in an AI enhanced workplace More than anything we need to prepare for this new era in which humans must work alongside smart machines far more intensively President Lyndon Johnson was prescient in this regard writing a half a century ago Automation is not our enemy Our enemies are ignorance indifference and inertia Automation can be the ally of our prosperity if we will just look ahead if we will understand what is to come and if we will set our course wisely after proper planning Back then nobody other than science fiction writers could have imagined robot dogs opening doors and escaping to wherever those androids from Blade Runner found refuge But LBJ s words resonate planning for change has never been more important 2019 Milken InstitutePrivacy NoticeShutterstockThere is a strange dichotomy at the moment surrounding the future of work In public political movements throughout the western world have seen populist campaigners railing against the threat to jobs from low wage migrants entering a country and outsourcing to low cost regions by multinationals What hasn t really been touched on is the impact automation might have on jobs in the future What began with the famous study from Oxford University academics Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne back in 2013 which highlighted the huge number of white and blue collar jobs that could be disrupted by automation has progressed to growing interest from governments around the world For instance a report by the British government s Science Technology Select Committee into AI examined the issue from a range of aspects from ethics to employment Watch on Forbes This was followed by a second report from the Chief Scientific Advisor to the British government which looked at the possible benefits to the state of an AI driven world in areas such as tax collection Further afield you have a recent report from the United Nations that looked at the disruptive possibilities of automation in the labor market It suggested that for now at least most of the disruption from automation will be in routine tasks and therefore the biggest impact will be in the developing world rather than the developed world Automation In AmericaDespite the rhetoric from the President elect it s perhaps no surprise that the White House has a view on this topic too and a recent report from the President s Council of Economic Advisors highlights the significant impact on professions such as driving What each of these reports have in common is their advocated response to the threat of automation All highlight the growing importance of education and the ability of people to adapt quickly to changes in the labor market We should not advance a policy that is premised on giving up on the possibility of workers remaining employed the White House paper says Our goal should be first and foremost to foster the skills training job search assistance and other labor market institutions to make sure people can get into jobs This is important because history tells us that technology and automation tend to create more jobs than they destroy but we don t tend to know what those jobs are yet Indeed the U S Department of Labor predicted a few years ago that around 65 of school children today will be employed in jobs that don t yet exist A Glass Half FullIt s also important because there is a backlash against globalization at the moment that is easy to imagine transferring its ire towards technology in the coming years The merits of globalization were quite aptly described by British economist Henry Martyn back in the 1700s He used the analogy of technological innovation to make his point and suggested that by using a tool a sawmill in his case we could perform the work of 30 men with the labor of two men Now of course we could employ those 30 men instead but that would be a waste of human resources The same is true for most technologies and whilst most would surely agree that technology is a force for good it s not an assumption that can be guaranteed Martyn went on to compare this with globalization and suggested that if another country can produce textiles for instance more efficiently than we can then it is akin to having a new technology to do likewise and we should jump at such an opportunity and instead deploy our resources to trade with that nation in areas that we can excel A Measured ResponseWhilst the White House report makes a number of measured responses including greater funding for adult education and an expanded welfare safety net the response of the new Trump administration is much less certain Whilst he currently blames immigration and free trade for the loss of jobs in America it s easy to imagine him flip flopping his attention onto automation if machines represent a more attractive target for him In reality the answers are largely the same in both instances whether it s providing greater support for lifelong learning supporting people to move where the jobs are and so on These responses do necessitate some action on behalf of those that are disrupted by technology however It s not enough to blame an external actor and hope to roll back change it requires one to take control and strive to learn the skills that give you a chance in the labor market This is a topic I ve covered a few times and whilst there is a growing appreciation for the urgency of such measures I can t help but feel that governments around the world are asleep at the wheel For more visit adigaskell org I am a free range human who believes that the future already exists if we know where to look From the bustling Knowledge Quarter in London it is my mission in life t Editor s Note Facing the Future of Work Facing the Future of Work In the last few years it has felt like every big election has focused on jobs and the threats they supposedly face from trade from immigrants and most accurately from technology No wonder Until recently the forecasts were almost unanimously grim The robots were coming we were told and they d soon make us humans redundant In the summer of 2015 the Atlantic captured the panic with a cover story titled A World Without Work which warned that the moment when machines make workers obsolete may finally be arriving Then on March 18 of this year a self driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Tempe Arizona and the conversation began to shift Suddenly the fear that humans would soon be superfluous started to seem a little less likely Around the same time the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released a new study that gave intellectual and statistical heft to this idea Yes automation will supplant some workers the report found But not nearly as many as we once thought and not nearly as soon As a result what exactly we should expect work to look like in the future has now become a lot more complicated and the discussions about it much more nuanced Which is why Foreign Policy has devoted this special issue to making sense of the emerging reality While the questions still outnumber the answers a few themes have started to surface As Molly Kinder argues in Learning to Work With Robots new technologies will create both winners and losers Artificial intelligence won t eliminate human labor in some cases it will even produce new jobs But automation is rapidly changing the nature of work and governments must help workers adapt Ryan Avent explores this idea further In Then They Came for the Lawyers he shows how manual laborers won t be the only ones forced to contend with a shifting workplace AI will also change the lives of doctors teachers and other professionals Adaptation is key but it s not the only task ahead of us In Protect Yourself Before You Wreck Yourself Michael Lind warns that retraining workers won t be enough governments must also reshape their trade policies to reflect the new era Of course despite the new developments and the strategies meant to deal with them automation still poses plenty of risks In Closing the Factory Doors Christina Larson shows how automated factories by replacing human textile and other light manufacturing workers may deprive poor nations of a traditional route out of poverty But the key point is that the news is far from uniformly bad FP s Ravi Agrawal shows how the much criticized gig economy is proving a boon for the developing world see Why India Gives Uber 5 Stars And as FP s Rhys Dubin reminds us in There s No Such Thing as a Stable Career constant change has been a fact of life for as long as there has been work to do just ask lectors and longshoremen Indeed just about the only factor that has remained the same is humans ability to adjust to new circumstances and generally make their lives better in the process Big changes are coming and plenty of them But there s no reason to think we won t weather

really like what she learnt and what of this she encourages us to apply in the public service 2018 Breakout Stream 1For the public sector it is hard to imagine a challenge bigger than gaining and maintaining the trust of our various audiences Be it regulation business attraction logistics compliance or awareness building there are few functions of public sector activity that aren t ultimately dependent on getting a message out But the where and the ways to do that have changed and are changing remarkably And addressing that can t be a merely a function of Corporate Communications teams no matter how good they might be If government is to remain relevant into the future its people need to think about their audiences every step of the way whatever their role But how do individual public servants with their own skills sets and natural abilities embrace a communications role Sue Cato perhaps Australia s leading issues management practitioner will join us in a facilitated discussion that will empower participants to start to realise their own individual potential to make strategic communication work for them their careers and the areas of public work for which they have

continues the Reduce Your Juice story that began in session 1A but it is not necessary to have attended that session to get all the benefits and insights from this session The future for policymaking will be a compact between government business and the community to resolve real world problems together More meaningful engagement with expertise in the community can only help to address the complex issues of trust and enhance confidence in public policy solutions Industry Secretary Heather Smith 2018 IPAA address US based CB Insights recently released research that connecting professional

universities to work together to develop more innovative creative and unique solutions to complex problems They provide an opportunity for policy innovators to work at a state national and international level to leverage its unique strengths across a range of private and public sector challenges Based in Brisbane Australia and with over 13 300 community experts and growing MindHive is the world s first crowdsourcing consultancy An Airbnb for brains it s aim is to disrupt the 145B consulting world This session will explore the technologies of expertise engaging crowds shared

evolution as a collaborative policy and strategy startup continues in Breakout 3B in a session focused on the digital platform and its future ambitions Many jurisdictions nationally and internationally are already using sustainability concepts to springboard new business models and transform their economies across ideas such as the circular economy But while multinationals and local communities alike are seeing economic environmental and social returns in many ways the core of this model is an innovation based on trust This session will explore the concept of the circular economy using a series of case studies to demonstrate the change that is already happening and changing our society and the way its institutions work from one based on take make and dispose to one that is restorative and regenerative by design The fast pace of digital change is re shaping today s workforce PwC research indicates there will be net job creation from technology however there is an increasing consensus across thought and practice leaders that it s time to get practical about assisting all workers to adapt to the digital age The task of retraining talent goes beyond digital upskilling 87 of Australia s CEOs either agree or strongly agree that they need to strengthen the soft skills of employees alongside their digital skills Human skills such as creativity flexibility agility problem solving collaboration adaptability and emotional intelligence are skills that can t be automated and therefore there is much value to gain from harnessing these skills in employees This session will distil the shift towards automation and AI in workplaces generally and the public sector in particular and use this as the beginning of a constructive even personal conversation A conversation that acknowledges and de mystifies their potential and facilitates a way to embrace the competitive advantage for individuals and organisations alike from developing skills that complement and leverage an integrated AI HI workforce Technological innovations including always on connectivity artificial intelligence and automation are undeniably changing the nature of work As

sector design from its earliest days realising the potential of the concept through a digital platform has been central to ensuring the viability of the original concept With MindHive 2 0 a new crowdsourcing and networking platform nearing launch participants will have the opportunity to observe how the theoretical and practical challenges were resolved and have the opportunity to experience the potential for policy and strategy development through the MindHive methodology firsthand To many minds the rise of technology and the state of the environment have a relationship that is parallel at best and inverse at worst A rise in one has too often been seen as necessarily having to come at the cost of the other But advances in technology from 3D printing to social media to big data are fundamental enablers to many of the facets of circular economy How can government enable and capitalise on this shift across portfolios as diverse as energy infrastructure social services and foreign

Technology is changing not only how we interact with each other but also our expectations when it comes to experiences Government and Enterprise are in the midst of the biggest call to action that we ve had in the last century and it s all coming down to one word Trust This is the new augmented world of humanity and technology fused together at the very core It s also more exciting than ever Just remember this though New world means new rules Global Futurist Chris Riddell will take you on an incredible journey unlocking exciting insights into human change the mega trends of beyond tomorrow and what true innovation in government looks like Welcome to a new Beyond Tomorrow Leaders and organisations are in an overheating crucible of radical transformation showing up their vulnerabilities and lack of agility It is a world characterised by increasing Variety Interdependency Complexity Change Ambiguity Seamlessness and Sustainability VICCASS These exponential changes challenge the established models and approaches of leadership and require very different capabilities and mindsets Leaders need to think differently behave differently and react differently We need to identify leaders early for their agility creativity ability to lead and connect people and teams their thinking patterns and their systems thinking Senior leaders should be measured on their ability to cut through bureaucracy to enable change their ability to create counter intuitive insights and their courage in challenging the norm It s time to change our thinking on who is a leader how they are trained and in what ways they are rewarded and supported Let s rethink reexamine and redesign leadership development and get the right people into leadership roles now while we still can 2018 Breakout Stream 4Most people interested in the field of innovation have heard of agile innovation teams These small entrepreneurial groups are designed to stay close to customers and adapt quickly to changing conditions When implemented correctly they have a reputation for almost always result in higher team productivity and moral faster time to market better quality and lower risk than traditional approaches can achieve But while agile methods caught on first in IT departments and are now widely used in software development the agile approach has potential to transform the public sector in ways far beyond better bits and bytes Conditions are ripe for agile teams in any situation where problems are complex solutions are at first unclear project requirements are likely to change and close collaboration with end users is feasible a description that matches many facing a wide variety of public sector activities This session will provide participants with an opportunity explore what the world of agile can teach them about themselves their work and their potential to serve their clients better whatever their role It will confront some of the common myths and misconceptions about agile and demonstrate how an agile approach can enable teams to deliver sooner and scale faster through a proven learning culture that builds and strengthens the team and its capabilities Navigating today s increasingly complex and volatile business terrain requires deep reservoirs of tenacity optimism and hardiness This session will equip participants with the ability to fundamentally and permanently strengthen their personal resilience by exploring elements of one of the world s most advanced scientifically grounded and widely adopted adversity tools By participating attendees will The best places are vibrant and complex But how do you quantify urban life The census is outdated before it s released Consumer research focuses on generalisations rather than diversity And community engagement processes struggle to reach enough people to uncover local nuances Every day millions of Australians create valuable data online that paints a picture about the places they visit and what they value Neighbourlytics harvests this rich user generated data to help city makers understand the unique identity of the places they plan build and manage Neighbourlytics is a social analytics platform for neighbourhoods pioneering the use of social data to help city makers across Australia understand the unique identity and local nuances of communities This session will not only serve as a deep dive into the practical reality of big data and data innovation for public sectors applications such as social sustainability but to the Neighbourlytics platform as it is currently operating in locations around the country Queensland Government BiiG NetworkQueensland Government BiiG NetworkCopyright 2000 2019 Cvent Inc All rights reserved From TV shows like Black Mirror to McKinsey Oxford OECD and Brookfield Institute studies many views of the impact of technology particularly automation on the future of jobs and society is bleak We are told stories of automation that will eliminate broad swaths of jobs opening up opportunity for some and having catastrophic effects for others like non college educated workers Brookfield Institute s The Talented Mr Robot 2016 estimates that nearly 42 of the employed Canadian labour force is at a high risk 70 or higher probability of being affected by automation over the next 10 to 20 years Some speculate like futurist Thomas Frey 2014 that hundreds of new types of jobs resulting from emerging technologies capabilities and needs will emerge to employ those people NESTA predicts that around one tenth of the workforce are in occupations that are likely to grow as a percentage of the workforce Around one fifth are in occupations that will likely shrink This latter figure is much lower than recent studies of automation have suggested This means that roughly seven in ten people are currently in jobs where we simply cannot know for certain what will happen It is clear there is not a consensus on what the overall job loss or creation impact of emerging technologies could be with wide ranging estimates of across sectors Further while predictions for job loss like these abound there are far fewer organizations working on envisioning the future of work and the jobs of the future that will employ the workforce of the future as current jobs are changed by automation and other emerging technologies This is where I ve focused my research with my digitalHKS research fellowship Since January 2018 I ve been collaborating with Bill Eggers and Amrita Datar from the Deloitte Center for Government insights to humanize the future of work and visualize the impact of technology on jobs to empower organizations employees and individuals to create a more positive future This week at MIT s EmTech NEXT Conference Bill and I debuted some of the early products and methods we ve developed together including a Future of Government Work Gallery Walk This gallery walk featured four government jobs of the future depicted through futuristic art text and storytelling including Child Aid Coordinators of the future are smart connected and always prepared the deliver on their mission protecting vulnerable children They safeguard the rights of children and intervene in cases of abuse neglect or ill treatment Garrison Commander of the future uses analytical software virtual reality training tools and secure communications to ensure a smoothly functional military installation that service members family members and civilian employees are proud to call home Mobility Platform Managers of their future and their teams are responsible for managing the city s integrated multimodal transportation network and ensuring the seamless movement of people and vehicles They supervise advanced AI systems that power the mobility platform Public Health and Safety Guardians of the future use the power of data cognitive technologies and their public health expertise to protect the health and safety of citizens The Gallery Walk exhibition seeks to invite observers to consider how emerging technologies will enable government work to become more impactful and productive increase decision making capability and better support the overall wellbeing of the employee while focusing on the core building block of the future of work the individual person doing the job The exhibition seeks to humanize the work transformation we might expect to see by 2025 This work demonstrates that not only new jobs will be created but some existing jobs will change in very real ways that we also need to be prepared for It also provides a story that both employees and employers can relate to in order to help encourage real discussion about these futures and enable people to visualize how they might start to approach those possible destinations Our work reverses the current tendency to go from generalizations about changing technology to assumptions about broad job classifications and instead starts with specifics about particular jobs for a more concrete understanding of what could happen in the workplace The Gallery Walk is just a taste of what we re working on We ve been busy developing content examples of jobs of the future and a method for developing jobs of the future and engagement approaches such as workshops and the gallery walk to encourage engagement and discussion around that content Developing proactive and productive tools for designing the future of work is both timely and important According to McKinsey 375 million workers or roughly 14 percent of the global workforce may need to switch occupational categories as digitization automation and advances in artificial intelligence disrupt the world of work In terms of magnitude it s akin to coping with the large scale shift from agricultural work to manufacturing that occurred in the early 20th century in North America and Europe and more recently in China The task confronting every economy particularly advanced economies will likely be to retrain and redeploy tens of millions of mid career middle age workers As the MGI report notes there are few precedents in which societies have successfully re trained such large numbers of people Both employers and employees will need to own their continued education and skill development in order to fill the jobs of the future Thus employers and employees will need to be given tools to envision the jobs of the future in a more visceral way so we can move towards them as a realistic destination Today society has an opportunity to design a better future given the transformation in jobs and way of working that is coming a future where workers aren t just more productive but where their individual well being is better cared for in a job Emerging technologies will change existing jobs as well as create brand new ones It will affect almost everyone you me our family our neighbors Its time humanize the discussion to one beyond an economic discussion about workforce and labour The individual people that will be affected by this change should also be engaged in this discussion The content and engagement approaches that I ve been developing through my digitalHKS fellowship in partnership with Deloitte are a few ways I believe we can start increasing the diversity of voices in the discussion about the future of work You can hear more about our call to put people back at the center of the future of work discussion in the talk I delivered at EmTech NEXT here https events technologyreview com video watch jenn gustetic harvard people future work Powered by SquarespaceCommentFor many people artificial intelligence conjures up images of sci fi movies and the future They see it as a threat to their jobs and sometimes even their safety but AI represents the biggest leap forward in terms of work productivity since the personal computer and few other industries can benefit from AI as much as government With AI we can change the way government works and help employees do their job better AI is already integrated into numerous cloud platforms and can be used to discover new information and deliver outcomes instantly I like to refer to this as practical AI AI has the potential to improve employee experiences by speeding up decision making and automating mundane and repetitive tasks Bringing machine learning to everyday work enables government agencies and departments to make better decisions faster because they do not have to hunt for data and aggregate it into a spreadsheet By building intelligence into platforms AI helps manage complex workflows and allows organizations to One way that AI will be applied in the workplace is automating service requests Most companies have an IT service desk as well as a customer support center These functions ensure that customers and employees receive help in a timely manner whether it is a request for a new computer a password reset or the status of a repair Manually triaging thousands of incidents or cases categorizing tasks and routing work can consume resources introduce human error and slow resolution In fact a new report from Accenture found that customer support functions spend up to 12 percent of their time categorizing prioritizing and assigning tickets Meanwhile AI accurately categorizes requests nearly instantly It eliminates the bottleneck created by agents having to manually assign categorize and route requests A full two days a week is wasted on manual administrative work according to the recent State of Work survey conducted by ServiceNow If an agency with 5 000 people automated those processes they could get 4 million work hours back a year Adding AI frees up employees to do the work they want to do spurring creativity Nearly half of respondents 48 percent said work levels increased by 20 percent or more after they adopted AI solutions Additionally 91 percent of executives say their skilled employees spend too much time on admin tasks and 93 percent believe that reducing mundane tasks unleashes employee creativity To properly implement AI solutions across government agencies we need to define which tasks are best suited for humans and which ones should be performed by AI The government has a term inherently governmental to describe work processes or decisions that must be done by government employees Contractors do much of the work in our government agencies but certain work is inherently governmental in nature As we move into an age defined by AI we need to identify and define the work processes and decisions that are inherently human We are going to increasingly work in a blended workplace with AI systems and humans working together to achieve a mission There are certain activities within any work environment that can only be performed or should only be performed by humans While there may be many more human activities designated as inherently human in the beginning I believe that as humans become more comfortable with the role of AI in the blended workforce less and less work will be designated as inherently human There will always be a need for humans to remain in charge from factual responsibility and liability aspects as well as from emotional and psychological ones We spend a third of our lives at work It shapes who we are how we feel and how we interact with the world so we must create great work experiences and this is what AI does AI creates work experiences that unleash productivity bringing out the best in us Rather than fearing machines stealing jobs we need to understand how AI will change the way government works though small but practical ways and prepare the workforce of the future for this change About the AuthorBob Osborn is CTO Federal of

EventsMember Roundtable on Automation and the Future of Work Federal Policy ResponsesWednesday July 18th 2 00 p m 3 00 p m Room Cannon 421Dear Colleague A growing number of business leaders and experts are warning that emerging automation and artificial intelligence technologies will transform the future of work disrupting labor markets possibly displacing large numbers of workers Some estimate tens of millions of jobs being lost in the U S and hundreds of millions worldwide 1 One widely cited Oxford University study estimates that 47 of U S jobs are at risk for being automated by 2033 2 Analysts predict that those workers who can least affordit are going to be hardest hit by job losses An Obama White House study found that the jobs that are threatened by automation are highly concentrated among lower paid lower skilled and less educated workers 3 A study by the Joint Center for Political Economic Studies shows that workers of color are disproportionately at risk finding that Over 31 percent of Latino workers and 27 percent of African American workers are concentrated in just 30 occupations at high risk to automation 4 Automation is one of a number of major forces transforming jobs and the nature of employment Others include the fissuring of employment relationships globalization the financialization of U S corporate governance and de unionization All of these forces are having profound impacts on the labor market altering which jobs will be available in the future to whom the pay and working conditions and how workers acquire necessary skills This roundtable brings together experts to discuss what the federal government can and should do to modernize our labor market institutions to ensure that the future of work is inclusive equitable and leads to increasing standards of living for most Americans The panel will explore policy proposals such as preserving the employer employee relationship in lieu of independent contracting promoting worker inclusive technology adoption offering adjustment assistance for displaced workers increasing worker voice improving workforce development and lifelong learning and modernizing the safety net

some of the ways the nature of government work the public workforce itself and the workplace it occupies will all need to continue to evolve Work New technologies can transform the capabilities of a government worker Artificially intelligent chatbots for example can perform triage on citizen questions freeing human attention for less routine queries The Army s recruitment chatbot SGT STAR does the work of 55 recruiters answering 94 percent of questions A Deloitte analysis of AI s potential found that automation could save the federal government as much as 1 2 billion hours of work annually What AI doesn t automate it can enhance Child welfare caseworkers who according to one study spend just 9 percent of their time with children but 37 5 percent of their time on paperwork could use technology to auto populate documentation freeing time for visits AI also can correlate hospital truancy and arrest records to flag children in danger Some restaurant health inspectors already analyze big data to identify likely candidates for inspections In Chicago for instance tests found 24 percent more critical violations and on average isolated dangers from the food system a week earlier For effective work redesign it s helpful to adopt a two pronged strategy of zooming in and zooming out A zooming in approach hones in on individual tasks and processes that have the most potential to be optimized through automation Zooming out entails looking at the bigger picture to define what work redesign means for entire job classifications departments and the organization as a whole Workforce Specialists in fields like cybersecurity agile development and artificial intelligence are not likely to commit decades to one government position and if they did they d still need to swap into the tech sector periodically to sharpen their skills That s why some government technology programs are taking a tour of duty approach letting private sector experts serve in the public sector for a few years on specific projects without locking them into a lifetime of government work At the federal level the General Services Administration s 18F digital services agency the Oak Ridge Institute for Science Education and the Presidential Innovation Fellows program all help government solve problems with temporary outside hires At the state level Michigan s Cyber Civilian Corps a volunteer group of cybersecurity professionals from the private sector and academia as well as government can be called upon if the governor declares a cyber emergency And long term government workers don t need to be stuck in one place A talent cloud can prepare for unexpected staffing needs by identifying in advance workers with special skills and applying them to tasks suited to their expertise Canada is experimenting with letting multiple agencies dip into a talent cloud and hire workers for specific missions Workers keep their union membership rights and benefits but may be called into service by any agency Workplace Empirical science rarely guides hiring But management is becoming more data driven Applying the newest science on team building personal efficiency and employee wellness to government agencies can upgrade the workplace to better attract retain and utilize talent Insights from studies of the composition and functioning of effective teams can inform decisions about using talents more effectively Organizational network analysis for example can use metadata from emails and other sources to map communication patterns in organizations accurately predicting individuals who will be high performers detecting unsatisfied employees six months before they actually quit and identifying leadership behaviors that correlate with success Modern workplace wellness programs are also extremely impactful Improving employee wellness can reduce lost work days increase retention and fuel productivity After the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center provided a physician and nurse case manager for employees it saw an 80 percent decline in lost work days over six years for a cost savings of 1 5 million In short the future of government work will require a level of dynamic workforce management far beyond the current practices of the public sector The potential for government agencies to unlock more human capital potential and make the public sector a magnet for talent is enormous As Buffalo s former mayor demonstrated to bring the right people together you have to know what it takes to make a project succeed Local governments are using internet surveys to better gauge residents needs Some states are finding ways to make rules easier to navigate and less costly for business while continuing to protect the public s interests The amount of missing and unusable public sector data is stunning Every jurisdiction should be comparing itself with its peers to identify problematic practices increase productivity and reduce costs It s all too easy for team members to misunderstand something Effective leaders know the value of the pre brief WRITTEN BY Charlie Tierney Steve Cottle Katie JorgensenWind back the clock to 1971 Jane a freshly minted college graduate joins the government as a clerk Jane s work consists largely of entering information into databases and creating reports which requires her to spend the better part of her work day seated at a terminal near a mainframe computer that fills an entire room Jane and her colleagues are expected to be at their desks from 9 a m to 5 p m five days a week Jane is grateful to have a steady 9 to 5 job and plans to spend her entire career with her agency Flash forward 40 years and meet Jane s grandson Ian He carries a slim tablet wherever he goes which has more computing power than the mainframe with which Jane worked Ian is constantly tethered to the Internet and works 24 7 from wherever he is Ian expects to switch from project to project and office to office as his career develops and his interests evolve If he feels he has reached the limit of his ability to learn or grow in one role he will look elsewhere for a new opportunity What if the government could give Ian the opportunities and experiences he seeks The GovCloud concept proposed in this paper would restructure government workforces in a way that takes advantage of the talents and preferences of workers like Ian who are entering the workforce today The model is based on a large body of research from interviews with public and private sector experts to best practices from innovative organizations both public and private This is the first generation of people that work play think and learn differently than their parents They are the first generation to not be afraid of technology It s like the air to them Don Tapscott author of Grown Up DigitalThis report details trends in work and technology that offer significant opportunities for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the government workforce It lays out the GovCloud model explaining how governments could be organized to take advantage of its flexibility It examines how work would be performed in the new model and discusses potential changes to government HR programs to support GovCloud Other sections provide resources for executives including a tool to help determine cloud eligibility steps they can take to pilot the cloud concept and future scenarios illustrating the cloud in action The GovCloud model represents a dramatic departure from the status quo It is bound to be greeted with some skepticism Without such innovation however governments will be left to confront the challenges of tomorrow with the workforce structure of yesterday The details of the GovCloud model are open for debate The purpose of this paper is to jumpstart that debate Forty years ago more than half of employed American adults worked in either blue collar or clerical jobs Today less than 40 percent work in these same categories and the share continues to shrink 1 Jobs requiring routine or manual tasks are disappearing while those requiring complex communication skills and expert thinking are becoming the norm 2 Increasingly employers seek workers capable of creative and knowledge based work We should ask ourselves whether we re truly satisfied with the status quo Are our workday lives so fulfilling and our organizations so boundlessly capable that it s now pointless to long for something better Gary Hamel author of The Future of ManagementThe next generation of creative knowledge workers has already entered the job market These Millennials came of age in a rapidly and radically changing world They are the first true digital natives They have grown up with instant access to information through technology As such Millennials have considerably different expectations for the kind of work they do and the information they use The pursuit for variety in work has led Millennials to cite simply needing a change as their top reason for switching jobs 3Advances in technology have also changed the actual ways in which people perform work The ability to crowdsource tasks is one example of this change Since its founding in 2001 volunteers have produced and contributed to over 19 million articles in 281 languages on Wikipedia 4 Built around this concept a burgeoning industry is developing around microtasking dividing work up into small tasks that can be farmed out to workers Amazon s Mechanical Turk rolled out in 2005 allows users to post tasks to a platform where registered workers can accept and complete them for a small fee When this paper was written more than 195 000 tasks were available on Mechanical Turk 5Such technologies may offer suitable possibilities for the public sector Microtask a Finnish cloud labor company maintains Digitalkoot a program that helps the Finnish National Library convert its image archives into digital text and correct existing errors It does so with volunteered labor participants simply play a game in which they are shown the image of a word and then must type it out to help a cartoon character cross a bridge In doing so they are turning scanned images into searchable text greatly improving the search accuracy of old manuscripts 6 At present more than 100 000 people have completed over 6 million microtasks associated with this project 7As the pace of computing power and machine learning increases professors Frank Levy and Richard Murnane contend that more tasks will move from human to computer processing 8 Skeptics need look no further than IBM s Watson a computer that can answer questions posed in natural language In February 2011 Watson defeated two all time champions of the quiz show Jeopardy This was not solely a publicity stunt IBM hopes to sell Watson to hospitals and call centers to help them answer questions from the public 9Around the globe more and more governments are looking to increase telework among employees In 2010 the U S government passed legislation calling for more telework opportunities for government employees Likewise the Australian government in order to attract and retain information and communications technology workers instituted a teleworking policy in 2009 requiring agencies to implement flexible work plans 10 Other countries including Norway and Germany are also focusing on flexible work arrangements to improve public sector recruiting 11 In Canada the government has an official telework policy that recognizes changes are occurring in the public service workforce with a shift towards more knowledge workers and encourages departments to implement telework arrangements 12Cloud definitionsCloud computing Internet based computing whereby shared resources software and information are provided to computers and other devices on demand like electricity AmazonCrowdsourcing Neologistic compound of crowd and outsourcing for the act of taking tasks traditionally performed by an employee or contractor and outsourcing them to a group of people or community through an open call to a large group of people a crowd asking for contributions WikipediaGovCloud A new model for government based on team collaboration whereby workforce resources can be surged to provide services to government agencies on demand GovLabSource Frank Levy and Richard J Murnane The New Division of Labor How Computers are Creating the Next Job Market Princeton Princeton University Press 2004 p 50 Figure 1 Trends in routine and non routine tasks in the U S 1960 200213These are all powerful steps in the right direction for employees whose natural work rhythms are not locked into 9 to 5 Some companies have taken telework one step further British Telecom is pushing the concept of agile working through its Workstyle Project where employees decide what work arrangements best suit them rather than a rigid definition by location and hours BT Workstyle is one of the largest flexible working projects in Europe with over 11 000 home based workers BT has found that its home enabled employees are on average 20 percent more productive than their office based colleagues 14Similarly U S electronics retailer Best Buy experimented with a Results Only Work Environment ROWE In a ROWE what matters is not whether employees are in their office but rather that they complete their work and achieve measurable outcomes In a ROWE salaried employees must put in as much time as is actually needed to do their work no more no less The decline in routine and manual tasks and the rise of new ways of working is not isolated to the private sector In 1950 the U S federal workforce largely comprised clerks performing repetitive tasks About 62 percent performed these tasks while only 11 percent performed more white collar work By 2000 those relationships were reversed Fifteen percent performed repetitive tasks compared to 56 percent in the white collar categories 16 Similarly in 1944 the number of workers in the UK civil service considered industrial totaled 505 000 By 2003 this number fell to 18 200 with non industrial workers reaching 538 000 in 2004 17 And in Canada in 2006 knowledge based workers represented 58 percent of federal workers in the Core Public Administration up from 41 percent 11 years earlier 18The swelling ranks of non industrial government workers indicate a shift in public sector jobs toward creative collaborative and complex work The workforce structure however designed for clerks of the last century remains largely the same With limited flexibility to distribute resources governments often address change by creating new agencies and programs This can be seen following major events like the outbreaks of the Avian flu and SARs in the past decade 9 11 and the financial crisis of 2008 Source United States Office of Personnel Management A Fresh Start for Federal Pay A Case for Modernization April 2002 p 5 http www opm gov strategiccomp whtpaper pdfFigure 2 The changing U S federal workforce 1950 200015Given increasing budgetary pressures and burgeoning national debts the conventional model of creating new agencies or permanent structures in response to new challenges is unsustainable This is exacerbated by our inability to accurately predict future needs and trends Consider a 1968 Business Week article proclaiming that the Japanese auto industry isn t likely to carve out a big share of the market for itself or the president of Digital Equipment Corporation who in 1977 said t here is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home 19The world is full of experts who attempt to predict the future and fail 20Instead of endeavoring to predict the future governments can choose to create a flexible workforce that can quickly adapt to future work requirements To accomplish this the government can learn from a game changing concept in the technology world cloud computing Major organizations and small startups alike increase their flexibility by sharing storage space information and resources in a cloud allowing them to quickly scale resources up and down as needed Why not apply the cloud model to people The creation of a government wide human cloud could provide significant benefits including A cloud based government workforce or GovCloud could include workers who perform a range of creative problem focused work Rather than being slotted into any single government agency cloud workers would be true government wide employees This section outlines the organizational structure of the GovCloud model which rests on three main pillars a cloud of government workers thin executive agencies and shared services Most government workforce models tend to constrain workers by isolating them in separate agencies Consider the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom and the subsequent slaughter of more than 6 million pigs sheep and cattle The problem of an impacted food supply is complicated In most countries multiple agencies focus on agriculture food production and public health In the United Kingdom the army and even tourism ministries were impacted by the outbreak as agencies became overwhelmed by the number of animals in need of disposal and by the cordoning off of tourist areas to prevent the spread of the disease Yet the structure of government agencies often confines employees to work in information silos creating inherent operational inefficiencies In a cloud workforce model experts in each area could be pulled together to support remedies and propose coordinated corrective measures I want someone saying Did you know that the Ministry of Justice is doing that or could you piggy back on what the communities department is doing or had you thought about doing it in this way You ve got to get away from thinking about centralized command and control Dame Helen Ghosh Permanent Secretary UK Home Office 21The FedCloud modelThe GovCloud model could become a new pillar of government comprising permanent employees who undertake a wide variety of creative problem focused work As needed the GovCloud model could also take advantage of those outside government including citizens looking for extra part time work full time contractors and individual consultants Cloud workers would vary in background and expertise but would exhibit traits of free agent workers self sufficient self motivated employees who exhibit a strong loyalty to teams colleagues and clients Daniel Pink author of Drive The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us argues that 33 million Americans one quarter of the workforce already operate as free agents 22According to the white paper Lessons of the Great Recession from Swiss staffing company Adecco contingent workers those who chose non traditional employment arrangements23 are expected to eventually make up about 25 percent of the global workforce 24These more autonomous workers according to Pink are better suited to 21st century work and are more productive even without traditional monetary incentives 25The fluid nature of the cloud can provide significant benefits The nature of the cloud teams forming and dissolving as their tasks require encourages workers to focus on specific project outcomes rather than ongoing operations Thin agency structures could lead to Greater use of shared services could allow the federal government to The need to support some ongoing missions will remain of course These missions will be carried out by thin agencies Under the cloud concept federal agencies would remain focused on specific missions and ongoing oversight These agencies however would become thinner as many of their knowledge workers transfer into the cloud Thin agencies could also create opportunities to streamline organizations with overlapping missions Employees working in thin agencies could fall into two main categories GovCloud could change the highest levels of public sector workers as we know them today The Senior Executive Service in the United States Permanent Secretaries and Directors General in the United Kingdom and Australia all such senior officials could rotate between agencies shared services and the cloud which would reflect the original intent behind many of these high level offices giving executives a breadth of experience in roles across government to help develop shared values and a broad perspective An important benefit of rotation would be the ability to tap into cloud networks to assemble high performing teams To further focus agencies on specific missions many of their back office support functions could be pulled into government wide shared service arrangements The use of shared services in government has come and gone in waves usually dictated by fiscal necessity Most countries in Europe as part of their e government strategies have placed increased focus of late on developing shared services whether through an executive agency or a CIO as well as working with EU coordination activities And while the decentralized governments of some EU countries such as Germany make shared services more difficult these countries are using states and agencies to pilot innovative approaches 27Other efforts around the world include the U S e Government Act of 2002 which examined how technology could be used to cut costs and improve services More recently the New Zealand government appointed an advisory group in May 2011 to explore public sector reform to improve services and provide better value In their report Better Public Services the advisory group recommended the use of shared services to improve effectiveness in a variety of government settings including policy advice and real estate 29 Following up on this three New Zealand agencies the Department of the Prime Minister the State Services Commission and the Treasury announced in December 2011 that they would share such corporate functions as human resources and information technology 30 And though shared services in Western Australia were shut down other projects in South Australia are moving ahead and already showing savings 31In August 2011 the government of Canada announced the launch of Shared Services Canada a program that seeks to streamline and identify savings in information technology Among its first targets is something as mundane as email But with more than 100 different email systems being used by government employees the potential savings and boost to efficiency could be significant Not only do these incompatible systems cost money by requiring individual departments to negotiate and maintain separate licenses and technical support it also makes it difficult for government employees to communicate with one another and with the public And with no single standard ensuring the security of information transmitted over email becomes more challenging Shared Services Canada will move the government to one email system as well as consolidate data centers and networks ultimately looking for anticipated savings of between CA 100 million and CA 200 million annually 28While the idea of using shared services is not a novel one it is central to the GovCloud model The GovCloud model envisions building upon effective practices and those shared services already in operation to deliver services like human resources information technology finance and acquisitions government wide Workers in these shared services would include subject matter experts in areas like human resources and information technology as well as generalists who support routine business functions The potential for shared services continues to grow As seen with IBM s Watson and Microtask s Digitalkoot new technologies provide an opportunity to accelerate the automated delivery of basic services Some agencies already have begun capitalizing on these trends For example NASA has moved its shared service center website to a secure government cloud facilitating greater employee self service and helping to reduce demand on finite call center resources 32This decision tool is designed to help leaders determine which employees are appropriate for each of the three structures in the GovCloud model the cloud thin agencies and shared services To the cloud GovCloud Project LifecycleManaging employees in the cloud will require governments to reinvent human resource management Individual and team performance evaluations career development pay structures and benefits and pensions would need to change to support GovCloud This section examines possibilities for HR reinvention including performance management career development workplace flexibility and benefits Employees working in the cloud would require an alternative to determine pay and career advancement The government could take its cues from the gaming world and evaluate cloud workers with a point system The manager as we know it will disappear to be replaced by a new sort of business operative whose expertise is assembling the right people for particular projects Daniel Pink author of Free Agent Nation 33An HR management system that incorporates the accumulation of experience points XP through effective work on cloud projects training education and professional certifications could replace the tenure centric models for cloud employees As employees accumulate XP they could level up and take on additional responsibilities in future projects Workers in the cloud could earn XP in four ways After some high profile incidents slow responses to outbreaks of foot and mouth disease flooding that may have been preventable and a farming subsidy system that seemed to result in more chaos than aid the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs DEFRA was looking to reinvent itself In 2006 the department launched DEFRA Renew One of its key goals was to bring the department s policymaking closer to actual delivery to create more responsive processes Organized mainly by policy with fixed teams DEFRA had been unable to redeploy resources as needed in response to a crisis As part of DEFRA Renew a new operating model was implemented that used flexible resourcing where staff were assigned to specific projects for fixed periods This allowed management to measure and build the required capabilities and competencies needed and to allocate resources efficiently to improve overall service quality New roles were also created to support sustainable staff development and resource management in the new model To create buy in for such a fundamental culture shift within the department a facilitative approach to decision making was employed Change management programs and mentoring were extended to all levels of the department including leadership New mechanisms such as approval panels for resources and the use of business cases also worked to push changes among staff and promote collaborative behavior DEFRA Renew was widely recognized as a key enabler in the department meeting required efficiency improvement targets set by the UK government DEFRA moved to a more project based approach with fewer staff in core teams According to Dame Helen Ghosh former Permanent Secretary of DEFRA they could be more responsive now that the management board won t be made up of director generals with individual policy silos 34Just as XP could be gained through learning new skills it could be lost in the following three ways Any serious discussion about creating a new class of government employees requires a fresh look at employee benefits and compensation For example XP could be used to help determine workers salaries but additional research into alternative pension and benefit programs is needed While any discussion on compensation could be contentious a healthy debate among stakeholders from across the government should be welcomed As new roles emerge in the cloud so too could new career paths Career emphasis could move away from time served in a particular pay grade and toward milestones that are meaningful for employee development Each worker may have different career aspirations For instance not all workers aspire to management some may seek to master a particular subject area instead Career advancement in the cloud would not equate to moving up a ladder but rather moving along a lattice Lattice GovCloud ModelHere s how the lattice could work for Ian who we met in the introduction Think of the lattice as a jungle gym The best opportunities to broaden your experience may be lateral or even down Look every which way and swing to opportunities Pattie Sellers Fortune editor at largeCathleen Benko and Molly Anderson the authors of The Corporate Lattice argue that the corporate ladder is giving way to a lattice that accommodates flatter more networked organizations improves the integration of career and life focuses on competencies rather than tenure and helps increase workforce loyalty 35 The lattice metaphor allows employees to choose many ways to get ahead It is unlikely that all workers will thrive in the new GovCloud environment right out of the gate As such it would be important to assess a worker s readiness before placing her in GovCloud and providing training on core competencies critical to cloud success There could also be opportunities to start workers especially those at earlier stages of a career within an agency or shared service to build up expertise in some area before graduating to the cloud Once in the cloud new workers could be paired with mentors who are more experienced to help navigate the cloud experience itself There should be an emphasis on continuous learning in the cloud It would be important for cloud workers to continue to refine their skills develop additional expertise and adapt to new ways of working Not only could continuous learning affect workers career mobility by increasing the depth and breadth of their skills but it could also impact their salary and level by increasing their XP Learning and development in the cloud could take on many themes of next learning Next learning focuses on creating personalized learning experiences that leverage the latest technologies and collaborative communities to deliver education and learning programs that build knowledge bases and promote learning as a focus and passion not just a checkbox in a career 36To broaden cloud worker skills and the ability to handle multiple tasks and work on a variety of projects cloud learning could include the following principles 37In the cloud careers and expertise will be built in new ways and work will be something we do rather than a place we go to As such the cloud will give workers more control over their schedules and workloads By creating a flexible workplace governments could shed a significant amount of physical infrastructure and create shared workspaces Many buildings could be converted into co located spaces teams could use collaboration spaces or videoconferencing centers Some workers might rarely set foot in a government building instead conducting cloud tasks at home and interacting with project teams virtually With advancing communications and mobile technology distance no longer hinders collaboration It no longer matters whether all workers are at an office between 9 a m and 5 p m what matters is whether project teams produce results and whether everyone contributes A more flexible workplace could also take advantage of resources governments might not otherwise have access to Some retiring workers may not want to quit working altogether and a flexible model could be an enticing way to keep their expertise on retainer Alternatively the model could take advantage of would be government employees unwilling to relocate or unable to work a regular schedule By increasing flexibility governments could increase their available resource pool allowing agencies to access the skills and knowledge they need when they need it For an example of how a retiree could interact with the cloud see Appendix C National Security Case Study Don t think governments will ever take to the cloud At the U S Department of State the idea could soon be a reality The Office of eDiplomacy is preparing to pilot a cloud component to its e internship model for American students as part of the Virtual Student Foreign Service VSFS beginning this year The VSFS currently offers e internships to U S university students of multiple month duration By using a new micro volunteering platform State Department offices and embassies around the world will be able to create non classified tasks that take anywhere from a couple of minutes to a couple of days to complete Each task will be tagged by region and or issue and will automatically populate the profiles of students who have indicated those interests Students can then select the tasks that interest them the most or that fit into their schedule To see that the most pressing work is performed first offices and embassies will be able to prioritize their tasks so critical items appear at the top of the queue Imagine a small embassy preparing for a high profile multilateral meeting The preparations for such an event could be daunting for a small staff The power of the cloud could augment an individual embassy s capacity to prepare for a major event and ensure that related items are performed ahead of those that are less critical While there are plenty of incentives for participating in the VSFS micro volunteering platform from an impressive line on a student s resume to the chance to make a difference by working on topics of interest thought is being put into how to creatively incent high performance One idea is to simply invoke students competitive spirit Competition could be encouraged by a monthly leader board which results in bragging rights and potentially even a low cost but high impact reward Transparency is also key to competition with ratings available to State Department staff and other cloud interns and the ability to make short thank you notes from embassies publicly available interns would be keen to make a good impression The potential applications of this type of program are significant Imagine if offices throughout the State Department could tap into the language and cultural expertise of the thousands of foreign national staff members around the globe Providing a platform for those employees to contribute even a small amount of time to discreet tasks that require their expertise could unlock a world of knowledge 38Creating the GovCloud model will require bold leadership and the ideas and initiatives of entrepreneurial executives While a GovCloud model may be years in the making agencies can begin adopting cloud concepts today The GovCloud concept is designed to be versatile as well as applicable to a wide range of entities Depending on your organization government executives wishing to employ GovCloud may choose to apply the concept first to a unit before expanding to other branches or divisions entire agencies or the whole of government Often GovCloud principles are most effectively implemented as part of a larger reform program within a particular agency as with the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs Renew program as described earlier in this report On a smaller scale the UK Cabinet Office used flexible resourcing FR in its Economic Reform Group ERG with a staff of about 400 as part of its cost reduction plans Using a simple database that it had developed and a strong program of communications FR is now used and embraced by all core ERG employees with strong clear ownership from the top another key implementation factor Says Ian Watmore the UK Cabinet Office s former permanent secretary FR means we are able to deploy people much more quickly to priority projects 40Figure 3 outlines how GovCloud can apply to a variety of organizations Most government workforces haven t undergone a broad restructuring in decades In that time the world has been transformed by computers the Internet and mobile communications To respond to a variety of challenges governments have created scores of new organizations However in today s world of budget cuts and increased fiscal scrutiny the constant creation of new permanent structures is not sustainable The GovCloud model could offer a new way to use government resources A cloud of government wide workers could coalesce into project based teams to solve problems and separate when their work is done This could allow governments to concentrate resources when and where they are needed By using this model in conjunction with thinner agencies and shared services governments can reduce back office redundancies and let agencies focus on their core missions This model capitalizes on the work preferences of Millennials the future government workforce who value career growth over job security or compensation 41 The GovCloud model allows employees to gain a variety of experiences in a shorter amount of time and to self select their career direction To support GovCloud governments could establish the processes by which cloud teams would form work and dissolve New ways to evaluate performance and help workers gain skills and build careers should be considered Today s employee classification system stresses job descriptions and time in service this could be transformed with an XP model that emphasizes the individual s ownership of his or her career The GovCloud model will undoubtedly be controversial Many stakeholders from governing bodies to public employee unions must weigh in to shape the future government workforce The transition to a cloud model will not happen overnight or maybe even in the next five years but the conversation starts today Charlie Tierney is a Manager in Deloitte Consulting LLP s Federal Human

award winning team of journalists designers and videographers who tell brand stories through Fast Company s distinctive lensWhen it comes to overall economic growth the conventional advice for governments is to get out of the way After all fewer government implemented policies mean less red tape and therefore less risk of a slowdown waiting to wreck any business s competitive advantage A new report from the Information Technology Innovation Foundation offers a different argument The report Think Like an Enterprise Why Nations Need Comprehensive Productivity Strategies says our widespread aversion to government intervention is exactly why the U S and many developed countries like Japan and Korea are in a productivity rut today and have been since the Great Recession The report encourages nations to implement a productivity body and promises that by doing so developed countries like the U S can increase annual labor productivity by at least one percent For less developed nations that percentage is likely to double We know productivity as the ratio of output to input is an important factor for economic growth but according to economist Robert Atkinson of ITIF we aren t maximizing outputs in all industries the way we could And the result is that we have a productivity problem which as the most important factor in economic well being goes on to affect per capita incomes and wages and our standard of living The report says Acting in response to market forces alone most firms will underinvest in productivity enhancing activities Moreover many industries are structured in ways that will lead to productivity underperformance absent sectoral based productivity policies In addition maximizing productivity requires economy wide technology platforms and development of these platforms often lags in the absence of supportive government policies Finally expecting the optimal array of policies and public programs and actions to emerge on their own in an organic trial and error way is wishful thinking Despite the conventional economist s little understanding in productivity growth Atkinson says a lot is going to change because countries are aware that productivity s been growing a lot more slowly so they re trying to focus a lot more attention on it The widely popular argument that technology kills jobs and replaces workers has caused heightened uneasiness for many and perhaps that s why there s been little push to design robotics sophisticated enough to disrupt the workforce in a major way But this kind aversion to technology investments is a recipe for productivity underperformance argues Atkinson Sure millions of human workers might soon be replaced by AI technologies but this doesn t mean that more workers won t be able to do their jobs better If you look at the U S we have a program that the National Science Foundation runs that s called the National Robotics Initiative says Atkinson and it s explicitly designed to support robotics that don t replace workers and that instead assist workers I think that s a bad idea I think we should be trying to have technology that would replace workers and raise productivity much much more and then help workers transition to new jobs Throughout history as technologies have advanced the rates of unemployment have either stayed the same or declined as Garry G Mathiason chairman of law firm Littler Mendelson which has a specialization in robotics employment law issues told Fast Company last year Despite widespread fear of robots taking human jobs the evidence suggests that productivity growth benefits the average worker And while workers who are displaced will find themselves training for different careers overall it s a positive outlook because productivity goes up companies have bigger profit margins workers make more money and the nation as a whole feels more optimistic Currently the U S has no government backed productivity body because there s a very strong bias and fear against productivity explains Atkinson There s some things where regulations hurt productivity he adds like European labor market regulations that make it really really hard to fire somebody There s clear evidence that that hurts productivity But there are other regulations that could help productivity if they re designed in the right way For instance Atkinson points to Australia s National Productivity Commission whose job is to identify opportunities and policies to improve productivity as a good example of something the U S should implement Other countries like Cyprus and New Zealand also have policy commissions As technologies continue to advance employers trust that workers will also advance and improve but without the right tools and training this kind of improvement doesn t happen at the same speed as technologies advancing Another example of nations taking the right steps is the U K s national productivity plan which lays out the country s productivity problems and explores ways the government can help In developing countries like South Africa and India there are productivity organizations but they re not as developed often focused on organizing conferences and helping companies develop higher productivity tools and management techniques When asked whether nations that have implemented some kind of productivity commission have seen productivity rates increased Atkinson says the data here is still lacking Still Atkinson believes nations especially the U S need policies that will take a comprehensive look in place To do so the U S needs to 1 Incorporate productivity as a principal goal of economic policy For instance legislatures need to require major economic organizations in the federal government whether it s the Department of Commerce the National Economic Council or the Federal Reserve Bank to include boosting productivity in their mission statements 2 Go beyond the traditional economist s advice of getting market conditions right and create much stronger incentives for firms to invest in better tools better technologies to raise productivity explains Atkinson These incentives can include tax policies to encourage organizations to invest in tools and that will drive productivity Or systematic platform technologies that accelerate productivity across industries says the report For instance when it comes to construction which has less productivity today than 20 years ago despite a number of technologies that can be adopted policies are desperately needed for automated systems adoption Eventually everyone on the construction site will have a tablet device and know exactly where all the materials are and the supply chain is and when they re arriving on the construction site says Atkinson Eventually they ll do that but it might be 20 years from now 3 Establish a research and development strategy focused on spurring the development of productivity enabling technologies such as robotics says the report Governments need to focus a much larger share of their R D budgets on advancing technologies that will reduce the need for labor 4 Identify key ways productivity policies differ

maximise the opportunities and manage the risks of disruptive technological change and its impact on the future of work and the workforce We will provide an independent assessment of the scale and potential impacts of rapid technological change and its disruptive impact on the future of work and the workforce in New Zealand The overriding aim is to harness changes to maximise the wellbeing of New Zealanders The assessment is to provide material for future government policy development and other initiatives to prepare the country for a productive sustainable and socially inclusive future despite uncertainties around the impact of technology Two broad questions are to guide the assessment Find out more by reading the terms of reference here Are workers being replaced by machines How is the nature of work and the workforce changing To start this project we ve analysed employment data from the last few decades to help understand what has changed and what future employment trends might be likely Watch this 3 minute video to find out more The Commission will release an issues paper in April outlining the context and scope of the inquiry key issues to be investigated and a list of questions to be addressed and evidence sought We will invite you to review the issues paper and share your feedback on the questions asked or on any issues that you consider relevant to the terms of reference Issues paper released April 2019Series of reports for feedback August November 2019Final report to Government 31 March 2020Our mission is to help leaders in multiple sectors develop a deeper understanding of the global economy Our flagship business publication has been defining and informing the senior management agenda since 1964 Our learning programs help organizations accelerate growth by unlocking their people s potential Higher costs and rising demand have driven rapid increases in spending on core public services such as education healthcare and transport while countries must grapple with complex challenges such as population aging economic inequality and protracted security concerns Government expenditure amounts to more than a third of global GDP budgets are strained and the world public sector deficit is close to 4 trillion a year At the same time governments are struggling to meet citizens rising expectations Satisfaction with key state services such as public transportation schools and healthcare facilities is less than half that of nonstate providers such as banks or utilities Governments need a way to deliver better outcomes and a better experience for citizens at a sustainable cost A new paper by the McKinsey Center for Government MCG Government productivity Unlocking the 3 5 trillion opportunity suggests that goal is within reach It shows that several countries have achieved dramatic productivity improvements in recent years for example by improving health public safety and education outcomes while maintaining or even reducing spending per capita or per student in those sectors If other countries were to match the improvements already demonstrated in these pockets of excellence the world s governments could potentially save as much as 3 5 trillion a year by 2021 equivalent to the entire global fiscal gap Alternatively countries could choose to keep spending constant while boosting the quality of key services For example if all the countries studied had improved the productivity of their healthcare systems at the rate of comparable best performers over the past 5 years they would have added 1 4 years to the healthy life expectancy of their combined populations That translates into 12 billion healthy life years gained without additional per capita spending It s imperative that governments find a way to unlock that productivity opportunity The challenge is that until now there s been limited progress on measuring government productivity even though productivity is a well established and vital measure of the performance of national economies and private sector businesses As a result it is difficult for governments to gauge the true return on spending and debate is often focused on how to increase inputs and not the quality of outputs Governments typically find it challenging to identify improvement opportunities by learning from other countries or from other regions or sectors within the same country To help close this gap MCG built a comprehensive database and benchmarking methodology the Government Productivity Scope to start to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of government expenditure MCG applied the tool across 42 countries that together make up 80 percent of global GDP focusing on seven sectors healthcare primary secondary and tertiary education public safety road transport and tax collection The research was supplemented with insights from more than 50 interviews with government leaders and more than 200 case studies This paper presents the first version of MCG s analysis which we will continue to extend and refine in dialogue with government leaders and academic experts The initial findings point to dramatic differences in countries relative productivity Even among comparable countries with very similar outcomes the least efficient government currently spends more than twice as much per unit of output as its most efficient peer And while most countries have struggled to contain spending growth in every sector MCG found examples of governments that have reduced expenditure per unit while experiencing improved outcomes These differences point to a tremendous opportunity for governments to boost productivity save money and achieve better outcomes for citizens To realize that opportunity though governments need to deepen their functional capabilities in four key areas finance commercial digital technology and data analytics and talent management As MCG shows pioneering countries have reimagined and strengthened these functions so they play a more strategic leadership role in pursuing efficiency and improving outcomes Across these areas those governments have adopted an ambitious structured approach to transform the effectiveness of

income But they are also a source of self esteem of social interaction a feeling of purpose and even of community And the skills embedded in jobs remain principal drivers of increasing productivity and ultimately wages So when one opines on the future of work people tend to listen But perhaps when one is opining on the future of work today expectations of the listener are more akin to the BBC announcer of Monty Python s Flying Circus and now for something completely different When perhaps it s simply not so different And I guess that may well prove the damp squib hashtag for my talk today We know from history that soothsayers abound when it comes to opining on the future of work Indeed history is littered with the foretelling of a dystopia of jobless woe or a utopia of little need to work at all And the only universal truth seems to be that they were all wrong both happily and unhappily so The 20th century father of the fiscal stimulus John Maynard Keynes foretold in 1930 that In the 21st century a 15 hour work week will suffice as we turn instead to how to use freedom from pressing economic cares And yet despite significant productivity gains since the Keynes 1930 treatise we still all work on average around 40 hours a week In the late 1970s the historian Ian Turner presided over a major symposium on what new technologies would mean for the worker He predicted an imminent period of change as significant as the Neolithic or Industrial Revolutions To quote By 1988 at least a quarter of the Australian workforce would be made redundant by technological change And a similar adage we heard in 1982 from Barry Jones in his book Sleepers Awake technology and the future of work We all know that the late 1980s did see an exponential uptick in the common use of computers in workplaces and even more so in the 90s as the price of the humble computer plummeted But the foretelling of widespread redundancies of the Australian workforce were not seen For throughout the past 100 years it s been more a case of technology remaining the loyal friend not foe of the worker continuing to remove jobs that are often unpleasant physically tiring downright dangerous or just tedious think toll booth operator More recently we ve seen a plethora of papers and reports produced by think tanks academics consultants and platform giants touting analyses of jobs that could be lost as a result of the latest wave of technological change And that latest wave being the digital age and both the resultant automation and artificial intelligence Some of these reports seem to have settled on a nice big round figure of about 40 per cent of today s jobs now being at risk of automation over the next 10 to 20 years Now most of these reports stem from a seminal 2013 paper by Frey and Osborne where US data was used to predict job losses in the future But their approach left out a few things It did not take into account that new technologies can create new jobs Nor did it contemplate that not all tasks within an occupation can be automated or should be automated And we know that the rate of technological adoption will also depend a lot on consumer preferences do you want a robot cutting your hair and the actual cost or put crudely the business case of adoption Others in taking these factors into account suggest 9 of Australian workers are exposed to the risk of automation So a much smaller but not insignificant number And here I ll mention the must read paper by Melbourne University economists Jeff Borland and Michael Coelli Are the Robots Taking Our Jobs Their work lines up with the more considered studies in the US and Europe So let s look at the evidence a common sense thing to do when in the midst of a chorus of now for something completely different To test whether we have strayed into a world of lies lies and damned statistics And in looking at the evidence I ve drawn on some of the Commission s recent endeavour such as our Digital Disruption report 2016 and Shifting the Dial 2017 as well as the work of Jeff Borland and Michael Coelli and that of Bart van Ark of The Conference Board Overall the evidence suggests that labour markets have been pretty well resilient to shocks posed by new technologies of the past century and even the most recent modern bit Occupations skills and jobs come and they go No matter how transformative the technology be it the telephone electricity indoor plumbing refrigeration air transport the personal computer and today s digital No technology has removed people s capacity to work And in productivity terms all have been more transformative than the digital revolution so far with emphasis being on the so far And a bunch of measures suggest that technology is not having as large of an effect as expected at least not in our current modern times The rise of the New Digital Economy which encompasses mobile technology ubiquitous access to the internet and the world of the cloud is unquestionably changing lots of things But to date productivity is not one So much so that this has become known as the Productivity Paradox So whilst our low rate of multi factor productivity growth observed recently is not unique to Australia it has been observed across other countries too it represents something of a puzzle This is because it suggests that at least in aggregate our economies have not become any more efficient in producing things And we know the policy reasons why productivity may have slowed in Australia but this is notwithstanding our purported better ability to exploit information technologies One explanation for this is that there has been a change in the nature of technological progress That recent technologies characterised by some as dramatic have been minor compared to those in the previous century The other explanation one offered by Bart van Ark and perhaps one of intuitive appeal is that whilst we still see rapidly declining ICT prices along with a shift from ICT investment to ICT services perhaps the new digital economy is still in its installation phase And we shouldn t expect to see the productivity dividend until it truly enters the deployment phase This makes sense when you see that in the US the contribution of the most ICT intensive industries to productivity growth has dropped markedly from 46 to 26 in the past decade 2007 16 And for the US and the UK it has even at times registered negative productivity growth in these sectors Which could suggest that the dividend only makes its way into the deployment and hopefully productivity dividend phase once users fully grapple with how to absorb technology effectively So returning to the evidence on the impact on jobs And we do know that there has been automation of many tasks in the workplace But arguably if technology was both disruptive and displacing replacing existing jobs without creating new ones we would expect to see a persistent upward trend in the unemployment rate And we don t Whilst routine manual and routine cognitive jobs have fallen as a proportion of jobs from 50 to 37 non routine manual and non routine cognitive jobs have increased from 42 to 53 Think child care aged care nursing office managers designers and engineers using software Most importantly the aggregate amount of work available to the Australian population on a per capita basis has not seen a decline since the 1980s when computers became common in the workplace The amount of work available has actually increased by about 14 since the early 1980s But that s not to say there hasn t been a lot of change in our workforce and the nature of work since the 1980s Since the 1980s the workforce participation rate for females has increased a lot by some 15 percentage points to now be just over 60 Marriage and even children are placing much less of a brake on economic participation of women Which is both a good thing for the economy and for women There has also been an increase in the incidence of part time jobs by some 25 percentage points since the late 1960s to now account for nearly one third of total employment around 35 in Australia And despite what some have suggested the pace at which workers are changing between jobs in the Australian labour market is not getting quicker Not only is there no evidence that more workers are being forced to work in short duration jobs but what is apparent is that the opposite has happened The proportion of workers in very long duration jobs more than 10 years has increased from just under 20 per cent in 1982 to around 27 per cent in 2016 Which is perhaps unsurprising when you also take into account the participation rate of older Australians 65 in age has risen steeply having nearly doubled in the past 30 years to now represent 12 of our workforce Also a good thing with our ageing population We do know that more workers today have multiple jobs now around 7 of workers And perhaps of much greater significance when workers do change jobs today more are changing occupations some 40 and industries over 50 And it was this modern day workforce reality that informed much of our thinking around the Commission s proposed changes to superannuation default arrangements in our current superannuation Inquiry And our thinking on what is needed from our tertiary education system which I ll return to later And whilst the gig economy is still in its infancy this has not translated yet to any increase in the proportion of the workforce being independent contractors Indeed this has not changed significantly since 2001 it s actually fallen a few percentage points from 20 per cent of employed persons in 2001 to around 18 per cent in 2014 So what does any of this mean or matter for public policy And perhaps here our focus should be two fold First on making sure there are no road blocks to our economy reaching the deployment phase of the digital or any technological age And second making sure we avoid a workforce of have and have nots in the benefits from the changes in the economy and ultimately jobs A sense of equality in the ultimate job productivity and wage dividend So let me pose a few policy questions Are we getting better at assisting transitioning workers We know that structural change whatever its source can result in considerable work and thus life disruption for the workers impacted unless we get the consequential skill adjustment right So have we gotten better in assisting displaced workers get the right skills to transition into new occupations and industries Recent work by the Commission on transitioning regional economies found that effectiveness of government in doing this is at best unclear Some programs found to be not well targeted automotive industry or create conflicting incentives Tasmanian forestry industry And why unclear use of data to simply track the impacted workers and decent evaluation of transitional assistance are largely missing in action Put simply we can and should be doing better Further it s a tad perverse that if the digital economy ultimately disrupts more jobs we do not use the data fuelling that economic activity to assist those disrupted We know of such endeavour in Germany using data to track the worker and the resultant human capital modelling which in turn better informs what requalification programs will deliver a better job transition to a displaced worker Are the right incentives in place to get the workers to the new jobs We know that jobs at least risk of automation jobs that require soft skills such as good old fashioned empathy account for the largest and growing part of our workforce And the latest metrics from the ABS brand new quarterly labour account experimental estimates reveal health care and social assistance as the largest employment sectors accounting for over 1 6 million jobs or 12 2 of all filled jobs This is largely a function of our demographic changes an ageing population women working more along with the NDIS arguably our single biggest social reform since Medicare The Commission s recent review of NDIS costs found that the NDIS workforce was not growing fast enough most regions require between a 50 per cent and 150 per cent increase in the disability services workforce Put simply for the foreseeable future 1 in 5 new jobs in Australia are projected to be for services for the NDIS Thus care is needed to ensure that the demand for these skills and workers is not frustrated by poor incentives The most notable as highlighted in our NDIS review being the need to ensure the pricing of these services allows this massive labour force response to occur Lest we have a program delivering disappointment and not services to the 475 000 Australians with eligible disabilities Is our education and training system fit for purpose for the workers of today and tomorrow Perhaps this is our biggest public policy must have when thinking of ensuring innovation and technology delivers not just more jobs but jobs for most That sense of equality in who shares in the ultimate job productivity and wage dividend And this was a question the Commission sought to ask and answer last year in our inaugural 5 yearly productivity review Shifting the Dial A policy roadmap for Australian Governments on what is needed to deliver on economic participation and productivity two of the three Ps population participation and productivity that matter most for economic growth and ultimately jobs and their real wages And we identified some fundamental fractures in our current education and training system First deteriorating results in subjects that matter for future work think science maths and reading the cognitive trifecta at school Second the VET system is a mess struggling to deliver relevant competency based qualifications Employers today are more satisfied with non accredited training courses 90 than VET 76 Third universities need to improve student employment outcomes delivering qualifications relevant to labour market needs and at a time relevant to the worker s needs Our key educational institutions seem more focused on research than student employment outcomes which is unsurprising given the notable absence of their skin in the game As manifest in 26 of students today not completing their undergraduate studies in less than 9 years Whilst undergraduate underemployment has more than doubled in the last decade to now reach just over 20 Currently the tertiary education system is set up against becoming a chef at age 40 or a dementia care worker at age 50 Retraining is currently inconvenient and expensive and the approach of educational institutions remains outdated and outmoded still emphasising a one career for life approach Which is not the modern day reality for many workers from the metrics cited earlier Taken collectively this unfortunate troika can only put at risk our capacity to deal with future labour market changes in an efficient and equitable way So we ve proposed a few things change for schools evidence and evaluation of what works with teaching for universities incentives be redressed around student employment outcomes and for work skills government to develop two things First tools for proficiency based assessment for skills rather than simply competency based assessment whether they can perform it at all And second a framework to facilitate independent accreditation of skills obtained agnostic of learning method Do current policy settings constrain us getting to and through the installation phase and on to realising benefits in the deployment phase of the digital economy Today s market power arguably resides in data and content The growth of the digital economy automation and artificial intelligence coupled with greater availability of data and algorithm advances will be key drivers of new business activity research endeavour products skills and jobs In short access and use of data and content will be the determining force in realising the economic benefits of the digital economy and artificial intelligence On data the Commission s report last year on Data Use and Availability proposed fundamental and novel changes to data availability and access policy to ensure it generates new economic opportunities and business opportunities driven by consumer needs and preferences A pro consumer and thus pro competition stimulus with the consumer in the drivers seat for their data held with business and government today And the good news is the Government s response to this inquiry has been one of can and will do The Government has committed to support the two most structurally significant recommendations First the passage of national legislation to remove barriers to data sharing and integration across major public interest data sets and create trusted user access And second the complementary legislated concept of a new general Right for Consumers to exercise joint control in the sharing and use of their data So it s now all down to getting the implementation right On content the Commission s Inquiry in 2016 on Intellectual Property Arrangements examined whether those arrangements meet the needs of the Australian economy And the short answer was no for copyright Currently Australia s copyright exceptions are too narrow and prescriptive do not reflect the way people today consume and use content and do not readily accommodate new legitimate uses of copyright material We found ourselves mired in the wrong debate of publishers clamouring for well protected profit for the purported benefit of local authors For access to content be it snippets of images maps pixels words song sounds is needed alongside data to actually do artificial intelligence But our arrangements unlike those in countries like the US South Korea and Israel pose a seemingly impenetrable barrier to AI being alive and well in our economy For in the absence of meaningful reform to copyright Australia will inevitably and demonstrably be a net importer of AI services and products And fair access to content also matters for education Now more than ever workers need flexible access to ongoing learning MOOCs are a key component of providing low cost and flexible access to ongoing learning And in consulting with the states on Shifting the Dial we were implored to think of the transitioning worker in NW Tasmania in our approach to ongoing skills acquisition especially for mature age workers Yet Australia s current system of copyright usage heavily constrain Universities TAFEs and schools from offering MOOCs So on a final note I ve failed dismally to foretell a future of dystopia or utopia and happily so but that doesn t mean that the deployment phase of the digital economy may yet still surprise us And in reflecting on the Inquiries that formed much of the Commission s endeavour over the last five years or so nearly all have dealt in some way shape or form with the now of work and thus the future of work And in doing so tried to view it through the lens of the needs of workers and students And through that lens it affords a sense of what policies new or tweaked will see our economy able to access the installation phase and realise the benefits of the deployment phase of any technological change And perhaps most importantly ensuring those phases see the benefits of jobs productivity and higher wages shared across the workforce Avoiding a world of technology driven haves and have nots Because that s what matters most for the future of work Follow OnSubscribeThank you for inviting me to speak with you here today In particular I want to thank the Productivity Commission and all involved in the Productivity Hub The previous presenters today have touched on a range of ideas for how we can face the challenge of improving our productivity in a changing world From technology and data to public services and the energy transition I m excited to see forward thinking people working on such a broad range of important topics I d like to commend you all and encourage you to keep up the good work My presentation today will focus on an issue that is at the heart of a productive economy how we approach the rapidly changing world of work I want to talk about how this fits with the overall economic strategy of the Government the core policy areas that we have identified to support New Zealanders in this process and the institutional settings required to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of the Future of Work Economic StrategyBy harnessing the potential of new technology and innovation educating and upskilling our workforce and incentivising research and development we can lift productivity and transition to an economy that is sustainable inclusive and productive That is this Government s overarching economic aim The lessons learned from the Future of Work Commission heavily influenced this Government s economic strategy We aim to shape an economy where we work smarter make better use of our resources ensure everyone who wants to work can work and ensure that the benefits of growth are spread across society In an article published this past weekend Rod Oram argued that we can rise to the immense challenge of making this a high value high wage economy over the next decade The global and local conditions for doing so are the most favourable ever I know there is an appetite among businesses and workers to take up this challenge and I couldn t agree more that the time is right to face up to this Boosting productivity across the economy will be one of the key drivers to improving New Zealanders living standards and wellbeing The Government will put this at the heart of what we do Our focus on lifting wellbeing will require a different approach and different measures of success We want to take a broader view of success and move beyond simple measures such as GDP which while an important measure of economic output does not tell the full story of peoples wellbeing We are working with our Confidence and Supply partner the Green Party on new sustainable development indicators to paint a fuller picture of how well off people are and how the Government can focus its resources best I have also instructed the Treasury to accelerate their work on the Living Standards Framework which measures the impact of policies on four capitals Human Social Natural and Financial Physical I intend to use this framework to inform the Budget process for Budget 2019 making it our first ever Wellbeing Budget By placing wellbeing at the heart of what we do we will be able to measure the extent to which our policies and investments are making real improvements to peoples lives Improving productivity is key to improving wellbeing By producing more from every hour worked businesses become more profitable incomes rise and workers wellbeing rises as time is freed up and purchasing power rises The challenge is how we achieve this The Changing World of WorkThis Government has come into office at an interesting time in New Zealand s economic story Technological advances are transforming our world for example through increased processing power and big data sensors remote work or smart devices The full effect of forces such as automation algorithms and globalisation are not yet known but we do know that they already are and will continue to be disruptive to what only 5 or 10 years ago we considered the status quo My thinking on this topic was shaped by the Future of Work Commission which I chaired for the Labour Party when we were in Opposition It was an ambitious undertaking that saw us engage with thousands of New Zealanders and experts from around the world It is hard to distil that work down to a few points but overall my takeaway is that there is an enormous possibility for us to have productive and fulfilling work over the coming decades But it will only happen if we prepare now We are facing a world where the change has been estimated by McKinsey Global Institute to be occurring at ten times the pace of the Industrial Revolution and 300 times the scale or roughly 3 000 times the impact Every aspect of our working lives is changing Whole jobs are disappearing and almost every job is being re shaped The very notion of what a job is has been challenged by the so called gig economy Advances in technology present both challenges and opportunities for this sometimes all at once For example a company which automates production of its products will experience productivity gains but there might be consequences for the company s workers What happens to those who are laid off How well positioned are they to quickly retrain Could their past training help them swiftly move into other work How can we benefit from changes to the nature of work while negating or limiting the disadvantages We cannot say with any certainty exactly what the world of work will look like but there are some core changes we can identify and the responses to them that are needed This represents both challenges and opportunities How we respond will drive the future of New Zealand s economy and shape how productive sustainable and inclusive our growth will be over the next few decades We all know the story of the New Zealand economy Over the past 20 years New Zealand has generally done well in the creating more part of the productivity equation GDP growth has averaged about 2 8 over that time compared to the OECD average of 2 1 But it s the other part of the equation the resources required to create more where we have been weak Of that headline growth about 1 7 can be attributed to growth in the volume of labour input or simply total hours worked In other words we required strong population growth and more people entering the workforce to ensure more hours were worked in order to increase production More people working is not a recipe for long term sustainable and inclusive growth The portion of that growth which can be attributed to getting more from each unit of labour in producing goods and services has been 1 1 of that 2 8 over the past 20 years that is we are one of the weaker performers in the OECD In fact our relatively low labour productivity growth over a long period of time means the level of labour productivity in New Zealand GDP per hour worked is about 20 below the OECD average The Productivity Commission has told us that New Zealand s shallow capital markets have meant low levels of investment of productive capital the stuff we need to invest in to help us create more from our available resources Our investment in non residential capital per person in the labour force in 2016 was 25 lower than the OECD average In order to get ahead in terms of headline growth we relied on more people coming here to work and those who were already here to enter work We are at a point where the level of labour productivity in New Zealand GDP per hour worked is around 30 below Australia We have to do something different In recent years the main growth drivers have been population growth and a run away housing market That is not a sustainable path and as those forces recede we need to move deliberately and with urgency to establish an economy that is based on a thriving productive sector We also have to ensure that the benefits of this growth translate into meaningful improvements to the living standards of many New Zealanders who missed out in recent years I spoke earlier about our Government s emphasis on wellbeing and delivering higher living standards for all New Zealanders We want to ensure the economy is delivering real benefits to peoples lives rather than simply pursuing growth for the sake of growth Our success in achieving this will largely be determined by how we respond to the challenges we face including New Zealand s productivity challenge With this in mind today I want to talk you through this Government s plan to ensure we are prepared to face the changes that are coming due to technological advances and the changing nature of work In responding to this our Future of Work report identified three core values to drive our response We need to be Inclusive offering opportunity and harnessing the talents of all Resilient to deal with the changes and shocks that are coming our way and Adaptable to be leaders of the change and shape it in line with our values There are a huge range of policy approaches and changes to the way we run our economy that are needed to meet these challenges and take the opportunities that will arise Our Tax Working Group and the reforms we are making to the Reserve Bank Act are an important part of setting the path to a more productive economy That focus on improving productivity is at the heart of the terms of reference for both these reviews Beyond these we had more than 63 recommendations in our report and you will be pleased I am not going to go through them all now I want to touch on just a few of the main themes Just TransitionIn the face of this rapid change it is essential that we have a just transition for those most affected We saw in New Zealand in the 1980s and 1990s the damage that can be done when major changes are made without enough thought or support given to those who face the immediate consequences In this instance I am using that phrase to primarily talk about two things one at a system level the other at a practical on the ground level The government has committed itself to the goal of a net zero carbon economy by 2050 This is an essential shift for New Zealand away from an economy that hastens climate change to one that is more sustainable and develops New Zealand s strategic advantages We will need to ensure this is a just transition where affected industries and communities are given the support to find new sustainable growth opportunities We are in the process of establishing an Independent Climate Commission which will have the job of establishing goals and targets Meanwhile under the leadership of Hon James Shaw a Green Investment Fund is being created to leverage private sector investment to support business developments that will support a low carbon economy Innovation science and research will have significant roles to play in this However New Zealand s total investment in Research and Development is only 1 3 of GDP about half the OECD average When the OECD issued its most recent assessment of the New Zealand economy last year this is what it had to say on R D Expenditure on R D is low as a share of GDP most notably in the business sector Collaboration between firms education and research institutions is low And its advice Increase fiscal support for business research and development Maintain or increase long term support for successful collaboration between research institutions and industry In the Coalition Agreement with New Zealand First we have set a target of hitting an R D spend of 2 of GDP in ten years That s more than a 50 increase in R D investment relative to GDP over that time and will make a significant contribution to improving our productivity Officials say that this is an ambitious goal We believe this can be done with the Government incentivising such vital work by the private sector Minister for Research Science and Innovation Megan Woods has already begun work on overhauling New Zealand s R D regime with Ministers set to discuss officials initial findings later this month We are committed in the first instance to restoring R D tax credits to give firms some certainty about their investments One other key investment identified in our Future of Work programme is in direct support of the technology sector and for businesses to make better use of new technology Research by Swedish academic and technologist Goran Roos found that 55 of New Zealand jobs are at risk due to technological advances and that countries likely to be least affected will be those with the highest levels of economic complexity This is just one of the reasons why it is important for us to diversify our skills base and look for more sustainable drivers of growth By putting the right policies and incentives in place the technology sector can be one of those economic drivers While technological advances present challenges to existing jobs we also have the opportunity to create new forms of work According to NZTech chief executive Graeme Muller only 14 percent of large NZ businesses have deployed any enabling technology for the Internet of Things despite 70 percent believing it will be strategically important for their business to do so Their concerns are largely around costs and changes in technology This Government wants to nurture an environment that gives businesses the confidence to take up new technology Minister Clare Curran is in the process of creating the position of Chief Technology Officer CTO who will report directly to the Prime Minister and Cabinet The CTO will be responsible for introducing and managing a National Digital Architecture and Digital Technology Roadmap They will also work with the wider industry to develop ingenuity and creativity in the ICT sector Our aim is for the ICT industry to be our second largest contributor to GDP by 2025 Learning For LifeThe other critical element of a just transition to this new world of work is how we support people to gain the relevant skills and knowledge We need to both support those workers whose jobs are under threat and prepare those who are yet to start working for the kind of labour market they are likely to enter New Zealand currently spends a fraction of what other countries do on active labour market policies Other countries around the world such as Singapore France and Germany have recognised that they need to both plan ahead for the changes but also provide greater support for people who are displaced by technological change The Future of Work was the catalyst for our three years free training and education policy One of this Government s key policies is to provide one year of free post secondary education or training gradually progressing to 3 years by 2025 In 2018 we will see 30 000 students enrolled in tertiary education courses and 50 000 in industry training without paying fees for their first year of education thanks to this policy This is extremely important for those whose jobs or future jobs are affected by automation and other technologies One aspect of this policy has not had a lot of attention which is for adults who have never trained or studied before They will be able to take up the three years free policy as it is rolled out This can be taken in short bursts or as complete re training This policy also covers the costs of those undertaking apprenticeships and aspects of industry training Because of the relative costs from 2018 this means two years free for apprentices right away For the next generation of people entering the workforce it is essential they are given the skills to be resilient and adaptable In the Future of Work Commission s time we heard from employer after employer that they were looking for people with what we once called soft skills the ability to collaborate be creative and solve problems These ideas lie at the heart of New Zealand s education curriculum but there is work to do to ensure they are developed for all our young people We will be embarking on a host of initiatives to see this happen including reform of our careers advice and guidance in schools to give all young people the opportunity to understand and experience the world of work This will be developed in close cooperation with business and training providers to create a more seamless transition from school to whatever comes next In January Employment Minister Willie Jackson announced the first of a series of initiatives to help give a group of young people who have fallen outside of the system sustainable work opportunities Sadly Maori and Pacifika young people are over represented among this group They are the most at risk of being excluded from the future of work and we need practical programmes that provide work experience to get them back into a training journey In the long term I believe we will need to radically alter the way we think about training and learning and work if we are to continue to lift productivity As the pace of technological change picks up we need to see ourselves as genuinely learning for life In many ways jobs will be events on that learning and training journey rather than the other way around This presents a series of challenges and opportunities for our education and training system that we will look at over the coming years There are of course many other areas of policy response that will contribute to our response to the Future of Work but I wanted to finish today on what systemic changes we will need to ensure we are leading the change rather than being passive recipients of it Active and Capable StateA critical element identified in our Future of Work report is that the state needs to be an active participant in how we shape the future of work It is important to note that by active I do not mean that it controls or dictates what happens but rather that we move beyond the tired and dangerous idea that we can simply leave the response to market forces to decide how New Zealand fares in the future world of work This means working alongside businesses to identify opportunities as noted above in the R and D and Tech sectors for example It means developing a new partnership between the Crown and Maori as the settlement of historic Treaty breaches comes to an end and opportunities for economic development emerge It also means being innovative and entrepreneurial when that is appropriate We are wanting public servants to co design with both politicians and the wider community what we can do to stay ahead of the curve A major example of this is the Provincial Growth Fund developed as part of our coalition agreement with New Zealand First This will see significant investments in the regions of New Zealand to grow sustainable and productive job opportunities The details of the Fund are to be released shortly and will provide some of the most significant development of our regions in decades These will be driven from the ground up with the Government as an active partner A New Social PartnershipIt is my strong belief that the most critical element to New Zealand succeeding in the Future of Work is a renewed social partnership between businesses workers and the government In the course of our Commission we saw examples in both large and small businesses of innovative approaches to this idea Air New Zealand s High Performance Engagement model is one useful example By involving workers in the full range of strategic decisions and change processes Air New Zealand has not only seen significant productivity benefits they have created far more harmonious workplace relations In a number of the new smaller technology businesses we have seen flat management structures and workplace democracy in action that is core to the way they run their businesses These companies give a significant voice to their employees and have seen productivity growth and improved workplace relations as a result We are working with MBIE and others to facilitate these approaches across a range of industries We can also see innovations happening in the way we work An example which has grabbed attention recently is Perpetual Guardian s decision to switch to trial a four day working week for five days pay The move was designed to improve workers wellbeing by giving them more time to spend with family and on other aspects of life with the expectation that this will enhance their productivity during the days they do work the same levels of output for fewer hours worked These are the kinds of practices that we need to see more of If we look at Germany as an example union members often sit on company boards as part of the decision making process ensuring that employee wellbeing is considered alongside high level corporate profit and financial targets It is unsurprising then that German workers on average worked the fewest hours annually in 2016 of all OECD countries with New Zealand workers on average doing 400 more hours every year This is possible because Germany s workers are also some of the most productive in the world I want to see New Zealand reach a point where we are able to work 400 fewer hours a year while producing more than we do today For us to get there we need to make the advances in productivity we have been discussing today Technological improvements will play a huge role in this One of my goals as Minister of Finance is to develop this new partnership at a system wide level to promote a combined work stream on how we can apply these lessons to other industries and sectors My parting challenge to the many public servants here today is to think about how we can do this across Government and break down some of the silos we have created to enable businesses and workers and their representatives to easily engage in such a partnership ConclusionI am most certainly not the first New Zealand politician to both highlight the challenge of low productivity nor to say that we will address it So the proof will be in what we actually do But we are in an environment that has change occurring at a pace and scale we have never seen before We have to take the opportunity now to capitalise on that to finally make the leaps that have so far eluded our country We have already made a start with the initiatives I have mentioned today I want us to re write our productivity story so that New Zealand becomes a leading example of a sustainable and productive economy in which everyone gets a share of economic success We have a long way to go but this Government is committed to tackling the long term challenges that this country has faced for

remote work dramatically change the 2020s Disruption is already beginning Let s explore future trends for digital nomads and everyone else including the cybersecurity implications of our changing workforce habits In a blog post that went viral this past week Richard Branson wrote The way we all work is going to change The entrepreneur believes that our 9 5 lifestyles will end in the next decade as a result of technology advancements from autonomous vehicles to robots to artificial intelligence The idea of working five days a week with two day weekends and a few weeks of holiday each year has become ingrained in society But it wasn t always the case and it won t be in the future I m lucky in being able to work wherever I am at any time and don t see work and play as separate it s all living I think this will be the case for more and more people in the future to the benefit of businesses countries and individuals But as we inch closer to 2020 how will remote work factor into the new year equation in 2019 The reality is that the way we do work is already being transformed now albeit not as radically as Branson predicts for the future The changes are occurring as a result of technology innovations that allow access to any data from anywhere at any time Meanwhile millennial desires and expectations regarding work are starting to transform what it means to have a job and at the same time have a life With U S unemployment numbers at a 50 year low the endless search for talent at an all time high and the shortage of government cybersecurity professionals getting worse this topic will only grow in importance in 2019 and throughout the next decade Background on Remote WorkNo doubt some of you are thinking Why cover this remote work topic now Back in early 2017 I blogged about the pros and cons of telework in government Looking further back one of my first blogs for CSO Magazine in 2007 was on telework So what has changed Answer A lot Let s start by exploring some fascinating headlines and 2018 stories As we take a year end look at technology and security trends I believe that these developments will be a key 2019 trend and it will certainly impact many other online trends including security plans Nevertheless it should be noted that working from home at least sometimes is not the same as the new remote work trend This remote work topic has evolved somewhat since Fast Company asked the question in 2014 Will half of people be working remotely by 2020 Still the growth of working remotely has not met the expectations set by many strategic planners This fact has not curbed the enthusiasm of experts who believe that remote work will be a major trend over the next decade On the Contrary For the naysayers in the crowd Forbes offers five reasons why a remote work arrangement isn t for you The feelings of being disconnected and experiencing too many interruptions away from the office top the list Entrepreneur Magazine describes some common mistakes that also ring true with remote work like poor communication for many I also like this scenario offered by a Trello blog A company decides to allow its employees to work from home one day a week They then find that their employees are least productive on those days or that employees are difficult to reach or perhaps they re constantly cutting in and out on conference calls so they scrap the program entirely Not only that when the topic of remote work comes up in conversation they repeatedly assert something along the lines of Yeah we tried that But it just didn t work This scenario mirrors my early experiences with remote work in the state of Michigan more than a decade ago as the CISO and CTO in government Everyone wanted Fridays to be their day to work from home and over time that became the day that the least work was done and no one scheduled meetings on Fridays It was also hard to get in touch with certain people which should NEVER happen Looking back we didn t have the right training metrics and processes in place to truly enable the proper use of working from home Also some employees didn t take the needed responsibility when given the opportunity We did make adjustments but never saw increased productivity from remote work But that was more than a decade ago and Fast Company offers these remote working tools to help manage the remote worker experience New Remote Work Solutions PleaseThis Raconteur article describes the rise in the digital nomad and answers the critics It starts with the reality that IBM was famous for its remote working policies in 2009 40 per cent of IBM s 386 000 global workforce worked remotely allowing it to sell unused office space for 2 billion They have just reversed the policy I personally know many people who were affected by the IBM remote work policy change and there is no doubt that all of the productivity data is still being analyzed Another recent article describes reasons why people love co working spaces This concept strives to eliminate some of the downsides of isolation and loneliness that many feel when working remote Still companies like Selina are growing rapidly In this Commercial Observer piece the author describes how Selina is bringing their model of hybrid work hostel to America A Panama hotel chain that mixes high end hotel units with multiple bed dormitory rooms in the same building along with a coworking space and local eateries wants to expand from Latin America to the U S My Closing ThoughtsI recognize that many of the remote work concepts presented in this blog will be seen by many readers as too cutting edge for state and local governments to adopt Still these concepts are being explored by the private sector now in order to attract and retain the talent of the future I foresee a 20s decade that will bring more and more remote teams to governments and the private sector around the world especially for technology and security work The key needs of trust transparency and accountability will be paramount in any remote work arrangements made Expect 2019 to be a year when many of these connectivity and remote communication opportunities and concerns are discussed in new ways in businesses and governments across the country Unless we see a major recession in the U S which could ease the desperate search for tech and security talent temporarily public and private sector organizations will increasingly look to utilize remote workers to fill important roles In addition societal trends with millennials and ongoing advancements in technology will bring about new security concerns regarding data confidentiality integrity and availability Also data backups remote system access from untrusted networks and customer service must all be addressed anew In the same way that cloud computing trends regarding onsite data centers are mixing with cloud data to create a hybrid environment remote workers will need to be competently managed along with onsite staff Leaders who can develop the skills to manage a mix of public and private sector talent along with onsite staff and remote workers will have a major advantage in the new normal that is coming Just ask

was At the pinnacle of technological progress man becomes a god New machines and software are continually forged in man s image and taught to do things that once only people could do A day will come when man s machines surpass their creators in their capacity to do and to think and it will be at that technological singularity that the economy will double on a weekly basis and mankind will become peripheral to a new reality and consciousness beyond human comprehension Conservative estimates place that date at about 100 years from now but in the meantime there are smaller fish to fry The American middle class is shrinking and it s technology that s causing it It s not all bad The gains in efficiency begotten by automation have been great for productivity And productivity means progress It always has Since the Industrial Revolution began around 1760 new technologies have been stealing jobs and since 1760 people have responded by finding or inventing new jobs that contemporary technologies couldn t do It s a good system in the long term everyone benefits from technological progress and while the workers losing their jobs in the interim might feel a bit miffed people have always found a way to bounce back into an ever adapting economy Besides if machines can do something better than people can it would be senseless to ignore such utility and hold back progress for fear of a few temporarily lost jobs Unfortunately for today s average worker finding or inventing a new job is harder than it once was When economists look back they see that it was around 1999 when something changed Productivity kept going up but where in the past median household income and employment per capita would have also hitched along they instead diverged Median household income is on a steep decline employment isn t bouncing back strongly after the Great Recession and a greater percentage of Americans now identify themselves as lower class than at any point in history Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson director and professor respectively at the MIT Sloan School of Management named this divergence of productivity and employment the great decoupling Technology is a broad term It can be equally applied to a stick being used by a chimpanzee to extract insects from the Earth and to a rocket launching a chimpanzee into suborbital flight above the Earth Today s technologies are more scalable and complex than the machines people needed to outsmart in the past which is a big reason for the decoupling Surveying a county road in 1998 meant that a team of workers needed to get into a pickup truck with a government seal on the side of it drive take photos and measurements of the area return to the office and assess the information that was gathered Researchers at the Michigan Tech Research Institute found in 2013 that it s much easier to just send a drone They also developed software that takes the sensory data gathered by the drone and generates a fully characterized 3 D model People are still needed in the process to make high level decisions and babysit the technology when things go wrong but not as many people are needed And even fewer will be necessary if the researchers concept is honed and commercialized The trouble is that the guy who once rode along in the pickup truck is now unemployed and he doesn t know how to design drones or code 3 D modeling software The average American is looking more and more like that guy A study by two researchers at the Oxford Martin School concludes that within the next 20 years or so approximately 47 percent of all jobs could be replaced by automation Technology is racing ahead but our skills our organizations our institutions aren t keeping up Brynjolfsson said As they adjust we will see more of the benefit show up in the economics but right now there are a lot of technologies with more potential than has been fully realized This trend is just getting started A lot of economists technologists and policymakers agree with McAfee and Brynjolfsson but some say today s technologies aren t special people will find new jobs just as they always have and no intervention is needed It s just the recession they say To understand why that s not the case people need to look closely at today s technology Brynjolfsson said For example there are prototypes of autonomous vehicles on the roads Legislators in Nevada California Florida and Michigan have penned laws allowing the vehicles limited public use and some estimate that almost all vehicular traffic will be autonomous by 2050 In a recent span of two months Google purchased eight robotics and machine learning companies not just because the technology will make cars drive themselves but because smart robots can improve productivity across almost all of the company s businesses The problem with this extremely fast progress is that people are relatively slow Although it won t happen overnight today s 233 000 taxi drivers and 1 7 million truck drivers aren t ready to become an anachronism In addition decoupling means the upper 1 percent gets a bigger piece of a growing pie Brynjolfsson said which also accounts for the shrinking middle class A lot of these digital technologies have winner take all or winner take most economics where you can get a small group of people producing a better piece of software or insight and once they ve digitized that they can replicate it 10 times or a hundred million times and dominate the market for that he said You can see it in checkout counter software you can see it in tax preparation software there are 17 percent fewer tax preparers than there were a few years ago you can see it in airline reservations In more and more categories software is eating the world Software can give legal advice analyze data and automate data entry and robots like IBM s Watson can even diagnose and recommend accurate cancer treatments much better than humans can One study showed that Watson can diagnose lung cancer accurately 90 percent of the time compared to a measly 50 percent rate for human doctors There s no economic law that says everyone is going to benefit from technological progress even if it does make the pie a lot bigger Brynjolfsson said So both in terms of theory and evidence I think there s a potential to be concerned and I am concerned Amazon spent 775 million buying out Kiva Systems in 2012 the maker of a disc shaped robot used in warehousing Today Amazon uses the robots to fetch pallets of goods saving workers the time and energy of running around to find products themselves The purchase came soon after a report showing that some Amazon warehouse workers were walking 10 to 15 miles per shift Most workers are probably grateful that their job is now to pack goods and do various administrative tasks rather than play fetch all day but on the other hand Amazon doesn t need as many human employees now If technology gets automatic and simple enough it will eventually just be one guy in the Bahamas running the company from his smartphone That might seem far fetched but it was in living memory that the idea of autonomous vehicles and talking robots were science fiction Now those technologies border on pass Researchers from MIT s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory are developing a theoretical model and algorithms that would let robots like the ones used by Amazon communicate more intelligently with one another so they can solve logistical problems on the fly and also communicate with other sensory agents in the environment human and otherwise Once robots can talk to each other and solve problems on their own even fewer people will be needed in those warehouses When robots like Baxter a 25 000 production line worker with a calm demeanor get cheap enough even sweatshop workers will be out of a job What the Industrial Revolution did for muscle power Brynjolfsson said the second machine age is doing for brain power and especially so in government As you automate and augment a lot of mental tasks it s a little less clear whether those technologies will be complements or maybe substitutes for human labor and that s one of the things we re working through now as a society Brynjolfsson said Government jobs on average tend to include more information processing and on average the workers in that sector are more educated and doing more knowledge work than in a lot of other parts of the economy So they in some ways are likely to be more affected Today s robots are very poor at doing some things such as folding laundry as one YouTube video confirms and even worse at others like offering compassion to a young student or making a sound moral decision as a police officer Those traditionally human skills are expected to gradually improve in robots but in the meantime data analytics and the Internet of Things provide a waypoint for progress Facilities like the Domain Awareness Center now being constructed in Oakland Calif will make monitoring cities for crime and dispatching help a more efficient process Likewise predictive crime software is a rising trend in law enforcement in many cities Making better use of data and distributed sensor networks means that fewer officers will be needed to cover a given geographic area because officers are better informed and more efficient Even if it s not the extreme scenario of Robocop taking over for human police officers technology finds gains in efficiency everywhere and the cost is usually displacing human jobs Some are optimistic about what all this means for the world and others less so but to take either position is to accept that technological progress has a foregone conclusion Brynjolfsson said and it doesn t It s been said that the best idea America ever had was mass public education he said That helped us make the transition from an agricultural economy to one based on industry and services It didn t happen by accident it happened through public policy We re going to have to reinvent what education is and focus more on creativity and interpersonal skills things that machines are not very good at and less on having people sit quietly in rows listen to instructions and carry out those instructions Nicco Mele agreed that education and government policy need to be revolutionized and that s why he teaches future policymakers at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government Mele is a consultant to the Fortune 1000 and was named by Esquire as one of America s best and brightest Modern technology Mele said compels us to rethink the assumptions of every discipline Look at our health care policy look at our retirement policy he said Those policies are built on this assumption that people have 9 to 5 jobs and stay with one employer their whole lives That s profoundly not true for the American workforce and hasn t been true for well over a decade A third of American workers are self employed and another third are contingently employed which means only about a third of the workforce has a traditional 9 to 5 job Yet our policymakers and our politicians are building all the policy on the assumption that this is a good way to do it American policymakers are on average older and richer but they also tend to know less about technology care less about technology and delegate technological responsibilities to others Mele said and this is unacceptable in a world where tech influences everything Imagine a state legislator saying I don t think about money I don t worry about money I don t worry about the tax rate I don t worry about the budget I just let accountants deal with it We d kick them out of office right That s not an acceptable answer and we need that same kind of expectation technologically he said The idea that tech is separate from the rest of the world is rooted in a past era where digital technology was less prevalent Today there are remnants everywhere of that old way of thinking that reinforce technological illiteracy in some of government s most critical positions Mele said One of the things I hate most in the world is the Genius Bar at Apple because it sets up this dichotomy he said It sets up this world where they re geniuses and we have to just do what they tell us People must demand that their leaders be technologically literate Mele said because it s profoundly dangerous to have elected officials or policymakers who don t have any technical literacy to evaluate what s going on A recent Gartner report identified that 60 percent of CEOs dismiss the idea that automated and smart technologies could displace a huge percentage of jobs in the next 15 years Michael Armstrong CIO of Corpus Christi Texas is not a denier of the second machine age s power and influence As a CIO Armstrong said the best one can hope for is to influence policymakers The coming years will bring incredible new changes he said Advances in 3 D printing have applications in medicine and other fields that haven t even been realized yet Advances in prosthesis are allowing people to live longer and there are even philosophical questions being opened up about what it means to be human The Shadow Robot Co based in London spent 1 million building the Bionic Man a robot composed entirely of artificial body parts and internal organs Life is changing fast for everyone I think we re hitting the knee of the curve and things are getting exponential Armstrong said Make sure that you understand and your leadership understands what is happening in these areas and what the implications are because that s going to drive social policy and government policy to a huge degree A lot of this stuff is happening very quietly Government has been shrinking for so long that s been an accepted way of doing business I think this is not going to leave anyone alone One way or another it s going to affect us all he said In any kind of revolution we always lose jobs but there s always been something to replace all those jobs and that may not be the case this time Colin wrote for Government Technology from 2010 through most

2017Regulation is a major way in which government influences the U S market economy The scope of government regulations is vast and reaches all sectors of the economy and all aspects of our daily lives But what exactly is regulation ReportReportSocial Media ToolkitSocial Media ToolkitRelated ContentRegulation is a major way in which government influences the U S market economy The scope of government regulations is vast and reaches all sectors of the economy and all aspects of our daily lives But what exactly is regulation The Merriam Webster dictionary provides this very general and simple definition of regulation an official rule or law that says how something should be done1Regulatory policy scholars Susan Dudley2 and Jerry Brito elaborate on that definition this way Regulations also called administrative laws or rules are the primary vehicles by which the federal government implements laws and agency objectives They are specific standards or instructions concerning what individuals businesses and other organizations can or cannot do Market economies need clear rules to function efficiently Without a legal framework establishing and enforcing property rights and the rules of the game our free enterprise system could not exist Regulations issued by the executive branch affect every aspect of our lives From the moment you wake up until the time you go to sleep regulations influence what you do Yet most people know very little about the impact of regulations or the process by which they are produced 3Recently the international Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD has done considerable research on regulatory policy Their overarching perspective is that regulations are often necessary for a well functioning market based capitalist society but they do not always live up to public expectations or achieve their social goals In other words regulations in practice do not always make things better Regulations are indispensable to the proper function of economies and societies They create the rules of the game for citizens business government and civil society They underpin markets protect the rights and safety of citizens and ensure the delivery of public goods and services At the same time regulations are not costless Businesses complain that red tape holds back competitiveness while citizens complain about the time that it takes to fill out government paperwork Moreover designing and enforcing regulations also requires resources for government and public administrations Regulations can also have unintended costs when they become outdated or inconsistent with the achievement of policy objectives The 2008 financial crisis which resulted in part from poorly designed regulatory regimes and the uneven enforcement of existing regulations and the ensuing and ongoing economic downturn starkly illustrate the potential consequences of regulatory failure 4When CED last spoke on regulatory policy we like the OECD recognized the necessity of regulation but noted how it often fails to serve its role well Government regulation of economic and social activities permeates our lives While regulation in many instances yields important public benefits regulations often are imposed on individuals and organizations with too little thought or analysis of what is gained in comparison with the losses incurred in time money indecision and productivity Further the growth of government involvement in the market system sometimes constrains our ability to achieve fundamental economic and social goals 5Indeed though government intervention in the marketplace is often justified it does not always achieve its first best textbook ideal There is an elegant efficiency in the market price system allowing resources to flow naturally to their highest valued uses as signaled by suppliers and demanders but still there is a role for government where markets fail to price goods and services to reflect social values Where government intervention can help correct prices whether through regulations or fiscal tax and spending policies government will improve economic and social outcomes This is not a blanket endorsement of government intervention however as public policies are often imperfect fixes that can worsen rather than improve outcomes A worthy government role does not mean we should hand over full control of markets to government The free market may still be superior to government in getting most of the prices and flows of resources right It follows that government regulations are more likely to improve rather than impede the performance of the economy when they adhere to broad economic principles rather than impose narrow statutory rules Principles based regulatory approaches have the advantage of being more adaptable to changes in economic conditions and economic opportunities as new markets develop in the economy and particular businesses rise or fall in response to appropriate price signals Admittedly the lack of specificity in principles based regulations can allow unintended behavior to be characterized as compliant On the other hand whereas a highly prescriptive rules based approach makes it harder for businesses and regulators to fudge compliance such brighter line regulations can become so specific and tailored to the situation of the moment that they can easily become obsolete or even counter productive particularly from a public interest or societal perspective as the economy evolves They can also be specifically designed to favor incumbent businesses as well supporting cronyism to the detriment of new business formation and the innovation and productivity growth of the overall economy The case for a highly specific rules based regulatory system is that in our litigious society laws and rules must fully cover every contingency lest the clever manipulate the system to take unfair advantage Even sound and well intended rules this perspective would contend could leave enormous and debilitating uncertainty until all of those contingencies were resolved perhaps even in court However we believe that the benefits of a more concise principles based approach are substantial enough that the nation should change its collective mentality including perhaps a dispute resolution system that could deliver timely judgments possibly with penalties for attempts at manipulation that are fairly determined to be frivolous A summary of recent literature on principles versus rules based systems is presented in Appendix 1 Government decisions are more susceptible to bias through the influence of special interest money and politics whereas free market outcomes are impartial to all the different participants in the marketplace who clearly signal values through the prices they are willing to pay or receive Therefore a well justified approach to government policy is one in which private market prices are still the primary signal to steer resources but regulations or other public policies supplement or correct the signals to more completely reflect public costs and benefits Regulation is just one way the government can intervene in the market economy Two other major ways are through fiscal and monetary policy These three types of public policy levers interact and overlap and can work toward the same goals but also unfortunately cross purposes Sadly government does not plan for and scrutinize the effects of regulatory policy as well as it does for the impact of fiscal and monetary policy There are several reasons for this discrepancy First the effects of regulations are more difficult to measure on both the benefit and the cost side but particularly measuring both on common terms usually in monetary values so they are comparable Second regulations typically do not impact the federal government s budget bottom line as directly or explicitly as fiscal policy does so it is more difficult and there is less incentive for the federal government itself to measure the costs which are often shifted to lower level governments or the private sector even though the effects on the economy broadly can be just as large or larger Any cost estimates produced by those very entities that disproportionately bear the costs of regulatory policies are typically viewed by federal policymakers with skepticism and a presumption of exaggeration given that they come from a self interested rather than purely public interested perspective Regulated entities not surprisingly view claims by regulators with analogous skepticism In theory the major economic justifications for and role of regulation are fairly clear cut In practice however capture special interests or cronyism theories compete with the public interest rationale to explain why and how the government actually regulates Regulation policy refers to how regulations in practice are made maintained and evaluated Worldwide regulation policy over the past few decades has progressed from concepts of regulatory reform or deregulation to regulation management and most recently to regulatory governance In a 2011 report on Regulatory Policy and Governance the OECD describes this progression of concerns and goals The OECD model of regulatory policy is founded on the view that ensuring the quality of the regulatory structure is a dynamic and permanent role of government Governments must be actively engaged in assuring the quality of regulation not reactively responding to failures in regulation In advanced countries this concept is evolving into regulatory governance Regulatory governance is grounded in the principles of democratic governance and engages a wider domain of players including the legislature the judiciary sub national and supra national levels of government and standard setting activities of the private sector The integration of evidence based impact assessment of new and existing regulation building strong institutions for regulatory management and placing a greater focus on users of regulation are all critical elements 6A common business perspective on regulatory policy is that regulations can often be helpful to the economy in encouraging competition leveling the playing field and promoting vibrant and dynamic markets that can be more responsive to evolving public interests On the other hand businesses also complain about regulations being overly burdensome inefficient and sometimes inappropriate and unjustified Of course individual businesses can find much to complain about in specific regulations that impose new costs on them specifically and may seek regulations that give their business competitive advantages over others Ironically to promote a business friendly regulatory climate the public interest large powerful companies sometimes lobby for what are effectively special interest regulations that keep potential new innovative competitors out of the market and thus remove much of the incentive for their own companies to keep innovating CED believes that regulations should support but not necessarily subsidize business activity in ways that maximize the net benefits to society as a whole This is why we favor a more principles based regulatory strategy Regulations are more likely to promote the public interest even if they stay on the books for a long time perhaps without periodic and frequent review if they are based on broad principles rather than narrow rules Broad economic principles last forever but narrow legal rules can become stale over time Broad principles do not favor specific companies over others whereas narrow rules easily can and sometimes do The last CED policy statement on regulatory policy Modernizing Government Regulation The Need for Action was issued in 1998 7 The report concluded that while government regulation is needed to achieve many important economic and social goals the regulatory system produces too few benefits at excessive cost a shortcoming encouraged by the lack of regular scrutiny and analysis of the justification for and effectiveness of regulations The report also observed that current efforts to effect meaningful regulatory reform are severely hampered by distrust on both sides of the regulatory debate and stressed the need to reconcile and narrow the gap between the polar extremes with sound science and analysis that is evidence based guidance transparency and accountability The CED statement made the following policy recommendations Note the repeated theme in these recommendations of getting Congress more involved in implementing evaluating and overseeing regulatory policies and moving away from what is viewed as regulators self evaluations which are more likely to be biased and invested positions But given how much things have changed over the past 18 years in terms of the function or rather dysfunction of Congress it is not clear that we can have the same faith in the capability and motivations of Congress over other parts and levels of government or other stakeholders in the private sector today Beyond that point regulations established via laws enacted by Congress are actually implemented by executive agencies not by Congress If regulations are to be workable at the street level where the practice takes place it will necessarily require expertise in the agencies much more than in the halls of Congress in Washington As a result oversight of agency regulations and their implementation now resides in the OIRA in the OMB within the Executive Office of the President It is not clear that relocating ultimate authority to the Congress would help improve the quality of regulations in practice in the real world On the other hand Congress mandates new regulations and in its decision making needs to understand whether a new cost effective regulation is achievable Therefore strengthening Congress s regulatory resources in some measure does make sense Regulations affect all sectors of the U S economy Susan Dudley and Jerry Brito s primer on regulation follows a day in the life of a regulated American family to illustrate regulatory policy s influence on many areas including telemarketing utilities consumer product safety water quality food nutritional information the pricing of produce and meat automobile safety air bags high occupancy vehicle lanes and highways workplace safety employee benefits both health insurance and retirement savings and television broadcasting When one realizes how these rules affect every aspect of how we earn and spend our money and the quantity quality and price of all these things we buy and sell it is clear that we all are essentially stakeholders in all kinds of regulations Some major aspects and sectors of the U S economy affected by regulations are Susan Dudley s latest May 2015 regulators budget 9 provides estimates on government spending and staffing for the social regulation and economic regulation categories see Figures 1 and 2 and the appendix of Dudley July 2015 10 It shows the tremendous growth in time and money spent on administering federal regulations particularly of the social variety over the past 50 years The past decade has been economically tumultuous and challenging and there is plenty of finger pointing at the government for not doing the right thing in various areas of policy Both since and as a result of the 2008 financial crisis there has been increased concern that the burden of regulation is unnecessarily holding back economic activity There is also recognition that policies must strike the proper balance between the often competing goals of i promoting the stability and longer term growth of the economy which suggests avoiding imprudent risk taking and addressing the fiscal outlook and ii continuing to support the current cyclical shorter term recovery which implies policies that may encourage risk taking and deficit spending This tension between economic goals means that in developing and establishing regulations policy makers will often need to consider whether imposing a regulation that is believed to have long term social and perhaps nonmonetary benefits is worth its short term economic risks and costs This is typically a tradeoff that is both challenging to measure and difficult to make The question Is the United States overregulated is difficult to answer because it is difficult to objectively measure how much we are regulated in terms of impacts on economic activity to be assessed later The term regulatory burden is often used more superficially in reference to paperwork and other administrative costs the costs of complying with regulations One possible measure of such administrative burden is page counts as shown in Figure 3 11 Another measure of regulatory burden is the count of economically significant rules deemed to have an effect of 100 or million or more in a year as illustrated in Figure 4 12Unfortunately these count based measures fail to get to the essence of what makes a regulation truly economically burdensome Are five pages of clear rules worse than one page that is so dense as to be impenetrable Is a significant rule that generates far more benefit than cost bad because its costs breach some arbitrary total cost cap Smarter measures of regulatory burden try to account for regulatory stringency on business and household economic activity such as through the international comparisons made by the OECD and World Bank which will be discussed in the next section Public attitudes about the burden of regulation may be flawed through reliance on opinions of persons not directly involved in the process 13 See Figure 5 Negative sentiment has risen over the past decade but it is unclear how much of this is informed through real life experiences of the burdens of regulation on economic activity versus blaming regulations for the general difficulties of the economy since the last recession versus people s more general philosophical positions informed by hearsay or otherwise from less than relevant personal experience The effects of regulation on economic activity are difficult to measure and thus too often are neglected in the debates over economic policy The World Bank s senior vice president and chief economist Kaushik Basu explains this is because regulations affect the nuts and bolts and plumbing in the economy the fundamental moving parts that are often too deep for us to see or notice He continues to explain that The public discourse on economic policy is overwhelmingly focused on fiscal measures monetary interventions welfare programs and other such highly visible instruments of government action Thus when an economy does poorly a disproportionate amount of our debate centers on whether or not it needs a fiscal stimulus whether there should be liquidity easing or tightening whether its welfare programs have been too profligate or too paltry and so on What gets much less attention but is equally and in some situations even more important for an economy s success or failure is the nuts and bolts that hold the economy together and the plumbing that underlies the economy The laws that determine how easily a business can be started and closed the efficiency with which contracts are enforced the rules of administration pertaining to a variety of activities such as getting permits for electricity and doing the paperwork for exports and imports are all examples of the nuts and bolts that are rarely visible and in the limelight but play a critical role Their malfunctioning can thwart an economy s progress and render the more visible policy instruments such as good fiscal and monetary policies less effective 14The ways in which regulatory policies affect the economy fall into these main categories On the macroeconomic effects Coglianese Finkel and Carrigan conclude that although there has been substantial progress in researchers ability to understand and better measure the economic effects of regulation neither regulatory analysts nor academic researchers have yet to develop the kind of evidentiary foundation needed to provide solid answers to the question Are regulations job killers or job creators 15Keith Hall current director of the Congressional Budget Office wrote for the Mercatus Center that agencies have failed to examine the economic cost of job displacement not based on any empirical evidence that job displacement is costless Although the lack of effective methodologies for forecasting the macroeconomic and dynamic impacts of regulation may be the biggest problem facing regulators the intentional dismissal of the cost of job displacement remains a real shortcoming of agency efforts to promote only those regulations where the benefits are worth their costs 16Regulating for safety reasons is an especially tricky proposition in terms of acknowledging economic side effects or unintended consequences and appropriately weighing benefits against costs Diana Thomas concludes that regulation of health and safety in consumer products ends up a regressive policy placing disproportionate burden on lower income households by driving up the prices of consumer goods and driving down wages 17 Greg Ip of the Wall Street Journal warns that safety regulation can encourage even riskier behavior as we are essentially lulled by a false sense of regulatory security Ip also emphasizes that regulations designed to tamp down risky behaviors widely deemed to be bad can often tamp down economic activity universally considered to be good 18To judge whether a regulation will be good or bad for the economy first one has to identify the purpose or goal of the regulation Is it to achieve a more optimal outcome for the economy and society that the private market cannot deliver on its own because of a fundamental market failure If so what is the nature of the failure and is a regulatory approach and if so what type the best way to address correct or adjust for the failure considering both the benefits and costs of the strategy What kinds of evidence can and should be gathered and considered to evaluate the likelihood of success before a regulation is established Dudley and Brito s regulation primer suggests the following steps in describing How to Analyze a Regulation chapter 8 In other words justify a role for government find the approach regulatory or otherwise most likely to improve the economic outcome and maximize net benefit to society and then consider and address and adjust if needed any undesirable distributional effects These would be the steps an impartial economist would take in building a smart regulation but of course impartial economists are not the ones who propose vote on or implement regulations Economists are on the sidelines ready to analyze when asked the economic effects of regulations already in motion or in place In asking how could regulatory policy do better for the economy we must first acknowledge the current resource constraints that make very challenging the adequate evaluation of regulations in terms of all these types of economic effects There are both data and analytical limitations Federal agencies currently do not do a good job of monitoring and measuring the effects of regulations and collecting data along the way for later analyses Having to compare effects at different points in time involving discount rates place values on human life and deal with uncertain outcomes is technically complicated Robert Hahn has argued that not enough progress has been made in the actual evolving practice of regulatory assessment in terms of the rigor and quality of economic analysis and its potential to improve regulatory policy 19 Yet Hahn also acknowledges that there are understandable and persistent political obstacles to strengthening the role of economic assessments in regulatory decision making Although all regulations must at least implicitly pass a society wide cost benefit test measurement especially of benefits and especially in the case of social regulations can be extremely difficult Given the limits of available knowledge benefits can be highly uncertain Furthermore it is in the nature of many regulations to require investment type activities which provide their uncertain payoffs years in the future Thus even if those benefits were known with certainty which they are not decision makers still could disagree over how many future dollars of benefit are required to justify one dollar of current cost Still further because those remote and uncertain benefits often include claims of the saving of human lives those decision makers are caught in the analytical and ethical quagmire of valuing a human life under various combinations of controversial circumstances The same of course can be true of the valuing of avoidance of injury or illness Environmental regulation is a good and large example the economic costs of environmentally motivated regulatory policies in terms of reduced economic output activities that explicitly enter GDP are much easier to put dollar values on than are the environmental benefits Thus although approving or rejecting a proposed regulation is inevitably and implicitly passing judgment on a cost benefit test in many instances that judgment will of necessity be highly controversial Hassett and Shapiro explain that the economic effects of regulations are fundamentally challenging to evaluate compared with assessing the effects of other types of government policies that are more easily parameterized such as tax policy s effects depending on the breadth and uniformity of the tax base and level of marginal and average tax rates 20 Regulations are varied and hard to generalize because every case is unique and it is difficult to find directly relevant empirical evidence Hassett and Shapiro conclude that policymakers must draw inferences concerning the likely impact of regulations from analogies and based on international comparisons reflecting differences in regulatory climates and stringency Note that this also supports a principles based approach to regulation as broader economic principles typically are applicable and relevant across countries whereas specific rules usually are not International comparisons can help researchers assess the overall country wide or at least industry wide stringency and burden of regulations on broad measures of business and household economic activity but they do not really help us evaluate the effectiveness of particular regulations on the particular more specific activities of particular businesses and households To do that we need more micro level data Here the case for more adequate funding for statistical agencies and programs must be made All stakeholders in regulatory policy should collect adequately detailed data to measure these micro effects so that regulations do what they are supposed to in economically sensible optimal ways Assessing the economic costs and benefits of particular types of regulations cannot be done using macro level data Given that aggregate or average economy wide effects are typically very small the most significant effects are the allocative and distributional effects across geographies industries companies within industries and different types of people which require micro level data to measure 21 It is also true that regulatory policies are not imposed in a vacuum so without the more detailed data it is extremely problematic to attribute changes in business or household behavior entirely to the regulatory policy Micro level data are needed to control for other factors affecting decisions and outcomes A great example of the kind of microdata needed to study the effects of regulations on the very activities that are being regulated and hence whether regulations are achieving their public interest goals is found in a paper by economists Joseph Shapiro and Reed Walker which uses factory level records from the Census Bureau and the Environmental Protection Agency EPA to isolate the effects of environmental regulations from other factors that affect pollution emissions trade productivity and consumer preferences 22 Using a model driven decomposition of the causes of the observed pollution changes the researchers find that environmental regulation explains 75 percent or more of the observed reduction in pollution emissions from U S manufacturing over 1990 2008 One of the four broad principles emphasized in CED s 1998 policy statement was that Where feasible and effective regulations should be applied with a soft touch that allows flexibility of response including the use of market incentives in lieu of command and control directives 23The report went on to explain a full range of regulatory policy approaches in terms of the degree of control the regulation attempts to impose on markets The reporting of information lies at the minimum end and traditional directive rulemaking at the maximum Intermediate positions include a variety of mechanisms that affect economic incentives through the price system such as in the case of environmental policy through pollution taxes or tradable permits Economists of all political persuasions tend to favor regulation via market based adjustment of prices to account for differences between social costs or benefits and private costs or benefits over regulation based on requiring changes to quantities of specific inputs or outputs which would override rather than simply adjust the natural market based price incentives Using the price system allows markets to self correct in response to government adjusted social costs and benefits while preserving the market fluctuating signals contained in the private component of prices in contrast to the latter command and control approach where the government essentially sets quantities and thus pre determines full prices Such market based forms of regulatory policy are also more in keeping with a principles based as opposed to a rules based approach Another advantage of using more market based approaches to regulation is that such practices facilitate the collection of real time objective information on the behavioral effects of these programs Randall Lutter writes that the permit trading approach to environmental regulation has several advantages In addition to promoting the lowest cost means of meeting a specified emissions target environmental regulation also generates emissions permit prices which are unsurpassed at measuring one important aspect of the effects of regulations on regulated entities the current marginal cost of controls averaged across the industry and futures markets for permits can also provide information about current expectations of future control costs 24To widen the market and to narrow the competition is always the interest of the dealers The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order ought always to be listened to with great precaution and ought never to be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined not only with the most scrupulous but with the most suspicious attention It comes from an order of men whose interest is never exactly the same with that of the public who have generally an interest to deceive and even oppress the public and who accordingly have upon many occasions both deceived and oppressed it 25Approximately 240 years ago Adam Smith cautioned the readers of his Wealth of Nations that policy actions touted by businesses and politicians as being in the public interest might actually be positions promoting their own particular and very special interests Fast forward to modern times and crony capitalism the pursuit of private gain through influence in the public sector which is a frequent topic of discussion and debate among the citizenry 26 In the field of regulation such manipulation can potentially have a serious cost Influence over the regulatory process could be used to stifle competition allowing existing businesses to charge higher prices To a degree perhaps beyond even what Adam Smith appreciated regulations could be used to preclude innovation that would challenge incumbent businesses Stifling innovation could in the longer run slow U S productivity growth and advantage other nations that would allow the same innovation to achieve more dynamic economies to challenge ours For that reason building regulatory governance structures that maintain a level playing field and encourage competition is essential Such an attempted manipulation of the regulatory process could be a quite straightforward one on one struggle between a particular private interest and the relevant governmental authorities However there have been occasional alliances between seemingly unlikely private collaborators in attempts to compound their political influence on regulation Economist Bruce Yandle has dubbed such phenomena the Bootleggers and Baptists theory of regulatory policy He first introduced the concept in a short paper in Regulation magazine in 198327 and revisited it in 1999 28 He recently made a short video on the theory 29 His latest more extensive take is in a 2014 book with the same title coauthored with his economist grandson named by the most extreme coincidence Adam Smith 30 As the two authors explain in the book s preface The Bootleggers and Baptists theory takes its name from the classic example of laws requiring liquor stores to close on Sundays which were supported by both alcohol bootleggers and anti alcohol Baptists with both groups willing to spend valuable resources in pursuit of such laws The happy bootleggers eliminated competition one day a week and the devoted Baptists could feel better knowing that demon rum would not be sold openly on their Sabbath day Of course no one will ever see bootleggers carrying signs in front of a state house seeking political support when closing laws are up for reauthorization The point of the theory is precisely that they don t have to the Baptists lobby state house members for them For success to occur according to the theory a respectable public spirited group seeking the same result must wrap a self interested lobbying effort in a cloak of respectability Both members of the politicking coalition are necessary to win The Baptists enable accommodating politicians to say the action is the right thing to do and have folks believe them The bootleggers laugh all the way to the bank and may occasionally share their gains with helpful politicians 31These Bootleggers and Baptists are indeed strange bedfellows but the problem for society is not the oddity of these relationships but rather the disparate and perverse motivations that are thus brought together to shape regulatory policy Instead of the partnership allowing policymakers to better account for a broad and diverse set of viewpoints in their making of government regulations as good public policy this collaboration between Bootlegger and Baptist types produces economic outcomes that are ironically bad for society and the public interest Instead of appropriately correcting or improving situations where the private market on its own would fail to generate an efficient and strong economy regulatory policies that are tailored to bootlegger special interests but cloaked in public interest Baptist costumes end up distorting markets further away from what would be best for society as a whole 32Smith and Yandle explain we are convinced that the rising tide of crony capitalism or what we would call Bootlegger Baptist capitalism is drawing some seriously critical attention to capitalism itself Capitalism has taken lots of hits recently Everything from bailed out banks and auto companies to subsidized solar product firms that fail spectacularly leaves the public with the feeling that the marketplace is seriously flawed Anti capitalism messages seem ubiquitous Yet the proposed remedies for the system s failings all seem to involve more government regulation which means more opportunities for Bootleggers and Baptists to line their purses with transferred rather than newly produced wealth 33In their book Smith and Yandle provide additional modern day examples of Bootleggers and Baptists B B in action with one chapter covering regulation of sinful substances including the original alcoholic beverages tobacco products and marijuana and another discussing the large field of environmental regulation In the next two chapters they relate the B B theory to two more recent and politically charged public policies the Troubled Asset Relief Program TARP following the financial crisis of 2008 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 popularly known as Obamacare In each case the authors identify Baptist type lobbying that yields Bootlegger type benefits cronyism in action The B B scenario is well illustrated in two more recent examples taken from some of the most innovative parts of our economy i taxicabs and ii internet service providers In both cases we can see Bootlegger type special interests trying to pass off their positions as protecting Baptist type public interests New Ride Hailing Companies as Alternatives to Traditional TaxicabsStories about the new ride hailing companies suggest there are some true public interests well served by the newcomers entry into the industry improved access to transportation in areas where it isn t profitable for taxis to wait for passengers as explained in Oglethorpe University president Lawrence Schall s experience as an Uber driver 35 better tailoring of supply to demand in real time via the app system and more efficient peak load pricing where fares rise when demand does to ensure cars are available where and when they are most needed or valued Traditional taxi companies already subject to regulations naturally find it unfair that companies such as Uber do not have to play by the same rules 36But instead of leveling the playing field by raising regulatory burdens on Uber governments could take Uber s success as evidence that their local economies would likely benefit from existing regulatory burdens on the rest of the taxi cab industry On the other hand as Eric Posner cautions the platform technology that Uber and Lyft use is one factor that suggests some regulatory attention will be needed as each company s own platform dedicated to purchasing ride services from that company alone may create monopoly like pricing opportunities 37 Net Neutrality in the Pricing of Internet ServicesIronically as Kevin Hassett and Robert Shapiro have explained in a recent paper the imposition of a single price whereby ISP companies are prohibited from charging higher prices for higher quality services will lower investment reduce supply and hence raise average costs charged to consumers 38 Hahn Litan and Singer 2010 explain that net neutrality takes a legitimate concern that internet services be provided without unjust price discrimination where different prices are charged for the exact same service and takes it to the unjustified extreme where a firm is prohibited from charging different prices for different levels of service reducing economic efficiency by preventing firms and consumers from entering into mutually beneficial agreements 39 A CED blog post focused on what seems to be the general public s misunderstanding of the economics of net neutrality 40In the end even the bootleggers in this case would not actually benefit from a pure unadulterated fully implemented and enforced version of net neutrality the way they think they would But as Roslyn Layton explains there will be plenty of external legal challenges and internal hand wringing over the FCC s new open Internet rules before any such rules become a reality 41Occupational LicensingSimilar to the bootlegger position of the taxi cab industry another current example of regulatory policy supported by incumbents in the industry is occupational licensing A 2015 report by President Obama s Council of Economic Advisers finds that the licensing requirements for certain occupations most commonly in the health and education fields for example physical therapist personal trainer dental hygienist or assistant yoga teacher are typically mandated through state level regulations 42 While ostensibly designed to protect the health and safety of consumers a Baptist goal they also create obstacles to either entering such employment or being geographically mobile in such work thus reducing competition for those who already hold such licenses within their state the bootlegger interests Again the benefits of the bootlegger or crony behavior here in favor of restrictive licensing requirements are clearly focused and easily recognized while the costs of the regulatory burden to the would be competitors who are kept out of the industry and to the consumers who pay more for such services because of the burden passed onto them are much more diffuse In general it seems that cronyism and capture of regulatory policy by special interests is easier when regulations are narrow special tailor made and complex difficult for new business to qualify or comply This means that not only are narrow rules based regulations likely to favor incumbent businesses over new businesses but they are likely to hurt the overall economy s level of innovation and productivity by allowing less productive older businesses to survive and be protected by regulatory hurdles that prevent more productive new businesses from entering the competitive market in the first place The Council on Foreign Relations 2015 report Quality Control Federal Regulation Policy reviews the literature and makes international comparisons 43 Their bottom line conclusion is that the United States needs smarter regulations not fewer From their report Research on the economic effects of regulation is underdeveloped though available evidence suggests most regulations have brought benefits that are worth the economic costs But the federal government could do more to lower burdens on business without compromising the objectives of regulation and the U S regulatory management system has changed little since the early 1980s and focuses almost exclusively on cost benefit analysis before regulations are put into place instead of in hindsight when it is clearer whether a regulation is working The United States used to be the trailblazer in regulatory reform But the rest of the rich world has caught up Survey data show that regulatory burden does not put U S business at a competitive disadvantage see World Bank s Ease of Doing Business index and Timothy Besley s paper on it but the United States does a poorer job of getting rid of regulations that no longer work 44From the World Bank s overview of their Doing Business report Doing Business 2015 Going Beyond Efficiency a World Bank Group flagship publication is the 12th in a series of annual reports measuring the regulations that enhance business activity and those that constrain it Doing Business presents quantitative indicators on business regulations and the protection of property rights that can be compared across 189 economies from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe and over time Doing Business measures regulations affecting 11 areas of the life of a business Ten of these areas are included in this year s ranking on the ease of doing business starting a business dealing with construction permits getting electricity registering property getting credit protecting minority investors paying taxes trading across borders enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency Doing Business also measures labor market regulation which is not included in this year s ranking Data in Doing Business 2015 are current as of June 1 2014 The indicators are used to analyze economic outcomes and identify what reforms of business regulation have worked where and why This year s report introduces a notable expansion of several indicator sets and a change in the calculation of rankings The United States ranks 7th out of 189 countries in this year s Doing Business report ranking particularly high in the financial market areas of ease of getting credit 2 and resolving insolvency 4 As the report explains page 3 emphasis added The 20 economies at the top of the ease of doing business ranking perform well not only on the Doing Business indicators but also in other international data sets capturing dimensions of competitiveness The economies performing best in the Doing Business rankings therefore are not those with no regulation but those whose governments have managed to create rules that facilitate interactions in the marketplace without needlessly hindering the development of the private sector The OECD s recent Future of Productivity report also suggests that regulatory burden in terms of stifling entry of new businesses harming innovation and productivity is relatively low in the United States compared with other countries 45 The United States is not included in the latest 2013 updates to the OECD s indicators on product market regulation but the 2008 data show the United States ranked second only to the Netherlands in terms of having the most market friendly least stringent or burdensome regulatory stance 46 In a recent article on the woes of the U S labor market in the Financial Times Martin Wolf contends that the troubles are not due to regulatory burden that the United States still has the least regulated labor market among all of the OECD countries including having a relatively low minimum wage 20 percent below UK levels in real terms in 2014 47Hassett and Shapiro refer to these regulatory stringency measures as providing relevant analogy in that they correlate with economic outcomes economic growth and investment 48 They describe the OECD s survey of individual governments asking approximately 1 400 questions the answers to which are combined and coded into a single quantitative score ranging from zero most market friendly to six least as a complicated procedure that might appear to have questionable empirical relevance to the macroeconomic differences among countries However the evidence shows they do have relevance They cite a paper by Alesina et al 2003 that found a statistically and economically significant negative relationship between the OECD measure of regulatory stringency and investment 49 Hassett and Shapiro explain the analogy strategy as follows It is our view that since the analysis of regulatory policy necessarily will require that an analyst draw from a large set of empirical analogies these macro econometric estimates can help researchers infer the likely direction and scale of a change in regulation In an ideal setting one could estimate how a given change in policy would change the index and then infer the likely impact on investment by drawing on the empirical literature Alternatively one could assemble micro analogies to the policy under consideration and then collect evidence on the plausibility of the scale of these effects by performing a thought experiment based on the OECD index 50Hassett and Shapiro also stress that regulatory policies often negatively impact economic activity particularly investment not so much because of the level of stringency of the rules per se but because of uncertainty about the nature and scope of the rules as they are anticipated to be finally written implemented and enforced They explain that A new regulation can have an especially destructive negative effect if it involves a threshold event that creates large incentives for investors to wait until an uncertainty is resolved Such a threshold event could occur for example when a regulator s actions are not consistent with his or her past actions and likely to be challenged in court Between the initial regulatory decision and the final resolution firms may radically reduce their affected investments 51This also explains Hassett and Shapiro s worry about net neutrality regulations discussed previously given the tremendous uncertainty about what the rules will finally be after all legal challenges have been resolved All of this suggests that although U S regulatory policies are not a huge burden on the U S economy in general and compared with other countries we could be doing better particularly in the execution and maintenance of regulations In theory we may know a lot about what makes for good regulations but in practice we are not optimizing Our regulations could be better designed and maintained to promote a more vibrant innovative and productive economy How can our nation do a better job at constructing and implementing sound regulation policies and avoiding cronyism including the Bootleggers Baptists problem and otherwise unwise or misguided policies Many researchers and research organizations U S and international have formulated guidelines for better regulatory policy All these recommendations focus on i better information that is the data and economic analysis the tools in the regulatory tool box that are used in the planning and evaluation of regulations ii better oversight and monitoring of the regulatory policy process and the institutions and people involved the regulators or the carpenters who build and maintain the regulations and iii better collaboration between and input from regulators and all stakeholders including businesses and the general public The 2012 OECD Regulatory Policy Committee recommendations52 of the Council On Regulatory Policy and Governance 2012 which built upon 2005 OECD Guiding Principles for Regulatory Quality and Performance 53 provide overarching recommendations on how to improve the quality of regulatory policy Those 12 recommendations are quoting with emphasis added Commit at the highest political level to an explicit whole of government policy for regulatory quality The policy should have clear objectives and frameworks for implementation to ensure that if regulation is used the economic social and environmental benefits justify the costs distributional effects are considered and the net benefits are maximised Adhere to principles of open government including transparency and participation in the regulatory process to ensure that regulation serves the public interest and is informed by the legitimate needs of those interested in and affected by regulation This includes providing meaningful opportunities including online for the public to contribute to the process of preparing draft regulatory proposals and to the quality of the supporting analysis Governments should ensure that regulations are comprehensible and clear and that parties can easily understand their rights and obligations Establish mechanisms and institutions to actively provide oversight of regulatory policy procedures and goals support and implement regulatory policy and thereby foster regulatory quality Integrate Regulatory Impact Assessment RIA into the early stages of the policy process for the formulation of new regulatory proposals Clearly identify policy goals and evaluate if regulation is necessary and how it can be most effective and efficient in achieving those goals Consider means other than regulation and identify the tradeoffs of the different approaches analysed to identify the best approach Conduct systematic programme reviews of the stock of significant regulation against clearly defined policy goals including consideration of costs and benefits to ensure that regulations remain up to date cost justified cost effective and consistent and deliver the intended policy objectives Regularly publish reports on the performance of regulatory policy and reform programmes and the public authorities applying the regulations Such reports should also include information on how regulatory tools such as Regulatory Impact Assessment RIA public consultation practices and reviews of existing regulations are functioning in practice Develop a consistent policy covering the role and functions of regulatory agencies in order to provide greater confidence that regulatory decisions are made on an objective impartial and consistent basis without conflict of interest bias or improper influence Ensure the effectiveness of systems for the review of the legality and procedural fairness of regulations and of decisions made by bodies empowered to issue regulatory sanctions Ensure that citizens and businesses have access to these systems of review at reasonable cost and receive decisions in a timely manner As appropriate apply risk assessment risk management and risk communication strategies to the design and implementation of regulations to ensure that regulation is targeted and effective Regulators should assess how regulations will be given effect and should design responsive implementation and enforcement strategies Where appropriate promote regulatory coherence through co ordination mechanisms between the supra national the national and sub national levels of government Identify cross cutting regulatory issues at all levels of government to promote coherence between regulatory approaches and avoid duplication or conflict of regulations Foster the development of regulatory management capacity and performance at sub national levels of government In developing regulatory measures give consideration to all relevant international standards and frameworks for co operation in the same field and where appropriate their likely effects on parties outside the jurisdiction The OECD s 2014 Framework for Regulatory Policy Evaluation focuses on evaluation practices in OECD countries and concrete examples of best practices 54 Chapter 1 provides insights from three expert papers chapter 2 describes the OECD framework for regulatory policy evaluation chapter 3 documents practices in regulatory policy evaluation across the OECD and chapter 4 describes the results of pilots for the framework in the Netherlands and Canada In their most recent October 2015 reports on regulatory policy Regulatory Policy in Perspective55 and OECD Regulatory Policy Outlook 201556 the OECD catalogs the knowledge to date on best regulatory practices and continued challenges with special focus on the use of regulatory impact assessment stakeholder engagement and ex post or retrospective evaluation They conclude that the ex ante evaluation of regulatory costs and benefits is well developed in the United States with the degree of evaluation efforts proportional to the anticipated impacts of the regulatory proposals They also note that the United States has institutionalized ex post evaluation via executive order discussed below but in terms of stakeholder engagement there is no mandatory requirement for consultation with the general public in the development or maintenance of primary laws calling for regulations initiated by Congress emphasis added a deeper discussion of the issues associated with retrospective review is presented in Appendix 2 The OECD indicators distinguish between primary laws and subordinate regulations statute can be changed only by another statute whereas regulations are subject to OMB OIRA executive review and a required public comment process In chapter 1 of the in Perspective volume written by Martin Lodge of the London School of Economics four main deficits in the current state of regulatory policy in OECD nations oversight participation incentive and adaptation are identified The scope of current U S regulatory policy rules and guidance and recent and current proposals for regulatory process reform are described in the Congressional Research Service report Cost Benefit and Other Analysis Requirements in the Rulemaking Process 57The federal government guidance on U S regulation policy writ large comes mostly from the U S Office of Management and Budget s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs OIRA 58address a compelling public need such as material failures of private markets be based on an assessment of all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives including the alternative of not regulating and maximize net benefits to society unless otherwise constrained by law This guidance requires that regulatory analysis be performed on all rules deemed to be of significant economic impact of 100 million or more in a year and that agencies submit such significant regulations for review by OIRA before publication in the Federal Register in proposed or final form OMB Circular A 460 whose most recent version was issued in September 2003 during the George W Bush Administration is essentially OMB s guidebook for federal agencies on how to do regulatory analysis i e what are best practices The 2003 version refined a prior guide developed in 1996 and published in 2000 The Obama Administration s E O 1356361 Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review January 18 2011 E O 1357962 Regulation and Independent Regulatory Agencies July 11 2011 and the latest E O 1361063 Identifying and Reducing Regulatory Burdens May 10 2012 all placed heavy emphasis on ex post retrospective analyses but only requested that regulatory agencies starting in 2011 develop a preliminary plan and then in 2012 take further steps to institutionalize regular assessments and promote public participation in retrospective review The Trump Administration s E O 1377164 Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs January 30 2017 specifies that to limit the costs associated with regulation at least two regulations must be eliminated for every one that is imposed For the current fiscal year 2017 each agency recommending a new regulation must identify at least two to be repealed Furthermore the total incremental cost of all new regulations for this fiscal year must be no more than zero including the reduction of cost from regulations that are repealed as determined by guidance issued by the Director of OMB Beginning next fiscal year 2018 the OMB Director shall create a regulatory cost budget to limit each agency s incremental net cost again taking into account regulations that are eliminated The Executive Order makes no reference to the benefits that accrue from any regulations including those that are recommended for imposition or repeal Logically if only costs are considered then every existing regulation should be eliminated and no new regulations should be imposed Presumably this logical inconsistency will somehow be dealt with in the guidance issued by the OMB Director Legislation relating to oversight of regulatory policy as described on pages 46 47 in the Dudley primer that has passed since CED s 1998 report includes the following The Congressional Review Act of 1996 CRA contained in the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 allows the Congress to overturn regulations within a specified time through a resolution of disapproval Because such a resolution would be subject to a presidential veto and with a presumption that a president would support his own regulation with a veto the CRA garnered little attention However the CRA also requires each agency issuing a regulation to submit a report to the Congress and the deadline for a resolution of disapproval occurs after the report is filed Because the requirement for a report may have been ignored in some instances a new administration hostile to such a regulation could file a report on a regulation issued at any time after the CRA was enacted and thereby empower the Congress to pass a resolution of disapproval The Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999 section 638 a requires OMB to report to Congress yearly on the costs and benefits of regulations and to provide recommendations for reform The Truth in Regulating Act of 2000 gives Congress authority to request that the GAO conduct an independent evaluation of economically significant rules at the proposed or final stages The Information Quality Act of 2000 requires OMB to develop government wide standards for ensuring and maximizing the quality of information disseminated by federal agencies Recent legislative proposals from the 114th Congress calendar years 2015 and 2016 for better regulatory policy practice fall into two general categories as sorted in Susan Dudley s September 2015 testimony 65 Proposals before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee either i improve analysis for decision making before regulations are issued and ii institutionalize retrospective review of regulations after they are put in place discussed in detail later On the former S 1818 the Principled Rulemaking Act would codify the language of President Clinton s Executive Order 12866 and President Obama s Executive Order 13563 66 This would give congressional support to the EO s nonpartisan principles could be applied to independent agencies and would make compliance with legislative requirements subject to judicial review S 1820 the Early Participation in Regulation Act of 2015 would require agencies to publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking ANPR at least 90 days before publishing a proposed major rule 67 This would be valuable to solicit input from stakeholders before decisions are made S 1607 the Independent Agency Regulatory Analysis Act would explicitly authorize the president to require that independent regulatory agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission the Federal Communications Commission and the Consumer Product Safety Commission comply with regulatory analysis requirements 68 Currently the analyses supporting regulations issued by independent agencies tend to be less robust The Administrative Conference of the United States recommended in 2013 Benefit Cost Analysis at independent Regulatory Agencies that independent regulatory agencies adopt more transparent and rigorous regulatory analysis practices for major rules 69 according to government data cited in the Dudley testimony more than 40 percent of the rules developed by independent agencies over the past 10 years provided no information on either the costs or the benefits expected from their implementation 70 Additionally the recently House passed pending in Senate H R 26 and S 21 Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny REINS Act also focuses on documenting and considering the economic costs of regulations before they are put in place The legislation Revises provisions relating to congressional review of agency rulemaking to require a federal agency promulgating a rule to publish information about the rule in the Federal Register and include in its report to Congress and to the Government Accountability Office GAO a classification of the rule as a major or non major rule and a complete copy of the cost benefit analysis of the rule including an analysis of any jobs added or lost differentiating between public and private sector jobs Defines major rule as any rule that is made under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or that the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget finds has resulted in or is likely to result in 1 an annual effect on the economy of 100 million or more 2 a major increase in costs or prices for consumers individual industries federal state or local government agencies or geographic regions or 3 significant adverse effects on competition employment investment productivity innovation or the ability of U S based enterprises to compete with foreign based enterprises But we conclude that there has been disproportionate emphasis on greater scrutiny of new regulations based on the common presumption that there is too much regulation overall at perhaps the price of too little effort toward expanding the practice of retrospective review and too little recognition that regulations may be suboptimal in a variety of ways in the variety of cases that evolve over time As the world changes including but not limited to advances in technology regulations even those based on principles rather than narrow specific rules can become obsolete and even counterproductive It is not surprising that scholars of regulation around the world have cited retrospective review as one of the areas where other nations have made advances and the United States while still a world leader has lost some of its comparative edge We believe that our nation must invest more in continuing review of its stock of regulations and in the data and other resources to support it That does not determine precisely what organization should perform such review We are skeptical that an analytical body of a sufficient size and strength could be created within the Congress Retrospective review must rely heavily on the street level body of knowledge and information already resident within the executive agencies and with the associated leadership resources in OIRA However we also are concerned that the instincts of self justification within those agencies the reflex to defend the judgments taken by those same executive offices in the past could prevent objective retrospective review Still the success of self review at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration documented below demonstrates that open minded self criticism can be achieved even more so with the expertise and leadership at OIRA with the President s own authority and the persuasive power of his budget office behind it One way to circumvent any tendencies of agencies to be closed mindedly defensive about their own regulations in any review process would be either to expand the resources of OIRA so that it could have a separate shop that focuses of retrospective review Alternatively a new and independent office could take on that responsibility What would not work is requiring existing staff at OIRA or the agencies already required to assure the quality of new regulations also to take on the responsibility for retrospective review Both functions would suffer beyond any self protective instinct in the retrospective review function The office charged with retrospective review could select existing regulations for the earliest review guided by priorities set by the Congress Those priorities could include the significance of the regulations as measured by the cost impact in dollar terms and the length of time that the regulations have been in force as well as the degree of public demand solicited through the current comment process We see this function as an ongoing challenge of regulation so we do not see the government institution to fulfill the function as a one time temporary commission with unpaid citizen members The Congress must play a stronger role in regulation There is always the potential for a costly Catch 22 dilemma for the executive should a less than fully informed Congress mandate the creation of a new regulation that must pass a cost benefit test while imposing conditions such that the creation of such a regulation is impossible The Congress does need more expertise to ensure that the legal foundations that it builds for future regulations are sound So better creation and ex post review of regulation will cost money It is important that the nation not swallow whole the fallacy that more resources for regulators mean more regulation It must be made to mean better regulation It can mean better data to facilitate stronger and more frequent review and therefore the cleaning out or improvement of obsolete or deficient regulations that otherwise would evade scrutiny All that is needed is the leadership and the understanding to make that happen It is imperative for a dynamic prosperous economy State and local governments lack capacity even more than the federal government to collect and analyze data on regulation merits and effectiveness Federal government analysts can inform and support regulatory policy practices at the state level particularly as some recompense for mandates on state and local governments that get passed along from federal government via federal regulations and fiscal policies An example is the Obama Administration s paper on best practices state level occupational licensing mentioned earlier in the section on crony capitalism On the other hand states and localities have better ground level hands on information and familiarity about the activities and industries they are regulating The federal government can learn from state experiences too Variation in state and local level regulatory policies and practices can provide an opportunity to learn about the economic effects of alternative strategies NYU Schwartz s study 2010 provides a comprehensive look across the states in terms of regulatory review practices Where little federal level variation in regulatory policies has taken place over time making the gathering of an evidence base challenging state and local level variation provides a natural way of controlling for other identifiable and measurable factors and estimating the effects of alternative policy specifications Researchers should be circumspect however about lessons that might not be so transferable and applicable going from one level of government to another For companies that do business in all 50 states plus DC the 52nd referenced by Schwartz is Puerto Rico the variety of state level regulations makes regulatory burden and red tape all the more costly How well aligned are regulations across states Or should they be aligned at all What makes certain types of regulatory policy more appropriately administered at the federal versus the state level How much progress has been made in regulatory policy and governance since CED s 1998 statement The one recommendation where some progress has been made is the earlier statement s recommendation number 6 more retrospective review of regulations but only in that more executive orders calling for it but not quite demanding it have been issued not because of any marked improvement in actual practice We largely agree with the recent conclusions of the Council on Foreign Relations proposals for regulatory reform should continue to emphasize better ongoing evaluation and oversight of regulatory policy that might be directed guided and even conducted outside the executive branch regulatory agencies themselves A deeper discussion of regulatory governance is included in Appendix 3 But today it is also important to consider whether the cronyism including Bootleggers and Baptists problem is more or less likely in the legislative versus executive branches recognizing that unelected bureaucrats are perhaps less likely to be so influenced by money in politics issues including campaign contributions than elected members of Congress are Who in the executive branch and who in the legislative branch would best be given the responsibility for unbiased evaluations of regulations and how can we best keep cronyism and special interests away from regulatory analyses and decision making At the same time policymakers will need to devote adequate resources to whichever entities are charged with conducting these impartial analyses to make sure that such evaluations can be done in a comprehensive systematic effective and yet timely and cost efficient manner CED Reaction to Policy RecommendationsThere is no question from our own observation as well as the judgments of the OECD and the World Bank that U S regulatory processes and practices could be improved We find some of the ideas in the literature highly promising others less so At the headline level we have already noted that approval of any regulation is at least an implicit assertion that its benefits exceed its costs We believe that to the greatest possible degree comparison of costs and benefits should be explicit We recognize that cost benefit analysis can be extraordinarily challenging and believe that sound cost benefit analysis in a world of uncertainty should make all of its assumptions explicit and should provide alternative upper and lower bound estimates of its key components We also believe that our proposed retrospective review should allow reconsideration on the basis of those sensitivity analyses We believe that such cost benefit analysis is the gold standard of the regulatory process We fear that some alternative decision rules however well meaning might yield inferior outcomes For example an aggregate regulatory budget or regulatory cost cap could yield perverse results A new regulation with benefits exceeding costs could be rejected by an aggregate regulatory cost cap or budget But at the same time old regulations whose costs exceeded their benefits would be protected against a cost cap or budget solely because of their incumbency Similarly a regulatory pay as you go rule which required repealing one regulation before imposing another could delay a fully justified regulation Another global approach to regulation is a sunset requirement such that all regulations would automatically expire unless reaffirmed through some formal process We fear that a well meaning mandatory sunset requirement would soak up considerable resources to reimpose justified and uncontroversial regulations resources that would better be devoted to the difficult and more important issues In short a regulatory cost cap or budget a cut as you go requirement or mandatory sunsetting rules all seem to be second or third best alternatives to a basic fundamental policy of rigorous cost benefit analysis and retrospective review If we were assured that those basics were unattainable we would consider falling back on the second best alternatives But we see no reason to declare pre emptive surrender on the most sound options available to our regulatory system There are other recommendations that we find highly appealing We believe that even statutorily independent regulatory agencies should be subject to the same process and review requirements as the line executive regulatory agencies Independent does not mean alien We believe that early public input should be solicited and given careful consideration We also align ourselves with the governance principles in the 2014 OECD report 71This CED review of U S regulatory policy leads to the following key takeaways and recommendations Economically wise regulation policy is easier in theory than in practice The problem of biased inefficient and outdated regulations could be better avoided if policymakers would pursue an overarching strategy of favoring principles based over rules based regulation which would be more immune to special interest hijacking and manipulation Measurement challenges and resource constraints continue to prevent adequate levels and quality of both ex ante and ex post retrospective evaluation of regulations to ensure that policies are beneficial and optimal The United States is doing better at ex ante justification but could and should strive to do more monitoring and evaluation of regulations after they are put in place Some other countries have surpassed the United States in regulatory management in this regard Federal regulations go on auto pilot without regular scrutiny a lot like mandatory spending and tax expenditures and in contrast to discretionary annually appropriated spending Charging an agency with retrospectively evaluating regulations might be one way to better reevaluate regulations ensure regulations continue to serve their intended purpose and monitor regulations to catch any sub optimal drift in their performance over time The independent body in charge of reevaluation of regulations could be charged with criteria to order the existing stock of regulations for review But we believe this to be a permanent function of looking for regulations that have fallen behind the changing times not a once for all housecleaning Toward the goal of more regular scrutiny of regulations a reinvigoration of the congressional reauthorization process is needed Legislators need more resources so that they can develop realistic standards for new regulations and can pay better attention to the function and performance of regulations after they are put in place too More and better data on the effects of regulatory policies are needed This has been recommended for decades but we really should be doing better now that the costs of collecting maintaining and analyzing data in real time have come down and will continue to decline rapidly At the same time funding for the statistical agencies should be preserved and enhanced to take advantage of the increasing productivity of investments in data More sharing and disclosure of information with stakeholders and the public more transparency is needed Regulatory policy making should involve other parts and levels of government and the public not just the federal executive agencies Increased stakeholder participation will shed light on and help avoid inefficient regulations that benefit special interests over the public interest These recommendations continue the spirit of our 1998 recommendations Unlike our recommendations in 1998 however we now put less emphasis on Congress doing the heavy lifting We also conclude that no matter who is in charge of developing and maintaining regulations the regulations will be more supportive of the economy and the public interest as well as more sustainable over time if based on broadly defined commonly agreed upon economic principles rather than narrowly defined technical rules If we are to improve the regulatory policymaking process and the ultimate quality and effectiveness of the regulations themselves we will need to determine which entities are best able to consider construct administer and review regulations in ways that help businesses the economy and our society See a more detailed discussion of issues of stakeholder involvement in Appendix 4 Reorienting our approach to regulation in this way will help to achieve our goal of regulations that are better justified and regularly monitored reevaluated and scrutinized to be economically smarter not just administratively simpler Principles based regulation is not an original idea Following are some valuable contributions from the recent literature Frantz and Instefjord 2014 72 present an academic theoretical paper on rules versus principles based financial regulation They explain that with regulatory competition and race to the bottom where regulators compete for businesses by watering down principles to nothing principles based strategies can essentially be captured by special interests and thus preferred by firms Without regulatory competition however special interests firms prefer rules based systems where the cost of ambiguity is borne by society They go on to explain that We study the relative strengths and weaknesses of principles based and rules based systems of regulation In the principles based systems there is clarity about the regulatory objectives but the process of reverse engineer ing these objectives into meaningful compliance at the firm level is ambiguous whereas in the rules based systems there is clarity about the compliance process but the process of forward engineer this into regulatory objectives is also ambiguous The ambiguity leads to social costs the level of which is influenced by regulatory competition Regulatory competition leads to a race to the bottom effect which is more harmful under the principles based systems Regulators applying principles based systems make dramatic changes in the way they regulate faced with regulatory competition whereas regulators applying rules based systems make less dramatic changes making principles based regulation less robust than rules based regulation Firms prefer a rules based system where the cost of ambiguity is borne by society rather than the firms however when faced with regulatory competition they are better off in principles based systems if the direct costs to firms is sufficiently small We discuss these effects in the light of recent observations Arnold Kling s 2012 AEI piece Why We Need Principles Based Regulation 73 argues When we think of regulation we think of specific rules that spell out the boundaries between what is approved and what is forbidden For example requiring credit card issuers to give 45 days notice prior to a rate increase I call this bright line regulation BLR What I want to propose is an alternative approach called principles based regulation PBR With PBR legislation would lay out broad but well defined principles that businesses are expected to follow Administrative agencies would audit businesses to identify strengths and weaknesses in their systems for applying those principles and they would punish weaknesses by imposing fines Finally the Department of Justice would prosecute corporate leaders who flagrantly violate principles or who are negligent in ensuring compliance with those principles The banks will always be savvier than the consumers and nimbler than the regulators so bright line regulation is bound to fail James Surowiecki74 wrote skeptically about the approach as advocated in April 2008 by Henry Paulson then Treasury Secretary with Surowiecki sniffing But the best principles in the world won t help much if those in charge aren t willing to enforce them They go on to say As with any regulatory approach principles based regulation must be well executed in order to work A key element is that the principles should have clear meaning They cannot be vague as in the United Kingdom where one finds principles like A firm must observe proper standards of market conduct or A firm must conduct its business with integrity To me those are not principles They are just glittering generalities that offer no concrete guidance to a firm Businesses often use internal mission statements and lists of principles as a tool to align employees with the goals of top management However in many instances the statements are so general that they have no implications for any particular way of conducting business The truly meaningful statements of corporate philosophy are those that provide strong signals of what type of business directions the firm will and will not take Similarly for PBR to work the principles have to clarify rather than obfuscate Legislative commentary should include specific examples of conduct that falls outside of the principles in order to provide further guidance Principles based regulation is not a cure all There are many regulatory problems that are better addressed with bright line regulation For example the algorithm for calculating the Annual Percentage Rate of interest should be standardized and clearly specified by regulators And any regulatory system will have gaps and flaws After all those who design and implement regulations are as human as the people who run the businesses that they regulate But in an increasingly complex and fast paced market environment there are likely to be many regulatory issues where principles based regulation will prove to be more robust Burgemeestre et al 2009 75 Rule based versus Principle based Regulatory Compliance is a thorough analysis of the different approaches and points out that for the case of customs regulations the United States tends to follow the rules based approach while the EU practices the principles based approach There is an ongoing debate in law and accounting about the relative merits of principle based versus rule based regulatory systems In this paper we characterize what kind of reasoning underlies the two styles of regulation We adapt an original account of Verheij et al 1998 to take aspects of the implementation context into account such as the process of adoption of a new norm and the roles of the participants The model is validated by a comparison between EU and US customs regulations intended to enhance safety and security in international trade The EU regulations AEO self assessment are essentially principle based whereas the American system C TPAT is rule based Black et al 2007 in Law and Financial Markets Review76 Black is with London School of Economics Making a success of Principles based regulation explain The UK Financial Services Authority FSA leads the way in the development of Principles based regulation of the financial services industry It is proposing a significant shift towards reliance on broadly stated Principles rather than more detailed rules The implications of a more Principles based approach for regulators those regulated by the FSA and those whose interests the regulatory regime is designed to protect are the subject of ongoing dialogue The potential benefits claimed of using Principles are that they provide flexibility are more likely to produce behavior which fulfils the regulatory objectives and are easier to comply with Detailed rules it is often claimed provide certainty a clear standard of behavior and are easier to apply consistently and without retrospectivity However they can lead to gaps inconsistencies rigidity and are prone to creative compliance to the need for constant adjustment to new situations and to the ratchet syndrome as more rules are created to address new problems or close new gaps creating more gaps and so on Blog by Northwestern University law professor Harlan Loeb 2015 77 on Principles Based Regulation and Compliance A Framework for Sustainable Integrity provides a useful illustration of the problem of absence of principles based regulation and the General Motors GM ignition switch recall They explain Because most global companies concentrate on making their systems operate as efficiently and functional as possible they can lack the agility and appropriate mindset to navigate and manage reputational risk and its underlying drivers with alacrity Compounding the challenge can be corporate dependence on rules based compliance systems to manage risk These are situations in which agents are motivated by incentives that reflect legal regulatory and political constraints rather than and frequently at the expense of moral and ethical imperatives Professor Caroline Kaeb at the University Connecticut Business School concludes that rules based compliance systems possess far greater hidden costs that prevent maximum compliance at a level of economic efficiency In addition rules based systems often pose design challenges Their rules are over or under inclusive Therefore they are unsustainable since global risk has become fragmented and increasingly qualitative simultaneously They go on to describe the recent problems experienced by General Motors The recent compliance crisis surrounding GM s ignition switch recall failure underscores the implications from the organizational absence of a principles based regulation culture A Wall Street Journal78 commentator points to the root cause of this high profile compliance failure as a culture of silence at GM GM s compliance system defied well established behavioral insights by not relying on the individual as the agent for principles based compliance and integrity but rather ignoring and allegedly even silencing the individual in the organization Many regulatory policy experts across the political spectrum call for better review of regulations after they are put in place to get rid of stale outdated and inefficient regulations The findings from ex post retrospective reviews could also serve to validate ex ante assessments Susan Dudley provides a concise retrospective review of retrospective review in a May 2013 brief for George Washington University s Regulatory Studies Center with an overview of the history and current status of the practice as well as arguments for more of it Michael Mandel and Diana Carew of the Progressive Policy Institute in a May 2013 report wrote of the adverse effects of regulatory accumulation the natural buildup of regulations over time on economic growth and its disproportionate burden on small businesses in terms of the hurdles to business formation hiring of workers and expansion of product markets They describe three types of regulatory accumulation i pebbles in a stream where too many regulations in the aggregate cause a blockage effect that increases costs and slows innovation ii interaction between small numbers of existing regulations intended or not obvious or not that raise costs for businesses and iii behavioral overload that forces management to prioritize compliance with regulations over growth and innovation Multiple presidents from both parties and with increasing emphasis over time have pushed for greater retrospective review of regulations via executive orders Yet retrospective review of the cumulative effects of regulation is not commonly practiced because it is time consuming analytically challenging expensive staff and data intensive and difficult to operationalize in an effective and impartial manner In a working paper for George Mason University s Mercatus Center The Role of Retrospective Analysis and Review in Regulatory Policy Randall Lutter 2012 observed that the most prominent practitioner of retrospective analyses is apparently the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA which has completed at the time of his writing 92 separate evaluations of the costs and the effectiveness of various facets of its regulatory program since 1973 and describes examples of specific retrospective analyses and the insights that were gained Lutter praises the NHTSA for the unusual rigor of their analyses and their apparent comfort with self criticism which sets the agency apart He speculates that this may stem from the NHTSA s engineering culture and unparalleled access to timely and high quality data both not the case in most other regulatory agencies which encourages the practice of data driven decision making rather than ex post data supported policy advocacy Lutter s paper also describes how the data driven NHTSA practices the most rigorous forms of analyses of their own regulations both prospectively and retrospectively He mentions a 1998 detailed reappraisal a quintessential retrospective review of the cost and effectiveness of the 1983 rule mandating center high mounted stop lamps on cars and light trucks and the original prospective study that had randomly assigned vehicles to have the special stop lamps under consideration Such use of randomized controlled trials as a means of informing regulatory policymaking and retrospective review is championed by former OIRA Administrator Cass Sunstein in a 2014 paper on The Regulatory Lookback Harvard Kennedy School But for the vast majority of regulatory agencies that aren t naturally so data driven in the development and administration of their regulations further efforts to emphasize and institutionalize retrospective review are needed Recently several legislative proposals for regulatory reform have been introduced as discussed in Susan Dudley s testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on 9 16 15 S 708 the Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015 sponsored by Sen Angus King Independent from Maine would establish a Regulatory Improvement Commission responsible for evaluating regulations that have been in effect for at least 10 years and making recommendations for their modification consolidation or repeal Congress would vote up or down on a full package of recommendations and federal agencies would have 180 days to implement the approved set of actions S 1683 the SCRUB Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act of 2015 sponsored by Sen Orrin Hatch Republican from Utah would establish a Retrospective Regulatory Review Commission to review and make recommendations to repeal rules or sets of rules that have been in effect more than 15 years Congress would approve the full package of recommendations via joint resolution The Commission s report would include estimated costs of the reviewed rules and would sort the most burdensome rules into two categories cut immediately or save for later cuts Agencies would be required to repeal rules in the first category within 60 days of the joint resolution s approval and as new regulations are issued agencies would be required to cut as they go or cut go and repeal rules in the second category to offset the costs of new regulations S 1817 the Smarter Regulations through Advance Planning and Review Act of 2015 sponsored by Sen Heidi Heitkamp Democrat from North Dakota would promote an evaluation mindset and require agencies to be forward looking and include in proposed major regulations a framework for measuring effectiveness benefits and costs and plans for gathering the information necessary to do so It would require assessment to take place within 10 years of a rule s promulgation to measure benefits and costs evaluate how well the rule accomplishes its objectives and determine whether the rule could be modified to achieve better outcomes These proposals are explicitly supported by former OIRA Administrator Susan Dudley and implicitly achieve policy goals laid out by many other regulatory policy experts The regulatory commission idea is modeled by Mandel Carew 2013 after the Base Realignment and Closing BRAC Commission Their conception is that The Regulatory Improvement C ommission would consist of eight members appointed by the President and Congress who after a formal regulatory review would submit a list of 15 20 regulatory changes to Congress for an up or down vote Congressional approval would be required for the changes to take effect but Congress would only be able to vote on the package as a whole without making any adjustments 80The current practice for retrospective review is regulatory agency self review which Mandel and Carew state is problematic because it is costly and time consuming for the agencies to review regulations already in place and agencies have little incentive to be self critical The Government Accountability Office GAO in April 2014 GAO 14 268 reported on the progress of agency retrospective reviews conducted over the 2011 13 period GAO found that agencies had made some progress in the practice of retrospective review and that the reviews often made a difference in bringing about improvements to the clarity and effectiveness of regulations and in reducing the burden on regulated entities probably taken as referring to compliance costs This is illustrated in Figure 6 But GAO also concluded that more guidance from OIRA was needed to improve the transparency and usefulness of the information to policymakers and the general public and to strengthen the links between retrospective analyses and the regulatory agencies performance and priority goals The GAO report identified the major strategies and barriers that affect agency implementation of retrospective analyses Strategies i establish a centrally coordinated review process to develop review plans ii leverage existing regulatory activities to identify needed changes iii use existing feedback mechanisms to identify and evaluate regulatory reforms and iv facilitate tracking of reviews and interagency discussion and collaboration on best practices Barriers i competing priorities hinder agencies ability to conduct retrospective analyses ii agencies reported difficulty obtaining sufficient data to identify improvements attributed to regulations and iii deciphering and analyzing data to be able to attribute effects to regulations vs other factors is difficult In his testimony that dissents from Susan Dudley s positions on the merits of current legislative proposals for retrospective review Sidney Shapiro states that the regulatory system has become out of balance with a hugely cumbersome and time consuming rulemaking process taking five years or longer and that the one size fits all requirements that would be imposed by the proposed bills discussed threaten to exacerbate the problem He argues that what is needed to make the regulatory policy process function more efficiently is to provide more resources and legal authority to the regulatory agencies themselves and to free them from unnecessary analytical requirements So some approaches that would help put retrospective review into better practice are Data need to be collected as regulations go along not long after the fact Agencies need to be forced to or more strongly encouraged to analyze data at regular intervals and in an impartial manner The regulatory system needs to better provide and align resources and incentives to undertake and enforce retrospective review Who is responsible for designing and implementing regulations and can that person or entity be trusted to pursue and enforce economically beneficial regulatory policy Can we better avoid regulatory capture and cronyism and the strange bedfellows of Bootleggers and Baptists Regulation policy experts including former OIRA Administrator Susan Dudley such as in her 2015 Case Western Reserve Law Review article and the OECD have some recommendations on improving regulatory process to keep it impartial transparent to stakeholders and the public comprehensive broadly applicable without special exemptions and free of cronyism or capture of regulators by special interests The OECD s 2014 The Governance of Regulators OECD Best Practice Principles for Regulatory Policy established seven principles for the governance of regulators emphasis is added where the principles most align with CED s objectives and role Role clarity An effective regulator must have clear objectives with clear and linked functions and the mechanisms to coordinate with other relevant bodies to achieve the desired regulatory outcomes Preventing undue influence and maintaining trust It is important that regulatory decisions and functions are conducted with the upmost integrity to ensure that there is confidence in the regulatory regime This is even more important for ensuring the rule of law encouraging investment and having an enabling environment for inclusive growth built on trust Decision making and governing body structure for independent regulators Regulators require governance arrangements that ensure their effective functioning preserve its regulatory integrity and deliver the regulatory objectives of its mandate Accountability and transparency Businesses and citizens expect the delivery of regulatory outcomes from government and regulatory agencies and the proper use of public authority and resources to achieve them Regulators are generally accountable to three groups of stakeholders i ministers and the legislature ii regulated entities and iii the public Engagement Good regulators have established mechanisms for engagement with stakeholders as part of achieving their objectives The knowledge of regulated sectors and the businesses and citizens affected by regulatory schemes assists to regulate effectively Funding The amount and source of funding for a regulator will determine its organization and operations It should not influence the regulatory decisions and the regulator should be enabled to be impartial and efficient to achieve its objectives Performance evaluation It is important that regulators are aware of the impacts of their regulatory actions and decisions This helps drive improvements and enhance systems and processes internally It also demonstrates the effectiveness of the regulator to whom it is accountable and helps to build confidence in the regulatory system Stakeholder engagement is an important ingredient in the good governance of regulators Steven J Balla and Susan E Dudley 2014 in a report for the OECD on Stakeholder Participation and Regulatory Policymaking in the United States 81 a summary graphic is provided in Figure 7 identify the different ways stakeholders can participate in the regulatory policymaking process Advances in online technology have certainly allowed more of the general public to become aware of regulations both proposed and in place and submit comments about them via the regulations gov website Managed by the eRulemaking Program Management Office in partnership with regulatory agencies and the OMB Regulations gov is your source for information on the development of Federal regulations and other related documents issued by the U S government Through this site you can find read and comment on regulatory issues that are important to you Balla and Dudley also describe how advances in internet technology and access have inspired some non profit and academic institutions to develop their own innovative approaches to interfacing with stakeholders and the general public regarding regulatory policy But despite the recent progress Balla and Dudley conclude that the current state of stakeholder participation in rulemaking is mostly a one way street Descriptions of regulatory policies in the pipeline are provided to the public and comments are solicited but there is little evidence that feedback collected via public comment is systematically accounted for in actual decision making Our review demonstrates that there are extensive opportunities for stakeholder participation at all stages of the regulatory process These opportunities however are typically oriented toward facilitating the provision of information on the part of stakeholders Instruments of participation in other words do not generally advance stakeholder engagement in deliberative decision making where deliberation is characterized by reflection on positions held by others and the possibility of changes in one s own preferences as a result of such reflection The Administrative Conference of the United States Petitions for Rulemaking identifies agency procedures and best practices for accepting processing and responding to petitions for rulemaking It seeks to ensure that the public s right to petition is meaningful while still respecting the need for agencies to

consider the potential impacts of rapid technological changeMinister of finance Grant Robertson has asked the Productivity Commission to examine and report on technological change disruption and the future of work in a project to be undertaken jointly with the Australian Productivity Commission The move follows the launch last August of a joint Australia NZ project focused on growing the digital economy and maximising opportunities for small and medium sized enterprises The minister said the commission had been asked to consider the potential impacts of rapid technological change and its impact on the future of work and the workforce in New Zealand to help inform future government policy so the opportunities presented by disruptive technologies for economic productivity and social prosperity could be realised and the risks managed The commission said its earlier joint project had been designed to explore how institutional and regulatory settings in the two countries could support the use of digital technology and in particular how small and medium enterprises could maximise the opportunities from digital transformation NZ Productivity Commission director Judy Kavanagh said the joint report had highlighted the challenges and opportunities presented by the digital economy In this new mandate the commission will provide recommendations that will help manage the likely impacts of wider technological disruption and change on the future of work the workforce labour markets productivity and wellbeing She said the commission s work would be informed by the knowledge and insights of all sectors of the economy and society The Commission will be speaking with public bodies unions businesses academics and other interested parties to better understand the impacts of technological change on the future of work In his instructions to the commission Robertson said well designed and coordinated government responses could allow New Zealand to fully realise the potential of disruptive technologies for economic productivity and social prosperity improve the services provided by government and increase the efficiency and effectiveness with which government functions He said it would also enable the Government to provide an enabling environment without unnecessary barriers to desirable change while effectively managing risks and help to prepare New Zealand for any rapid labour displacement and distributional impacts Given the uncertainty around future technology and its impact the inquiry is not expected to make detailed quantified predictions of impacts Robertson said Rather it should give a sense of the nature and relative scale of impacts in different scenarios The inquiry should have a long term focus with recommendations that can be implemented in the short to medium term It should provide a resource for government to develop policies and programmes that make the most of the technological opportunities on offer and allow New Zealanders to face an uncertain future with confidence The Commission s final report to the Government is due on 31 March 2020 Sign up to gain exclusive access to email subscriptions event invitations

DEBUG:root:WRITTEN BY Charlie Tierney Steve Cottle Katie JorgensenWind back the clock to 1971 Jane a freshly minted college graduate joins the government as a clerk Jane s work consists largely of entering information into databases and creating reports which requires her to spend the better part of her work day seated at a terminal near a mainframe computer that fills an entire room Jane and her colleagues are expected to be at their desks from 9 a m to 5 p m five days a week Jane is grateful to have a steady 9 to 5 job and plans to spend her entire career with her agency Flash forward 40 years and meet Jane s grandson Ian He carries a slim tablet wherever he goes which has more computing power than the mainframe with which Jane worked Ian is constantly tethered to the Internet and works 24 7 from wherever he is Ian expects to switch from project to project and office to office as his career develops and his interests evolve If he feels he has reached the limit of his ability to learn or grow in one role he will look elsewhere for a new opportunity What if the government could give Ian the opportunities and experiences he seeks The GovCloud concept proposed in this paper would restructure government workforces in a way that takes advantage of the talents and preferences of workers like Ian who are entering the workforce today The model is based on a large body of research from interviews with public and private sector experts to best practices from innovative organizations both public and private This is the first generation of people that work play think and learn differently than their parents They are the first generation to not be afraid of technology It s like the air to them Don Tapscott author of Grown Up DigitalThis report details trends in work and technology that offer significant opportunities for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the government workforce It lays out the GovCloud model explaining how governments could be organized to take advantage of its flexibility It examines how work would be performed in the new model and discusses potential changes to government HR programs to support GovCloud Other sections provide resources for executives including a tool to help determine cloud eligibility steps they can take to pilot the cloud concept and future scenarios illustrating the cloud in action The GovCloud model represents a dramatic departure from the status quo It is bound to be greeted with some skepticism Without such innovation however governments will be left to confront the challenges of tomorrow with the workforce structure of yesterday The details of the GovCloud model are open for debate The purpose of this paper is to jumpstart that debate Forty years ago more than half of employed American adults worked in either blue collar or clerical jobs Today less than 40 percent work in these same categories and the share continues to shrink 1 Jobs requiring routine or manual tasks are disappearing while those requiring complex communication skills and expert thinking are becoming the norm 2 Increasingly employers seek workers capable of creative and knowledge based work We should ask ourselves whether we re truly satisfied with the status quo Are our workday lives so fulfilling and our organizations so boundlessly capable that it s now pointless to long for something better Gary Hamel author of The Future of ManagementThe next generation of creative knowledge workers has already entered the job market These Millennials came of age in a rapidly and radically changing world They are the first true digital natives They have grown up with instant access to information through technology As such Millennials have considerably different expectations for the kind of work they do and the information they use The pursuit for variety in work has led Millennials to cite simply needing a change as their top reason for switching jobs 3Advances in technology have also changed the actual ways in which people perform work The ability to crowdsource tasks is one example of this change Since its founding in 2001 volunteers have produced and contributed to over 19 million articles in 281 languages on Wikipedia 4 Built around this concept a burgeoning industry is developing around microtasking dividing work up into small tasks that can be farmed out to workers Amazon s Mechanical Turk rolled out in 2005 allows users to post tasks to a platform where registered workers can accept and complete them for a small fee When this paper was written more than 195 000 tasks were available on Mechanical Turk 5Such technologies may offer suitable possibilities for the public sector Microtask a Finnish cloud labor company maintains Digitalkoot a program that helps the Finnish National Library convert its image archives into digital text and correct existing errors It does so with volunteered labor participants simply play a game in which they are shown the image of a word and then must type it out to help a cartoon character cross a bridge In doing so they are turning scanned images into searchable text greatly improving the search accuracy of old manuscripts 6 At present more than 100 000 people have completed over 6 million microtasks associated with this project 7As the pace of computing power and machine learning increases professors Frank Levy and Richard Murnane contend that more tasks will move from human to computer processing 8 Skeptics need look no further than IBM s Watson a computer that can answer questions posed in natural language In February 2011 Watson defeated two all time champions of the quiz show Jeopardy This was not solely a publicity stunt IBM hopes to sell Watson to hospitals and call centers to help them answer questions from the public 9Around the globe more and more governments are looking to increase telework among employees In 2010 the U S government passed legislation calling for more telework opportunities for government employees Likewise the Australian government in order to attract and retain information and communications technology workers instituted a teleworking policy in 2009 requiring agencies to implement flexible work plans 10 Other countries including Norway and Germany are also focusing on flexible work arrangements to improve public sector recruiting 11 In Canada the government has an official telework policy that recognizes changes are occurring in the public service workforce with a shift towards more knowledge workers and encourages departments to implement telework arrangements 12Cloud definitionsCloud computing Internet based computing whereby shared resources software and information are provided to computers and other devices on demand like

or community through an open call to a large group of people a crowd asking for contributions WikipediaGovCloud A new model for government based on team collaboration whereby workforce resources can be surged to provide services to government agencies on demand GovLabSource Frank Levy and Richard J Murnane The New Division of Labor How Computers are Creating the Next Job Market Princeton Princeton University Press 2004 p 50 Figure 1 Trends in routine and non routine tasks in the U S 1960 200213These are all powerful steps in the right direction for employees whose natural work rhythms are not locked into 9 to 5 Some companies have taken telework one step further British Telecom is pushing the concept of agile working through its Workstyle Project where employees decide what work arrangements best suit them rather than a rigid definition by location and hours BT Workstyle is one of the largest flexible working projects in Europe with over 11 000 home based workers BT has found that its home enabled employees are on average 20 percent more productive than their office based colleagues 14Similarly U S electronics retailer Best Buy experimented with a Results Only Work Environment ROWE In a ROWE what matters is not whether employees are in their office but rather that they complete their work and achieve measurable outcomes In a ROWE salaried employees must put in as much time as is actually needed to do their work no more no less The decline in routine and manual tasks and the rise of new ways of working is not isolated to the private sector In 1950 the U S federal workforce largely comprised clerks performing repetitive tasks About 62 percent performed these tasks while only 11 percent performed more white collar work By 2000 those relationships were reversed Fifteen percent performed repetitive tasks compared to 56 percent in the white collar categories 16 Similarly in 1944 the number of workers in the UK civil service considered industrial totaled 505 000 By 2003 this number fell to 18 200 with non industrial workers reaching 538 000 in 2004 17 And in Canada in 2006 knowledge based workers represented 58 percent of federal workers in the Core Public Administration up from 41 percent 11 years earlier 18The swelling ranks of non industrial government workers indicate a shift in public sector jobs toward creative collaborative and complex work The workforce structure however designed for clerks of the last century remains largely the same With limited flexibility to distribute resources governments often address change by creating new agencies and programs This can be seen following major events like the outbreaks of the Avian flu and SARs in the past decade 9 11 and the financial crisis of 2008 Source United States Office of Personnel Management A Fresh Start for Federal Pay A Case for Modernization April 2002 p 5 http www opm gov strategiccomp whtpaper pdfFigure 2 The changing U S federal workforce 1950 200015Given increasing budgetary pressures and burgeoning national debts the conventional model of creating new agencies or permanent structures in response to new challenges is unsustainable This is exacerbated by our inability to accurately predict future needs and trends Consider a 1968 Business Week article proclaiming that the Japanese auto industry isn t likely to carve out a big share of the market for itself or the president of Digital Equipment Corporation who in 1977 said t here is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home 19The world is full of experts who attempt to predict the future and fail 20Instead of endeavoring to predict the future governments can choose to create a flexible workforce that can quickly adapt to future work requirements To accomplish this the government can learn from a game changing concept in the technology world cloud computing Major organizations and small startups alike increase their flexibility by sharing storage space information and resources in a cloud allowing them to quickly scale resources up and down as needed Why not apply the cloud model to people The creation of a government wide human cloud could provide significant benefits including A cloud based government workforce or GovCloud could include workers who perform a range of creative problem focused work Rather than being slotted into any single government agency cloud workers would be true government wide employees This section outlines the organizational structure of the GovCloud model which rests on three main pillars a cloud of government workers thin executive agencies and shared services Most government workforce models tend to constrain workers by isolating them in separate agencies Consider the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom and the subsequent slaughter of more than 6 million pigs sheep and cattle The problem of an impacted food supply is complicated In most countries multiple agencies focus on agriculture food production and public health In the United Kingdom the army and even tourism ministries were impacted by the outbreak as agencies became overwhelmed by the number of animals in need of disposal and by the cordoning off of tourist areas to prevent the spread of the disease Yet the structure of government agencies often confines employees to work in information silos creating inherent operational inefficiencies In a cloud workforce model experts in each area could be pulled together to support remedies and propose coordinated corrective measures I want someone saying Did you know that the Ministry of Justice is doing that or could you piggy back on what the communities department is doing or had you thought about doing it in this way You ve got to get away from thinking about centralized command and control Dame Helen Ghosh Permanent Secretary UK Home Office 21The FedCloud modelThe GovCloud model could become a new pillar of government comprising permanent employees who undertake a wide variety of creative problem focused work As needed the GovCloud model could also take advantage of those outside government including citizens looking for extra part time work full time contractors and individual consultants Cloud workers would vary in background and expertise but would exhibit traits of free agent workers self sufficient self motivated employees who exhibit a strong loyalty to teams colleagues and clients Daniel Pink author of Drive The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us argues that 33 million Americans one quarter of the workforce already operate as free agents 22According to the white paper Lessons of the Great Recession from Swiss staffing company Adecco contingent workers those who chose non traditional employment arrangements23 are expected to eventually make up about 25 percent of the global workforce 24These more autonomous workers according to Pink are better suited to 21st century work and are more productive even without traditional monetary incentives 25The fluid nature of the cloud can provide significant benefits The nature of the cloud teams forming and dissolving as their tasks require encourages workers to focus on specific project outcomes rather than ongoing operations Thin agency structures could lead to Greater use of shared services could allow the federal government to The need to support some ongoing missions will remain of course These missions will be carried out by thin agencies Under the cloud concept federal agencies would remain focused on specific missions and ongoing oversight These agencies however would become thinner as many of their knowledge workers transfer into the cloud Thin agencies could also create opportunities to streamline organizations with overlapping missions Employees working in thin agencies could fall into two main categories GovCloud could change the highest levels of public sector workers as we know them today The Senior Executive Service in the United States Permanent Secretaries and Directors General in the United Kingdom and Australia all such senior officials could rotate between agencies shared services and the cloud which would reflect the original intent behind many of these high level offices giving executives a breadth of experience in roles across government to help develop shared values and a broad perspective An important benefit of rotation would be the ability to tap into cloud networks to assemble high performing teams To further focus agencies on specific missions many of their back office support functions could be pulled into government wide shared service arrangements The use of shared services in government has come and gone in waves usually dictated by fiscal necessity Most countries in Europe as part of their e government strategies have placed increased focus of late on developing shared services whether through an executive agency or a CIO as well as working with EU coordination activities And while the decentralized governments of some EU countries such as Germany make shared services more difficult these countries are using states and agencies to pilot innovative approaches 27Other efforts around the world include the U S e Government Act of 2002 which examined how technology could be used to cut costs and improve services More recently the New Zealand government appointed an advisory group in May 2011 to explore public sector reform to improve services and provide better value In their report Better Public Services the advisory group recommended the use of shared services to improve effectiveness in a variety of government settings including policy advice and real estate 29 Following up on this three New Zealand agencies the Department of the Prime Minister the State Services Commission and the Treasury announced in December 2011 that they would share such corporate functions as human resources and information technology 30 And though shared services in Western Australia were shut down other projects in South Australia are moving ahead and already showing savings 31In August 2011 the government of Canada announced the launch of Shared Services Canada a program that seeks to streamline and identify savings in information technology Among its first targets is something as mundane as email But with more than 100 different email systems being used by government employees the potential savings and boost to efficiency could be significant Not only do these incompatible systems cost money by requiring individual departments to negotiate and maintain separate licenses and technical support it also makes it difficult for government employees to communicate with one another and with the public And with no single standard ensuring the security of information transmitted over email becomes more challenging Shared Services Canada will move the government to one email system as well as consolidate data centers and networks ultimately looking for anticipated savings of between CA 100 million and CA 200 million annually 28While the idea of using shared services is not a novel one it is central to the GovCloud model The GovCloud model envisions building upon effective practices and those shared services already in operation to deliver services like human resources information technology finance and acquisitions government wide Workers in these shared services would include subject matter experts in areas like human resources and information technology as well as generalists who support routine business functions The potential for shared services continues to grow As seen with IBM s Watson and Microtask s Digitalkoot new technologies provide an opportunity to accelerate the automated delivery of basic services Some agencies already have begun capitalizing on these trends For example NASA has moved its shared service center website to a secure government cloud facilitating greater employee self service and helping to reduce demand on finite call center resources 32This decision tool is designed to help leaders determine which employees are appropriate for each of the three structures in the GovCloud model the cloud thin agencies and shared services To the cloud GovCloud Project LifecycleManaging employees in the cloud will require governments to reinvent human resource management Individual and team performance evaluations career development pay structures and benefits and pensions would need to change to support GovCloud This section examines possibilities for HR reinvention including performance management career development workplace flexibility and benefits Employees working in the cloud would require an alternative to determine pay and career advancement The government could take its cues from the gaming world and evaluate cloud workers with a point system The manager as we know it will disappear to be replaced by a new sort of business operative whose expertise is assembling the right people for particular projects Daniel Pink author of Free Agent Nation 33An HR management system that incorporates the accumulation of experience points XP through effective work on cloud projects training education and professional certifications could replace the tenure centric models for cloud employees As employees accumulate XP they could level up and take on additional responsibilities in future projects Workers in the cloud could earn XP in four ways After some high profile incidents slow responses to outbreaks of foot and mouth disease flooding that may have been preventable and a farming subsidy system that seemed to result in more chaos than aid the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs DEFRA was looking to reinvent itself In 2006 the department launched DEFRA Renew One of its key goals was to bring the department s policymaking closer to actual delivery to create more responsive processes Organized mainly by policy with fixed teams DEFRA had been unable to redeploy resources as needed in response to a crisis As part of DEFRA Renew a new operating model was implemented that used flexible resourcing where staff were assigned to specific projects for fixed periods This allowed management to measure and build the required capabilities and competencies needed and to allocate resources efficiently to improve overall service quality New roles were also created to support sustainable staff development and resource management in the new model To create buy in for such a fundamental culture shift within the department a facilitative approach to decision making was employed Change management programs and mentoring were extended to all levels of the department including leadership New mechanisms such as approval panels for resources and the use of business cases also worked to push changes among staff and promote collaborative behavior DEFRA Renew was widely recognized as a key enabler in the department meeting required efficiency improvement targets set by the UK government DEFRA moved to a more project based approach with fewer staff in core teams According to Dame Helen Ghosh former Permanent Secretary of DEFRA they could be more responsive now that the management board won t be made up of director generals with individual policy silos 34Just as XP could be gained through learning new skills it could be lost in the following three ways Any serious discussion about creating a new class of government employees requires a fresh look at employee benefits and compensation For example XP could be used to help determine workers salaries but additional research into alternative pension and benefit programs is needed While any discussion on compensation could be contentious a healthy debate among stakeholders from across the government should be welcomed As new roles emerge in the cloud so too could new career paths Career emphasis could move away from time served in a particular pay grade and toward milestones that are meaningful for employee development Each worker may have different career aspirations For instance not all workers aspire to management some may seek to master a particular subject area instead Career advancement in the cloud would not equate to moving up a ladder but rather moving along a lattice Lattice GovCloud ModelHere s how the lattice could work for Ian who we met in the introduction Think of the lattice as a jungle gym The best opportunities to broaden your experience may be lateral or even down Look every which way and swing to opportunities Pattie Sellers Fortune editor at largeCathleen Benko and Molly Anderson the authors of The Corporate Lattice argue that the corporate ladder is giving way to a lattice that accommodates flatter more networked organizations improves the integration of career and life focuses on competencies rather than tenure and helps increase workforce loyalty 35 The lattice metaphor allows employees to choose many ways to get ahead It is unlikely that all workers will thrive in the new GovCloud environment right out of the gate As such it would be important to assess a worker s readiness before placing her in GovCloud and providing training on core competencies critical to cloud success There could also be opportunities to start workers especially those at earlier stages of a career within an agency or shared service to build up expertise in some area before graduating to the cloud Once in the cloud new workers could be paired with mentors who are more experienced to help navigate the cloud experience itself There should be an emphasis on continuous learning in the cloud It would be important for cloud workers to continue to refine their skills develop additional expertise and adapt to new ways of working Not only could continuous learning affect workers career mobility by increasing the depth and breadth of their skills but it could also impact their salary and level by increasing their XP Learning and development in the cloud could take on many themes of next learning Next learning focuses on creating personalized learning experiences that leverage the latest technologies and collaborative communities to deliver education and learning programs that build knowledge bases and promote learning as a focus and passion not just a checkbox in a career 36To broaden cloud worker skills and the ability to handle multiple tasks and work on a variety of projects cloud learning could include the following principles 37In the cloud careers and expertise will be built in new ways and work will be something we do rather than a place we go to As such the cloud will give workers more control over their schedules and workloads By creating a flexible workplace governments could shed a significant amount of physical infrastructure and create shared workspaces Many buildings could be converted into co located spaces teams could use collaboration spaces or videoconferencing centers Some workers might rarely set foot in a government building instead conducting cloud tasks at home and interacting with project teams virtually With advancing communications and mobile technology distance no longer hinders collaboration It no longer matters whether all workers are at an office between 9 a m and 5 p m what matters is whether project teams produce results and whether everyone contributes A more flexible workplace could also take advantage of resources governments might not otherwise have access to Some retiring workers may not want to quit working altogether and a flexible model could be an enticing way to keep their expertise on retainer Alternatively the model could take advantage of would be government employees unwilling to relocate or unable to work a regular schedule By increasing flexibility governments could increase their available resource pool allowing agencies to access the skills and knowledge they need when they need it For an example of how a retiree could interact with the cloud see Appendix C National Security Case Study Don t think governments will ever take to the cloud At the U S Department of State the idea could soon be a reality The Office of eDiplomacy is preparing to pilot a cloud component to its e internship model for American students as part of the Virtual Student Foreign Service VSFS beginning this year The VSFS currently offers e internships to U S university students of multiple month duration By using a new micro volunteering platform State Department offices and embassies around the world will be able to create non classified tasks that take anywhere from a couple of minutes to a couple of days to complete Each task will be tagged by region and or issue and will automatically populate the profiles of students who have indicated those interests Students can then select the tasks that interest them the most or that fit into their schedule To see that the most pressing work is performed first offices and embassies will be able to prioritize their tasks so critical items appear at the top of the queue Imagine a small embassy preparing for a high profile multilateral meeting The preparations for such an event could be daunting for a small staff The power of the cloud could augment an individual embassy s capacity to prepare for a major event and ensure that related items are performed ahead of those that are less critical While there are plenty of incentives for participating in the VSFS micro volunteering platform from an impressive line on a student s resume to the chance to make a difference by working on topics of interest thought is being put into how to creatively incent high performance One idea is to simply invoke students competitive spirit Competition could be encouraged by a monthly leader board which results in bragging rights and potentially even a low cost but high impact reward Transparency is also key to competition with ratings available to State Department staff and other cloud interns and the ability to make short thank you notes from embassies publicly available interns would be keen to make a good impression The potential applications of this type of program are significant Imagine if offices throughout the State Department could tap into the language and cultural expertise of the thousands of foreign national staff members around the globe Providing a platform for those employees to contribute even a small amount of time to discreet tasks that require their expertise could unlock a world of knowledge 38Creating the GovCloud model will require bold leadership and the ideas and initiatives of entrepreneurial executives While a GovCloud model may be years in the making agencies can begin adopting cloud concepts today The GovCloud concept is designed to be versatile as well as applicable to a wide range of entities Depending on your organization government executives wishing to employ GovCloud may choose to apply the concept first to a unit before expanding to other branches or divisions entire agencies or the whole of government Often GovCloud principles are most effectively implemented as part of a larger reform program within a particular agency as with the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs Renew program as described earlier in this report On a smaller scale the UK Cabinet Office used flexible resourcing FR in its Economic Reform Group ERG with a staff of about 400 as part of its cost reduction plans Using a simple database that it had developed and a strong program of communications FR is now used and embraced by all core ERG employees with strong clear ownership from the top another key implementation factor Says Ian Watmore the UK Cabinet Office s former permanent secretary FR means we are able to deploy people much more quickly to priority projects 40Figure 3 outlines how GovCloud can apply to a variety of organizations Most government workforces haven t undergone a broad restructuring in decades In that time the world has been transformed by computers the Internet and mobile communications To respond to a variety of challenges governments have created scores of new organizations However in today s world of budget cuts and increased fiscal scrutiny the constant creation of new permanent structures is not sustainable The GovCloud model could offer a new way to use government resources A cloud of government wide workers could coalesce into project based teams to solve problems and separate when their work is done This could allow governments to concentrate resources when and where they are needed By using this model in conjunction with thinner agencies and shared services governments can reduce back office redundancies and let agencies focus on their core missions This model capitalizes on the work preferences of Millennials the future government workforce who value career growth over job security or compensation 41 The GovCloud model allows employees to gain a variety of experiences in a shorter amount of time and to self select their career direction To support GovCloud governments could establish the processes by which cloud teams would form work and dissolve New ways to evaluate performance and help workers gain skills and build careers should be considered Today s employee classification system stresses job descriptions and time in service this could be transformed with an XP model that emphasizes the individual s ownership of his or her career The GovCloud model will undoubtedly be controversial Many stakeholders from governing bodies to public employee unions must weigh in to shape the future government workforce The transition to a cloud model will not happen overnight or maybe even in the next five years but the conversation starts today Charlie Tierney is a Manager in Deloitte Consulting LLP s Federal Human Capital Practice and a former GovLab Fellow He

Pospisil EU Public Policy and Government Affairs Manager LinkedInPlanning ahead for the demographic and technological changes of the Fourth Industrial Revolution requires policymakers and industry leaders to have access to comprehensive and relevant labor market data Last month we hosted our first European Economic Graph Forum in the European Parliament in Brussels to explore the future of work and impact of access to these insights The event brought together policymakers and key stakeholders to showcase concrete examples of how cities and regions in the EU have been reacting to recent labor market changes and training their workforce to ensure they obtain the skills they need to work in tomorrow s economy Here s a quick recap of our takeaways from the conversation A big thank you to MEP Eva Maydell who hosted us at the Parliament and without whom this conversation would not have been possible For further insights on skills evolution European educational institutions and the importance of creating policy rooted in data enjoy additional highlights from the event below Related TopicsLinkedIn analytics help deepen and enrich European labour market policymakingUnderstanding digital skills in MunichThe latest Economic Graph updates are on our LinkedIn pageOf course we can t predict the future of either the government workforce or workplace especially not in the distant year 2040 But we can envision what it might look like given what we know about trends underway today The IBM Center as part of it 20th anniversary activities this year is looking twenty years ahead It recently held its first in a series of Envision Government in 2040 sessions starting with the future of work in government This small group session spurred a fast paced conversation that raised more questions than answers but concluded that we need to start preparing now for that future whatever it might be The Workforce The Tech Revolution is happening faster than we are ready to absorb writes Darrell West in a new book to be released in May There will be fewer full time employees in government just look at the staff sizes of places like Facebook and Google which are on the cutting edge of the future workforce in the private sector Estimates of job displacement as a result of a variety of new technologies artificial intelligence robotics 3 D printing nanotechnology virtual and augmented reality etc vary depending on the studies involved Strategists are saying that the role of humans will need to shift from accumulating and synthesizing knowledge which can increasingly be done by artificial intelligence to skills such as empathy experimentation and innovation And this would require a reorientation of our education system With this in mind the emphasis will be on re skilling and re deploying the workforce not replacing it However certain kinds of work may go away Work that is repetitive in nature such as transactional services such as HR and financial management will largely be automated and likely be candidates for being contracted out to the private sector for delivery Some questions raised in the Envision Session The Workplace The increasing interconnectedness among people and machines will increasingly allow people to work from anywhere via virtual reality and other participatory systems allowing individuals and teams to still feel as connected as if they were co located This increase in connectivity will allow opportunities for less physical travel and greater flexibility for geographic locations for individuals and organizations But this also implies greater investments in digital infrastructure to allow this to happen Preparing Today for Change Tomorrow Technology is typically being seen as augmenting not replacing today s workers But increasingly the role of workers will change For example STEM education is seen as important up until about 2035 but increasingly less so as a result of AI advances after that point After that point other human traits will become more important in the workplace such as empathy and imagination As one report notes Computers are great at optimizing but not so great at goal setting or even using common sense What Comes Next The Future of Work envisioning session was the first of several envision sessions in the works The next will focus on the impact of Artificial Intelligence to be followed by several others Each of these sessions are being used to inform selected authors as they draft chapters for our Future of Government 2040 book to be published this Fall so keep tuned Also don t

is heading Machinists and truck drivers are out robotics programmers and project managers are in But as job titles get more and more nebulous what is it that project managers do anyway a new report from the World Economic Forum suggests that we ought to also look at skills Skills are actionable They can guide workers toward understanding their unique value where they are deficient and what they want to learn Especially as more of the workforce shifts toward freelancers it will be skills not job titles that will help workers differentiate themselves Many of the skills for which the WEF predicts demand will grow like active learning and technology design make sense for a world where the rate of technological change is set to accelerate Meanwhile when we think of the skills most likely to be automated routine and repetitive tasks like adding a widget on an assembly line or filling in an accounting form come to mind However some of the skills needs expected to be on the decline in the next five years might come as a surprise In addition to manual labor we ve also already outsourced many cognitive tasks to technology Phones serve as an external hard drive for our brains Task management software replaces some of the responsibilities previously held by managers So even skills which may seem uniquely human like memory and management of personnel will become less important differentiators for human talent as technology advances the WEF suggests Note that while active learning is among the skills expected to be in high demand just a few years from now active listening is not The WEF s full list of 2022 skills might help you think through skills to develop in order to stay relevant in the future By using this service you agree not to post material that is

WagnerRetirement Planning by Tammy Flanagan 2019 by Government Media Executive Group LLC All rights reserved Today the Volcker Alliance released a study which addresses an important and timely question What knowledge and skills will the next generation of public servants need to be effective The report Preparing Tomorrow s Public Service presents insights on crucial skills from nearly 1 000 rising government leaders and explores how government s managerial capacity can keep pace with the scale and complexity of government s responsibilities Additionally the study provides recommendations to government agencies professional associations and educational institutions on cultivating the most critical capacities for government service With nearly one third of federal career employees eligible for retirement by the end of the decade and similar workforce pressures impacting states and localities these issues are of growing import The rising government managers from the federal state and local levels who were surveyed by the Volcker Alliance convey the importance of skills such as motivating teams perseverance project management and oral communication to succeed in public service Soft skills are rated by this cohort of rising government leaders as relatively more important than other hard skills such as advanced data analytics Given headlines in recent years about the technical challenges facing government such as the launch of healthcare gov or the data breach of federal background check data we expected to hear huge demand for technical training from government employees However what we found came through most clearly in this study said Paul A Volcker former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and chairman of the Volcker Alliance is that public administration is still about people and communications and management skills are as important as they ever were in implementing policies effectively In Preparing Tomorrow s Public Service rising government leaders express a strong commitment to government service and a desire for more networked learning and other professional development opportunities Of those surveyed 75 percent report that they intend to continue in government for the long term Over 50 percent wish they had access to professional development opportunities that were more relevant to them and 74 percent intend to pursue additional professional development Dustin Brown who leads performance and personnel management as the deputy assistant director for management in the US Office of Management and Budget and was interviewed for the report said I appreciate the Alliance shedding light on this important issue to improve the government s ability to recruit skills needed to modernize He added that the Volcker Alliance s findings align with his hiring priorities for the federal government I m not looking for just policy people but for folks who have the change management skills to work across silos Brown said For the types of problems government is trying to solve and the way in which the government is organized we need managers that can lead implementation efforts across organizations and sectors The Alliance recommends a range of ways that government agencies can invest in and support future public servants including mentoring and coaching programs fellowship programs and employee training opportunities Preparing Tomorrow s Public Service highlights some existing programs that are tailored for rising managers as models for other agencies to adopt The Alliance also recommends that graduate programs consider incorporating more field based content and offer more post degree just in time courses and experiences The Volcker Alliance is a 501 c 3 nonprofit organization ImpactoApril 30 2018 by Luis Miguel Castilla Leave a CommentThe uncertainty of the future of work naturally raises a number of questions It is no wonder Argentina put it on the agenda as one of three priorities to be discussed at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires Will its impact be the same across the globe What jobs will be most affected What new skillsets will be required But above all how can governments prepare and what role can Multilateral Development Banks play All four leading regional development banks recently came together in Washington to present some key perspectives regarding the jobs of the future which can be found in the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives Here are a few worth considering On the one hand Emerging Europe Developing Asia Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean are witnessing how robotics automation and artificial intelligence are lowering costs and increasing productivity providing an opportunity for accelerated growth Countries like Estonia have taken the lead in digital technology youth in Nigeria and Ethiopia are harnessing technology to boost yields in agriculture in Vietnam and Bangladesh Information and Communication Technologies ICT is boosting the service industry and across Latin America and the Caribbean smartphone adoption is expected to reach beyond 70 by 2020 On the other hand as a result of this new wave of technological advances known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution a series of myths emerge that it is important to clarify Myth 1 All regions will be impacted in the same way The truth is that technology will be adopted at varying speeds depending on the region s economic development and demographic trends An aging population in Emerging Europe will face different challenges than Africa where 12 to 15 million young people enter the job market each year Myth 2 Mass unemployment is unavoidable The truth is that the jobless rate will be lower than originally expected Mass unemployment is unlikely to become a reality But the shifts in job opportunities will certainly require flexibility and access to new training tools which may in turn be provided by technology itself Myth 3 Automation will replace all human jobs and tasks The truth is that automation only takes place where it is both technically and economically feasible A human workforce will still be required in most sectors particularly those such as health and education At the same time it would be foolish to ignore the genuine threats of unemployment and increased income inequality that the rapid expansion of new technology will generate Above all as Multilateral Development Banks the question we need to be asking is how can governments ease the transition What can governments do to ensure that the largest number of people possible benefit from this transition Policymakers can take four actions to ease the adoption of technology while mitigating potentially adverse effects on jobs and incomes Multilateral Development Banks certainly have their own role to play not only by acting as think tanks for initiatives on how to capitalize on new technologies and mitigate their negative effects but also in coordinating global or regional policy responses strengthening partnerships between policymakers and employers to jointly identify and address challenges Our products and services will need to adapt A recent IDB health project in the Dominican Republic which uses drones to link remote rural clinics with hospital laboratories is a prime example of this Change will also take place within our workforce Outsourcing the IDB s human resources department from Washington to Costa Rica to ensure efficiency and reduce costs was certainly a step in the right direction It is important that we take the time to seriously identify the opportunities and risks the 21st century global job market presents so that together we can help shape the future of work In the meantime we must also remain relevant for our customer base and at the forefront of innovation Whether we succeed or not is up to all of us Downlaod the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives hereFiled Under Beyond development effectiveness Tagged

Asamblea de Gobernadores o sus pa ses miembros The future of work was a big theme at Davos Although perhaps lost among stories about the lack of political big hitters Trump Putin and the scramble for those blue bobble hats there was an important report released by the International Labour Organisation ILO on the future of work There s lots of food for thought in what the ILO commission has produced It was also a reminder of how our anxieties about the future of work are nothing new The ILO report was published to celebrate the organisation s centenary and how back in 1919 the organisation was formed to provide a positive vision of how employees and employers could work together in rebuilding society after the First World War Another relevant anniversary is looming Perhaps not as illustrious as the ILO s birth February will be five years since the UK government published its own future of work study It s worth a read as it tries to anticipate how work will be organised by 2030 You can check it out here There are four scenarios set out for what the world of work might look like There s forced flexibility that s generated modest growth but with poor job security for low skilled The Great Divide is properly dystopian with robust growth driven by high tech but a sharper divergence between the haves and have nots Both could be possible outcomes but thankfully I see us moving in a direction somewhere between the other two scenarios spelt out in the report One is skills activism that sees technological innovation driving automation of more white collar work triggering an extensive government led skills programme The other is innovation adaptation that sees vastly improved productivity through rigorous implementation of ICT solutions Technological innovation is already having a huge impact on major job categories Look at how retail jobs are being lost as e commerce takes over or how banking s business model relies on having much fewer physical branches because of how customer migration to online banking has been accelerated by mobile That s impetus enough for the government to push on skills and education Even though it s estimated 10 billion is spent in this area and there are many initiatives movement is slow because no one has perhaps cracked how to aggressively drive the closing of skills gaps especially for digital The submission of the Local Government Association to a parliamentary review of skills training said despite the billions being spent the skills gap will widen with over four million too few high skilled people to take up available jobs two million too many with intermediate skills and more than six million too many low skilled by 2024 So relying on government alone to close the skills gaps remains challenging though it remains a goal that must be focused on Moreover governments need to address outdated schooling that is increasingly not fit for purpose in the 21st Century I was particularly moved by Seth Godin s education manifesto Stop stealing dreams a powerful argument against school systems designed for the last industrial revolution and not today s fourth industrial revolution We need to take to heart Godin s stark observation that annually our schools churn out millions of workers who are trained to do 1925 style labour and to be compliant consumers rather than creative problem solvers Where I feel more optimistic is how far we have gone to embrace innovation to adapt to the changing world of work Some may contend that the ICT solutions that underpin gig economy firms might not be creating quality jobs But I do feel those innovators are looking to correct their earlier missteps around how they engage with their workers Perhaps what s more significant is how the changing nature of business to be more digital depends on humans with digital skills rather than the march of the robots As I have argued before organisations have realised that their harnessing of technology to drive business improvement will depend on how much they empower their workers to use digital tools to solve problems and improve processes In fact you can see this called out in the 2014 report where it recommends that individuals focus on development of key skills and attributes that will be at a premium in future including resilience adaptability resourcefulness enterprise cognitive skills such as problem solving A week is a long time in politics So perhaps four years is a millennium But I am struck by how governments and agencies like ILO haven t shied away from how the nature of work will be transformed and regardless of how important technology is the answers and outcomes are very human centred At Pegasystems I have overall responsibility for technical sales and I am the company s senior technology architect and evangelist I am also a member of the European Subscribe I want to receive email updates on Apolitical s recent quiz Do you have what it takes for the government jobs of the future tested public servants tech savviness global awareness and aptitude for collaboration and innovation Backed by two years of research it s part of an ongoing effort to understand the readiness of the world s civil servants for the coming digital revolution which is expected to eliminate 77 of administration and operations roles by 2030 Even if your result was The Luddite or Old School there s still time to learn about the technologies and disciplines that will be essential to getting things done in the public service of the future We ve isolated the most important trends here this is why they matter how governments can use them and the best online resources to learn them yourself Big data once a tool reserved for statisticians and intelligence personnel is now indispensable to the functioning of government With it public servants can use evidence to drive decision making rather than guesswork In the private sector a strong linkbetween effective data use and better financial performance has been established but much of government data still lives on paper or in old fashioned systems This coupled with a tendency to treat data analysis as an afterthought when crafting policy prevents governments from reaping its benefits Of course every civil servant need not be a data scientist but they should appreciate its potential to improve the lives of citizens help services function more efficiently and cut costs In the future of work all public servants will deal with data in service delivery which means overcoming a misconception of big data as amorphous and overwhelming Public servants should come to see it as a tool to help government do more for their citizens with less which in this era of shrinking budgets and growing technological innovation is crucial At a time when there is an urgent need to improve the efficiency of public services data analytics has huge potential Eddie Copeland NestaHow to use it Estonia saves more than 2 8 million hours of labour every year through a data exchange network that helped it digitise 99 of government services The system lets citizens pay their taxes in five minutes and incorporate companies in under 20 Police forces in the US are using big data to predict where crime is most likely to occur and allocate officers more efficiently Some cities have cut crime by up to 40 London is using data analytics to predict which children are most at risk for neglect and abuse allowing child services to intervene before something happens The system will save municipalities 910 000 a year Ukraine has clamped down on corruption and saved 37 million on drugs for its health service with a data driven app that compares government purchases to prices listed by other suppliers How to learn The School of Data has courses on the fundamentals of data as well as how to extract map and clean it The Open Data Institute offers classes in open data essentials and finding stories in data It also has offline courses like Open data in a day for government and Managing risk with open data Coursera has a John Hopkins University sanctioned Launch your career in data science class Datacamp teaches data science skills like R SQL and python Dataquest offers beginner intermediate and expert level courses in data analysis and prediction General Assembly has a number of courses in data science and analysis In the US just 27 of citizens are happy with government s digital services Constituents want to interact with government more easily and governments leading the charge in bringing services online are using artificial intelligence AI to do so With AI systems learn from experience and keep improving their performance without humans having to explain how to complete tasks A prime example of this is chatbots virtual assistants that field questions from constituents who would normally have to call a public office or help desk Chatbots which learn from the questions they are asked to continually improve performance help governments serve constituents better and free up public servants time for higher value jobs AI has the potential to rid humans of monotonous work administrative tasks like data sorting filing and searching documents translating materials and drafting briefs among others saving federal governments up to 1 2 billion hu man hours and 41 1 billion annually City officials only work during the day 8am to 5pm Chatbots work 24 7 Ryan Johnson City of North CharlestonHow to use it Governments in the US Singapore and Jersey use chatbots to help citizens cut through bureaucracy and find the answers they need quickly and easily Las Vegas is using AI to predict car crashes with up to 70 accuracy It uses it to warn drivers to avoid the area up to two hours in advance The UK is using a machine learning model that can identify billion dollar pension schemes at risk of collapse New York City is preventing fires by using a prediction tool that has improved the accuracy of inspections by 20 allowing the city to divert crews to the most at risk buildings How to learn Udacity has an introductory course to AI Udemy offers a

variety of introduction to AI courses IBM offers a beginner s guide to artificial intelligence machine learning and cognitive computing Policymakers are often accused of losing sight of the challenges everyday people face Design thinking is a way for governments to leverage the philosophy of user centric companies like Apple which puts customer experience at the centre of product design to solve problems and shape policy Design thinking puts end citizens at the centre of policy formulation in the iterative process public servants form theories about what constituents want by observing them prototype a product or service then test it out on real people This form of empathetic hands on policymaking helps government build services in concert with citizens to meet their needs rather than relying on detached experts The collaborative approach encourages public servants to break out of departmental siloes and tap into more risky innovative service design It s quite messy doing design work But the old ways of thinking just aren t working anymore Sarah Hurcombe the Australian Centre for Social InnovationHow to use it Denmark used design thinking to reorganise waste management in Copenahagen reduce tension between inmates and guards in prisons and transform services for mentally disabled adults in Odense Singapore has redesigned its employment centres to make them calm and easily navigable for stressed job seekers West Hollywood used design thinking to bring the first robotic parking garage to the west coast The US Department of Labour used design thinking to come up with a speed dating approach to teaching job seekers about resume building financial literacy and how to find work How to learn Stanford University offers a world renowned virtual crash course in design thinking Coursera has a University of Virginia backed design thinking for innovation class Ideou teaches a number of courses in design thinking and innovation strategy MIT has a class in mastering innovation and design thinking FutureLearn has a course called designing for the future in which students learn to apply design thinking to modern problems The University of Cincinnati offers and introductory design thinking and innovation course The use of human psychology to drive citizen behaviour was pioneered by the UK government to cut costs and help people make better choices It taps into the minutiae of how people act and uses small nudges such as a text message or personalised letter to prompt behavioural changes The discipline has had an outsize effect on human behaviour the UK Nudge Unit has signed up an additional 100 000 organ donors a year doubled the number of army applicants and helped collect an additional 40 million a year from taxpayers Nudge units use empirical evidence to anticipate how people will react to policy options rather than assuming their response will be rational They have spread to governments across the world including Guatemala the US Australia Germany and Singapore but the use of behavioural insights is still nascent In the future it is expected to have a significant impact on solving problems that stem from ingrained or unconscious bias like gender inequality It s hard for government to admit that something it s doing might not work or that it s failed People are often running blind David Halpern UK Nudge UnitHow to use it The UK Australia and Singapore use a behavioural science and machine learning tool to blind managers to gender and ethnicity allowing them to hire solely based on talent A public university in San Francisco used text message nudges to cut dropouts among low income students by 10 Australia is using nudges to boost women s labour force participation and their visibility in televised sports A Sacramento utility nudged customers to cut their peak hour energy consumption by 12 by automatically enrolling them in an energy saving plan How to learn Read about developing public policy with

FuturesCentre apoliticalco https t co 33hM95VuQZ A few more ideas here https t co g3dNRQ8ppyA few more ideas here by nesta What are the skills and attitudes for successful public problem solving In late November 2018 I delivered the opening keynote at the Future of Work 2018 Conference hosted by the University of Melbourne Center for Workplace Leadership 1 where I described how to keep people at the center of the future of work discussion After my talk find a video of the 45 minute keynote here I was interviewed for a short video segment to share the highlights In preparing for the interview I found the questions to explore a thoughtful comprehensive look at the scope of the discussion on the future of work and thus I wanted to share my answers I am interested in your reactions Do you agree with my thoughts Disagree Why What are some examples of human centric approaches to work within areas of high automation I would approach this question differently While there are some jobs that might have a higher likelihood of automation than others especially those contain significant amounts of routine tasks 2 the World Economic Forum has recently predicted that greater than 50 of all jobs will require significant reskilling and upskilling by 2022 3 This means we will need to consider more human centric approaches in most jobs not just those with a higher proportion of tasks that could be automated In the research I ve been conducting in partnership with Bill Eggers and Amrita Datar from Deloitte and Carlos Teixeira from the Harvard Kennedy School through my current part time fellowship with the Harvard Kennedy School digitalHKS initiative we ve envisioned 6 government jobs of the future with a method that puts humans back at the center for both new and changing jobs Putting the worker first we envision future jobs to place human machine coordination at the core in order to improve productivity and decision making while also increasing the well being of the workers themselves The trick is not to think about what can be automated but also what can be augmented If a human s time could be freed up what higher order value could be accomplished with uniquely human skills Might we be able to deliver more value than human machine coordination than through humans alone or machines alone For example Child case workers in Colorado currently spend less than 10 percent of their work time actually interacting with children and families This impacts their ability to most effectively protect vulnerable children and coordinate services for those children Case workers today spend a large percentage of their time on administrative tasks Our research has envisioned a future where administrative burdens are reduced with the application of technologies to increase the time spent on higher valued work for the customer For example some technology applications could include case management systems powered by cognitive computing to ease scheduling and follow up voice based smart assistants that document case notes after an appointment while the future child aid coordinator travels between appointments robotic process automation tools that automatically process a client s eligibility for services on the fly and using predictive analytics and machine learning to prevent abuse neglect and ill treatment Child aid coordinators should be empowered to customize services for vulnerable children based on the child s own unique circumstances Spending more time with children and families is a critical part to increasing the value created by this work and by applying technology to free time from administrative tasks coordinators are able to spend more time problem solving for their customers What frightens you or stirs you the most about the shift from human power to machine power MIT Professor David A Mindell talks about three myths of 21st century robotics and automation in his book Our Robots Ourselves that I think are particularly relevant to shift the focus of this question The myth of linear progress the idea that technology evolves from direct human involvement into remote presence and then to fully autonomous systems The myth of replacement the idea that machines take over human jobs one for one Myth of full autonomy the utopian idea that robots today or in the future can operate entirely on their own 4 So there s a lot of fear mongering about how quickly and how extremely a shift to machine power will happen Also I think what we have to remind ourselves is that human power alone and machine power alone won t be as great as power achieved through human machine coordination To get the most value we need to design machines that have humans in the loop and empower humans to design work processes where machines are in the loop This is where the greatest value lies but is also where the challenge is because most organizations are not good at integrating new technologies into their business processes One reason they struggle with this not far from the only reason is significant workforce resistance when new technologies are forced on them This is where employees seeing WHY the change is important and why there is a benefit to them to re skill is important Another reason is because true user centered design in the technology development and deployment process is not common practice Organizations must embrace a user centered technology adoption mindset if technology initiatives are to succeed in improving the performance of an organization Co creating a visualization for the jobs of the future as occurs in the workshops Bill Amrita and I have developed can be a powerful tool to enable these actions How futuristic or progressive is the research in this area are we finding out the facts and figures too late There is a lot of research being done in this area but often in silos Conversations about future of work are often segmented between communities People building technologies focus on a technology enabled future Human capital and staffing professionals focus on how workforce changes are affecting the future of work Universities and educators focus on future skills and learning mindsets as being key enablers for the future The urgent need is to build bridges across these communities and research areas since I believe solutions will lie at the intersections of the complex topics including but not limited to Technology development robotics computer and data science engineering etc Economics and economic development policy local state and national Education and learning Workforce development policy Technology ethics Labor relations Business and public sector management Human centered design human factors Architecture and build environment design Business strategy Organizational design Performance management Organizational and Individual PsychologyMIT is one university trying to get ahead of this need for interdisciplinary action oriented research through the Task force on Work of the Future announced off earlier this year but significantly more work can be done in convening these communities for active solution development What s critical to do right now in ensuring the human evolves and doesn t disappear from meaningful work In the near term government employers employees and educators all have a role to play to design a future that is better for humans not worse Employees must not wait around for skill development to be presented to them by their employer a mindset of life long learning will be a key attribute for the future employee Learning doesn t necessarily mean traditional university higher education where costs are becoming unsustainable Learning can happen online through local boot camps by doing through micro courses designed to be taken on demand etc Employees must see that change is coming understand the new skills that will be required for them to succeed in a changed work world and feel empowered to take some of that learning on for themselves Now that s not to say that employers won t also have an important role to play in training employees in the skills of the future like AT T s 1B commitment to re train half of its workforce for the jobs of the future But McKinsey estimates that globally some 500M 900M future workers may need to move to new employers and sectors to find meaningful work 5 That transition will require some initiative on the part of the employee Thus we must create means for individuals to feel empowered and encouraged to do this and reduce fear of the future that could be paralyzing Educators act as a bridge between the future workforce and employers Being an effective bridge should involve identifying the salient knowledge skills and abilities required for the future of work and evolving curriculum and learning environments to prepare students for those futures This requires educators to have a keen understanding of the needs of industry Many institutes of higher education are also completely rethinking how they teach and how students learn and are making education to non traditional students more broadly available through online learning certifications and MOOCs Innovating the learning process itself and the funding model for learning is a critical role of educators and a role all educators should be moving to adopt in the near term Employers must step out of their comfort zone and think about a future where their potential workforce could include not only be full time human employees but contract employees the crowd strategic partnerships and machine intelligence How do you think about integrating the machine as part of the team How does this change the role and skills for managers How might humans and machines combined create a more valued product or service that you provide today The challenge is to not think about the application of machines as an efficiency gain to cut overall costs by reducing human labor but to think about how machines augment humans who can provide higher order cognitive value to the organization Employers should also actively engage their workforce in designing the jobs of the future jobs that use technology to augment current work and that add new value Current employees see problems on the front line and opportunities for additional value creation that management and senior leadership often doesn t see That front line intelligence should be incorporated into designing jobs of the future Designing a future organizational model that harnesses an agile way to leverage human machine coordination to add value is a business imperative Further employers have to be obsessed with creating a learning environment in their organizations This environment should teach existing employees how to fail fast and adapt to changing technologies and customer information regularly but also help new employees onboard much more quickly due to the increasing fluidity of the workforce and increasing incidence of telework remote teams Governments must set economic workforce development training education and technology policies that consider the interdisciplinary issues of the future of work But their role is not only limited to policy making through laws and executive orders They could also Leverage convening power to create a cross sector agenda Encourage experimentation at the state and local level as test beds for national policy Fund programs to re skill employees in parts of the economy that might not be able to afford to do it themselves like small to mid size manufacturers Consider government agency roles and responsibilities to see if policy making across different interdisciplinary areas should be better coordinated Encourage policy making that includes a participatory element to ensure the voices and values of the public not just organizational stakeholders are considered when evaluating policy solutions Ensure trade offs between technology ethics and societal values are considered in economic growth policies Initiate diplomatic efforts to address inequality issues in the future of work EtcMcKinsey 6 Bain 7 and others have also made recent recommendations on what these groups can do to prepare for the future of work How do we rein in the growth of inequality as technology shifts the balance of power and opportunity in society New technology throughout history has been accompanied by fear of that technology Malcolm Frank and others in their book What to Do when Machines do Everything note Many seem to forget that throughout history automation has provided a net benefit to society In the process of automating our work and our society through generation after generation three positive things have repeatedly occurred 1 A new abundance has been created sales of products and services produced by automation now vastly more affordable and of higher quality skyrocket2 With the new abundance overall employment rises even when there is less labor input per unit 3 Society gains a net benefit with higher living standards created by newly affordable products and services 8 However this fourth work revolution does have some unique issues to consider with respect to furthering inequality A primary issue involves the coding of biases into future decision making structures and thus significant discussions have emerged on the ethical use of AI This discussion can often be about how to ensure that the algorithm developers aren t coding their own personal biases into technologies But it can also be about the data that we are using to train our AI if training data is biased or not representative of broader society then we could be making incorrect diagnoses faster or forgetting entire populations in the future we re optimizing for For example a 2010 report from the University of British Columbia warned against the danger of assuming that all of humanity s psychology closely matches the behaviors of 20 something college students They cite evidence that between 2003 and 2007 undergrads made up 80 percent of study subjects in six top psychology journals and that 96 percent of all psychology samples come from countries that make up only 12 percent of the world s population 9 The researchers refer to the sample population as mostly coming from Western Educated Industrialized Rich Democratic WEIRD populations So if a future AI therapist were trained off this data set the accuracy of diagnosis and the effectiveness of treatment may likely underperform with underrepresented communities in the dataset We must be vigilant against potential bias both in our training research data as well as the humans coding the rules else we are likely to further encourage inequitable application of technology What can only humans do and how will this change improve be compromised in the future work economy Humans are still vastly better at problem solving communication knowledge sharing collaboration leadership creativity empathy and the ability to cope with ambiguity and uncertainty 10 In some jobs that conduct routine cognitive tasks machines can actually become smarter than humans when powered by vast amounts of data These jobs may include call centers auditing insurance underwriting and basic tax preparation Some creative cognitive jobs may also be replaced For example powered by significant amounts of viewer data Netflix can set the parameters to create new TV series and movies they know will be enjoyed by their population As described by Jessica Brillhart AI is also creating beautiful art This means humans will need to perform more sophisticated cognitive tasks in the future of work Mohanbir Sawhney suggests a few such jobs in Forbes like managing and designing the future human machine teams and jobs that require social intelligence like providing care to humans nurses counselors physical therapists Also he notes as technology improves the quality of life for society humans may have more free time for leisure which could increase employment in the entertainment and leisure industries 11 All previous work revolutions agricultural and industrial have unlocked new industries and thus new opportunities for jobs while improving the overall quality of life of society though there could be much vigorous debate on the nuances of this statement If history is our guide we would expect to see the same net change over time though the times that society undergoes that transition can be very difficult The relatively good news here is that the transition may be quick occurring within one person s lifetime and not over the course of three lifetimes like previous revolutions This will significantly impact a generation but the overall transition time may be shorter Thus we have an urgent need to act now to minimize the negative effects on this generation with overall progress vigorous guard against embedded bias and human quality of life and equity top of mind References 1 Important Note My work on the Future of Work is conducted as an outside activity from my NASA duties My Future of Work research is done in affiliation with

17a7d6fc3fceTagged future of work technology AI automation human resources skills education jobs government work workPowered by SquarespaceApple has integrated 9 000 trees into its futuristic new headquarters campus reflecting research showing that greenery in workplaces increases productivity by 15 percent Several years ago Google s People Analytics division launched Project Aristotle to understand the components of productive teams embracing research that groups are more creative than individuals Private sector businesses are automating tedious tasks augmenting workers with artificial intelligence technologies reskilling and upskilling their workforces focusing on employee wellness and hungrily recruiting talent Government will have to catch up Perhaps nowhere is the gap between the public and private sector greater than in workforce management Most public sector organizations are still locked into decades old employee policies such as rigid job classifications lockstep pay and a reliance on seniority as a substitute for capability The reality is that government agencies are increasingly called upon to address society s most complex challenges while using workforce approaches rooted in the distant past The good news Change is possible and beginning to happen A new Deloitte study explores some of the ways the nature of government work the public workforce itself and the workplace it occupies will all need to continue to evolve Work New technologies can transform the capabilities of a government worker Artificially intelligent chatbots for example can perform triage on citizen questions freeing human attention for less routine queries The Army s recruitment chatbot SGT STAR does the work of 55 recruiters answering 94 percent of questions A Deloitte analysis of AI s potential found that automation could save the federal government as much as 1 2 billion hours of work annually What AI doesn t automate it can enhance Child welfare caseworkers who according to one study spend just 9 percent of their time with children but 37 5 percent of their time on paperwork could use technology to auto populate documentation freeing time for visits AI also can correlate hospital truancy and arrest records to flag children in danger Some restaurant health inspectors already analyze big data to identify likely candidates for inspections In Chicago for instance tests found 24 percent more critical violations and on average isolated dangers from the food system a week earlier For effective work redesign it s helpful to adopt a two pronged strategy of zooming in and zooming out A zooming in approach hones in on individual tasks and processes that have the most potential to be optimized through automation Zooming out entails looking at the bigger picture to define what work redesign means for entire job classifications departments and the organization as a whole Workforce Specialists in fields like cybersecurity agile development and artificial intelligence are not likely to commit decades to one government position and if they did they d still need to swap into the tech sector periodically to sharpen their skills That s why some government technology programs are taking a tour of duty approach letting private sector experts serve in the public sector for a few years on specific projects without locking them into a lifetime of government work At the federal level the General Services Administration s 18F digital services agency the Oak Ridge Institute for Science Education and the Presidential Innovation Fellows program all help government solve problems with temporary outside hires At the state level Michigan s Cyber Civilian Corps a volunteer group of cybersecurity professionals from the private sector and academia as well as government can be called upon if the governor declares a cyber emergency And long term government workers don t need to be stuck in one place A talent cloud can prepare for unexpected staffing needs by identifying in advance workers with special skills and applying them to tasks suited to their expertise Canada is experimenting with letting multiple agencies dip into a talent cloud and hire workers for specific missions Workers keep their union membership rights and benefits but may be called into service by any agency Workplace Empirical science rarely guides hiring But management is becoming more data driven Applying the newest science on team building personal efficiency and employee wellness to government agencies can upgrade the workplace to better attract retain and utilize talent Insights from studies of the composition and functioning of effective teams can inform decisions about using talents more effectively Organizational network analysis for example can use metadata from emails and other sources to map communication patterns in organizations accurately predicting individuals who will be high performers detecting unsatisfied employees six months before they actually quit and identifying leadership behaviors that correlate with success Modern workplace wellness programs are also extremely impactful Improving employee wellness can reduce lost work days increase retention and fuel productivity After the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center provided a physician and nurse case manager for employees it saw an 80 percent decline in lost work days over six years for a cost savings of 1 5 million In short the future of government work will require a level of dynamic workforce management far beyond the current practices of the public sector The potential for government agencies to unlock more human capital potential and make the public sector a magnet for talent is enormous As Buffalo s former mayor demonstrated to bring the right people together you have to know what it takes to make a project succeed Local governments are using internet surveys to better gauge residents needs Some states are finding ways to make rules easier to navigate and less costly for business while continuing to protect the public s interests The amount of missing and unusable public sector data is stunning Every jurisdiction should be comparing itself with its peers to identify problematic practices increase productivity and reduce costs It s all too easy for team members to misunderstand something Effective

lot of manual labour and the equipment was getting old and we re dealing with breakdown So we were able to build this facility it s a big technology advancement compared to how we used to farm and now we re able to do less time choring and do other work instead so we re more efficient and it s just a more humane way to harvest milk Sensequake is making cities safer and smarter by combining sensors AI and data analysis to perform structural health monitoring and determine the integrity and natural hazard vulnerability of a structure More and more workplaces are going to need the technologies that are emerging now and in the future And having knowledge of these new technologies is going to be crucial in every sector Skills development is vital right now What skills are we embedding inside

skills and keeping on top of trends To help with that we ve created this reading list for the new age of government Several of these books and reports deal directly with how the civil service operates Others offer lessons from other industries From how to apply a startup mentality to the public service to the role of art in policymaking here are our top nine instructional and inspirational reads for civil servants We hope you ll find it helpful and feel free to add your own ideas for ones we ve missed in the comments below For more like this see our government innovation newsfeed If We Can Put a Man on the Moon Getting Big Things Done in Government John O LearyOne of the best ways to improve policymaking is to help governments learn from failures which is what this book is devoted to It takes a fine tooth comb to policymaking mistakes made by the US government from the war in Iraq to the response to Hurricane Katrina to Healthcare gov and gives practical advice on how similar crises can be averted in the future It argues that the reason governments fail at large scale transformations is that public servants and politicians keep falling into the same traps This book is an essential guide to improving government by learning from policymaking pitfalls Sprint How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days Jake Knapp John Zeratsky Braden KowitzGovernment tends to move slowly but with the rise of innovation labs that s changing Agile government may be a buzzword but it s now what many departments are aiming for faster design and delivery of policies and services The Sprint formula for testing ideas was developed at Google and has been taken up in more than 100 organisations from schools and startups to non profits and large companies The process is designed to take an idea from prototype to decision in just five days which could save government time and money and cut down on unnecessary red tape Bonus For more on the agile government movement see the Agile Government Handbook Public Servants Art and the Crisis of the Common Good Johanna Burton Shannon Jackson Dominic WillsdonPeople often think of policymaking as practical and technocratic but a growing movement of civil servants in the US UK and beyond are working to bring art and other creative pursuits into the process This book a collection of essays and art projects argues that civil servants should be engaged with art and artists if they want to have better conversations about the future of government Art can help us manage these changes the authors say and shape the landscape of government into something more human This book will make you question what you know about policymaking and rethink the role of creativity in the public sector The Algorithmic Accountability Toolkit AI NowThe growing significance of artificial intelligence to government can t be overstated Even if your job has nothing to do with technology an understanding of how algorithms are used to provide government services allocate resources and make decisions will be critical to the future of government work This toolkit is a comprehensive but easy to understand look at the implications of AI in government and where its use could go wrong It highlights the importance of transparency oversight accountability and citizen input particularly in critical areas like procurement and delves into algorithms vulnerability to human bias and error Simpler The Future of Government Cass SunsteinCass Sunstein spent four years as Barack Obama s regulatory tsar during which time he led a revolution in how government regulates industry His work made federal rules more effective and easier to understand and catalysed changes from simplified mortgages and student loan applications to the improved labelling of food and energy efficient appliances These regulatory changes now help citizens save money and time improve their health and live longer lives This book is a guide to using evidence based policymaking citizen engagement and behavioural science to make government less bureaucratic What is Public Sector Innovation The Observatory of Public Sector InnovationOften seen as an oxymoron by outsiders government innovation is a concept many public servants have heard about but few can define Having a shared understanding of innovation matters without it it s hard to get support for the field and the people who work in it If you re confused about innovation and its ramifications on government at large this is what you should read OPSI s deep dive into what public sector innovation is and how it can be harnessed Hooked How to Build Habit Forming Products Nir EyalLet s face it the private sector is simply better at building products and services that people want to use Citizens dread visiting government offices to apply for a driver s license replace a birth certificate or get a marriage license Perhaps if governments took more of a cue from the private sector they might be able to design services citizens are happy to use This book outlines the Hook Model a four step design process that helps nudge user behaviour and encourage habits Even if you aren t involved in service delivery this book will help you understand the importance of good design Invisibles The Power of Anonymous Work in an Age of Relentless Self Promotion David ZweigThis book is for civil servants who work tirelessly for the public good with little to no recognition Some of the world s most important work is done by invisibles from engineers to interpreters to government employees These professions require expertise skill and dedication but the public is scarcely aware of the work they do In this book David Zweig explores how they find job satisfaction what motivates them and how they define success He found that many of these people share the same core traits and identifies how the rest of us can live more fulfilled lives if we follow in their footsteps Getting the Work Done What Government Innovation Really Looks Like Hana Schank Sara HudsonThis report is a frank and insightful look into what s working in the field of government innovation and what isn t More than 60 interviews with city managers services designers product managers engineers and chief innovation officers offer unprecedented insight into what the day to day work of government innovation is like It delves deeply into the major barriers that plague the field including its lack of community and professional development opportunities It s recommended for any public

and skills building programs will be created to meet new demands There are two uncertainties Will well prepared workers be able to keep up in the race with AI tools And will market capitalism survive By Lee Rainie and Janna AndersonMachines are eating humans jobs talents And it s not just about jobs that are repetitive and low skill Automation robotics algorithms and artificial intelligence AI in recent times have shown they can do equal or sometimes even better work than humans who are dermatologists insurance claims adjusters lawyers seismic testers in oil fields sports journalists and financial reporters crew members on guided missile destroyers hiring managers psychological testers retail salespeople and border patrol agents Moreover there is growing anxiety that technology developments on the near horizon will crush the jobs of the millions who drive cars and trucks analyze medical tests and data perform middle management chores dispense medicine trade stocks and evaluate markets fight on battlefields perform government functions and even replace those who program software that is the creators of algorithms People will create the jobs of the future not simply train for them and technology is already central It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead Jonathan GrudinMultiple studies have documented that massive numbers of jobs are at risk as programmed devices many of them smart autonomous systems continue their march into workplaces A recent study by labor economists found that one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment to population ratio by about 0 18 0 34 percentage points and wages by 0 25 0 5 percent When Pew Research Center and Elon University s Imagining the Internet Center asked experts in 2014 whether AI and robotics would create more jobs than they would destroy the verdict was evenly split 48 of the respondents envisioned a future where more jobs are lost than created while 52 said more jobs would be created than lost Since that expert canvassing the future of jobs has been at the top of the agenda at many major conferences globally Several policy and market based solutions have been promoted to address the loss of employment and wages forecast by technologists and economists A key idea emerging from many conversations including one of the lynchpin discussions at the World Economic Forum in 2016 is that changes in educational and learning environments are necessary to help people stay employable in the labor force of the future Among the six overall findings in a new 184 page report from the National Academies of Sciences the experts recommended The education system will need to adapt to prepare individuals for the changing labor market At the same time recent IT advances offer new and potentially more widely accessible ways to access education Jobholders themselves have internalized this insight A 2016 Pew Research Center survey The State of American Jobs found that 87 of workers believe it will be essential for them to get training and develop new job skills throughout their work life in order to keep up with changes in the workplace This survey noted that employment is much higher among jobs that require an average or above average level of preparation including education experience and job training average or above average interpersonal management and communication skills and higher levels of analytical skills such as critical thinking and computer skills A central question about the future then is whether formal and informal learning structures will evolve to meet the changing needs of people who wish to fulfill the workplace expectations of the future Pew Research Center and Elon s Imagining the Internet Center conducted a large scale canvassing of technologists scholars practitioners strategic thinkers and education leaders in the summer of 2016 asking them to weigh in on the likely future of workplace training Some 1 408 responded to the following question sharing their expectations about what is likely to evolve by 2026 In the next 10 years do you think we will see the emergence of new educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers in the skills they will need to perform the jobs of the future The nonscientific canvassing found that 70 of these particular respondents said yes such programs would emerge and be successful A majority among the 30 who said no generally do not believe adaptation in teaching environments will be sufficient to teach new skills at the scale that is necessary to help workers keep abreast of the tech changes that will upend millions of jobs See About this canvassing of experts for further details about the limits of this sample Participants were asked to explain their answers and offered the following prompts to consider Several common expectations were evident in these respondents answers no matter how hopeful or fretful they were about the future of skills and capabilities training efforts It is important to note that many respondents listed human behaviors attributes and competencies in describing desirable work skills Although these aspects of psychology cannot be classified as skills and perhaps cannot be directly taught in any sort of training environment we include these answers under the general heading of skills capabilities and attributes A diversifying education and credentialing ecosystem Most of these experts expect the education marketplace especially online learning platforms to continue to change in an effort to accommodate the widespread needs Some predict employers will step up their own efforts to train and retrain workers Many foresee a significant number of self teaching efforts by jobholders themselves as they take advantage of proliferating online opportunities Respondents see a new education and training ecosystem emerging in which some job preparation functions are performed by formal educational institutions in fairly traditional classroom settings some elements are offered online some are created by for profit firms some are free some exploit augmented and virtual reality elements and gaming sensibilities and a lot of real time learning takes place in formats that job seekers pursue on their own A considerable number of respondents to this canvassing focused on the likelihood that the best education programs will teach people how to be lifelong learners Accordingly some say alternative credentialing mechanisms will arise to assess and vouch for the skills people acquire along the way A focus on nurturing unique human skills that artificial intelligence AI and machines seem unable to replicate Many of these experts discussed in their responses the human talents they believe machines and automation may not be able to duplicate noting that these should be the skills developed and nurtured by education and training programs to prepare people to work successfully alongside AI These respondents suggest that workers of the future will learn to deeply cultivate and exploit creativity collaborative activity abstract and systems thinking complex communication and the ability to thrive in diverse environments One such comment came from Simon Gottschalk a professor in the department of sociology at the University of Nevada Las Vegas The skills necessary at the higher echelons will include especially the ability to efficiently network manage public relations display intercultural sensitivity marketing and generally what author Dan Goleman would call social and emotional intelligence This also includes creativity and just enough critical thinking to move outside the box Another example is the response of Fredric Litto a professor emeritus of communications and longtime distance learning expert from the University of S o Paulo We are now in the transitional stage of employers gradually reducing their prejudice in the hiring of those who studied at a distance and moving in favor of such graduates who in the workplace demonstrate greater proactiveness initiative discipline collaborativeness because they studied online Other respondents mentioned traits including leadership design thinking human meta communication deliberation conflict resolution and the capacity to motivate mobilize and innovate Still others spoke of more practical needs that could help workers in the medium term to work with data and algorithms to implement 3 D modeling and work with 3 D printers or to implement the newly emerging capabilities in artificial intelligence and augmented and virtual reality Jonathan Grudin principal researcher at Microsoft commented People will create the jobs of the future not simply train for them and technology is already central It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead Seriously You re asking about the workforce of the future As if there s going to be one Anonymous scientific editorAbout a third of respondents expressed no confidence in training and education evolving quickly enough to match demands by 2026 Some of the bleakest answers came from some of the most respected technology analysts For instance Jason Hong an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University wrote There are two major components needed for a new kind of training program at this scale political will and a proven technology platform Even assuming that the political will and budget existed there s no platform today that can successfully train large numbers of people MOOCs Massive Open Online Courses have a high dropout rate and have serious questions about quality of instruction They are also struggling with basic issues like identification of individuals taking the courses So in short we can train small numbers of individuals tens of thousands per year using today s community colleges and university systems but probably not more Several respondents argued that job training is not a primary concern at a time when accelerating change in market economies is creating massive economic divides that seem likely to leave many people behind An anonymous scientific editor commented Seriously You re asking about the workforce of the future As if there s going to be one Employers either run sweatshops abroad or hire people in the first world to do jobs that they hate while more and more unskilled and skilled people end up permanently on welfare or zero hour contracts And the relatively job secure qualified people who work in the professions are probably a lot closer than they think they are to going over that same cliff The details of how they earn their credentials aren t going to be an issue Most participants in this canvassing wrote detailed elaborations explaining their positions though they were allowed to respond anonymously Their well considered comments provide insights about hopeful and concerning trends These findings do not represent all possible points of view but they do reveal a wide range of striking observations Respondents collectively articulated five major themes that are introduced and briefly explained in the 29 page section below and then expanded upon in more detailed sections Some responses are lightly edited for style or due to length The following section presents a brief overview of the most evident themes extracted from the written responses including a small selection of representative quotes supporting each point Some responses are lightly edited for style or due to length These experts envision that the next decade will bring a more widely diversified world of education and training options in which various entities design and deliver different services to those who seek to learn They expect that some innovation will be aimed at emphasizing the development of human talents that machines cannot match and at helping humans partner with technology They say some parts of the ecosystem will concentrate on delivering real time learning to workers often in formats that are self taught Commonly occurring ideas among the responses in this category are collected below under headings reflecting subthemes Most experts seem to have faith that rapid technological development and a rising wariness of coming impacts of the AI robotics revolution are going to spur the public private and governmental actions needed for education and training systems to be adapted to deliver more flexible open adaptable resilient certifiable and useful lifelong learning Educators have always found new ways of training the next generation of students for the jobs of the future and this generation will be no different Justin ReichJim Hendler a professor of computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute predicted The nature of education will change to a mix of models College education which will still favor multi year residential education will need to be more focused on teaching students to be lifelong learners followed by more online content in situ training and other such elements to increase skills in a rapidly changing information world As automation puts increasing numbers of low and middle skill workers out of work these models will also provide for certifications and training needs to function in an increasingly automated service sector Michael Wollowski an associate professor of computer science at the Rose Hulman Institute of Technology commented We will definitely see a vast increase in educational and training programs We will also see what might be called on demand or on the job kind of training programs We kind of have to as with continued automation we will need to retrain a large portion of the workforce I strongly believe employers will subscribe to this idea wholeheartedly it increases the overall education of their workforce which benefits their bottom line Nevertheless I am a big believer in the college experience which I see as a way to learn what you are all about as a person and in your field of study The confidence in your own self and your abilities cannot be learned in a short course It takes life experience or four years at a tough college At a good college you are challenged to be your best this is very resource intensive and cannot be scaled at this time Justin Reich executive director at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT Teaching Systems Lab observed Educators have always found new ways of training the next generation of students for the jobs of the future and this generation will be no different Our established systems of job training primarily community colleges and state universities will continue to play a crucial role though catastrophically declining public support for these institutions will raise serious challenges David Karger a professor of computer science at MIT wrote Most of what we now call online learning is little more than glorified textbooks but the future is very promising No matter how good our online teaching systems become the current four year college model will remain dominant for quite some time Online teaching will increase the reach of the top universities which will put pressure on lesser universities to demonstrate value One potential future would be for those universities to abandon the idea that they have faculty teaching their own courses and instead consist entirely of a cadre of less well paid teaching assistants who provide support for the students who are taking courses online A few respondents said already established institutions cannot be as fully successful as new initiatives Jerry Michalski founder at REX commented Today s educational and training institutions are a shambles They take too long to teach impractical skills and knowledge not connected to the real world and when they try to tackle critical thinking for a longer time scale they mostly fail The sprouts of the next generation of learning tools are already visible Within the decade the new shoots will overtake the wilting vines and we will see all sorts of new initiatives mostly outside these schooling academic and training institutions which are mostly beyond repair People will shift to them because they work because they are far less expensive and because they are always available Barry Chudakov founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp says education has been liberated because thanks to digital innovation everyone can embed learning continuously in their everyday lives He wrote The key to education in the next 10 years will be the understanding that we now live in a world without walls and so the walls of the school physical and conceptual need to shatter and never go up again In the hopefully near future we will not segregate schooling from work and real world thinking and development They will seamlessly weave into a braid of learning realization exposure hands on experience and integration into students own lives And again the experience of being a student now confined to grade school secondary school and university will expand to include workers those looking for work and those who want or need to retrain as well as what we now think of as conventional education One way we will break down these walls we are already doing so will be to create digital learning spaces to rival classrooms as places where learning happen s Via simulation gaming digital presentations combined with hands on real world experience learning and re education will move out of books and into the world The more likely enhancement will be to take digital enhancements out into the world again breaking down the walls of the classroom and school to inform and enhance experience An anonymous respondent echoed the sentiment of quite a few others who do not think it is possible to advance and enhance online education and training much in the next decade writing These programs have a cost and too few are willing to sacrifice for these programs More such arguments are included in later sections of this report Some respondents expressed confidence in the best of current online education and training options saying online course options are cost effective evolving for the better and game changing because they are globally accessible Those with the most optimism expect great progress will be made in augmented reality AR virtual reality VR and AI While some say 2026 will still be early days for this tech many are excited about its prospects for enhancing learning in the next decade Already today there are quite effective online training and education systems but they are not being implemented to their full potential Edward FriedmanEdward Friedman professor emeritus of technology management at the Stevens Institute of Technology wrote Already today there are quite effective online training and education systems but they are not being implemented to their full potential These applications will become more widely used with familiarity that is gained during the next decade Also populations will be more tech savvy and be able to make use of these systems with greater personal ease In addition the development of virtual reality AI assistants and other technological advances will add to the effectiveness of these systems There will be a greater need for such systems as the needs for new expertise in the workforce increase and the capacity of traditional education systems proves that it is not capable of meeting the need in a cost effective manner The president of a technology LLC wrote Training teaching are all going online partly because of high costs of campus education Richard Adler distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future predicted AI voice response telepresence VR and gamification techniques will come together to create powerful new learning environments capable of personalizing and accelerating learning across a broad range of fields Ray Schroeder associate vice chancellor for online learning at the University of Illinois Springfield commented It is projected that those entering the workforce today will pursue four or five different careers not just jobs over their lifetime These career changes will require retooling training and education The adult learners will not be able to visit physical campuses to access this learning they will learn online I expect that we will see the further development of artificially intelligent teaching specialists such as Jill Watson at Georgia Tech the virtual graduate assistant who was thought to be human by an entire class of computer science students I anticipate the further development and distribution of holoportation technologies such as those developed by Microsoft using HoloLens for real time three dimensional augmented reality These teaching tools will enable highly sophisticated interactions and engagement with students at a distance They will further fuel the scaling of learning to reach even more massive online classes Fredric Litto an professor emeritus of communications and longtime distance learning expert from the University of S o Paulo replied There is no field of work that cannot be learned totally or in great part in well organized and administered online programs either in traditional course formats or in self directed independent learning opportunities supplemented when appropriate by face to face hands on practice situations Tawny Schlieski research director at Intel and president of the Oregon Story Board explained New technologies of human computer interaction like augmented and virtual reality offer the possibility of entirely new mechanisms of education Augmented and virtual reality tools make learning more experiential they engage students with physical movement and they enable interactive and responsive instructional assets As these tools evolve over the next decade the academics we work with expect to see radical change in training and workforce development which will roll into although probably against a longer timeline more traditional institutions of higher learning Many respondents said real world campus based higher education will continue to thrive during the next decade They generally expect that no other educational experience can match residential universities capabilities for fully immersive person to person learning as well as mentoring and socializing functions before 2026 They said a residential university education helps build intangible skills that are not replicable online and thus deepens the skills base of those who can afford to pay for such an education but they expect that job specific training will be managed by employers on the job and via novel approaches Some say major universities core online course content developed with all of the new tech bells and whistles will be marketed globally and adopted as baseline learning in smaller higher education locales where online elements from major MOOCs can be optimally paired in hybrid learning with in person mentoring activities The most important skills to have in life are gained through interpersonal experiences and the liberal arts Human bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion empathy vulnerability and social emotional intelligence Frank ElavskyUta Russmann communications marketing sales professor at the FHWien University of Applied Sciences in Vienna Austria said In the future more and more jobs will require highly sophisticated people whose skills cannot be trained in mass online programs Traditional four year and graduate programs will better prepare people for jobs in the future as such an education gives people a general understanding and knowledge about their field and here people learn how to approach new things ask questions and find answers deal with new situations etc all this is needed to adjust to ongoing changes in work life Special skills for a particular job will be learned on the job Frank Elavsky data and policy analyst at Acumen LLC responded The most important skills to have in life are gained through interpersonal experiences and the liberal arts Human bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion empathy vulnerability and social emotional intelligence These skills are imperative to focus on as the future is in danger of losing these skillsets from the workforce Many people have gained these skills throughout history without any kind of formal schooling but with the growing emphasis on virtual and digital mediums of production education and commerce people will have less and less exposure to other humans in person and other human perspectives Isto Huvila professor at Uppsala University replied The difference between educating to perform and educating to make the future is the difference between vocational education and higher university education Spending four years at a university is not only about learning skills but about bildung self cultivation and socialising in a group that is capable of fostering collaboration much better than an ad hoc group of people But this does not mean that alternative means and paths of learning and accreditation would not be useful as complementary to the traditional system that has limitations as well Dana Klisanin psychologist futurist at Evolutionary Guidance Media R D wrote Educational institutions that succeed will use the tools of social media and game design to grant students access to teachers from all over the world and increase their motivation to succeed Online educational programs will influence the credentialing systems of traditional institutions and online institutions will increasingly offer meet ups and mingles such that a true hybrid educational approach emerges Will training for skills most important in the jobs of the future work well in large scale settings by 2026 Respondents in this canvassing overwhelmingly said yes anticipating that improvements in such education would continue However many believe the most vital skills are not easy to teach learn or evaluate in any education or training setting available today Dozens of descriptive terms were applied by respondents as they noted the skills capabilities and attributes they see as important in workers lives in the next decade The skills needed to succeed in today s world and the future are curiosity creativity taking initiative multi disciplinary thinking and empathy These skills interestingly are the skills specific to human beings that machines and robots cannot do Tiffany ShlainWhile coding and other hard skills were listed as being easiest to teach to a large group in an online setting soft human skills were seen by most respondents as crucial for survival in the age of AI and robotics Devin Fidler research director at the Institute for the Future predicted As basic automation and machine learning move toward becoming commodities uniquely human skills will become more valuable There will be an increasing economic incentive to develop mass training that better unlocks this value Susan Price a digital architect at Continuum Analytics commented Increasingly machines will perform tasks they are better suited to perform than humans such as computation data analysis and logic Functions requiring emotional intelligence empathy compassion and creative judgment and discernment will expand and be increasingly valued in our culture Tiffany Shlain filmmaker and founder of the Webby Awards wrote The skills needed to succeed in today s world and the future are curiosity creativity taking initiative multi disciplinary thinking and empathy These skills interestingly are the skills specific to human beings that machines and robots cannot do and you can be taught to strengthen these skills through education I look forward to seeing innovative live and online programs that can teach these at scale Ben Shneiderman professor of computer science at the University of Maryland observed Students can be trained to be more innovative creative and active initiators of novel ideas Skills of writing speaking and making videos are important but fundamental skills of critical thinking community building teamwork deliberation dialogue and conflict resolution will be powerful A mindset of persistence and the necessary passion to succeed are also critical Louisa Heinrich founder at Superhuman Limited commented Lateral and system thinking skills are increasingly critical for success in an ever changing global landscape and these will need to be re prioritised at all levels of education An anonymous technologist commented Programming and problem solving learning how to work with artificial intelligence and robotics will become more important and more and more workers will be replaced by software hardware based workers Automation will reduce the need for the current workforce and the divide between the upper class and the lower class will continue to eat the middle class Some who are pessimistic about the future of human work due to advances in capable AI and robotics mocked the current push in the U S to train more people in technical skills An anonymous respondent commented Teach a billion people to program and you ll end up with 900 000 000 unemployed programmers An anonymous program director for a major U S technology funding organization predicted We will see training for the jobs of the past and for service jobs The jobs of the future will not need large numbers of workers with a fixed set of skills most things that we can train large numbers of workers for we will also be able to train computers to do better Among the many other skills mentioned were process oriented and system oriented thinking journalistic skills including research evaluation of multiple sources writing and speaking understanding algorithms computational thinking networking and programming grasping law and policy an evidence based way of looking at the world time management conflict resolution decision making locating information in the flood of data storytelling using data and influencing and consensus building A few people mentioned that young adults need to be taught how to have face to face interaction including one who said they seem to be sorely lacking in these skills and can only interact with a cellphone or laptop Because so many intricacies of the workplace the human soft and hard are learned on the job respondents said they expect apprenticeships and forms of mentoring will regain value and evolve along with the 21st century workplace D Yvette Wohn assistant professor of information systems at the New Jersey Institute of Technology wrote Formalized apprenticeships that require both technical skills and interpersonal interaction will become more important Ian O Byrne an assistant professor of literacy education at the College of Charleston replied In the future we ll see more opportunities for online personalized learning This will include open online learning experiences e g MOOCs where individuals can lurk and build up capacity or quench interests I also believe that we ll see a rise in the offering of premium or pay content that creates a space where one to one learning and interaction will allow mentors to guide learners while providing critical feedback We will identify opportunities to build a digital version of the apprenticeship learning models that have existed in the past Alternative credentials and digital badges will provide more granular opportunities to document and archive learning over time from traditional and nontraditional learning sources Through evolving technologies e g blockchain this may provide opportunities for learners to document and frame their own learning pathways An instructional designer with 19 years of experience commented The pattern I m seeing is toward individualized learning almost on the level of tutoring or apprenticeship We ve seen again and again that the broader the audience focus the less the course seems to deliver As for what the skills of the future are they ll be specialized to their fields with a university degree assumed to be a certificate in the ability to learn more about a particular subject specialty You may get a degree in computer software development but the truth is that you still need to be taught how to write software for say the mortgage company or insurance company that hires you The key to the future will be flexibility and personal motivation to learn and tinker with new things As they anticipate the appearance of effective new learning environments and advances in digital accountability systems many of these experts believe fresh certification programs will be created to attest to workers participation in training programs and the mastery of skills Some predict that many more workers will begin using online and app based learning systems Charlie Firestone communications and society program executive director and vice president at The Aspen Institute replied There will be a move toward more precise and better credentialing for skills and competencies e g badging and similar techniques Employers will accept these more as they prove probative And online learning will be more prevalent even as an adjunct to formal classroom learning New industries such as green energy and telemedicine will increase new employment opportunities Despite all of these measures the loss of jobs from artificial intelligence and robotics will exceed any retraining program at least in the short run Sam Punnett research officer at TableRock Media wrote I suspect employers will recognize the new credentialing systems Particularly those certificates awarded for studies in emerging disciplines currently data science appears all the rage and those that reflect an upgrade of previously acquired skills Traditional credentials will continue to hold value but I believe they will be considered in light of a candidates perceived ability in learning how to learn The four year degree and subsequent graduate studies will continue to be less of a guaranty towards employment without work experience Certificates are being viewed more favourably and many universities are lagging in their connection between their pedagogies and working world requirements William J Ward a university communications professor DR4WARD commented Higher Education is doing a poor job of preparing students with the skills they need to succeed in the workforce Online and credentialing systems are more transparent and do a better job on delivering skills People with new types of credentialing systems are seen as more qualified than traditional four year and graduate programs Many workplaces place a higher value on real world work portfolios than they do on a degree or certification yet their hiring systems including AI bots programmed to scan resum s still use the commonly accepted credentials as a basis for interviewing candidates Some respondents hope to see change Schools today turn out widget makers who can make widgets all the same They are built on producing single right answers rather than creative solutions Jeff JarvisA software engineering and system administration professional commented The reliability of the traditional educational system is already being questioned in some fields it s considered common sense that certifications and degrees mean little and that a portfolio references and hands on interviews are much more important for assessing a candidate s ability The unfortunate reality is that many HR departments still post job listings saying degrees and certifications are required as a way of screening candidates Both of those cost a lot of money and neither mean a lot for a candidate s competence I hope this will change both job listings and quality of degrees certifications but don t see it happening soon Meryl Krieger career specialist at Indiana University Bloomington s Jacobs School replied Credentialing systems will involve portfolios as much as resum s resum s simply are too two dimensional to properly communicate someone s skillset Three dimensional materials in essence job reels that demonstrate expertise will be the ultimate demonstration of an individual worker s skills I see credentialing as a piece of a very complex set of criteria these will also incorporate an individual s ability to communicate and work with teams huge in employer requests for new employees which can more readily be documented and tracked through online portfolio tools than through traditional resume formats Thus the educational and training programs of the future will become in their best incarnations sophisticated combinations of classroom and hands on training programs The specific models will necessarily be responding to individual industry requirements Jeff Jarvis a professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism wrote Schools today turn out widget makers who can make widgets all the same They are built on producing single right answers rather than creative solutions They are built on an outmoded attention economy Pay us for 45 hours of your attention and we will certify your knowledge I believe that many not all areas of instruction should shift to competency based education in which the outcomes needed are made clear and students are given multiple paths to achieve those outcomes and they are certified not based on tests and grades but instead on portfolios of their work demonstrating their knowledge While the first three themes found among the responses to this canvassing were mostly hopeful about advances in education and training for 21st century jobs a large share of responses from top experts reflect a significant degree of pessimism for various reasons Some even say the future of jobs for humans is so baleful that capitalism may fail as an economic system The next themes and subthemes examine these responses A large share of respondents predicted that online formats for knowledge transfer will not advance significantly in the next decade The 30 who expressed pessimism were often deeply doubtful about the capabilities of current education systems to adapt to pivot to respond to new challenges as quickly as necessary Interestingly being able to adapt and respond to looming challenges was seen by nearly everyone in this canvassing as one of the most highly prized future capabilities these respondents especially agree that it is important and they say that our human institutions government business education are not adapting efficiently and are letting us down Many of them say that current K 12 or K 16 education programs are incapable of making adjustments within the next decade to serve the shifting needs of future jobs markets Among the other reasons listed by people who do not expect these kinds of transformative advances in job creation and job skill upgrading Some among the 70 of respondents who are mostly optimistic about the future of training for jobs also echoed one or more of the points above mentioning these tension points while hoping for the best Following are representative statements tied to these points and more from all respondents Thomas Claburn editor at large at Information Week wrote I m skeptical that educational and training programs can keep pace with technology Traditional models train people to equate what they do with who they are i e what do you want to be when you grow up rather than to acquire critical thinking and flexible skills and attitudes that fit a rapidly changing world Pamela RutledgeAndrew Walls managing vice president at Gartner wrote Barring a neuroscience advance that enables us to embed knowledge and skills directly into brain tissue and muscle formation there will be no quantum leap in our ability to up skill people Learning takes time and practice which means it requires money lots of money to significantly change the skill set of a large cohort B Remy Cross assistant professor of sociology Webster University commented Lacking a significant breakthrough in machine learning that could lead to further breakthroughs in adaptive responses by a fully online system it is too hard to adequately instruct large numbers of people in the kinds of soft skills that are anticipated as being in most demand As manufacturing and many labor intensive jobs move overseas or are fully mechanized we will see a bulge in service jobs These require good people skills something that is often hard to train online John Bell software developer and teacher at Dartmouth College replied Even today access to information is not the limiting factor in skills education for anyone who can go online While there have been generational gains in the developments of online communities a large scale educational experience either MOOC or on demand broadcasts will not be able to duplicate that Stowe Boyd managing director of Another Voice and a well known thinker on work futures discussed the intangibles of preparing humans to partner with AI and bot systems While we may see the creation and rollout of new training programs he observed it s unclear whether they will be able to retrain those displaced from traditional sorts of work to fit into the workforce of the near future Many of the skills that will be needed are more like personality characteristics like curiosity or social skills that require enculturation to take hold Individual training like programming or learning how to cook may not be what will be needed And employers may play less of a role especially as AI and bot augmented independent contracting may be the best path for many rather than a job Homesteading in exurbia may be the answer for many with forty acres and a bot as a political campaign slogan of 2024 Luis Miron a distinguished university professor and director of the Institute for Quality and Equity in Education at Loyola University in New Orleans wrote Bluntly speaking I have little confidence in the educational sector K 16 having the capacity and vision to offer high quality online educational programs capable of transforming the training needs of the wider society The most important skills are advanced critical thinking and knowledge of globalization affecting diverse societies culturally religiously and politically Pamela Rutledge director of the Media Psychology Research Center wrote The core assumptions driving educational content are not adapting as fast as the world is changing Traditional models train people to equate what they do with who they are i e what do you want to be when you grow up rather than to acquire critical thinking and flexible skills and attitudes that fit a rapidly changing world We have traditional institutions invested in learning as a supply side model rather than demand side that would create proactive self directed learners This bias impacts the entire process from educators to employers It is changing but beliefs are sticky and institutions are cumbersome bureaucracies that are slow to adapt New delivery systems for skills related to technology will be more readily accepted than traditional ones because they avoid much of the embedded bias Successful education models will begin developing mixed methods to leverage technology with traditional delivery and rewrite certification processes with practice relevant standards Justin Reich executive director at the MIT Teaching Systems Lab observed There will continue to be for profit actors in the sector and while some may offer choice and opportunity for students many others will be exploitative with a great er focus on extracting federal grants and burdening students with debt than actually educating students and creating new opportunities John Paine a business analyst commented The competing desires 1 to make educational activity available to all and 2 to monetize the bejeezus out of anything related to the internet will limit the effectiveness of any online learning systems in a more widespread context danah boyd founder of Data Society commented I have complete faith in the ability to identify job gaps and develop educational tools to address those gaps I have zero confidence in us having the political will to address the socio economic factors that are underpinning skill training For example companies won t pay for reskilling and we don t have the political power to tax them at the level needed for public investment in reskilling Furthermore we have serious geographic mismatches underlying discriminatory attitudes and limited opportunities for lower to mid level career advancement What s at stake are not simply skills gaps it s about how we want to architect labor benefits and social safety nets And right now we talk about needing to increase skills but that s not what employers care about It just sounds nice When computer science graduates from CUNY and Howard University can t get a job what s at stake is not skills training Among the future worker capabilities with the highest value in these respondents eyes are the ability to adapt or pivot and the motivation to up skill as needed Many respondents emphasized that the most crucial skill is that people have to learn how to learn and be self motivated to keep learning My biggest concern with self directed learning is that it requires a great deal of internal motivation And I am not confident that individuals will find their way David BersteinDavid Bernstein a former research director wrote The most important skills needed to succeed in the workplace will be flexibility and the ability to adapt and continuously learn My biggest concern with self directed learning is that it requires a great deal of internal motivation And I am not confident that individuals will find their way just as those who enter college today don t know what they want to be when they grow up often until after they graduate So everyone will still need some basic skills interpersonal communications basic arithmetic along with some general culture awareness so they can have that flexibility Any 3 year old can use their parent s smartphone or tablet without reading the manual What I worry about is how well they will adapt when they are 35 or 55 Calton Pu professor and junior chair in software at the Georgia Institute of Technology wrote The most important skill is a meta skill the ability to adapt to changes This ability to adapt is what distinguished Homo sapiens from other species through natural selection As the rate of technological innovation intensifies the workforce of the future will need to adapt to new technology and new markets The people who can adapt the best and fastest will win This view means that any given set of skills will become obsolete quickly as innovations change the various economic sectors precision agriculture manufacturing 4 0 precision medicine just to name a few Therefore the challenge is not only to teach skills but also how to adapt and learn new skills Whether the traditional programs or new programs will be better at teaching adaptive learning remains to be seen Cory Salveson learning systems and analytics lead at RSM US responded The nature of work today and in future is such that if people want to keep increasingly scarce well paying jobs they will need to educate themselves in an ongoing manner for their whole lives Some of these experts say those who aren t motivated to continue to learn and grow will be left behind Scott Amyx CEO of Amyx said online training is advancing and will continue to evolve but The education system is at an inflection point Many ambitious federal and state programs have fizzled to produce dismal to no statistical change in the caliber of K 12 education It s those less educated and less skilled who are most sensitive to technological displacement Online mediums and self directed approaches may be limited in effectiveness with certain labor segments unless supplemented by human coaching and support systems Beth Corzo Duchardt a professor at Muhlenberg College replied Self directed study is a variable that changes the alchemy of teaching and learning It is true that most online courses require self direction Indeed when I advise students I don t recommend that students take online courses unless they have demonstrated an aptitude for self direction But in person courses may also be self directed This works well for some students but not others Students who are self directed often have had a very good foundational education and supportive parents They have been taught to think critically and they know that the most important thing you can learn is how to learn And they are also are more likely to come from economic privilege So not only does the self direction factor pose a problem for teaching at scale the fact that a high degree of self direction may be required for successful completion of coursework towards the new workforce means that existing structures of inequality will be replicated in the future if we rely on these large scale programs Among the 30 of respondents who said they did not think things would turn out well in the future were those who said the trajectory of technology will overwhelm labor markets killing more jobs than it creates They foresee a society where AI programs and machines do most of the work and raise questions about people s sense of identity the socio economic divisions that already distress them their ability to pay for basic needs their ability to use the growing amount of leisure time constructively and the impact of all of this on economic systems It should also be noted that many among the 70 who expect positive change in the next decade also expressed some of these concerns The problem of future jobs is not one of skills training it is one of diminishing jobs How will we cope with a workforce that is simply irrelevant Jennifer ZickermanCory Doctorow activist in residence at MIT Media Lab and co owner of Boing Boing boingboing net responded It s an article of faith that automation begets more jobs than it displaces in the long run but this is a theory free observation based on previous automation booms The current automation is based on general purpose technologies machine learning Turing complete computers a universal network architecture that is equally optimized for all applications and there s good reason to believe that this will be more disruptive and create fewer new jobs than those that came before Glenn Ricart Internet Hall of Fame member and founder and chief technology officer of US Ignite said Up to the present time automation largely has been replacing physical drudgery and repetitive motion things that can and should improve the quality of people s work lives But in the next decade or two there is likely to be a significant amount of technological innovation in machine intelligence and personal assistants that takes a real swipe out of the jobs we want humans to have in education health care transportation agriculture and public safety What are the new jobs we want these people to have If we haven t been able to invent them in response to international trade pacts why are we sure we will be able to create them in the future Richard Stallman Internet Hall of Fame member and president of the Free Software Foundation commented I think this question has no answer I think there won t be jobs for most people a few decades from now and that s what really matters As for the skills for the employed fraction of advanced countries I think they will be difficult to teach You could get better at them by practice but you couldn t study them much Jennifer Zickerman an entrepreneur commented The problem of future jobs is not one of skills training it is one of diminishing jobs How will we cope with a workforce that is simply irrelevant The question isn t how to train people for nonexistent jobs it s how to share the wealth in a world where we don t need most people to work Nathaniel BorensteinNathaniel Borenstein chief scientist at Mimecast replied I challenge the premise of this question that humans will have to be trained for future jobs The jobs of the future are likely to be performed by robots The question isn t how to train people for nonexistent jobs it s how to share the wealth in a world where we don t need most people to work Paul Davis a director based in Australia predicted Whilst such programs will be developed and rolled out on a large scale I question their overall effectiveness Algorithms automation and robotics will result in capital no longer needing labor to progress the economic agenda Labor becomes in many ways surplus to economic requirements This shift will dramatically transform the notion of economic growth and significantly disrupt social contracts labor s bargaining position will be dramatically weakened The nature of this change may require the world to shift to a Post Economic Growth model to avoid societal dislocation and disruption John Sniadowski a systems architect replied The skill sets which could have been taught will be superseded by AI and other robotic technology By the time the training programs are widely available the required skills will no longer be required The whole emphasis of training must now be directed towards personal life skills development rather than the traditional working career based approach There is also the massive sociological economic impact of general automation and AI that must be addressed to redistribute wealth and focus life skills at lifelong learning Tom Sommerville agile coach wrote Our greatest economic challenges over the next decade will be climate change and the wholesale loss of most jobs to automation We urgently need to explore how to distribute the increasing wealth of complex goods and services our civilization produces to a populace that will be increasingly jobless in the traditional sense The current trend of concentrating wealth in the hands of a diminishing number of ultra rich individuals is unsustainable All of this while dealing with the destabilizing effects of climate change and the adaptations necessary to mitigate its worst impacts Some of these experts projected further out into the future imagining a world where the machines themselves learn and overtake core human emotional and cognitive capacities Timothy C Mack managing principal at AAI Foresight said In the area of skill building the wild card is the degree to which machine learning begins to supplant social creative and emotive skill sets This section features responses by several more of the many top analysts who participated in this canvassing Following this wide ranging set of comments on the topic a much more expansive set of quotations directly tied to the set of four themes begins on Page 40 Baratunde Thurston a director s fellow at MIT Media Lab Fast Company columnist and former digital director of The Onion replied Online training and certification will grow significantly in part due to the high expense of formal higher education along with its declining payoffs for certain occupations Why go 100 000 in debt for a four year university when you can take a more targeted course with more guaranteed income generation potential at the end From the employer perspective this type of learning will only grow We are creating a system of on demand labor akin to cloud based labor where companies provision labor resources at will and release them at will not by the year or month but by the job labor unit or small time unit including minutes The automation of human labor will grow significantly And having a workforce trained in discrete and atomizable bits of skills will be seen as a benefit by employers This of course is a terrible soulless insecure life for the workers but since when did that really change anything There will also be a parallel call for benefits professional development and compensation that smooths out the rough patches in this on demand labor life but such efforts will lag behind the exploitation of said labor because big business has more resources and big tech moves too fast for human scale responses of accountability and responsibility To quote Donald Trump Sad Doc Searls journalist speaker and director of Project VRM at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society wrote I don t expect the evolution of work in the connected world to require new educational and training programs Instead I expect we ll see much more adaptive forms of education especially of the self made kind Look at Linux and open source development The world runs on both now and they employ millions of human beings Many or most of the new open source programmers building and running our world today are self taught or teach each other to a higher degree than they are educated by formal schooling Look at Khan Academy and the home schooling movement both of which in many ways outperform formal institutional education The main qualification for programming work isn t a degree It s proven capability This model for employment of self and others will also spread to other professions By the way I don t like the term job It demeans work and reduces the worker to a position in an org chart The great educator John Taylor Gatto who won many awards for his teaching and rarely obeyed curricular requirements says nearly all attempts to reform education make it worse We are by nature learning animals We are each also very different both from each other and from who we were yesterday As a society we need to take advantage of that and nurture our natural hunger for knowledge and productive work while respecting and encouraging our diversity a fundamental balancing feature of all nature human and otherwise Jeff Jarvis professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism wrote At a roundtable on the future convened by Union Square Ventures a few years ago I heard this economic goal presented We need to see the marginal cost of teaching another student fall to zero to see true innovation come to education allowing change to occur outside the tax based and thus safe confines of public education I don t think we ll ever reach zero MOOCs are not the solution But we will likely see a radical economic disruption in education using new tools and means to learn and certify learning and that is the way by which we will manage to train many more people in many new skills Cory Doctorow activist in residence at MIT Media Lab and co owner of Boing Boing boingboing net responded There is for the immediate and medium term a huge shortage of IT talent of course especially security researchers and professionals In part this is driven by the legal and educational framework that takes a zero tolerance approach to the hacking that kids historically engaged in on their way to becoming security researchers If a kid today hacks her school s censoring firewall to look at a blocked site she is expelled and possibly arrested not streamed into an Advanced Placement computer science class We also have a poorly constituted math curriculum for understanding algorithms which is really understanding the statistics of machine learning models An earlier and more enduring focus on stats and statistical literacy which can readily be taught using current affairs for example analyzing the poll numbers from elections the claims made by climate change scientists or even the excellent oral arguments in the Supreme Court Texas abortion law case would impart skills that transferred well into IT programming and especially security Amy Webb futurist and CEO at the Future Today Institute commented Gill Pratt a former program manager of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA recently warned of a Cambrian Explosion of robotics About 500 000 years ago Earth experienced its first Cambrian Explosion a period of rapid cellular evolution and diversification that resulted in the foundation of life as we know it today We are clearly in the dawn of a new age one that is marked not just by advanced machines but rather machines that are starting to learn how to think Soon those machines that can think will augment humankind helping to unlock our creative and industrial potential Some of the workforce will find itself displaced by automation That includes anyone whose primary job functions are transactional bank tellers drivers mortgage brokers However there are many fields that will begin to work alongside smart machines doctors journalists teachers The most important skill of any future worker will be adaptability This current Cambrian Explosion of machines will mean diversification in our systems our interfaces our code Workers who have the temperament and fortitude to quickly learn new menu screens who can find information quickly and the like will fare well I do not see the wide scale emergence of training programs during the next 10 years due to the emergence of smart machines alone If there are unanticipated external events environmental disasters new pandemics and the like that could devastate a country s economy and significantly impact its workforce which might catalyze the development of online learning opportunities Mike Roberts Internet Hall of Fame member and first president and CEO of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN responded MOOCs and related efforts are in their infancy so yes there will be considerable expansion as more is learned about what works and what doesn t work These developments are contributing to a crisis of self confidence in higher ed where traditional scholarship is being challenged on many fronts including the basic definition of education Human brains are complex and it becomes tiresome to see simplistic approaches to education issues Generally an educated person possesses a level of knowledge about the world that allows him or her to use analytical skills induction deduction probability etc to arrive at conclusions that guide behavior The jury is very much out on the extent to which acquisition of knowledge and reasoning skills requires human interaction We now have empirical evidence that a substantial percentage half or more can be gained through self study using computer assisted techniques The path forward for society as a whole is strewn with obstacles of self interest ignorance flawed economics etc If one believes in the singularity it doesn t matter because human machine symbiosis will bury the problem Judith Donath of Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society replied A lot has been written about the need for STEM science technology engineering and mathematics education Here I want to focus on other areas 1 Teaching and Healing As computers robots and other machines take over many jobs we need to reposition the social status of jobs that involve interpersonal care day care teachers nurse elderly coach The issue is not just training but cultural re evaluation of teaching and healing as highly respected skills While technology can assist with this work we mustn t lose sight of the importance of human connections as an end in and of themselves 2 Craft and Repair For the benefit of both the individual and the environment we need to strongly support learning design craft building repair Few of us make anything we use from the building we live in to the objects we own and these things are mostly manufactured as cheaply as possible to be easily bought discarded and bought again in a process of relentless acquisition that often brings little happiness Education here should be integrated into everyday life not just for when one is in school E g much rental housing is in bad repair with tenants waiting weeks months years for even simple fixes a running toilet broken lights a hole in a wall Very easily accessible learning for how to fix these things themselves and making it economically rewarding in the case of a common good is a simple basic example of the kind of ubiquitous craft learning that at scale would be enormously valuable Some of this can be taught online a key component is also online coordination 3 An Informed Citizen What should people know what skills should they have to be informed participants in a democracy Certainly science and technology are important but we need to refocus liberal education not ignore it History in all its complexity Critical thinking how to debate how to recognize persuasive techniques how to understand multiple perspectives how to mediate between different viewpoints Key skill how to research how to evaluate what you see and read David Weinberger a senior researcher at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society said Judging from what we re seeing happening now on the web it seems likely that many of the innovative platforms will be peer to peer Sites like Stack Overflow for software engineers demonstrate a new moral sense that learning in private is selfish Public learning is becoming the norm Brad Templeton chair for computing at Singularity University wrote We will see the start of these technologies but they will not be widespread at the hard problem of adult retraining in 10 years Instead most focus will be on childhood education for the poorer sectors of the world The most important skill flexibility won t be taught easily this way but must become a focus of K 12 education John Markoff former senior writer at The New York Times said We have now passed through the first generation of MOOCs and a new generation of online learning technology is beginning to emerge Udacity is a good example of the trajectory Sebastian Thrun was one of the inventors of the MOOC concept After starting a company to pursue the idea he pivoted focusing specifically on skill oriented education that is coupled directly to the job market Vint Cerf vice president and chief internet evangelist at Google and an Internet Hall of Fame member noted The internet can support remote training and learning These need not be MOOCs Even mobiles can be sources of education I hope we will see more opportunities arising for sharing this kind of knowledge Marcel Bullinga trend watcher and keynote speaker futurecheck replied The future is cheap and so is the future of education I saw an ad already for 1 000 bachelor s level training with an app of course Schools and universities will transform in the same way as shops have done in the past 10 years from analog human first to digital mobile AI first New online credential systems will first complement then gradually replace the old ones The skills of the future Those are the skills a robot cannot master yet Leadership design human meta communication critical thinking motivating cooperating innovating In my black and white moments I say Skip all knowledge training in high schools Main teaching goal We enable you to survive in an ever changing world with ever changing skills and not yet existing jobs of the future We make you better than a robot We let you cooperate with robots We build your self trust We turn you into a decent polite social person And most importantly we do not mix education with religion never Anil Dash entrepreneur technologist and advocate AnilDash predicted These credentials will start to become widespread but acceptance and quality of the training programs will map to the existing systemic biases that inform current educational and career programs Henning Schulzrinne Internet Hall of Fame member and professor at Columbia University wrote Training programs have had the problem that short duration generic programs are often not very effective except as a way to incrementally add very specific skills learn how to operate the new industry specific tool X in a week to the existing repertoire The subject matter specific part of a B S degree in a technical or scientific field takes at least two years often more and these are high intensity full time years often without other responsibilities such as family mostly for students at an age where learning is still natural and easy A large part of this time is spent not in a classroom but becoming fluent through monitored practice including group work internships and other high intensity high interaction apprentice like programs It is hard to see how workers can afford to spend two years without income support while still fulfilling their adult responsibilities such as taking care of their family or elderly parents There are possibilities for adding limited skill sets to otherwise qualified workers e g the ability to program in Python for somebody who already has an economics degree increasing their ability to get their work done The MOOC style programs have shown themselves to be most effective for this delta learning for practicing professionals not turning a high school graduate into somebody who can compete with a college graduate Jamais Cascio distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future responded We will certainly see attempts to devise training and education to match workers to new jobs but for the most part they re likely to fall victim to two related problems 1 The difficulty of projecting what will be the jobs of the future in a world where the targets keep shifting faster and faster Jobs that seem viable may fall victim to a surprising development in automation see for example filmmaking new categories of work may not last long enough to support large numbers of employees 2 We re in an era of general purpose computing which means that our systems are not physically or procedurally limited to a narrow type of work Automation and semi automation e g self checkout stands don t need to completely eliminate a job to make it unable to support large numbers of workers As learning systems improve we will soon if we re not already be at a point where adaptive algorithms can learn new jobs faster than humans Kate Crawford a well known internet researcher studying how people engage with networked technologies wrote We clearly need new educational and training programs to address the deepening precarity of the labor market But to make it successful in that the right training could be developed to make it possible that everyone will have jobs is very unlikely Paul Jones clinical professor and director at the University of North Carolina replied We learn more today by training and information sipping than in the past Training is useful but not the end of education only a kind of education As for sipping you need not know the name of every bear to know you should avoid bears Yet the continual construction of knowledge and cultures requires more from us So far training formally as in Kahn Academy and Lynda com are unarguably effective for continual updates for basic skills No programmer or developer could keep up without the informal training of Stack Overflow Wikipedia hasn t destroyed bar trivia but it has made a dent in our conversational expertise Who played guitar lead on All or Nothing No need for debate A little information sip will let us know We re fine and informed but not educated or learned But what is left out Collaborative construction of knowledge in new areas deeper investigation into known areas and the discovery of entirely new areas of knowledge This is our challenge how to create wisdom from knowledge not just jobs from training and information Bob Frankston internet pioneer and software innovator commented This is a nuanced question We trained generations of people to be phone operators by making it easy to operate the phone aka dialing Today programming is increasingly become a trade The problem with many websites is not so much the training of the programmers as much as getting managers and C level people who understand the new concepts of a world being redefined by software And that s even more true for policymakers We need to think about co evolving work and workers And as always critical thinking will remain the biggest challenge Frank Pasquale author of The Black Box Society The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information and professor of law at the University of Maryland said The biggest danger for the United States educational system is premature vocationalism Rigorous science and humanities courses help students learn how to learn Skills training all too often does not Of course it can complement core academic courses and is likely to be part of a lifetime of learning for those switching occupations But turning high school and college into narrow vocational education programs would make their graduates more vulnerable to robotic replacement not less We need to invest in higher education shoring up support for traditional universities and colleges lest they eventually become bastions for reproduction of an elite leaving the rest of society to untested experiments or online programs Online learning is a good complement for existing colleges but cannot replace them Online only programs emphasize the upside of high tech approaches but rarely grapple with the downside Big data surveillance will track the work students do ostensibly in order to customize learning Get stuck on a lesson Just keep interfacing with a keyboard camera and perhaps haptic sensors Or perhaps IM some reserve army of tutorial labor via digital labor platforms like Mechanical Turk or TaskRabbit Want to prove you aren t faking exams Just let cameras record your every move and keystroke perhaps your eye movements and facial expressions too With new platforms Silicon Valley has lured some universities into giving away lectures for free The colleges think they re establishing good karma with the public but disrupters hope for a more chaotic endgame students deciding to watch free courses then proving their credentials to certifiers who give out badges to signify competence in a skill set The certifiers most likely won t be burdened with any of the teaching research community service counseling career or otherwise recreation social events extracurriculars or other long standing features of residential university communities They will just verify that student X can do task Y It could be a very profitable business If students pay less for actual instruction by experts they have more money to spend on badges This is the for profit model shift money away from instruction and amenities and toward administrator salaries and marketing Unburdened by legacy staff and faculty ed tech firms could muster a just in time workforce to develop new educational technologies Investors could continue unbundling the university into least cost providers of content units student surveillance and badge granting That vision may draw capital but it probably won t be attractive to many students There are serious worries about rapid centralization and reuse of student data by under regulated firms For instance black boxed instructional technology is often run by algorithms that can t be accessed by the students it is assessing Tom Ryan CEO of eLearn Institute Inc responded The degree and perhaps the prestige of the institution gets you the first interview but it is your ability to do good work that keeps the job and move s you to the next level How individuals develop the skills will be less important than having the skills As mastery learning evolves so will our performance based assessment systems providing universities and businesses a greater set of evidence and qualifications then is currently available Our traditional educational systems are burdened by legacy bureaucratic practices that don t contribute to mastery of learning and distract from great teaching and learning People in rural areas don t have physical access to a higher education campus or highly skilled trainers Current job responsibilities don t allow flexible work schedules to seek skills to improve their position K 12 teachers are constantly pulled from class time with students for professional development or during class are required to take attendance complete grade assessments fill out grade checks practice fire drills all degrading quality teaching time If online systems just removed these barriers they would be a great benefit but there is so much more these systems can offer Many of the new skills necessary for jobs of the future require digital skills to be successful Too often education leaders and politicians make unilateral decisions about the interaction between teacher and learner instead of building and maintaining an environment for great teaching and learning to take place Large school systems can t scale major improvements in current systems without leveraging the tools that society and industry are using to transform their practice Barry Chudakov founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp replied One serious drawback to fast tracking needed educational and training programs the people who are creating the jobs of the future have so little time to reflect and gain perspective on the people they will need and how adding these people to their corporate culture changes that culture These entrepreneurs are so busy building technology infrastructures filing patents testing beta incarnations of ideas and processes not to mention navigating the thicket of regulations and restrictions that surround many emerging technologies and industries that they simply don t have time to look around and see the implications of the changes their companies are creating In the near future we will explode the notion of education as a rite of passage for youth happening within the walls of an institution Educational institutions will not disappear but they will change in ways that make them almost unrecognizable by today s models Just as Pokemon Go lifts people out of their chairs into real world environments to explore imaginary captures we will change learning from a passive to an active dynamic experience Three dynamics that will affect all learning and retraining efforts 1 Newer tools are changing our sense of identity 2 We are moving from the fixed point of view that the book gave us to a multiple simultaneous narrative of flow in a networked environment 3 Again since what we think is what we think through we are applying that logic of visual presentation to our presentation and sense of self The first skill needed to succeed in the workforce of the future will be the ability to understand manage and manipulate data Everyone in a technology based profession will need to be a quant quantitative analyst or keep up with the quants Because all human processes and activities can now be quantified and there is considerable exploration and technology development in the application of quantification to everything from our sleep patterns and shopping habits to our emotions and online behaviors many new and important business models are emerging from quantification and the learning algorithms that drive it The second and much more important skill needed to succeed in the workforce of the future will be the ability to find meaning and value in data combined with the problem condition or opportunity the data is outlining Said simply the greatest skill will be the ability to think through the cloud of facts data experience and strategic direction that products and services require Design thinking or visual thinking will be a critical part of managing a data driven world Data mining and management can be taught effectively Thinking problem solving reflection and visioning are difficult to teach at scale Elisabeth Gee professor at Arizona State University and author of What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy commented First many jobs of the future won t require workers with a lot of training Second degrees and credentials have been increasingly promoted by institutions more driven by profit than an interest in preparing students in any meaningful way for employment If the government doesn t step in to restrict such institutions we ll continue to see students graduate with huge debt and little prospect of decent employment Lastly we don t need large scale training of workers we need real education not job focused and opportunities for people to pursue diverse pathways for career development and lifelong learning Patrick Tucker technology editor at Defense One and author of The Naked Future observed Online education offers the opportunity to gather data on student performance continuously or telemetrically What telemetric education offers is the opportunity to continuously and constantly evaluate a student to gain a much more comprehensive understanding of ability retention of information even how other behaviors and factors such as time of day other calendar items nutrition amount of time on Pokemon Go influence learning It offers a more true moving score Learning will become easier and much more of it will happen outside of school settings all of which will diminish the importance of schools and teachers as we know them today But platforms like Coursera can amplify the talents of gifted and effective instructors and reduce the cost of education in the coming decade for all Some schools and colleges will thrive and prosper at a level not seen in their history But they will do so only by transitioning away from today s classroom model toward something else like data driven skills workshops at the high school level and startup incubators or problem solving workshops at the college level We may be conflicted about replacing classes with platforms but if we are to be honest with ourselves we know that we can t prepare coming generations for the challenges of a technological and globalized economy the same way we prepared previous generations to be factory workers The greatest thinker of the 21st century whoever he or she is will understand more about how she thinks and learns than any student in any previous generation and all before ever stepping foot inside a schoolhouse Imagine for a moment the power of knowing beforehand how well you would perform on a test Laura Matzen of Sandia National Laboratory and some of her colleagues have demonstrated that the brain s electrical activity detectable via electroencephalogram EEG predicts how well studied material has been incorporated into memory and thus how well a subject will perform on memory tests Telemetric education also offers the opportunity for everyone to raise his or her hand and be heard That opportunity doesn t come easily in a crowded classroom especially not for women or minority students many of whom feel that if they ask the wrong question or display ignorance they ll confirm some unflattering broadly held perception about their social group David Golumbia associate professor of digital studies at Virginia Commonwealth University commented As an educator I am completely unconvinced by the current rhetoric that says our educational system is unable to meet the needs of current or future workforces This whole argument is a sham meant to attack the fundamental purpose and basis of education Most empirical evidence shows that the premises of this question are incorrect most high skilled jobs of the sort implied here have an oversupply of qualified talent We need more of an emphasis on the fundamental purpose of education not on skills Stephen Downes researcher at the National Research Council of Canada commented We will see educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers because for the most part mechanisms will be in place that enable them to train themselves Within 10 years we should be beginning to see that the idea of providing training education or training is misguided because it s overly expensive and less effective than self managed learning I find it interesting even that the question itself presumes that skills must be taught Which of these skills can be taught effectively via online systems It s not that the skills are taught per se but rather that the skills are learned A wide range of activities may enable skills to be learned especially multidisciplinary skills such as critical thinking or social interaction without specifically teaching those skills There are very few skills that require specific and personal instruction from an expert to learn frankly I can t think of any which means that within 10 years we should at least be able to countenance the possibility that all or nearly all educational programs may be automated Of course they will continue to require the time and participation of the individual learner and in many cases social interaction with other learners but the labor intensive learning industry we have developed to this point will not be required I see no major objections to this argument 1 It may be argued that personal interaction is required in order to get to know a student and therefore anticipate what they need However in 10 years it will be arguable and probably demonstrable that your own computer networks will know you better than any individual instructor could even an instructor who worked with you your entire life Sure there are disasters like the Facebook news stream but people are already amazed at how much Google knows about them And we know that with enough data analytics can outperform humans even in complex tasks 2 It may be argued that personal interaction is required in order to evaluate a student s level of achievement Most actual assessment not to be confused with multiple choice tests in school or professional programs is based on expert recognition The submitted behavior an essay performance in surgery piloting an aircraft in a simulation is not assessed according to whether a set of indicators is achieved this would possibly be a necessary but never a sufficient condition The expert looks at the overall behavior and assesses whether that competency has been met The expert is serving as a proxy for the community at large With modern communications technology this proxy is no longer required Through the course of any given day as a person goes through various activities they interact with dozens of other people either in person or through online interaction Each person responds to them in some way not by testing them but by for example engaging them in conversation asking questions following advice etc These responses over time form a comprehensive and constantly changing assessment of the person An anonymous postdoctoral fellow at Rice University s Humanities Research Center observed So much has been said and challenged over the past three decades about online education I d like to answer this by asking a different set of questions which address recent developments in robotics and artificial intelligence How will autonomous factories in Chicago U S share what they ve learned with factories in Pingdingshan China What credentialing system will self driving cars require How will artificially intelligent laborers learn the skills needed to run a household business government institution or political organization When will universities allow artilect nonhuman artificial intelligence students to enroll in their traditional undergraduate and graduate degree programs and how would students learn the more ephemeral skills like critical thinking from a thinking machine

maintaining the trust of our various audiences Be it regulation business attraction logistics compliance or awareness building there are few functions of public sector activity that aren t ultimately dependent on getting a message out But the where and the ways to do that have changed and are changing remarkably And addressing that can t be a merely a function of Corporate Communications teams no matter how good they might be If government is to remain relevant into the future its people need to think about their audiences every step of the way whatever their role But how do individual public servants with their own skills sets and natural abilities embrace a communications role Sue Cato perhaps Australia s leading issues management practitioner will join us in a facilitated discussion that will empower participants to start to realise their own individual potential to make strategic communication work for them their careers and the areas of public work for which they have responsibility We are living through a fundamental transformation in the way we work Automation and thinking machines are replacing human tasks changing the skills that organisations are looking for in their people But what will the future look like This isn t a time to sit back and wait for events to unfold To be prepared for the future you have to understand it In this session PwC will lead participants through a conversation about what the future of work could look like and how organisations and people can prepare for it now Technological innovations including always on connectivity artificial intelligence and automation are undeniably changing the nature of work As well pressures both in and outside of work are leading Australian employees to report high rates of workplace stress No longer separating home and work today s employees are increasingly expecting their employer to offer flexibility and support to deal with the changes they are experiencing In fact successful employers and workplaces of the future will be those that provide a strong and compelling workplace culture and an employee experience that supports employees to deal with change and stress both within and outside of work Sunsuper s 2018 Australian Employee Insights Report highlights the significant impact technology is having on Australian employees at work We will explore the employee

internationally are already using sustainability concepts to springboard new business models and transform their economies across ideas such as the circular economy But while multinationals and local communities alike are seeing economic environmental and social returns in many ways the core of this model is an innovation based on trust This session will explore the concept of the circular economy using a series of case studies to demonstrate the change that is already happening and changing our society and the way its institutions work from one based on take make and dispose to one that is restorative and regenerative by design The fast pace of digital change is re shaping today s workforce PwC research indicates there will be net job creation from technology however there is an increasing consensus across thought and practice leaders that it s time to get practical about assisting all workers to adapt to the digital age The task of retraining talent goes beyond digital upskilling 87 of Australia s CEOs either agree or strongly agree that they need to strengthen the soft skills of employees alongside their digital skills Human skills such as creativity flexibility

sector design from its earliest days realising the potential of the concept through a digital platform has been central to ensuring the viability of the original concept With MindHive 2 0 a new crowdsourcing and networking platform nearing launch participants will have the opportunity to observe how the theoretical and practical challenges were resolved and have the opportunity to experience the potential for policy and strategy development through the MindHive methodology firsthand To many minds the rise of technology and the state of the environment have a relationship that is parallel at best and inverse at worst A rise in one has too often been seen as necessarily having to come at the cost of the other But advances in technology from 3D printing to social media to big data are fundamental enablers to many of the facets of circular economy How can government enable and capitalise on this shift across portfolios as diverse as energy infrastructure social services and foreign aid This session will combine case studies with practical experience to show the digital revolution in a whole new shade green We are living through a fundamental transformation in the way we work
