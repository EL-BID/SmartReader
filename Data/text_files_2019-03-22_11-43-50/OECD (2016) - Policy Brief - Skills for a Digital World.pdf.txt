Information and communication 
technologies (ICT) are profoundly changing 
the skill profile of jobs. Skill development 
policies need to be overhauled to reduce the 
risk of increased unemployment and 
growing inequality. 

 

To thrive in the digital economy, ICT skills 
will not be enough and other complementary 
skills will be needed, ranging from good 
literacy and numeracy skills through to the 
right socio-emotional skills to work 
collaboratively and flexibly. 

 

56% of the adult population have no ICT 
skills or have only the skills necessary to 
fulfil the simplest set of tasks in a 
technology-rich environment. Young 
people, however, are much more ICT 
proficient than older generations. 

 

 

Skills policies should seek to: strengthen 
initial learning; anticipate and respond better 
to changing skill needs; increase the use of 
workers’ skills; and improve incentives for 
further learning. 

 

What skills for tomorrow's digital world 

Ensuring that everyone has the right skills for an 
increasingly digital and globalised world is essential to 
promote inclusive labour markets and to spur 
innovation, productivity and growth. Several types of 
skills are needed: technical and professional skills, 
including ICT specialist skills for workers who drive 
innovation and to support digital infrastructures and 
the functioning of the digital eco-system; ICT generic 
skills for workers and citizens alike to be able to use 
digital technologies; and ICT complementary “soft” 
skills, such as leadership, communication and 
teamwork skills, required for the expanding number of 
opportunities for ICT-enabled collaborative work 
(OECD, 2015a; OECD, 2016a; Grundke et al., 2017).  

The use of ICT in the workplace – affecting only a 
handful of occupations a few decades ago –  is now 
required in all but two occupations in the United 
States: dishwashing and food cooking. (Berger and 
Frey, 2016). Similarly, in most OECD countries, over 
95% of workers in large businesses and 85% in 
medium-sized businesses have access to and use the 
Internet as part of their jobs. In small businesses the 
share is at least 65% (OECD, 2013). Workers will thus 
have to be able to take on complex, less automatable, 
tasks such as problem solving in novel situations 
while working with the new technologies. This 
requires solid literacy, numeracy and problem-
solving skills, but also autonomy, co-ordination and 
collaborative skills which complement ICT skills 
(OECD, 2015a). Workers also need to be capable of 
adapting continuously as technologies evolve (Spitz-
Oener, 2006; Bessen, 2015).  

According to OECD estimates, less than 10% of 
workers, on average in the OECD area, are in jobs that 
are at risk of being replaced by machines, but 25% are 

in jobs where a high percentage of tasks (50-70%) 
could be automated (Arntz et al., 2016). This 
underlines the need for flexible skills that allow 
workers to shift to new tasks that are difficult to 
automate.  

Digitalisation is accelerating the pace of 
globalisation, helping firms increase their 
competitiveness. In turn, globalisation and 
offshoring change the distribution of job tasks 
globally. As a result, German workers today, for 
example, compared to those in the 1970s, must have 
a more varied skill set enabling them to perform 
multiple tasks rather than one specific task (Becker 
and Muendler, 2015).  

Not only the workplace is changing; interactions 
between public and social services and business and 
clients are also relying increasingly on digital, mobile 
or social-media tools (OECD, 2009, 2011). For example, 
the Flemish public employment service (VDAB) uses 
the matching capabilities of mobile apps in providing 
services to jobseekers, and the Dutch public 
employment service (UWV) has digitised most of its 
functions to improve efficiency (OECD, 2015b). 

Are workers ready for a digital world?  

In an increasingly digital world where the skill needs 
of employers are continuously evolving, policy makers 
need to make sure that everyone can participate and 
learn new skills. Recent technological change has 
shifted skill demands predominantly towards high-
level skills. Workers need to be prepared to change 
jobs over their working life while avoiding 
unemployment or ending up in a lower paying job. 
ICT foundation skills are becoming increasingly 
important in order to benefit from technological 
innovation in terms of better employment chances 
and higher wages.

The evidence on how well countries are prepared for 
the digital economy is rather disturbing. The OECD’s 
Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) suggests that more 
than 50% of the adult population on average in 
28 OECD countries can only carry out the simplest 
set of computer tasks, such as writing an email and 
browsing the web, or have no ICT skills at all (see 
Figure 1). Only around a third of workers have more 
advanced cognitive skills that enable them to 
evaluate problems and find solutions (OECD, 2013). 
As a result, many workers use ICTs regularly 
without adequate ICT skills: on average, over 40% of 
those using software at work every day do not have 
the skills required to use digital technologies 
effectively (OECD, 2016a).

in problem solving in technology-rich environments

in each proficiency level 

Notes: Individuals in Level 2 or Level 3 have more advanced ICT 
and cognitive skills to evaluate problems and solutions than those 
in Level 1 or below. 
Source: OECD (2015c), Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) 2015. 

Not surprisingly, younger generations do better than 
older people (Figure 2). Some 42% of adults aged 25 to 
34 can complete tasks involving multiple steps and 
requiring the use of specific technology applications, 
such as a new online form (Level 2 or 3), but in the 
age group 55-65, only one in ten can do so.  

Although most young people seem ready to interact 
with technology, there is still a large share of youth 
with low levels of proficiency. Moreover, the 
unequal distribution of ICT skills by educational 
attainment and migrant status may also amplify 
existing inequalities as these skills become 
increasingly important.  

Figure 2. Younger people are better prepared for the 
digital working environment than older people

Problem Solving in Technology-Rich Environments

There is no sizeable gender gap in the share of 
people possessing good ICT generic skills – i.e. those 
who perform at the medium and high level in 
problem solving in technology-rich environments. 
However, a sizeable gap emerges when focusing 
only on ICT specialists. In 2014, 5.5% of male 
workers in OECD countries were ICT specialists 
compared to just 1.4% of female workers (OECD, 
2016a). While this is a relatively small group, it 
involves well-paid jobs in high demand and with 
good career prospects. 

The importance of digital skills is reflected in the 
wage returns to these skills (see Figure 3 or Falck, 
Heimisch and Wiederhold, 2016). Compared to 
workers who can only perform the most basic 
computer functions like typing or operating a mouse 
(workers at or below Level 1), workers performing at 
Level 2 or 3 are paid 27% more, on average. These 
gaps are greater than 50% in England (UK), Singapore 
and the United States. Workers with no computer 
experience earn around 10% less than those with 
the most basic computer skills. 

To seize the benefits of technological change, 
economies need ICT specialists: workers who can 
code, develop applications, manage networks and 
manage and analyse Big Data, among other skills. 
These skills enable innovation in a digital economy 
to flourish, but also support the infrastructure that 
firms, governments, commerce and users rely on 
(OECD, 2015a). However, besides these experts, 
digitalisation also calls for all workers to have a 
relatively high minimum level of ICT skills, even 
those in low-skilled jobs. For instance, this is the 
case for blue-collar workers in factories that are 
entirely automated or waiters having to take orders 
on iPads.

Jobs requiring more intensive ICT use also require a 
range of technical, professional and other 
occupation-specific skills, a solid level of 
information-processing skills (e.g. literacy and 
numeracy), as well as the ability to collaborate, 
share information, give presentations, provide 
advice, work autonomously, manage, influence and 
solve problems. (OECD, 2015a). As technology 
automates certain tasks, the value of skills needed 
for non-automatable tasks, such as social skills, also 
increases (Autor, 2015; Deming 2015). 

Four key priorities for skills policies to meet the 
challenges of a digital world  

Addressing the challenges arising in an increasingly 
digital world will require an overhaul of current 
employment and skills policies. Government must 
help ensure that an increasingly digital world yields 
better quality jobs and that both employers and 
workers have the means to take advantage of the 
new job opportunities that open up. There are four 
key priorities for skill policies to facilitate take-up of 
these opportunities and promote inclusive growth:  

1) Part of the task is to ensure that initial education 
equips all students with basic ICT skills as well as 
solid literacy, numeracy and problem-solving 
skills to use ICT effectively. Many of these skills 
are acquired also outside education and training 
institutions – for instance, in the workplace – 
emphasising the need to recognise skills 
acquired outside formal channels.  

For ICT specialist skills, basic programming is no 
longer enough. For instance, advanced 
engineering and experience with machine-
learning are increasingly important. In addition, 
ICT specialists also need domain-specific 
knowledge, given the potential applications of 
ICT in business, health, education and industry.  

2) Education and training systems need to better 
assess and anticipate changing skill needs in 
order to adapt programmes and pathways offered 

and guide students towards choices that lead to 
good outcomes. Big data can be harnessed to 
complement labour market information systems 
and monitor changing needs (OECD, 2016a). By 
including all stakeholders in skills assessment 
exercises and in translating the findings into 
pratice, governments can ensure that the 
information collected is useful and that policies 
respond to actual needs (OECD, 2016b). 

3) It is not just sufficient for workers to have the 
skills needed for the digital economy but 
employers must fully use these skills to reap 
their benefits in terms of higher productivity and 
greater competitiveness. The use of skills, 
including reading, numeracy and problem 
solving in a technologically-rich environment, 
varies substantially across countries (OECD, 
2016b). A key factor driving this variation is the 
use of high performance work practices such as 
teamwork, work autonomy, training, flexible 
work hours, etc. Thus it is important to promote 
better work organisation and management 
practices within firms and across the economy, 
as well as fostering the skills needed to support 
these practices. 

4) As skill demands change continuously, training 
for workers to keep up with new skill 
requirements is crucial. This requires offering 
better incentives for workers and firms to re-skill 
and up-skill. It also means using the possibilities 
of new technologies to adapt new job tasks to the 
skills sets of incumbent workers. At the same 
time, the diffusion of "on-demand" jobs on digital 
platforms puts increasing responsibility on 
individuals for managing their own skills 
development (OECD, 2016c). Low- and medium-
skilled workers are the least likely to receive 
training, even though they may be facing the 
greatest risk of job loss. 

For youth who have dropped out of education 
and lack the necessary skills, well-designed 
second-chance programmes can be effective for 
reintegration. Second-chance programmes 
promoted by the European Union, or those in 
Canada, France, Ireland and the United States 
have a strong focus on basic and complementary 
ICT skills (OECD, 2015e). More generally, effective 
and well-targeted active labour market 
programmes are needed for jobseekers who are 
facing difficulties because of outdated or 
inadequate skills. 

Digitalisation also opens new opportunities for 
innovation in learning infrastructure. MOOCs 
(massive open online courses) and OERs (open 
educational resources) already offer 
opportunities to learn for many workers, 
although still underutilised. Take-up is low due 
to the low perceived quality of these forms of 
learning, lack of incentives and lack of 
recognition of the competencies acquired 
through these and other informal and non-
formal means. To this end, alternative 
certification methods (e.g. OpenBadge) have 
begun to appear (ITU, 2014). A number of 
technology companies such as Microsoft, CISCO,

HP, Samsung, Apple, and Google, offer 
certificates that MOOC participants can earn 
directly online. Technology also offers prospects 
of new ways to learn skills, such as using virtual 
reality, games and so forth.  

A combination of policies is needed to allow workers 
to keep their skills up to date, help them move 
between jobs and ensure that employers have a 
skilled, highly productive and innovative workforce. 
This includes strengthening initial learning, improving 
incentives for further learning, and reinforcing active 
labour market programmes for the unemployed 
(OECD, 2016d). It will also be crucial to tackle skills 
mismatch and ensure that employers fully use the 
skills of their workers through management practices 
that motivate workers and flexible work organisation 
which allows job content to be adapted or for workers 
to move to better suited jobs. This would enhance 
productivity and has the potential for reducing 
inequality (Adalet McGowan and Andrews, 2015; 
OECD, 2015b, 2016e).
