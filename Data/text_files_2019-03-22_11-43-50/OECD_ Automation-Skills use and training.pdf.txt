Abstract 

 

This study focuses on the risk of automation and its interaction with training and the use 

of skills at work. Building on the expert assessment carried out by Carl Frey and Michael 

Osborne in 2013, the paper estimates the risk of automation for individual jobs based on 

the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC). The analysis improves on other international 

estimates of the individual risk of automation by using a more disaggregated 

occupational classification and identifying the same automation bottlenecks emerging 

from the experts’ discussion. Hence, it more closely aligns to the initial assessment of the 

potential automation deriving from the development of Machine Learning. Furthermore, 

this study investigates the same methodology using national data from Germany and 

United Kingdom, providing insights into the robustness of the results. 

The risk of automation is estimated for the 32 OECD countries that have participated in 

the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) so far. Beyond the share of jobs likely to be 

significantly disrupted by automation of production and services, the accent is put on 

characteristics of these jobs and the characteristics of the workers who hold them. The 

risk is also assessed against the use of ICT at work and the role of training in helping 

workers transit to new career opportunities.

Résumé 

Cette étude analyse le risque d'automatisation et ses implications pour la formation 

professionnelle et l'utilisation des compétences dans le cadre professionnel. En 

s’appuyant sur les entretiens d’experts conduits par Carl Frey and Michael Osborne en 

2013, cette étude détermine un risque d’automation qui est spécifique à chaque emploi. 

En utilisant l’Enquête sur les Compétences des Adultes (PIAAC). L’analyse perfectionne 

les résultats obtenus par d’autres études internationaux sur le risque d’automatisation à 

niveau individuel en utilisant des catégories professionnelles plus désagrégées et en 

identifiant les mêmes étranglements techniques constatés lors des entretiens d’experts. 

Par conséquent, cette étude est mieux alignée à l’évaluation du potentiel 

d’automatisation généré par les développements en Intelligence Artificielle. Aussi, cette 

étude applique la même méthodologie à des bases de données nationales pour 

l’Allemagne et le Royaume Uni, ce qui permet de tester la robustesse des résultats. 

Le risque d'automatisation est estimé jusqu'à présent pour les 32 pays de l'OCDE ayant 

participé à l'Évaluation des compétences des adultes (PIAAC). Outre la proportion 

d'emplois à risque d’être perturbés par l’automatisation de la production et des services, 

l'étude s'intéresse en particulier aux caractéristiques desdits emplois et des travailleurs 

qui les occupent. Le risque est également évalué en fonction de l'utilisation des TIC dans 

le cadre professionnel et du rôle des formations visant à aider les travailleurs à évoluer 

vers de nouvelles opportunités professionnelles

Main findings 

The implications for jobs and skills of the developments in Artificial Intelligence and 

Machine Learning have dominated recent debates on the Future of Work and the changes 

brought about by digital technologies. Since Frey and Osborne (2013) shocked analysists 

and policy makers worldwide with a study suggesting that 47% of jobs in the United 

States are at high risk of being automated, several other researchers and institutions have 

contributed to the debate, all produced estimates in the high double digits. All these 

studies stem from an assessment by experts of the risk of automation for a subset of 

occupational titles, based on the tasks these occupations involved. This allowed 

identifying the so-called bottlenecks to automation – i.e. the tasks that, given the current 

state of knowledge, are difficult to automate. These include: social intelligence, such as 

the ability to effectively negotiate complex social relationships, including caring for 

others or recognizing cultural sensitivities; cognitive intelligence, such as creativity and 

complex reasoning; and perception and manipulation, such as the ability to carry out 

physical tasks in an unstructured work environment. These bottlenecks were used to 

compute a risk of automation for occupational titles that were not included in the expert 

assessment and for countries outside the United States. 

More recent studies, exploiting the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC), brought the 

estimates of the share of jobs at risk of automation down significantly. These studies 

show that there is considerable variation in the tasks involved in jobs having the same 

occupational title and that accounting for this variation is essential to gauge the extent of 

the problem. Arntz, Zierhan and Gregory (2016), for instance, put this share to 9% in the 

United States. While this figure is only a fraction of the estimate provided by Frey and 

Osborne, it translates to approximately 13 million jobs across the United States, based on 

2016 employment figures. As job losses are unlikely to be distributed equally across the 

country, this would amount to several times the disruption in local economies caused by 

the 1950s decline of the car industry in Detroit where changes in technology and 

increased automation, among other factors, caused massive job losses. 

The current study aims to go beyond providing an estimate of the share of jobs at high 

risk of automation by also highlighting the significant changes that jobs will undergo as a 

result of the adoption of new technologies. It also offers an analysis of the distribution of 

risk among different population groups and the role of training in helping workers transit 

to new career opportunities. The study builds on the work done by Arntz, Zierhan and 

Gregory (2016) for OECD and exploits PIAAC to account for the variation in tasks 

within narrowly-defined occupational groups. However, coverage is broadened to all 32 

countries that have participated in the survey so far and the engineering bottlenecks 

identified by Frey and Osborne (2013) are more closely matched. In doing so, the current 

study better aligns to the original expert assessment of the potential automation deriving 

from the development of Machine Learning. The methodological differences also imply 

that this study covers a broader set of workers than the study by Arntz, Zierhan and 

Gregory (2016). Notably, it includes workers who lack basic computer skills and/or are in

jobs that do not require using a computer. As the use of ICT correlates negatively with the 

risk of automation, this study yields a higher estimated share of jobs at risk of automation. 

Here are the study’s key findings. 

 Across the 32 countries, close to one in two jobs are likely to be significantly 
affected by automation, based on the tasks they involve. But the degree of risk 

varies. About 14% of jobs in OECD countries participating in PIAAC are highly 

automatable (i.e., probability of automation of over 70%). Although smaller than 

the estimates based on occupational titles obtained applying the method of Frey 

and Osborne (2013) this is equivalent to over 66 million workers in the 32 

countries covered by the study. In addition, another 32% of jobs have a risk of 

between 50 and 70% pointing to the possibility of significant change in the way 

these jobs are carried out as a result of automation – i.e. a significant share of 

tasks, but not all, could be automated, changing the skill requirements for these 

jobs.  

 The variance in automatability across countries is large: 33% of all jobs in 
Slovakia are highly automatable, while this is only the case with 6% of the jobs in 

Norway. More generally, jobs in Anglo-Saxon, Nordic countries and the 

Netherlands are less automatable than jobs in Eastern European countries, South 

European countries, Germany, Chile and Japan. Caution is needed when 

interpreting the numbers related to the risk of automation: the actual risk of 

automation is subject to significant variation and, while country rankings at the 

top and the bottom of the scale are robust to methodological changes, there is 

more uncertainty for countries closer to the cross-country average. As a result, for 

instance, while the findings reliably point to jobs in Slovakia having a higher risk 

of automation than jobs in Norway, the specific probability of automation is 

harder to pin down. 

 The cross-country variation in automatability, contrary to expectations, is better 
explained by the differences in the organisation of job tasks within economic 

sectors, than by the differences in the sectoral structure of economies. About 30% 

of the cross-country variance is explained by cross-country differences in the 

structure of economic sectors and 70% is explained by the fact that, within these 

sectors, countries employ different occupational mixes. Moreover, within the 

same occupations, the frequency of perception and manipulation tasks as well as 

cognitive and social intelligence tasks varies. Within industry and occupation 

differences in the task-content of jobs may reflect the extent to which automation 

has already taken place and jobs have adapted as a result. Countries where the 

adoption of labour-substituting technologies has not yet taken place would show a 

structure of job tasks that is more prone to automation. 

 Robustness checks carried out using data for Germany and the United Kingdom 
yield qualitatively similar results as those obtained for these two countries when 

using the Survey of Adult Skills: the actual estimate of the risk of automation 

varies but the picture emerging in terms of who is most affected is very similar. 

In addition, the two national databases show how jobs have become more 

intensive in less automatable tasks and this had been the case both within and 

between occupations. In other words, bottleneck tasks such as analytical and 

social skills have become more common within occupations but occupations that 

already performed those tasks intensively have also grown in number. On the 

other hand, in these two countries, the decline in tasks involving physical strength 

has primarily happened through the reduction in the number of occupations that

were intensive in those tasks. While these results point to interesting trends in the 

skills content of jobs, they cannot be easily generalised to other OECD countries 

as the trends would have been influenced by the timing and speed of technology 

penetration and adoption and by the employment structure of each country. 

 There are upside and downside risks to the figures obtained in this paper. On the 
upside, it is important to keep in mind that these estimates refer to technological 

possibilities, abstracting from the speed of diffusion and likelihood of adoption of 

such technologies. Adoption, in particular, could be influenced by several factors, 

including regulations on workers dismissal, unit labour costs or social preferences 

with regard to automation. In addition, technology will without doubt also bring 

about many new jobs. For instance, several analysts have found an association 

between automation and job growth in the service sector in parallel to job 

destruction primarily in manufacturing. Also, PIAAC does not include 

information on some key social intelligence tasks such as caring for and assisting 

others and this would bias the risk of automation upwards somewhat. But there 

are risks on the downside too. First, the estimates are based on the fact that, given 

the current state of knowledge, tasks related to social intelligence, cognitive 

intelligence and perception and manipulation cannot be automated. However, 

progress is being made very rapidly, particularly in the latter two categories. 

 Most importantly, the risk of automation is not distributed equally among 
workers. Automation is found to mainly affect jobs in the manufacturing industry 

and agriculture, although a number of service sectors, such as postal and courier 

services, land transport and food services are also found to be highly automatable. 

The occupations with the highest estimated automatability typically only require 

basic to low level of education. At the other end of the spectrum, the least 

automatable occupations almost all require professional training and/or tertiary 

education. 

 Overall, despite recurrent arguments that automation may start to adversely affect 
selected highly skilled occupations, this prediction is not supported by the Frey 

and Osborne (2013) framework of engineering bottlenecks used in this study. 

If anything, Artificial Intelligence puts more low-skilled jobs at risk than previous 

waves of technological progress, whereby technology replaced primarily 

middle-skilled jobs creating labour market polarisation – i.e. a rise in the 

employment share of low-skilled and high-skilled jobs and a decline in the share 

of middle-skilled ones. Indeed, with the exception of some relatively low-skilled 

jobs – notably, personal care workers – the findings in this study suggest a rather 

monotonic decrease in the risk of automation as a function of educational 

attainment and skill levels. 

 A striking novel finding is that the risk of automation is the highest among 
teenage jobs. The relationship between automation and age is U-shaped, but the 

peak in automatability among youth jobs is far more pronounced than the peak 

among senior workers. In this sense, automation is much more likely to result in 

youth unemployment, than in early retirements. To some extent, this higher risk 

of automation may be countered by smoother transitions between jobs for young 

people compared to older individuals. In most countries, young people are better 

skilled than their older counterparts so they may find it easier to adapt to new 

jobs, including those created as a result of the introduction of new technologies. 

Furthermore, as high-risk jobs are, in many countries, associated with student 

jobs, schemes that facilitate internships in areas related to each student field of

AUTOMATION, SKILLS USE AND TRAINING 

For Official Use 

study may allow practicing job-specific skills as well as facilitate the acquisition 

of generic skills once achieved through low-skilled summer jobs. 

 This unequal distribution of the risk of automation raises the stakes involved in 
policies to prepare workers for the new job requirements. In this context, adult 

learning is a crucial policy instrument for the re-training and up-skilling of 

workers whose jobs are being affected by technology. Unfortunately, evidence 

from this study suggests that a lot needs to be done to facilitate participation by 

the groups most affected by automation. The odds of participating in any type of 

training, on-the-job and outside the job, are found to be significantly lower among 

workers in jobs at risk of being automated. Workers in fully automatable jobs are 

more than three times less likely to have participated in on-the-job training, over a 

12-months period, than workers in non-automatable jobs. Differences in training 

participation outside work are also marked, with workers with the highest risk of 

automation about twice less likely to participate in formal education and 3.5 times 

less likely to take part in distant learning. These findings also apply to training 

duration: individuals in fully automatable job spend 29 hours less in job-related 

training annually than those in non-automatable jobs, ceteris paribus. These 

findings point to the importance of training provision outside the workplace, 

particularly for workers in jobs where most tasks are automatable. 

 An analysis of German data suggests that training is used to move to jobs at lower 
risk of automation. Looking at the content of the subsequent training spells of 

German workers, the risk of automation tends to decline. This suggests that 

participants already use requalification – the participation in a training course that 

provides a new qualification – as a mechanism to transition from more to less 

automatable occupations. However, these transitions are gradual, meaning that 

workers choose to requalify to occupations that are quite closely-related in skill 

content to their previous training. To the extent that bolder moves may be 

required in the future as the distance in skills content between declining jobs and 

growing ones broadens, the effectiveness of existing adult learning systems may 

come under strain. 

Overall, while job destruction figures estimated in this paper exploiting job-specific 

information are smaller than the higher estimates obtained based on occupational titles, 

it is crucial not to dismiss the important of providing retraining and social protection for 

the 14% of workers who may see their job being entirely restructured in terms of job 

tasks or significantly downsized. This is a group that receives very little retraining from 

their own employers and may face several barriers to participate in adult learning, notably 

low basic skills, time constraints or limited motivation. In parallel, the large share of 

workers whose jobs are likely to change quite significantly as a result of automation calls 

for countries to strengthen their adult learning policies to prepare their workforce for the 

changes in job requirements they are likely to face. 

Finally, this study highlights, but does not deal with, some important issues that will be 

the focus of further work. First, as mentioned above, the focus is placed on technological 

possibilities, abstracting from technology penetration and adoption. Ongoing work is 

expected to shed light on the timing of the risk of automation in different industries and 

countries. Secondly, this study only touches on how technological progress may affect 

wages by highlighting the negative association between the estimated risk of automation 

and hourly wages. This relationship is being looked at more in-depth in the context of 

work on wage polarisation and inequality and will lead to a broader discussion on the 

potential need for income redistribution. Thirdly, the regional concentration of the risk of

automation could amplify its social and economic impact, particularly in countries where 

geographical mobility is low. The OECD is currently working on deriving regional 

estimates of the risk of automation to highlight the policy implications of risk 

concentration.

Principaux résultats 

Les conséquences sur l’emploi et les compétences des progrès de l’intelligence artificielle 

et de l’apprentissage automatique ont été au cœur des récents débats sur l’avenir de 

l’emploi et les transformations induites par les technologies numériques. Depuis que Frey 

et Osborne (2013) ont provoqué un choc parmi les analystes et décideurs publics du 

monde entier en publiant une étude selon laquelle aux États-Unis, 47 % des emplois 

seraient exposés à un risque élevé d’automatisation, plusieurs autres chercheurs et 

institutions ont apporté leur contribution au débat et tous sont parvenus à des estimations 

très élevées. Toutes ces études reposent sur une évaluation du risque d’automatisation 

d’un ensemble de professions réalisée par des experts à partir des taches que comportent 

ces professions. Cette évaluation a permis d’identifier des obstacles à l’automatisation ou 

« goulets d’étranglement », en d’autres termes des tâches qui, en l’état actuel des 

connaissances, sont difficilement automatisables. Il s’agit de tâches qui font appel à 

l’intelligence sociale, par exemple la capacité à négocier efficacement des relations 

sociales complexes, notamment à s’occuper d’autrui ou à percevoir les sensibilités 

culturelles ; à l’intelligence cognitive, en particulier la créativité et la capacité à mener un 

raisonnement complexe ; et à la perception et à la manipulation, par exemple la capacité à 

exécuter des tâches physiques dans un environnement de travail non structuré. Ces 

goulets d’étranglement ont été utilisés pour calculer un risque d’automatisation pour des 

professions non prises en compte dans l’évaluation des experts et pour d’autres pays que 

les États-Unis. 

Des études conduites plus récemment à partir de données de l’Évaluation des 

compétences des adultes du Programme pour l'évaluation internationale des compétences 

des adultes (PIAAC) ont abouti à des estimations nettement inférieures du pourcentage 

d’emplois menacés d’automatisation. Ces études montrent que les tâches à exécuter 

varient considérablement entre des emplois appartenant à une même profession et qu’il 

est indispensable d’en tenir compte pour apprécier l’ampleur du phénomène 

d’automatisation. Notamment, en tenant compte de cette variabilité, Arntz, Zierhan et 

Gregory (2016) évaluent à 9 % la proportion d’emplois menacés aux États-Unis. Quoique 

nettement inférieur à l’estimation de Frey et Osborne, ce pourcentage représente environ 

13 millions d’emplois sur l’ensemble du territoire des États-Unis d’après les statistiques 

sur l’emploi de 2016. Comme il est peu probable que les destructions d’emplois soient 

réparties de manière équilibrée sur le territoire national, les économies locales subiraient 

une déstabilisation plusieurs fois supérieure à celle provoquée par le déclin de l’industrie 

automobile à Detroit dans les années 50, durant lesquelles le progrès technologique et le 

développement de l’automatisation, entre autres, avaient fait disparaître une grande 

quantité d’emplois. 

Cette étude entend non seulement fournir une estimation de la proportion d’emplois 

menacés d’automatisation, mais aussi apporter un éclairage sur les transformations 

importantes que subiront les emplois en raison de l’adoption de nouvelles technologies. 

Elle présente également une analyse de la répartition des risques entre différents groupes 

de la population, ainsi que du rôle que peut jouer la formation pour aider les travailleurs à

évoluer afin d’accéder à de nouveaux débouchés professionnels. Elle s’appuie sur les 

travaux réalisés par Arntz, Zierhan et Gregory (2016) pour l’OCDE et exploite les 

données issues du PIAAC pour prendre en compte les différences de tâches au sein de 

professions définies de manière étroite. Elle porte cependant sur une zone géographique 

plus large, à savoir sur les 32 pays qui participent à ce jour à l’Évaluation des 

compétences des adultes, et les variables utilisées correspondent mieux aux goulets 

d’étranglement décrits par Frey et Osborne (2013). L’étude est ainsi plus cohérente par 

rapport à l’évaluation de l’automatisation susceptible de résulter des progrès de 

l’apprentissage automatique initialement réalisée par les experts. Du fait des différences 

méthodologiques, l’étude couvre en outre un éventail plus large de travailleurs que celle 

réalisée par Arntz, Zierhan et Gregory (2016). Sont notamment aussi inclus dans 

l’analyse les travailleurs qui sont dépourvus de compétences élémentaires en 

informatique et/ou qui occupent des emplois ne nécessitant pas l’utilisation d’un 

ordinateur. Comme il existe une corrélation négative entre l’utilisation des technologies 

de l’information et de la communication (TIC) et le risque d’automatisation, l’estimation 

de la proportion d’emplois menacés d’automatisation obtenue dans cette étude est plus 

élevée. 

Les principaux résultats de l’étude sont les suivants : 

 Dans les 32 pays étudiés, près d’un emploi sur deux risque d’être sensiblement 
affecté par l’automatisation compte tenu des tâches qu’il comporte. Toutefois, 

l’ampleur du risque est variable. Dans les pays de l’OCDE qui participent à 

l’Évaluation des compétences des adultes, environ 14 % des emplois sont 

fortement automatisables (caractérisés par une probabilité d’automatisation 

supérieure à 70 %). Ce pourcentage est inférieur à l’estimation calculée au niveau 

des professions en utilisant la méthode de Frey et Osborne (2013), mais n’en 

représente pas moins plus de 66 millions de travailleurs au total dans les 32 pays 

étudiés. Par ailleurs, 32 % des emplois sont exposés à un risque d’automatisation 

compris entre 50 et 70 %, ce qui signifie que la manière dont ils sont exercés 

pourrait se transformer sensiblement sous l’effet de l’automatisation – en d’autres 

termes, bien que toutes les tâches qu’ils comportent ne soient pas concernées, une 

forte proportion pourrait être automatisée, si bien qu’ils exigeront des 

compétences différentes. 

 Le risque d’automatisation est très variable d’un pays à l’autre : alors que 33 % 
des emplois sont fortement automatisables en Slovaquie, ce pourcentage ne 

dépasse pas 6 % en Norvège. Plus généralement, les emplois se prêtent moins à 

une automatisation dans les pays anglo-saxons, dans les pays nordiques et aux 

Pays-Bas que dans les pays d’Europe de l’Est et d’Europe du Sud, ainsi qu’en 

Allemagne, au Chili et au Japon. Il faut cependant interpréter les chiffres relatifs 

au risque d’automatisation avec prudence : le risque lui-même est très variable et, 

si les chiffres obtenus pour les pays qui se situent aux extrémités supérieure et 

inférieure du classement ne sont pas sensibles aux changements de méthodologie, 

ceux concernant les pays proches de la moyenne sont plus incertains. En 

conséquence, s’il est par exemple possible d’affirmer que la proportion d’emplois 

menacés par l’automatisation est plus forte en Slovaquie qu’en Norvège, il est 

plus difficile de déterminer spécifiquement la probabilité d’automatisation dans 

chaque pays. 

 Contrairement à ce que l’on aurait pu attendre, les écarts entre pays en matière de 
risque d’automatisation s’expliquent davantage par des différences au niveau de 

l’organisation des tâches au sein des secteurs économiques que par des 



DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2018)3 │ 13 
 

 

AUTOMATION, SKILLS USE AND TRAINING 

For Official Use 

différences de structure sectorielle. Ainsi, 30% environ de ces écarts sont 

imputables à des différences de structure sectorielle, tandis que les 70 % restants 

sont dus au fait que l’éventail des professions représentées au sein de ces secteurs 

varie selon les pays. De surcroît, dans une même profession, la fréquence des 

tâches exigeant des capacités de perception et de manipulation et de celles faisant 

appel à l’intelligence sociale et cognitive est variable. Ces disparités observées au 

sein d’un même secteur et d’une même profession au niveau des tâches que 

comportent les emplois pourraient elles-mêmes refléter le fait qu’une plus ou 

moins grande automatisation a déjà eu lieu et que les emplois ont évolué en 

conséquence. Les pays qui n’ont pas encore adopté les technologies susceptibles 

de se substituer à la main-d’œuvre se caractérisent par une structure des tâches qui 

se prête relativement bien à l’automatisation. 

 Les tests de robustesse réalisés à partir de données nationales relatives à 
l’Allemagne et au Royaume-Uni donnent des résultats qualitativement similaires 

à ceux obtenus pour ces deux pays au moyen des données issues de l’Évaluation 

des compétences des adultes : l’estimation du risque d’automatisation n’est pas la 

même, mais les conclusions relatives aux travailleurs les plus exposés au risque 

d’automatisation sont très proches. De plus, les deux bases de données nationales 

montrent que les emplois comportent désormais davantage de tâches relativement 

peu automatisables et que cette augmentation a eu lieu aussi bien au sein des 

professions qu’au niveau de la structure par profession de l’économie. En d’autres 

termes, les tâches difficilement automatisables comme celles qui font appel à des 

compétences analytiques et sociales sont devenues plus courantes au sein d’une 

même profession, mais le nombre de professions dans lesquelles elles étaient déjà 

fréquentes a lui aussi augmenté. En revanche, dans ces deux pays, le recul des 

tâches faisant appel à la force physique s’explique en premier lieu par une 

diminution du nombre de professions dans lesquelles ces tâches occupent une 

large place. Si ces résultats mettent en lumière des tendances intéressantes sur le 

plan du contenu des emplois, ils peuvent difficilement être généralisés à d’autres 

pays de l’OCDE parce que ces tendances peuvent être influencées par le moment 

où la pénétration et l’adoption des technologies ont eu lieu et la vitesse à laquelle 

elles se sont faites, ainsi que par la structure de l’emploi de chaque pays. 

 Il est possible que les chiffres présentés ici soient surestimés ou sous-estimés. 
S’agissant du risque de surestimation, il faut garder à l’esprit que les calculs 

présentés reposent sur des possibilités technologiques et ne tiennent pas compte 

de la vitesse de diffusion de ces technologies et de la probabilité qu’elles soient 

adoptées. L’adoption, en particulier, peut être influencée par divers facteurs, par 

exemple la réglementation relative au licenciement, les coûts salariaux unitaires 

ou les préférences sociales à l’égard de l’automatisation. De plus, les technologies 

engendreront aussi sans nul doute de nombreux emplois nouveaux. Certains 

analystes ont par exemple constaté que si elle entraînait une destruction de 

l’emploi, principalement dans le secteur manufacturier, l’automatisation avait 

aussi pour corollaire une croissance de l’emploi dans le secteur des services. 

Enfin, l’Évaluation des compétences des adultes ne fournit pas d’informations sur 

certaines tâches importantes faisant appel à l’intelligence sociale comme les 

activités d’aide à la personne, ce qui pourrait être à l’origine d’une surestimation 

du risque d’automatisation. Néanmoins, il est aussi possible que les chiffres soient 

sous-estimés. Premièrement, les estimations reposent sur l’hypothèse selon 

laquelle, en l’état actuel des connaissances, les tâches qui mobilisent l’intelligence 

sociale, l’intelligence cognitive et les capacités de perception et de manipulation

ne sont pas automatisables. Or, les progrès sont très rapides, en particulier dans 

les deux derniers domaines cités. 

 Autre point particulièrement important : le risque d’automatisation n’est pas 
réparti de manière égale entre les travailleurs. L’automatisation touche 

principalement des emplois des secteurs manufacturier et agricole, même si 

certaines activités de service, comme les activités de poste et de courrier, 

de transport terrestre et les services de restauration sont également très facilement 

automatisables. En règle générale, les professions les plus exposées au risque 

d’automatisation exigent un niveau d’études très faible à faible. À l’inverse, la 

quasi-totalité des professions qui se prêtent le moins à une automatisation 

requièrent une formation professionnelle et/ou un diplôme de l’enseignement 

supérieur. 

 Dans l’ensemble, la thèse régulièrement avancée selon laquelle l’automatisation 
pourrait commencer à avoir des conséquences négatives sur certaines professions 

très qualifiées n’est pas corroborée par le cadre d’évaluation des goulets 

d’étranglement défini par Frey et Osborne (2013) et utilisé dans cette étude. En 

fait, l’intelligence artificielle menace sans doute davantage les emplois non 

qualifiés que les précédentes vagues de progrès technologique, qui s’étaient 

essentiellement traduites par une substitution de la technologie aux emplois 

moyennement qualifiés et avaient entraîné une polarisation du marché du travail – 

une augmentation de la proportion d’emplois peu et très qualifiés et une 

diminution de la part des emplois moyennement qualifiés. La présente étude 

montre en effet que si l’on exclut certains emplois relativement peu qualifiés – 

comme les services à la personne –, le risque d’automatisation diminue de 

manière relativement monotone en fonction du niveau d’études et de 

compétences. 

 Une conclusion inédite et surprenante se dégage de l’étude, à savoir que le risque 
d’automatisation le plus élevé concerne les emplois occupés par les adolescents. 

Le lien entre automatisation et âge prend en effet la forme d’une courbe en U, 

mais le sommet atteint par la probabilité d’automatisation est beaucoup plus élevé 

pour les emplois occupés par les jeunes que pour ceux occupés par les travailleurs 

âgés. L’automatisation risque donc nettement plus de se traduire par du chômage 

parmi les jeunes que par des départs en préretraite. Ce risque plus élevé peut être 

en partie contrebalancé par le fait que les jeunes passent plus facilement d’un 

emploi à un autre que leurs aînés. Dans la plupart des pays, ils sont plus qualifiés 

que les travailleurs âgés, ce qui peut faciliter l’adaptation à des emplois nouveaux, 

dont ceux engendrés par l’introduction de nouvelles technologies. De surcroît, 

étant donné que dans bon nombre de pays, les emplois très exposés au risque 

d’automatisation sont souvent occupés par des étudiants, des dispositifs leur 

permettant d’effectuer des stages dans la discipline où ils suivent leurs études 

pourraient leur permettre de mettre en pratique des compétences spécifiques à un 

emploi donné et faciliteraient l’acquisition de compétences génériques auparavant 

acquises dans le cadre d’emplois d’été peu qualifiés. 

 Cette inégale répartition du risque d’automatisation ne fait qu’accroître l’enjeu 
des politiques visant à préparer les travailleurs à satisfaire aux nouvelles 

exigences du marché du travail. Dans ce contexte, la formation des adultes est un 

instrument primordial pour permettre à ceux dont les emplois sont touchés par le 

progrès technologique de se reconvertir ou d’améliorer leurs qualifications. 

Malheureusement, l’étude laisse penser qu’il reste un long chemin à parcourir 

pour faciliter l’accès à la formation des catégories les plus concernées par 



DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2018)3 │ 15 
 

 

AUTOMATION, SKILLS USE AND TRAINING

l’automatisation. La probabilité de participer à une formation, en cours d’emploi 

ou non, est en effet nettement plus faible parmi les travailleurs dont les emplois 

sont menacés d’automatisation. Ainsi, sur une période de 12 mois, les travailleurs 

qui occupent un emploi automatisable ont une probabilité plus de trois fois plus 

faible d’avoir suivi une formation en cours d’emploi que leurs homologues 

occupant un emploi non automatisable. Les différences sont également fortes 

s’agissant de la participation à la formation en dehors du cadre professionnel, les 

travailleurs les plus menacés par l’automatisation ayant une probabilité environ 

deux fois plus faible de suivre une formation formelle et 3.5 fois plus faible de 

suivre une formation à distance. Les constatations sont les mêmes en ce qui 

concerne la durée de la formation : toutes choses égales par ailleurs, les personnes 

qui occupent un emploi totalement automatisable consacrent 29 heures de moins 

par an à la formation professionnelle que celles qui exercent une activité non 

automatisable. Ces conclusions montrent à quel point il est important d’offrir des 

formations en dehors du cadre professionnel, en particulier aux travailleurs qui 

occupent un emploi comportant essentiellement des tâches automatisables. 

 Il ressort de l’analyse des données nationales allemandes que la formation est 
utilisée pour accéder à des emplois moins exposés au risque d’automatisation. 

L’étude du contenu des formations désormais suivies par les travailleurs 

allemands révèle une diminution du risque d’automatisation. Il est permis d’en 

déduire que les participants aux formations utilisent déjà la reconversion – la 

participation à une formation qui permet d’acquérir une nouvelle qualification – 

pour accéder à des emplois moins automatisables. Toutefois, ces transitions entre 

emplois se font progressivement, en ce sens que les travailleurs choisissent de se 

reconvertir dans des professions étroitement liées en termes de qualifications 

requises à celle correspondant à leur formation antérieure. À l’avenir, des 

transitions plus radicales pourraient se révéler nécessaires à mesure que l’écart de 

qualification entre les emplois en déclin et les emplois en croissance se creusera, 

si bien que l’efficacité des systèmes de formation pour adultes pourrait être 

insuffisante.  

Dans l’ensemble, le fait que les chiffres relatifs à la destruction d’emplois obtenus dans 

cette étude à partir de données relatives aux tâches spécifiques à chaque emploi soient 

inférieurs à ceux calculés sur la base des professions ne doit pas faire oublier combien il 

est essentiel que les 14 % de travailleurs dont l’emploi risque de se transformer 

radicalement ou de disparaître aient accès à une protection sociale et à une formation pour 

se reconvertir. Ces travailleurs bénéficient très rarement d’une formation proposée par 

leur employeur. En outre, divers facteurs peuvent les empêcher de participer à la 

formation des adultes, notamment le manque de connaissances de base, de temps et de 

motivation. Parallèlement, comme une forte proportion de travailleurs occupe des 

emplois qui risquent d’évoluer sensiblement sous l’effet de l’automatisation, il faudrait 

que les pays améliorent leurs politiques de formation des adultes afin de préparer la 

population active dans la perspective de l’évolution des compétences requises. 

Enfin, cette étude met en évidence, sans toutefois les traiter, certains aspects importants 

qui feront l’objet de travaux ultérieurs. Premièrement, comme souligné précédemment, 

elle aborde l’automatisation sous l’angle des possibilités technologiques, 

indépendamment de la pénétration et de l’adoption des technologies. Des travaux en 

cours devraient apporter un éclairage sur la probabilité concrète d’automatisation et son 

échéance dans différents secteurs d’activité et pays. Deuxièmement, l’étude ne fait 

qu’aborder les effets négatifs que le progrès technologique peut avoir sur les salaires, en

mettant en évidence la corrélation négative entre le risque d’automatisation estimé et le 

salaire horaire. Ce lien est analysé de manière plus approfondie dans le cadre de travaux 

sur l’inégalité et la polarisation des salaires qui donneront lieu à une réflexion plus large 

sur la nécessité éventuelle d’une redistribution des revenus. Troisièmement, il est possible 

que la concentration régionale du risque d’automatisation amplifie ses retombées sociales 

et économiques, en particulier dans les pays où la mobilité géographique est limitée. 

L’OCDE a engagé des travaux pour effectuer des estimations régionales du risque 

d’automatisation afin de mettre en évidence les implications de la concentration de ce 

risque pour l’action publique.

AUTOMATION, SKILLS USE AND TRAINING 

For Official Use 

1.  Introduction 

1. How new technologies transform work has always been a fascinating topic for 
analysts. Whenever there is a new potentially impactful technology, the media and 

academia become busy predicting its potential impact on people’s jobs and lives. 

The timing of technological breakthroughs is often surprising and poorly predicted. Less 

than 15 years ago, Autor, Levy and Murnane (Autor, Levy and Murnane, 2003[1]) 

(ALM hereafter) suggested that computers were good at performing repetitive routine 

cognitive and manual tasks, but poor at performing non-routine tasks, which are tacit in 

nature, or which require “flexibility, creativity, generalised problem-solving, and complex 

communications.” (p. 1280). Less than 10 years after ALM wrote their influential work 

on the skill content of the recent technological change, many of the tasks they identified 

as non-routine, and hence non-automatable, were found well within the reach of 

cutting-edge technologies. Advances in machine vision and simultaneous localisation and 

mapping have brought the long-standing dream of automated vehicles closer to 

commercialisation than ever in the past. In 2016, IBM Watson showed that it can 

combine big data and artificial intelligence (AI) to outperform oncologists in complex 

cognitive tasks such as cancer diagnosis and treatment recommendations. In fact, the 

scope of what digital technologies can do expanded so much that more recent work on job 

automation found it easier to ask “what is that computers cannot do” than to keep asking 

“what is that computers can do.” 

2. The debate on how many jobs might be destroyed by technology advances was 
reignited, in 2013, by Carl Frey and Michael Osborne who collected expert views about 

the likelihood of automation in a selected set of 70 occupations. In the exercise run by the 

two researchers, experts were asked to assess whether “the tasks in these occupations are 

sufficiently specified, conditional on the availability of big data, to be performed by 

state-of-the-art computer equipment”. This allowed identifying the so-called bottlenecks 

to automation – i.e. the tasks that, given the current state of knowledge, are difficult to 

automate. These include: social intelligence, such as the ability to effectively negotiate 

complex social relationships, including caring for others or recognizing cultural 

sensitivities; cognitive intelligence, such as creativity and complex reasoning; and 

perception and manipulation, such as the ability to carry out physical tasks in an 

unstructured work environment. This information was used to obtain a risk of automation 

for each occupational title, including about 630 occupations outside the initial 70. In the 

United States, Frey and Osborne (2013) estimated that 47% of jobs are at high risk of 

being automated. 

3. A set of more recent studies have challenged these extremely high figures. These 
studies build on evidence from the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) that there is 

considerable variation in tasks within occupational groups and show how accounting for 

this variation is essential to gauge the extent of the problem and brings the estimates of 

jobs threatened by automation down significantly. Arntz, Zierhan and Gregory (2016), 

for instance, put this share to 9% in the United States.

AUTOMATION, SKILLS USE AND TRAINING

4. This study builds on the work done by Arntz, Zierhan and Gregory (2016) for 
OECD and exploits PIAAC to account for the variation in tasks within narrowly-defined 

occupational groups. Compared to the previous study, coverage is broadened to the 32 

countries that have participated in the PIAAC survey so far and the engineering 

bottlenecks identified by Frey and Osborne (2013) are more clearly identified. In doing 

so, the current study closely aligns in spirit to the assessment of the potential automation 

deriving from the development of Machine Learning. The methodological differences 

also imply that this study covers a broader set of workers than the study by Arntz, Zierhan 

and Gregory (2016). Notably, it includes workers who lack basic computer skills and/or 

are in jobs that do not require using a computer. As the use of ICT correlates negatively 

with the risk of automation, this results in a higher estimated share of jobs at risk of 

automation. 

5. However, these improvements come with a caveat. In order to identify the same 
70 occupations used in Frey and Osborne (2013) in PIAAC, ISCO at the 4-digit level is 

needed. This level of disaggregation is available for Canada where sample size in PIAAC 

is particularly large. Hence, the relationship between the engineering bottlenecks and the 

risk of automation is estimated using Canadian data and then the estimation coefficients 

are applied to calculate the risk of automation of jobs beyond the original 70 occupations 

and outside Canada. This is a major improvement over previous work which exploited 

occupational titles at the 2-digit level only, preventing the exact identification in PIAAC 

of the 70 occupations used by Frey and Osborne. However, while there is no specific 

reason to believe that the way bottlenecks relate to the risk of automation differs across 

countries, it is possible that Canada’s specific industrial structure and its position in 

global value chain may influence the coefficients. Overall, the pros of conducting the 

estimation on better defined occupations and the larger sample size outweigh the cons 

which should nevertheless be kept in mind. 

6. The PIAAC-based analysis is complemented by evidence from job-task surveys 
in the United Kingdom and Germany. This allows checking the robustness of the PIAAC 

results for these two countries against national sources. It also allows exploring the 

changes over time in the task composition of jobs as time series are available for both 

countries, with the caveat that trends in these two countries cannot be generalised to other 

PIAAC participants as they may depend on factors such as the penetration and adoption 

of technology, the productive structure, and the position of the countries in global value 

chains. 

7. In addition to estimating the share of workers whose jobs are at very high risk of 
being automated using the methodology briefly described above, this study sheds light on 

a number of other crucial issues. First, it brings attention to the bigger group of workers 

whose job tasks would likely change significantly as a result of the current wave of 

technological innovations. Second, it looks at the characteristics of jobs at risk of 

automation and the characteristics of workers in these jobs. Finally, it offers an 

assessment of the risk of automation against the use of ICT at work and the role of 

training in helping workers transit to new career opportunities. 

8. The study is organised as follows. Section 2 summarises the past and near-future 
trends in the supply of and the demand for skills. Section 3 reviews the key literature on 

the effects of digitalisation on the labour market. Section 4 introduces the estimates of the 

risk of automation in 32 OECD countries, provides cross-country comparisons and 

studies the characteristics of workers in jobs at risk of automation. Section 5 tests how 

predictive the measure of job automation used in the paper is when it comes to actual

labour market developments. Section 6 studies the changes of skill demands over time in 

Germany and the United Kingdom. Section 7 analyses the relationship between skills and 

ICT. Section 8 checks the robustness of PIAAC-based findings for Germany and the 

United Kingdom against results obtained with country-specific surveys. Section 9 

discussed the role of training, on-the-job and outside the job, in preparing workers 

affected by automation to transition to other career paths. Section 10 concludes and 

highlights the potential for further work.

9. Before starting to dwell on the relationships between automation, employment, 
wages and work content, it is useful to gain an understanding of the general labour market 

trends, past and projected, in OECD countries. As discussed in more than one instance in 

this study, automation has proven much more likely to redistribute the demand for 

various skills and jobs than to eliminate work altogether. Therefore, the degree to which 

OECD countries experience technological unemployment depends not only on the 

disruptiveness of the technological change, but also on the readiness of the educational 

systems and the industries themselves to meet the demand for changing skill profiles with 

relevant education, training and re-training. 

2.1. Long-term trends in skill demand 

10. The actual demand for jobs and skills is difficult to measure. However, 
employment levels and shares of occupational groups are considered good proxies 

(Handel 2012, p. 11). Focusing on occupations has become more and more common in 

this literature, following the findings that much of our skills are occupation-specific 

(Kambourov and Manovskii 2009; Gathmann and Schoenberg 2010). However, some of 

the skills we use at work are also industry-specific (Neal 1995; Parent 2000), so in 

addition to occupations, industry employment patterns are also informative. Focusing on 

employment shares (as opposed to employment levels) is intentional. By shedding light 

on the relative changes in groups’ employment instead of the absolute changes, 

employment shares are more informative about the biases in employment creation and 

destruction. As discussed later, such biases typically originate in organisational and 

technological changes in the production process. 

11. Handel (2012) shows that most OECD countries saw their manufacturing jobs rise 
as a share of total employment between the 1950s and the 1970s, and decline afterwards. 

Starting in the 1950s, countries with a sizeable share of agricultural employment saw this 

share decline sharply in parallel to the rise in manufacturing employment. The share of 

agricultural employment remained stable in countries where it was low to start with. 

In parallel, throughout the whole period, Handel evidenced a steady growth of the 

employment shares of professionals, managers and service jobs. Interestingly, clerical 

jobs first grew, until the 1980s or 1990s depending on the country, and then started to 

decline. 

12. For more recent trends and forecasts of occupational and industry-specific job 
demand in OECD countries, it is helpful to highlight the findings by Cedefop (2016a and 

2016b). The Cedefop Skills Forecast program offers occupation-level and industry-level 

10-year employment estimates and forecasts for the 28 member countries of the European 

Union (EU-28). According to Cedefop (2016a), between 2005 and 2015, the economy of 

EU 28 grew by 3%, but growth rates differed significantly across economic sectors 

(Figure 2.1). The employment share of the primary sector and utilities shrank 1.2%age 

points (pp), the one of the manufacturing sector shrank 2.1 pp, and the one of

construction shrank by 0.7 pp. At the same time, services expanded their shares in total 

employment: non-market services by 0.7, business and other services by 2.9 and 

distribution and transport by 0.4 pp. In the next 10 years (2015-2025), Cedefop expects 

that the primary sector and the manufacturing sector will each reduce their shares in total 

employment by about 1 pp, while business and other services will increase their share by 

2 pp. At the same time, the employment shares of construction, distribution and transport, 

and non-market services are not expected to change significantly. 

Figure 2.1. Changes in employment shares, past and projected by economic sector 

 

Source: Cedefop skills forecast 2016, as published in Cedefop (2016a) and Cedefop (2016b)  

 

13. In terms of occupations (Figure 2.2), highly skilled occupations (managers, 
professionals, associate professionals and technicians) experienced sizeable expansions in 

their shares between 2005 and 2015, continuing the trends observed in Handel (2012). 

The share of service and sales workers also grew 1 pp, and the one of elementary 

occupations grew 0.4 pp. At the same time, production workers, crafts workers, 

agricultural workers and clerks all saw their employment shares decline (by 0.8, 1.8, 0.9 

and 0.6 pp respectively). These growth trends for all but service and sales workers are 

expected to continue until 2025. In the case of service and sales workers Cedefop expects 

a trend reversal – their employment share is expected to slightly shrink this coming 

decade.

14. Unlike the EU, the United States haves been experiencing somewhat different 
developments when it comes to the jobs for highly educated since the turn of the 

21
st 

century. Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and Beaudry, Green and Sand (2016) showed 

that, in the United States, employment growth among the highly skilled occupations has 

slowed down drastically since 2000. Beaudry, Green and Sand (2016) associate this 

decline with the 2000 bust of the dotcom bubble. They suggest that the IT industry in the 

United States reached maturity around the turn of the century. The period of innovation 

and cognitive investment in the industry was completed at about that time and the 

industry started routinising, shedding employment among the managers and other 

cognitive workers. These conclusions are somewhat at odds with the Bureau of Labour 

Statistics (BLS) 2014-2024 projections for jobs in the United States IT sector and at odds 

with the expectations that other scholars have for the future of the IT sector (Brynjolfsson 

and McAfee 2014). While jobs as IT managers are projected to grow slower than the 

average, most other IT jobs (system managers, IT engineers, software developers etc.) are 

projected to grow faster than the average employment growth (Bureau of Labour 

Statistics 2016). 

15. The pattern of change shown in Figure 2.2 sheds light on the widely-observed job 
polarisation in developed economies (Goos and Manning 2007; Goos, Manning and 

Salomons 2009 and 2014). Job polarisation refers to the phenomenon of hollowing out of 

the middle-paid, middle-skilled jobs in developed countries. Workers in the declining 

occupations in Figure 2.2 used to constitute the middle-paid group in the 1970s and 

the 1980s, while the workers in growing occupations were either the high (managers,

(elementary occupations, sales and other service jobs). 

16. The occupation and industry-specific trends tell us little about what happens to 
the skill demands within occupations and industries. If the job content of occupations and 

industries changes over time, we would understate the degree to which the skill demands 

in the economy change. ALM documented that, in the United States, within the same 

industries, the demand for routine cognitive and routine manual tasks at work has been 

decreasing since the 1980s, while non-routine manual tasks have been declining at least 

since the 1960s (Table 2.1). On the other hand, within the same industries, non-routine 

cognitive and non-routine interactive tasks have been increasing since the 1960s. 

Spitz-Oener (2006) showed that West Germany experienced similar within-occupational 

trends between 1979 and 1999. Throughout the whole period, routine cognitive and 

routine manual tasks declined within occupations, while non-routine cognitive, 

non-routine interactive and non-routine manual tasks grew (Table 2.2). Handel (2012) 

shows that these trends continued in the new century. Analysing changes in the 

occupational skill requirements of countries around the world, he concludes that the 

educational, cognitive and interpersonal skill requirements have been gradually 

increasing, while craft skills, physical demands and the repetitive physical tasks have 

declined. He also finds that these changes were more rapid in European countries than in 

the United States, and that the reason for this is that the United States de-routinised earlier 

than Europe.

17. The between and within occupational and industry shifts away from routine and 
towards non-routine tasks are tightly related to the trends in educational upgrading in 

OECD countries. Using data for 11 OECD-member countries, Michaels, Natraj and 

van Reenen (2014) show that the wage share of jobs typically requiring tertiary education 

increased by an average of 10 pp between 1980 and 2004. The largest expansion 



28 │ DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2018)3 
 

 

AUTOMATION, SKILLS USE AND TRAINING

happened in the UK (16.5 pp), Finland (15.2 pp), the United States (13.9 pp) and 

the Netherlands (13.1 pp). Interestingly, in three out of four of these countries (United 

States, Finland, and the Netherlands), the wage share of tertiary educated was already far 

above the estimated mean across the 11 countries in 1980. The smallest expansion in the 

wage bill of the highly educated was observed in Denmark (4.1 pp), Italy (5.3 pp), 

Austria (5.4 pp) and Germany (6.3 pp). These happen to also be countries where the wage 

share of tertiary educated was below the estimated cross-country mean in 1980. The wage 

share of the medium skilled also expanded in all countries, except for the United States 

and the Netherlands, where it declined by 5.1 and 2.9 pp respectively. Finally, the wage 

share of the low skilled declined across the board, losing 18.7 pp on average. Michaels, 

Natraj and van Reenen (2014) also show that already in the 1980s, highly skilled 

Americans specialised in non-routine cognitive tasks, middle-skilled specialised in 

routine cognitive and routine manual tasks and low-skilled Americans specialised in 

routine cognitive and non-routine manual. Hence, as the demand for non-routine tasks 

increased, so did the demand for tertiary education. 

2.2. Supply Trends 

18. On the supply side, educational attainment has been increasing across all OECD 
member countries. Between 1971 and 2014, the average tertiary school enrolment ratio

1
 

in OECD countries increased by a spectacular 46.3 pp, from 23.7% in 1971 to 70% in 

2014 (Table 2.3). 

19. Moreover, the changes in the choice of occupational training in developed 
economies show that educational upgrading is a mechanism through which economies 

move away from learning routine cognitive tasks and manual tasks and towards learning 

non-routine cognitive and interactive tasks. Data for Germany shows this very clearly 

(Figure 2.3). Germans who enrolled in occupational training (vocational training, applied 

sciences college or university education) in the 1960s and the 1970s opted for 

occupations that typically have higher frequency of routine cognitive tasks and manual 

tasks (both routine and non-routine) than did Germans who started occupational training 

in the most recent decades.

 These estimates measure the typical occupational task content as of 2012, meaning that they 

ignore the within-occupational task changes. Moreover, the data comes from a survey of working 

Germans in 2012 and not from separate representative surveys in each decade. These two facts 

imply that the actual trends in job task changes are steeper than the ones reported here.

2.3. Supply meets demand 

20. The demand for skills is driven by technological changes, but also by institutional 
factors (e.g., level of unionization and employment protection) and the patterns of 

international trade, and with that, the international division of labour. The supply side is 

driven by the decisions of educational institutions, the provision of employer training and 

on-the-job learning, and for many countries, migration. In their work on “the race 

between education and technology,” Goldin and Katz (2007, 2009) analyse how the 

supply of and demand for people with different levels of education determined their 

groups’ wage premia in the United States between 1915 and 2005. Throughout most of 

the century, the college premium increased when relative demand for college graduates 

outstripped relative supply and it declined when relative supply surpassed relative 

demand. Since the 1980s, they find, technology has been racing in front of education, 

driving up the college premium. 

21. Educational and occupational wage premia and real wage developments are 
excellent indicators of over or undersupply of certain workers. The premia are typically 

estimated against a reference group, e.g., the premium to college degree against only 

having a high school degree and are hence informative of the relative wage 

developments. The developments in real wages by occupation or education, i.e., these 

wages adjusted for inflation, however show how different groups fare in real terms, i.e., 

whether their standard of living is improving or worsening. Education-specific real wages

in the United States have changed dramatically since the 1960s. Figure 2.4 plots the 

development of real log earnings by gender and education level for samples of full-time, 

full-year workers in the United States. Each series is normalised at zero in the starting 

year of 1963, and the subsequent values correspond to the log change in earnings for each 

group relative to its 1963 level. There are three distinct periods in terms of wage trends in 

the figure. The first period is the first decade (1963-1973), where real wages rose for 

males and females and for all educational groups. The second period started with the 

1973 oil shock and lasted for a decade. During this period, male wages either fell or 

stagnated and female wages mainly stagnated. The third period started in the mid-1980s 

with a sharp divergence in wage rates across educational attainment groups. This 

development has been most pronounced in the case of male workers. Real wages of male 

post-graduates and college graduates have risen, while the wages of all other educational 

groups have declined. In the case of female workers wages have grown across all 

educational groups but at different rates. Raising wage inequality is evident for both 

genders. 

22. Summing up, while remaining agnostic about the drivers of demand and supply 
for now, starting in the mid-1980s demand for college and post-college graduates has 

increased relative to other educational groups. In line with the conclusions by Goldin and 

Katz (2007, 2009), demand has outpaced supply for these educational group bringing 

about real wage increases. At the same time, the lack of demand for the other, less 

educated groups, relative to their supply levels, has resulted in a real wage decline. 

If educational institutions had been quick to realize this trend and adjust the supply 

accordingly, the developments might have looked very different today. Hence, from a 

policy perspective, it is critical to understand that the effects of technological change on 

the employment and wage outcomes of citizens are deeply dependent on how well 

educational and training institutions can anticipate demand shifts and how quickly and 

substantively they can respond to them. While it may be difficult to control the diffusion 

of technologies, it is certainly possible to mitigate their “dark side”
3
 by designing timely 

and adequate institutional responses.

3.  The effects of digitalisation on jobs and skills 

23. For most of the 20th century, technological innovations were considered to be 
skill-biased, i.e. they increased the demand for the educated relative to the demand for the 

less-educated (Nelson and Phelps 1966; Katz and Murphy 1992; Goldin and Katz 1998; 

Bekman, Bound and Machin 1998; Violante 2008). Nelson and Phelps (1966) explained 

that “education enhances one’s ability to receive, decode, and understand information.” 

This ability of workers is particularly important in jobs where technological 

improvements are common and where workers need to keep up with technology by 

learning new things (p. 69). Renowned economists of the 20
th
 century repeatedly 

predicted that new technologies would directly replace labour
4
, but these predictions 

proved erroneous or premature: in spite of structural sectoral and occupational shifts, 

aggregate employment kept growing. The case of digital technologies, and computers in 

particular was no different. The research work on this topic focused on the aspect of 

capital-labour complementarities (Krueger 1993; Autor, Katz and Krueger 1998, Machin 

and Van Reenen 1998; Bresnahan, Brynjolfsson, and Hitt 2002) and less on the 

substitution of labour by capital. The changes in the employment structure along the skill 

dimension could be explained by labour movements from less skilled to more skilled 

jobs, and the jobs created by growing sectors (first manufacturing, then services) more 

than compensated the job destruction in declining sectors (first agriculture, then 

manufacturing) in developed economies. 

24. In 2003, ALM published an analysis that looked into the task content of jobs that 
use computers and explicitly argued that computer capital is both task-complementing 

and task-substituting. They put forward that computer capital “substitutes for workers in 

performing cognitive and manual tasks that can be accomplished by following explicit 

rules; and complements workers in performing non-routine problem-solving and complex 

communications tasks” (p. 1279). What computers can do well, the authors argued, 

is follow exact procedures designed by programmers. That means that computers can 

only be made to perform tasks that humans have thoroughly understood and meticulously 

codified. Moreover, these need to be tasks that can technically be executed by 

technology. Tasks with high tacit content, and tasks requiring situational adaptability, 

visual and language recognition, and in-person interaction, i.e. non-routine manual and 

interactive tasks, are out of reach for computers. This also holds for tasks that require 

creativity, problem-solving and persuasion (abstract tasks). This seminal empirical work, 

employing what is now referred to as “the task-based approach,” fundamentally changed 

the course of research on this topic. The basic mechanism behind the computer-skill 

interaction is quite straightforward. The price of computers fell dramatically

introduction and the time when this study was conducted, leading to wide-spread 

adoption across industries. Jobs specialised in routine tasks started competing directly 

with computers. As computers became cheaper and more prevalent, employers opted for 

computer-performed routine tasks rather than human-performed routine tasks. 

However, routine tasks and non-routine tasks are complements. As a consequence, 

the increased supply of (computer-performed) routine tasks increased the demand for 

non-routine tasks, driving the wages and employment of non-routine jobs up. 

This analytical and empirical framework proved extremely predictive of the 

developments of the relative demands for labour and job polarisation (Goos and Manning 

2007; Autor, Katz and Kearney 2006; Antonczyk, DeLeire and Fitzenberger 2010; Goos, 

Manning and Salomons 2009 and 2014), educational upgrading (ALM, Spitz-Oener 

2006), and wage inequality (Dustmann, Ludsteck and Schoenberg 2009; Autor, Katz and 

Kearney 2008; Acemoglu and Autor 2011) until recently. 

25. Less than ten years after the ALM study was published, digital technology 
advanced so much that the ALM categorization of tasks seemed partially outdated. 

Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014) and Frey and Osborne (2013 and 2017), among others, 

argued that digital innovations, and in particular in machine learning, have made many 

tasks that ALM considered out of reach for computers for many more years achievable. 

The self-driving car has become a plausible threat to driving jobs, ranging from taxis, 

Uber and Lyft to bus and truck drivers and drivers of construction machinery. Language 

translation, including simultaneous translation is widely available to everyone with 

internet access through technologies such as Google Translate and Skype Translation. 

In 2016, IBM’s Watson and DeepMind Health proved to be better at diagnosing rare 

cancers than human doctors. Journalistic text writing, at least simple ones, can now be 

partially automated, as can personal financial advice (Frey and Osborne 2017; Mims, 

2010). According to Frey and Osborne (2017) (FO) these innovations expand the list of 

potentially automatable jobs to drivers, translators, tax analysts, medical diagnostics, 

legal assistants, security guards, law enforcement officers, teachers, HR workers, 

financial analysts, and even software programmers.

3.1. Labour Market Implications 

26. The labour market implications of a strictly skill-biased technological change 
(SBTC) are different from the ones of a task-biased technological change (TBTC). SBTC 

would increase the relative employment and wages of the more skilled. It could also 

increase the real wages and employment levels of the most skilled if certain conditions 

are met: elastic output demand and inelastic skilled labour supply (Autor 2015). 

As technologies make certain work that complements highly skilled workers cheaper, we 

can reasonably expect that the demand for this output would grow. On the labour supply 

side, education takes time to acquire and even if schools are able to quickly react to 

changing labour demands and quickly absorb new applicants, the time it takes to educate 

a labour force cohort will induce a lag between demand and supply. 

27. ALM-type TBTC would have similar implications as SBTC on real and relative 
wages, as well as employment levels and relative employment, but the important 

                                                      
6
 In contrast, the ALM framework typically categorizes clerical, administrative support workers, 

sales workers, production, crafts, repair, and operative occupations among those that can be 

automated.

dimension would not be the level of education, but the task content of jobs/occupation, 

i.e. the degree to which a job/occupation is routinisable. Non-routinisable jobs would see 

an increase in relative employment and wages, as well as an increase in real wages,
7
 

at least in the short run, and a higher employment level. Moreover, TBTC would erode 

the real wages and employment of those in routinisable jobs/occupations. In the 1970s 

and the 1980s routinisable jobs were concentrated in the middle of the wage distribution 

in OECD countries. Many clerical and blue collar manufacturing workers occupied these 

middle-paying jobs. Hence, TBTC has distinctively different empirical predictions than 

SBTC: it predicts that the most adversely affected occupations will be middle-paid ones. 

3.1.1. Wage developments 

28. In the United States, starting in the 1980s, real wages rose for highly educated 
workers, particularly those with a post-college education, and fell steeply for the least 
educated. For male workers in particular, the real hourly wage in 2009 was significantly 
lower for those with less than 14 years of education than what similar workers would 
have earned in 1973 or 1989. For instance, a male worker with only 7 years of education 
earned 18% lower hourly wages in 2009 than a similar worker in the 1970s or the 1980s. 
At the same time, a worker with 18 years of education, earned 22% more in 2009 than in 
the 1970s and the 1980s (Acemoglu and Autor 2011). These wage dynamics translated in 
the widely-observed rising wage inequality in the United States (Bound and Johnson 
1995; Levy and Murnane 1992; Murphy and Welch 1992; Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce 
1993; Katz and Murphy 1992; Acemoglu 2002; Autor, Katz, and Kearney 2008). 

29. This pattern was not unique to the United States. Rising income inequality since 
the 1980s was observed in other OECD countries, such as the United Kingdom (Gosling, 
Machin, and Meghir 2000), Canada (Boudarbat, Lemieux, and Riddell 2006) and 
Germany (Dustmann, Ludsteck and Schoenberg 2009; Antonczyk et al. 2010). In addition 
to OECD countries, Piketty (2014) documented rising inequality in emerging economies. 

30. While the rise in wage inequality was found to coincide with wage polarisation in 
the United States in the 1990s, when lower tail inequality increased and upper tail 
inequality decreased, this was not the case in later decades or in other countries. Rather, 
most countries have seen an increase in the gap between top and median wages, and 
either a stable or increasing gap between median and bottom wages (OECD, 2017). 

3.1.2. Employment 

31. Goos and Manning (2007) were among the first ones to notice that the changes in 
the employment structure of OECD countries followed a pattern that is difficult to 
reconcile with SBTC. For the UK, they found that since the mid-1970s, the employment 
shares of the lowest and the highest paid occupations have been growing at the account of 
those in the middle. They termed this phenomenon job polarisation. Autor, Katz and 
Kearney (2006) documented a similar pattern for the United States. Goos, Manning and 
Salomons (2009 and 2014) and OECD (2017) documented that job polarisation has been 
prevalent across 16 OECD countries. All these studies argue that TBTC is the driving 
force behind job polarisation. What are these middle-paying jobs? They are mainly the 
skilled blue-collar jobs, unskilled labourers, the clerical and the sales occupations whose 

                                                      
7
 This assumes that there are at least some frictions or costs to workers who would switch from 

routine to non-routine jobs. If there is sufficient supply of workers in non-routine jobs, wages will, 

of course, not increase.

AUTOMATION, SKILLS USE AND TRAINING

job tasks fall in the categories of routine manual and routine cognitive work (Acemoglu 
and Autor 2011; Autor 2015). The clerical and some of the sales jobs typically require 
high school and some college. The production jobs typically require some form of 
vocational training. Hence, at least to a degree, the middle paying jobs fall within the 
category of middle-skilled jobs. 

3.1.3. Declining labour-capital ratio and premature industrialisation 

32. Berger and Frey (2016) review the cumulating evidence of declining labour share 
in income, and related to this, premature deindustrialisation of countries. Karabarbounis 

and Neiman (2014) document that the share of global corporate gross value added paid to 

labour across 59 countries declined 5 pp over the past 35 years. Among these 59 

countries, 42 experienced a decline in the labour share. At the industry level, 6 of the 10 

major industries experienced significant labour share declines (mining, manufacturing, 

transport, utilities, wholesale and retail, and public services) and 2 experienced significant 

growth (agriculture, financial services and business services). They find that most of the 

global decline in the labour share can be attributed to within-industry changes and not to 

changes in industrial composition of countries. They consider several factors that might 

have caused this decline, but conclude that the most likely factor is the decline in the 

price of investment goods, which incentivised companies to shift the production function 

from employing labour to utilising technology. Rodrik (2015) describes that peak 

manufacturing employment has steadily declined among emerging economies over the 

course of the twentieth century, leading to what is often termed as the middle-income 

trap. The employment share of manufacturing in the world’s first industrial nation, 

the United Kingdom, peaked at about 45%, while manufacturing employment in today’s 

emerging economies typically peaked at below 15%. 

3.1.4. Educational upgrading and skill mismatch 

33. As technology changes the character of job tasks, how do people adapt to new 
ones? SBTC would suggest that technology prefers highly educated workers and that 

adaptation to new technologies takes place through selection and matching between 

skilled workers and technologically innovative jobs (Nelson and Phelps 1966). There is 

probably a lot of truth in this because the skill supply has been a strong predictor of 

skill-specific wage premia (Katz and Murphy 1992; Goldin and Katz 2007 and 2009) and 

skill upgrading has been the mark of the 20
th
 and the 21

st
 centuries. However, skills are 

multidimensional, and not single-dimensional as depicted by most economists. A degree 

in biology has a fundamentally different quality than a degree in law. These two fields 

may require the same years of schooling, but the skills obtained in each one of them are 

not interchangeable. Probably the only way a lawyer could become a decent biologist is 

to attend the full length of education that biologists undertook. And although both types 

of occupational education teach high-level of analytical and interactive skills, the nature 

of these differs in each training. This means as well that making one of these occupations 

obsolete would not translate into frictionless employment transition from the obsolete 

occupation to the growing one. 

34. Given the gravity of the technological transformation we are undergoing, there is 
astonishingly little research effort in understanding the subsequent response through skill 

adjustment. Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2015) find that Americans that were displaced as 

a result of automation opt for non-participation rather than unemployment, suggesting 

that they become discouraged to search for jobs. However, for Germany, Nedelkoska 

(2013) finds that the workers displaced from routinised jobs are more likely to switch 



DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2018)3 │ 37 
 

 

AUTOMATION, SKILLS USE AND TRAINING 

For Official Use 

occupations than to become unemployed.
8
 Fujita (2014) analyses the causes for the 

increasing non-participation in the American labour market and finds that, along with 

retirement, non-participation due to schooling and disability explain most of its increase. 

This means that to some extent non-participation masks the increases in re-qualification 

also in the American labour market. However, it is important to note that in absence of 

regional re-qualification opportunities, the skill gap between the obsolete routinised 

occupations and the growing non-routine ones may discourage workers to search for jobs 

– this may be one reason why many opt to claim disability benefits rather than retrain. 

Nedelkoska, Neffke and Wiederhold (2015) analysed the job transitions of displaced 

workers in Germany between 1975 and 2010 and found that workers who after being 

displaced from their jobs moved to occupations requiring skill upgrades (relative to their 

pre-displacement job), did not experience the typically observed long-term earnings 

losses (Jacobson, La Londe, and Sullivan 1993; Neal 1995; Fallick 1996; Schmieder, 

von Wachter and Bender 2010), but workers who after job displacement moved to 

occupations where they were down-skilled compared to their pre-displacement jobs, 

experienced large long-term earnings losses. This suggests that re-qualification and 

upskilling play a key role in mitigating the difficult transitions awaiting workers whose 

skills have been rendered obsolete by technological progress. 

35. Finally, while re-qualification and the educational choices of the young are highly 
important, one should not oversee the skill-shifts that happen at the workplace. A great 

deal of skill upgrading happens at the job. ALM and Spitz-Oener (2006) for instance find 

that the intensity of non-routine analytic and interactive tasks increased within the same 

educational groups and the intensity of routine manual and cognitive tasks decreased 

within the same educational groups in the course of the 1980s and the 1990s. ALM also 

show that computer adoption can explain large share of the variance in task changes, and 

in the case of high school graduates, the full variance. Hence, adaptation does not only 

happen through requalification, but also through the change in the work content of jobs. 

3.2. Innovation, Diffusion, and Market Responses 

36. The ALM framework is accompanied by a large number of studies which, 
as elabourated earlier, show that the automation of routinised jobs had wide-spread 

implications on the labour markets of OECD countries since the 1980s. The more recent 

hypothesis that automation has a reach beyond routine tasks put forward by Brynjolfsson, 

McAfee, Frey and Osborne and others has been less tested. One of the reasons for this is 

that many of their predictions apply to events that may unfold in the future, e.g., 

self-driving cars or large-scale computerised medical diagnosis, while ALM’s hypotheses 

were formulated to capture what automation was already doing. Moreover, specifically 

for the United States, for which FO’s study was designed, the Bureau of Labour Statistics 

projects that many of the occupations that FO categorize as being at a high risk of 

automation – translators and interpreters, marketing specialists, technical writers, medical 

and clinical labouratory technologists and others – will grow significantly faster than the 

average employment growth between 2014 and 2024 (Bureau of Labour Statistics, 2016). 

37. In 2014 Brynjolfsson and McAfee found that the jobless recovery following the 
2008 Great Recession could be attributed to automation. Indeed, Jaimovich and Siu

 National statistics show that the participation rate in the USA has been declining since the 

mid-1990s, while the opposite is the case for Germany.

AUTOMATION, SKILLS USE AND TRAINING

(2014) found that about 80% of the jobless recovery in the last two recessions can be 

attributed to the loss of routine employment, resulting in job polarisation. In line with 

a pattern suggested by Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014), Autor (2015) showed that, 

for the United States, polarisation changed in nature over the most recent decade. While 

the general pattern is still polarising, the growth of jobs in the lowest skill percentiles 

accelerated, while the growth of jobs above the median skill percentile decelerated 

(p. 20). However, Autor also argues that the root cause of this changing aggregate 

behaviour is probably not automation. Private fixed investment in information processing 

equipment and software has been declining since the 2000 tech bust and currently stands 

at 1995 levels. A more plausible hypothesis, Beaudry, Green and Sand (2016) argue, 

is that the pattern is driven by the fact that the IT industry reached maturity around 

the 2000. Industry maturity typically means that process innovation has reached its peak 

and that there is less need for problem-solving and creative tasks (Klepper, 1996 and 

1997). The maturity of the IT industry dampened innovative activity and reduced 

the demand for high-skilled workers more broadly, Beaudry and colleagues conclude. 

38. If current technology can replace 47% of the jobs in the United States, as FO 
conclude

9
, why aren’t all jobs for which we have readily available technological 

substitutes disappearing? There are several reasons for this. 

3.2.1. Technologies help create new jobs 

39. Declining sectors free up human resources for other sectors of the economy. 
The automation of agriculture in the 1960s gave its way to manufacturing and 

the automation of manufacturing gave a way to services. As Bessen (2016) put it 

“Innovative technology is displacing workers to new jobs rather than replacing them 

entirely.” He finds that only manufacturing jobs are being eliminated persistently in 

developed economies, and that these losses are offset by growth in other occupations. 

Bessen’s finding is corroborated by the observation that despite the massive sectoral 

transformations within a single century, OECD countries have been adding, not losing 

jobs in net terms. His conclusion is in line with the trends in aggregate employment in 

developed economies. For instance, the number of employees in the United States in 

February 2017 reached 145.8 million. This is 6% more employees than in February 2007 

before the start of the Great recession, 205% more employees than in 1970, before the 

spread of commercial computers, and 487% more employees than in 1939, before the 

advent of the service economy (Bureau of Labour Statistics, 2017a). Automation also 

frees up human resources within the same jobs. Scientists are more productive today than 

they were three decades ago precisely because computing software performs the 

time-consuming calculations that data analysis requires: data organisation, cleaning, 

tabulation, and high-level mathematical and statistical computation such as regression 

analysis, network analysis and machine learning. The automation of the computational 

part of our work freed up resources that were reallocated to hypothesis formulation, 

method development, increasing the robustness of our tests, interpretation, writing and 

communication. 

                                                      
9
 Applying a method similar to the one of FO, but using individual-level job task data, Arntz, 

Gregory, Zierahn (2016) come to an estimate that is significantly more optimistic – they conclude 

that about 9% of jobs in OECD countries are at a high risk of automation.

3.2.2. Demand elasticity 

40. As ALM argued, what makes automation attractive is its cost-saving feature. 
Cost-saving technologies can reduce the final price of a product or a service. In the case 

of goods and services with high demand elasticity, lower final price will result in more 

purchases. Cases in point are ATMs, as described by Bessen (2016). Between the 1980s 

and today, 400 000 ATMs were installed in the United States. The number of bank tellers 

in the same period increased from 500 000 to almost 600 000. Bessen argues that ATMs 

increased the demand for tellers precisely because they reduced the cost of operating a 

bank branch. While the average number of tellers required to operate a branch office in 

urban areas fell by 35%, the number of bank branches in these areas increased by 43%. 

3.2.3. Innovation vs. diffusion 

41. The path between commercial introduction of a product and its wide-spread use is 
long and uncertain. Gort and Klepper (1982) estimated that the average time between 

the first commercial application and take off in the sales of 46 commercially successful 

inventions of the 19
th
 and the 20

th
 centuries was 14.4 years. However, most innovations 

with potentially commercial value never reach the stage of wide-spread application. 

The fact that a technology has commercial value does not guarantee its diffusion and it 

certainly does not guarantee that it will diffuse to a degree which disrupts the way people 

work. The electric car, for instance, was invented towards the end of the 19
th
 century, 

but it soon lost the battle against the cheaper, gasoline-fuelled car once the internal 

combustion engines were perfected and mass production of gasoline-based vehicles was 

enabled. The diffusion of modern-day electric cars is aided by generous government 

subsidies in countries like Norway and the Netherlands. Moreover, making electric 

vehicles mobile at long distances requires investment in new infrastructure - charging 

stations – that are not yet readily available in all places and countries. Their 

commercialisation does not only require perfecting the vehicles, but also changing 

the environment in which the vehicles operate. This is no different from the case of 

the self-driving car, and if anything, the environment control here is an even more 

pronounced obstacle to the diffusion of the self-driving car.

 “Computer scientists sometimes remark that the Google car does not drive on roads, but rather 

on maps. A Google car navigates through the road network primarily by comparing its real-time 

audio-visual sensor data against painstakingly hand-curated maps that specify the exact locations 

of all roads, signals, signage, and obstacles. The Google car adapts in real time to obstacles, such 

as cars, pedestrians, and road hazards, by braking, turning, and stopping. But if the car’s software 

determines that the environment in which it is operating differs from the environment that has been 

pre-processed by its human engineers - when it encounters an unexpected detour or a crossing 

guard instead of a traffic signal - the car requires its human operator to take control. Thus, while 

the Google car appears outwardly to be adaptive and flexible, it is somewhat akin to a train 

running on invisible tracks” (Autor, 2015, p. 24).

4.  Who is at risk of job automation? 

42. In 2003 ALM asked a simple but fundamental question about the relationship 
between computers and humans: “what do computers do – that is, the tasks they are best 

suited to accomplish – and how do these capabilities complement or substitute for human 

skills in workplace settings?” (p. 1280). By 2013, advances in machine learning (ML) and 

mobile robotics (MR) extended the list of job tasks that can be performed by machines by 

a degree that made the question “what is that machines cannot do” easier to answer than 

ALM’s question asked just ten years before. This change in perspective is reflected in 

FO’s approach to measuring the degree to which jobs are automatable (automatability). 

At the core of FO’s approach is identifying the current engineering bottlenecks that ML 

and MR developers are facing. To understand these, in 2013 FO interviewed ML 

scientists at a workshop held at the Oxford University Engineering Sciences Department. 

They showed the scientists a list of 70 occupations and their O*NET
11

 job tasks 

descriptions and asked “Can the tasks of this job be sufficiently specified, conditional on 

the availability of big data, to be performed by state of the art computer-controlled 

equipment?”. Those occupations for which the scientists agreed that all tasks can be 

automated were labelled 1 and occupations that could only be partially automated were 

labelled 0. The second source of data in FO’s approach is O*NET (www.onetonline.org). 

For each occupation (702 in total) O*NET provides detailed descriptions of job tasks. FO 

focused on 9 such descriptions (variables) that correspond to 3 distinct engineering 

bottlenecks identified through the interviews with ML scientists (Table 4.1).

43. In FO’s notation, the list of O*NET variables is a feature vector denoted as 𝒙 ℝ9. 
The feature vector is available for all 702 occupations in O*NET. The dataset constructed 

with the scientists’ answers – the so-called “training dataset” – is denoted as 𝐷 = (𝑿, 𝒚), 
where 𝑿 ∈ ℝ70×9 is the matrix of O*NET variables for the subset of 70 occupations and 
𝒚 ∈ {0,1}70 has the occupational labels of automatability. Using the training data, FO 
estimate the underlying latent probability of automation, 𝑃(𝑦∗ = 1|𝑓∗). This “true” 
probability of becoming automated as a function of the feature vector can be modelled in 

various ways. FO assume that the latent probability distribution is logistic: 

𝑃(𝑦∗ = 1|𝑓∗) =
1

1 + exp⁡(−𝑓∗)′
 

and explore two broad statistical approaches when modelling it: (a) modelling f∗ 
parametrically as a logistic regression, and (b) modelling it non-parametrically using 

Gaussian process (GP) classifiers, a machine learning technique. The logistic regression 

implies a simple monotonic relationship between the probability of automation and the 

feature vector, while the GP approach is non-parametric and more flexible in terms of 

functional forms. They try three different covariances of the GP: exponentiated quadratic, 

rational quadratic and linear covariances. Judging by conventional measures of model fit 

and in particular the area under the curve (AUC) criterion, the exponentiated quadratic 

model fitted the data best. Estimating these models for the subset of training data then 

allows for an out-of-sample prediction across all 702 occupations, since the feature vector 

is available for all of them. 

44. Using this approach, FO found that 47% of all 2010 employees in the United 
States were at a high risk (i.e. over 70% risk) of automation in near future, while only 

33% of the employees were at less than 30% risk of being automated. A few other studies 

translated FO’s study at the occupational level for other countries and found, not

surprisingly, correspondingly high risks of automation (Brzeski and Burk 2015; Pajarinen 

and Rouvinen (2014). Arntz, Gregory and Zierahn (2016) (AGZ) designed a study similar 

to the one by Frey and Osborne, however with two advantages: (a) they use PIAAC data 

for 22 countries and (b) they have access to individual-level data on job content. Contrary 

to FO, AGZ find that, on average, only 9% of jobs across the considered OECD countries 

are have a probability of automation equal of higher than 70%. 

4.1. Estimating the probability of automation using PIAAC data 

45. This study follows the FO approach very closely in order to analyse the risk of 
automation in 32 OECD countries. The individual-level data were collected through the 

first two rounds of the PIAAC study in 2011/2012 and 2014/2015 (OECD, 2013; OECD, 

2016; Quintini, 2016). In order to replicate FO as closely as possible for OECD countries, 

two empirical challenges needed to be met. First, a correspondence between the 70 hand 

labelled occupations in FO’s training data and a subset of the 440 ISCO-08 occupational 

classes in the PIAAC data was needed. This was done by manually comparing the 

70 O*NET occupations with the available ISCO data. The second challenge was to find 

job task variables in PIAAC that correspond to the engineering bottlenecks identified in 

FO. Table 4.2 shows the PIAAC variables that correspond to the three types of 

engineering bottlenecks: perception and manipulation, creative intelligence and social 

intelligence. While PIAAC contains variables that adequately match these areas, there is 

no perfect overlap with the O*NET variables selected in FO. Most importantly, there are 

no questions in PIAAC about job aspects which have to do with caring for and assisting 

others. This affects a large population working in healthcare and services. A potential 

consequence of missing this part of social intelligence is that automatability of jobs that 

involve care and assisting others will be overstated.

12

 In a replication of the FO approach using data from Germany (BIBB/BAuA Employment 

Survey), we find that caring for others is one of the most predictive variables of automatability. 

They are, of course, negatively correlated. However, we also find that caring for others correlates 

with advising (𝜌 = 0.19) and teaching (𝜌 = 0.28), hence we expect that some of its variance will 
be picked up by the other variables of social intelligence.

46.  An important difference between the approach using PIAAC data and the 
approach using O*NET data is that PIAAC offers individual-level data on job tasks. 

Taking advantage of this feature the latent variable function for the subset of training data 

is estimated at the individual level. A logistic regression is used, as done in one of the 

variants of the FO’s approach. Also, the training data is limited to Canada, because 

Canada has a substantially larger sample than any other country in PIAAC allowing 

a better identification of the 70 FO occupations.
13

 This is a major improvement over 

previous work which exploited occupational titles at the 2-digit level only, preventing the 

exact identification in PIAAC of many of the 70 occupations used by Frey and Osborne. 

However, while there is no specific reason to believe that the way bottlenecks relate to 

the risk of automation differs across countries, it is possible that Canada’s specific 

industrial structure and its position in global value chain may influence the coefficients. 

Arntz, Zierhan and Gregory (2016) provide the opportunity for a simple robustness test. 

In fact, they estimate the coefficients on a sample that pools all countries and includes 

country dummies. With the exception of the frequency of solving simple problems, 

the sign and significance of the estimated coefficients are the same between the two 

studies. Overall, the pros of conducting the estimation on better defined occupations and 

the larger sample size probably outweigh the cons which should nevertheless be kept in 

mind. 

47. The coefficients estimated on Canadian data are then applied to all other 
individuals across 32 countries in PIAAC to obtain an out-of-sample prediction of the 

individual risk of automation. Table 4.3 summarises the results of the logistic regression 

estimation.

 Seven occupations could not be identified in ISCO-08: dishwashers; parking lot attendants; 

technical writers; paralegals and legal assistants; gaming dealers; farm labour contractors; claim 

adjusters, examiners and investigators. Additionally, the same ISCO-08 code – credit and loan 

officers – is used for two of the 70 FO occupations: credit authorisers, checkers and clerks; and 

loan officers. See Table A A.1 in Annex A for the whole correspondence.

48. As one can see in Table 4.3, while all variables are predictive of automatability, 
not all of them are predictive in the expected way. Finger dexterity, selling and 

communicating are positively, not negatively associated with automatability. Even 

solving simple problems and negotiating are positively, although only marginally 

statistically significantly associated with automatability.
14

Table 4.4 shows the analysis of 

the variance (ANOVA) decomposition. The ANOVA shows that the variables that 

explain the largest share of the variance in automatability are planning for others, selling, 

influencing, communicating and advising, while negotiating, and problem-solving explain 

small, insignificant part of the variance.

 In FO’s 2017 publication, Figure 2, one can also see that the variables of finger dexterity, 

manual dexterity and cramped workspace are all positively correlated with the probability of 

computerisation.

4.2. Main findings and cross-country variation 

49. For the overall sample of 32 countries, the median job is estimated to have 48% 
probability of being automated (Table 4.5). However, there is a large variation in the 

degree of automatability across countries. In New Zealand and Norway, for instance, 

the median worker has 39 and 40% probability of being automated, respectively. This is 

about half a standard deviation less than the median automatability for all 32 countries. 

At the other extreme, the median worker in Slovakia has 62% probability of being 

automated and in Greece and Lithuania the median worker has 57% chance of being 

automated. These values are at least half a standard deviation above the median for the 

full sample. To illustrate what these differences mean in terms of distributional 

properties, Figure 4.1 plots the distributions of automatability for Canada, the reference 

country, and for the four countries at the two extreme ends of automatability. 

It exemplifies the wide distributional differences observed across countries. The modes 

for New Zealand and Norway are found to be less the 30%, Slovakia’s mode is about 

70% and Lithuania’s mode is around 60% of automatability. It appears that the countries 

that score lowest on the probability of being automated are countries located in the North 

of Europe (Norway, Finland, UK, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark), in Northern 

America (United States and Canada) and New Zealand. New Zealand is an interesting 

case. Ethnically it is dominated by Europeans, especially Europeans of British origin 

(74% according to the 2013 Census), and it trades intensively with other countries of 

Anglo-Saxon origin (Australia, United States, UK), and with Asian countries (China, 

Japan, Singapore). These relations may drive the similarities that we see with other 

Anglo-Saxon countries. Another interesting observation (documented by Handel 2012) 

that may explain this pattern is that New Zealand, more than other OECD countries, 

experienced a sharp rise in occupations that specialise in cognitive jobs: professionals 

since the early 1990s and managerial occupations since 2010. At the other end of

the automatability distribution are the countries of South and Eastern Europe, but also 

Slovakia, Germany and Japan. The higher risk of automatability does not only arise from 

the fact that these countries have relatively larger share of manufacturing jobs, but also 

from differences in the job content within nominally similar industries and occupations 

(see below).

50. Another way to present these findings is akin to the FO and AGZ studies 
(Figure 4.2), looking at the share of workers at high and low risk of automation. Across 

all countries in our sample, 14% of jobs have a probability of being automated higher 

than 70% (as opposed to the 47% estimated by FO and 9% estimated by AGZ).
15

 Another 

32% have a chance of automation between 50 and 70%. This is a group at risk of 

significant change. Put in other words, these are jobs that presumably include several 

automatable tasks – which will ultimately disappear from the job description – but also 

some of the bottleneck tasks listed above which will presumably become more prominent 

or be complemented by similarly non-automatable tasks. At the opposite end of the 

automatability spectrum, about 26% of jobs have less than 30% chance of automation 

(as opposed to 33% in FO). Hence, the results of this study are more similar to those 

estimated by AGZ (2016), and less similar to the results derived by FO. As noted above, 

there are large differences across countries. In Norway, for instance, only 6% of all jobs 

have a risk of automation higher than 70%. Similarly, the share of jobs at high risk is just 

7% in Finland and 8% in Sweden. However, 33% of all jobs in Slovakia are at high risk 

and so are 25% of the jobs in Slovenia and 23% of the jobs in Greece. 

51. Several facts can explain the large differences in the share of jobs at high risk of 
automation estimated by FO – 47% of jobs in the United States – and that calculated in 

                                                      
15

 This figure refers to the share of all (job) observations in the OECD countries that participated 

in PIAAC whose risk of automation is higher than 70%, after applying sampling weights. In other 

words, cross-country averages reported in this paper are weighted averages.

this study – just 10% of jobs in the United States. While the distribution of the risk of 

automation appears to be informative about the relative risk of automation, estimates of 

its absolute risk are more dependent on estimation methods. This finding will be further 

corroborated in Section 8, using country-specific data for Germany and the United 

Kingdom compared to PIAAC-based results for these two countries. A major difference 

between the two studies is the level of aggregation. The latent function in FO was fitted 

on 70 observations (corresponding to 70 occupations in the training data). In the current 

study, the latent function was fitted using 4,656 individual-level observations.
16

 

As a result, the degrees of freedom in our study are far larger than in the case of the FO. 

Replications of our study at higher level of occupational aggregation show that the level 

of aggregation affects the kurtosis of the latent variable distribution. As we aggregate the 

data, the kurtosis increases and the bimodality of the distribution becomes more 

pronounced. Hence, most occupations are categorized either as highly susceptible or as 

not susceptible to automation at higher levels of aggregation, similarly to the outcomes of 

the FO study. At low levels of aggregation, the distribution becomes unimodal with lower 

kurtosis. In other words, as jobs differ significantly within occupations in the tasks they 

involve, valuable information is lost when the risk of automation is calculated based on 

the skill requirements of broad occupational categories. 

                                                      
16

 While the Canadian sample includes 26 880 observations, only workers employed in one of the 

ISCO-08 occupations identified in Table A A.1 and for which valid answers on the engineering 

bottlenecks variables are available are used to estimate the latent function.

4.3. Characteristics of jobs at risk of automation 

52. This section discusses what kind of occupation-specific and industry-specific 
human capital is being automated and analyses the socio-demographic characteristics of 

workers in jobs at high risk of automation. 

53. Figure 4.3 and Figure 4.4 show the mean probability of automation by occupation 
and industry. Although for at least part of the countries a more detailed occupational 

classification is available, the results are presented at 2-digit ISCO-08 occupational 

categories, which are available for all 32 countries. The occupational groups that have 

the highest probability of becoming automated typically do not require specific skills or 

training: food preparation assistants, assemblers, labourers, refuse workers, cleaners and 

helpers. The next category are however workers with at least some training, and what 

they have in common is that large part of their job content is interacting with machines, 

mainly in the manufacturing sector: machine operators, drivers and mobile plant 

operators, workers in the processing industry, skilled agricultural workers, metal and 

machine workers etc. At the other end of the spectrum are occupations that require high 

level of education and training and which involve high degree of social interaction, 

creativity, problem-solving and caring for others. This end is populated by all sorts of 

professionals and managers, but also by personal care workers. Overall, despite recurrent 

arguments that the current wave of automation will adversely affect selected highly 

skilled occupations, this prediction is not supported by the FO-type framework of

engineering bottlenecks. Indeed, with the exception of some relatively low-skilled jobs – 

notably, personal care workers – the findings here suggest a rather monotonic decrease in 

the risk of automation as a function of skill level. Section 7 confirms that these results 

hold true when the same measurement approach is applied to data in Germany and the 

UK, suggesting that the pattern is rather a result of how engineering bottlenecks are 

defined and less a result of data specificities. 

54. As far as industries are concerned, there are 88 2-digit ISIC Rev. 4 industries. 
Figure 4.4 shows the 20 industries at highest average risk of automation and the 20 

industries at lowest. The industries with high risk of automation belong mostly to the 

primary and the secondary sector. Few service industries – notably, postal and courier 

services, food and beverage services, land transport, waste collection and treatment, 

and services to buildings and landscape – face a high risk of automation. At the opposite 

end of the ranking, the industries with low average probability of being automated are all 

part of the service sector, with the exception of oil extraction. Most of these industries 

belong to the category of Knowledge Intensive Business Services (KIBS).

4.4. Characteristics of workers whose jobs are at risk of automation 

55. To further understand the question of what kind of human capital is being 
automated and identify which groups of employees deserve most policy attention, this 

section focuses on educational attainment as well as socio-demographic characteristics of 

workers at risk of automation. 

56. A simple OLS regression is estimated to explain the probability of automation as 
a function of: 9 categories of educational attainment, age, gender, and PIAAC’s numeracy 

scores and country fixed effects; with the addition of occupation and industry dummies in 

a second model
17

,
18

 (Table 4.6). These variables together only explain 27% of the 

variation in job automatability which is astonishingly low given the attention that has 

been given to the role of skills in technology-labour relationships (Table 4.7). 

57. Educational attainment shows a very clear pattern in relation to automatability: 
a higher educational attainment translates into a lower risk of automation (Figure 4.5). 

There is no indication that the risk of automation brought about by AI and ML is 

particularly high for the medium skilled jobs, as observed in the polarisation literature 

based on the routine content of jobs. Numeracy and being male correlate negatively with 

the probability of automation, but the economic significance of their coefficients is not 

high. Being male is associated with a lower risk of 1.6%, and one standard deviation 

higher numeracy is associated with 1.7% lower risk. The inclusion of occupation and 

industry controls does not change the results fundamentally. Notably, these controls 

reduce differences between groups with different educational attainment, the relationship 

between educational attainment and the risk of automation remains negative and 

monotonic. They do not seem to affect differences by age and actually reinforce the 

disadvantage of female workers over their male counterparts. In essence, while sorting 

into occupations and sectors plays a role in some cases, differences between 

socio-demographic groups appear to be driven by differences in the task composition of 

individual jobs. This is particularly striking for women when controlling for industry and 

occupation actually increases the likelihood of automation relative to men, suggesting 

that women tend to sort into occupations that have a lower risk of automation but within 

these occupations, they are often carrying out more automatable tasks than their male 

counterparts. 

                                                      
17

 Please note that including controls such as occupational dummies in addition to education 

creates a “bad control” problem (Angrist and Pischke 2009). As a result the inclusion should be 

seen as a robustness check to reassure readers that the results are not driven by the sorting of 

different groups into specific occupations. However, only the first specification gives a meaningful 

read of the coefficients of education and numeracy, and neither of the two regressions is meant to 

suggest causal relationship between automatability and the right hand side variables. 

18
 As the inclusion of occupation and industry controls in Model 2 implies a significant reduction 

in sample size due to missing values in these two variables, a third model is presented. Model 3 

uses the same specification as Model 1, applied to the smaller sample used for Module 2.

58. Just like in the case of education, the risk of automation falls monotonically as a 
function of earnings. This is the case in all 32 countries, except for Russia where the risk 

does not differ among wage earners (Figure 4.6). There is no indication that the wave of 

near future automation will be wage polarising, i.e. affecting middle-income jobs in a 

more pronounced way, or that it will start affecting high-income, highly-educated 

professionals. 

Figure 4.6. Automatability and earnings  

 

Note: Earnings percentile on the x-axis and probability of automation on the y-axis. Earnings are only defined 

for wage and salary earners and include bonuses. For cross-country comparability, we express earnings in 

percentiles and rank all workers by their standing in the wage distribution. 

Source: Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) 2012, 2015.  

59. The relationship between age and automatability is U-shaped for most countries 
and for the weighted sample of OECD individuals PIAAC (Figure 4.7). There are 

exceptions though. In Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Lithuania, New 

Zealand and the United States, the risk of automation does not increase significantly with 

age after peaking in the teens. In Italy, Slovakia, Slovenia the risk even declines with age. 

What is surprising is that the risk of automation in all countries, except in Russia, peaks at 

the earliest working age. This is contrary to the intuition that automation is more likely to 

affect older workers who employ technologically outdated skills and are least likely to 

participate in lifelong learning (Autor and Dorn 2009). What causes this pattern is 

the occupational choice of young workers. Almost 20% of those aged 20 or younger work 

in elementary occupations (labourers, cleaners and helpers, agricultural jobs, food 

preparation and refuse jobs), while only 7% of those older than 20 work in such jobs. 

As shown above, these elementary jobs have the highest estimated probability of 



DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2018)3 │ 57 
 

 

AUTOMATION, SKILLS USE AND TRAINING 

For Official Use 

automation. Another 34% of teen jobs are in sales and personal services, another 

occupational group with a rather high risk of automation. Only 13% of older workers hold 

such jobs. Not only are these figures informative of what might happen in the near future, 

they also match ongoing trends in teenage jobs, particularly in the United States. Pew 

Research Centre (Desilver 2015) has documented a sharp decline in the share of teens 

that hold jobs in the United States in the past few decades, from about 42% in the 1970s, 

1980s and 1990s, to 28% in 2014. This is not only a consequence of the teenagers opting 

more often for formal education instead of taking jobs. Summer jobs which teens used to 

take during summer vacations have also become less likely: from 57% in the 1970s and 

1980s to 34% in 2014. These changes call for ways to ensure that youth have access to 

jobs at lower risk of automation, either as new labour market entrants or working 

students. On the other hand, it is also important to acknowledge that while the risk of 

automation faced by older workers might be smaller, this age group may face more 

difficult transitions: adult learning participation tends to be lower for older workers 

making it harder to pursue upskilling and re-training for this age group.

Note: Age on the x-axis and probability of automation on the y-axis.

60. Finally, Figure 4.8 illustrates the risk of automation by type of work contract and 
firm size. Employees on work-based VET programmes or in apprenticeships, as well as 

those hired through employment agencies on temporary contracts have the highest risk of 

automation, while those with indefinite and fixed term contracts have the lowest risk. 

The elevated risk among those in apprenticeships may reflect the over-representation of 

traditional trades as many countries have only recently started to encourage the creation

AUTOMATION, SKILLS USE AND TRAINING

of apprenticeship programmes in new emerging occupations. Looking at firm size, 

the risk of automation declines with the size of the firm although this could be due to 

compositional effects relating to industry and occupation. On the other hand, larger firms 

may be better prepared to adopt new technologies and job descriptions may change more 

rapidly to reflect these choices.

4.4.1. Differences across countries in the between and within task variation of 
industries and occupations 

61. As shown above, countries differ significantly in the extent to which they are 
susceptible to automation. There are typically two broad reasons for this. First, 

the economic structures of countries differ a lot. Second, the way work is organised 

within the same industry could differ a great deal too. Economists strongly believe that 

what makes some countries richer is that their production of goods and services is 

organised in a more efficient way (Bloom and Van Reenen 2011; Bloom, Sadun and 

Van Reenen 2012). To study this, a shift-share analysis is conducted whereby all PIAAC 

countries are compared to Canada, the reference country, and the difference in the risk of 

automation is decomposed into differences in the structure of industries (between 

variance) and differences in the job content within industries (within variance). This 

calculation is typically called shift-share analysis. The methodology is similar to that used 

in ALM, p. 1299, except it is applied to cross-country instead of over-time differences:

The total difference in automatability (Δ𝐴𝑐) between any country different from Canada 
(𝑐 ≠ 𝐶𝐴𝑁) and Canada can be decomposed into a between industry 
component:⁡∑ (𝛥𝐸𝑖𝑐≠𝐶𝐴𝑁𝐴𝑖𝐶𝐴𝑁)𝑖 , and a within-industry component: ∑ (𝐸𝑖𝐶𝐴𝑁𝛥𝐴𝑖𝑐≠𝐶𝐴𝑁)𝑖 . 
Here, 𝐸𝑖 is industry-specific employment share and 𝐴𝑖 is the industry-specific level of 
automation; 𝑖 is an industry (occupation) index. 𝐸𝑖 and 𝐴𝑖 take values between 0 and 1. 
Figure 4.9 shows the results of this decomposition using industries as dimension along 

which the variance is decomposed. Figure 4.10 shows the results of this decomposition 

using occupations instead of industries. 

62. The first striking finding in the industry-based shift share analysis is that 
the within-industry differences explain the bulk of the variation (71%), while 

the between-industry differences only explain 29% of the variation. This is somewhat 

surprising – it is easier to think of the differences in job content between sectors 

(e.g., agriculture vs. manufacturing vs. service) while it is more difficult to think of 

the differences between countries in way work is organised in a given sector. One could 

argue that this is an artifact of working with only 85 different industries, but a robustness 

check shows that using the 4-digit ISIC Rev. 4 classification instead (containing 

737 industries) results in between-variance of only 39%. 

63. In the case of occupations, the between variance explains 47% of the total 
variance. This is already significantly higher than in the case of industries, although 

the 2-digit ISCO-08 classification used in this exercise only distinguishes among 

38 classes. 

64. It seems that within nominally similar industries, different countries organise their 
work content very differently. They use different combinations of occupations and even 

within these occupations they embrace variations in the job content. To develop an 

intuition of what is happening, it is helpful to look at some examples. For instance, jobs in 

the Republic of Korea are at higher risk of automation than in Canada (positive total 

variance in Figure 4.9 and Figure 4.10). The main reason for this is that Korea has 

different industry and occupational structure than Canada (positive between-variance). 

Over 30% of Korean jobs are in manufacturing, while this is the case with only 22% of 

Canadian jobs (Handel 2012). However, within the same industries, Korean jobs are 

organised in a way that makes them less susceptible to automation (negative 

within-variance). Korea might be ahead of Canada in automating routine jobs or it might 

be combining social and creative tasks together with routine tasks more frequently than 

Canada. The jobs in Slovakia, Greece and Lithuania, on the other hand are on average 

more susceptible to automation than the jobs in Canada, but this is less a result of 

different industry and even occupational structure, and more a result of differences in job 

content within nominally same industries and occupations. Slovakia, Greece and 

Lithuania are simply lagging behind Canada when it comes to the automatability of tasks 

accomplished in the workplace, for similar kinds of jobs in terms of industry and 

occupational groupings. 

                                                      
19

 A typical shift-share analysis has a third component which in this context would reflect the size 

difference in the pairs of countries. We are however not interested in this component.

5.  Are the estimates of automatability predictive of labour market outcomes? 

65. To our knowledge, none of the studies that have used FO’s engineering 
bottlenecks to estimate the risk of automation have tested how it relates to labour market 

outcomes of potentially affected workers. One could argue that at the time FO formulated 

their arguments about the engineering bottlenecks it was difficult to say what the future 

may bring. The prediction pertains to technologies that may be developed in the future as 

much as it does to commercially available technologies today.
20

 However, according to 

FO, already now (i.e., at the time of their study) one should see a growing breadth of 

the impact of computerization on the labour market than what ALM predicted in 2003. 

This prediction is certainly testable. Section 3 discussed the theoretical predictions of how 

computerization should affect the employment and wages of people with different skills 

and job task content. Over time, as new computer technologies spread, the employment in 

more automatable occupations relative to the employment in less automatable ones 

should decline. The same should hold for relative wages. The absolute level of 

employment in automatable occupations should also decline. Wages in these occupations 

could also decline, but Autor (2015) argues that this depends on the conditions of task 

complementarity, output demand elasticity and the reactions of the labour supply. 

66. In this section, PIAAC is used to show how employability and wages correlate 
with the degree of automatability in order to establish basic generalizable facts for the 32 

OECD countries. Then, the German BIBB/IAB BIBB/BAuA Surveys are used to 

compare the FO-based estimates of automatability and its relationship with employment 

and wages with those using ALM-based estimates. The categorization of routine and 

non-routine tasks in the German skills survey is based on the rich literature on this topic 

(Spitz-Oener 2006; Antonczyk et al. 2008; Rohrbach-Schmidt and Tiemann 2013). 

5.1. Automatability, job security and earnings 

67. To get a sense of whether declining occupations or industries correspond to those 
with the highest risk of automation, occupation-specific and industry-specific 

unemployment rates are calculated for the 32 PIAAC countries. PIAAC includes detailed 

occupational data (4-digit ISCO-08) and detailed industry data (4-digit ISIC Rev. 4) for 

all interviewed working individuals. Those individuals, that at the time of the survey were 

not employed, were instead asked to report the occupation and the industry of their last 

job. This allows calculating occupation-specific and industry-specific unemployment 

rates: for each group we know the number of people currently working and the number of 

people that used to work there, but are now unemployed. The share of unemployed 

individuals in occupation 𝑜 in the total pool of individuals in this occupation (employed 

                                                      
20

 This reveals potential weakness in this futuristic approach to measuring automatability. 

The approach is based on technical feasibly and ignores how the markets may react to the adoption 

of these technologies. 



DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2018)3 │ 63

and unemployed) gives the unemployment rate for that specific occupation. The resulting 

indicators effectively capture which occupations/industries have been declining recently. 

Figure 5.1 shows that occupations that have higher average risk of being automated today 

or in the future have higher unemployment rates. Similar correlations are found between 

industry automatability and industry unemployment rates, but the relationship is 

somewhat weaker.
21

 The strength of this simple relationship is astonishing. 

The difference in the unemployment rate between the least and the most automatable 

occupation is 44 pp (31 pp in the case of industries). Over a third of the variance in the 

occupational unemployment rate can be attributed automatability, when not controlling 

for other factors. 

68. To study the relationship further, notably by accounting for other factors affecting 
occupational and industry unemployment rates beyond automatability, individual level 

data on hours worked are used. The supply of working hours is a choice variable to an 

extent. Higher hourly rates increase the supply of hours, men choose to work more hours 

than women and better educated people work more hours than less educated ones. It is 

also country specific: different countries have different regulations about the official 

working week and overtime. Once these factors are controlled for, it is expected that jobs 

that are at higher risk of automation will have fewer working hours. As these jobs are 

being phased out, the number of hours that employers are willing to offer in these jobs, 

will decline. 

                                                      
21

 The most likely reason why automatability and job risk are more correlated at the occupational 

level is because job tasks are more occupation and less industry specific (Poletaev and Robinson 

2008; Gathmann and Schoenberg 2010; Kambourov and Manovskii 2009).

69. The number of weekly working hours is modelled as a function of automatability, 
age, gender, the hourly wage, education and country-specific effects using OLS. Across 

the 32 countries, the difference in working hours between the least and the most 

automatable job is 8 hours per week (Table 5.1). These results are not affected by the 

inclusion of occupation and industry controls (Model 2 in Table 5.1).
22

 Workers in the 

most automatable jobs work about a day less than workers in the safest jobs ceteris 

paribus.
23

 Figure 5.2 shows these estimates, country by country. The relationship is 

strongest in New Zealand, England (UK) and Germany. The relationship is not 

statistically different from zero in seven countries: Chile, the Czech Republic, Korea, 

Lithuania, Poland, the Russian Federation and Turkey.

 It is important to note that full identification of the impact of automatability on employment and 

wages in OECD countries is beyond the scope of this study. Unobserved individual characteristics 

(e.g., intelligence or personality traits) may correlate with the choice of job (and hence 

automatability), biasing the findings away from zero. In spite of these limitations, the analysis 

should be able to indicate whether the basic theoretically expected patterns hold in the data.

70. Turning to the relationship between wages and the risk of automation, PIAAC 
includes information on hourly wages including bonuses. In the regression analysis, 

the natural log of hourly wages is used as a dependent variable; hence the coefficients can 

be interpreted as semi-elasticities. For the full sample, the difference in hourly wages 

between the least and the most automatable job is 43% (Table 5.2). In other words, 

10 percentage points higher automatability corresponds with 4.3% lower hourly earnings 

ceteris paribus. Including occupation and industry controls does not change 

the correlation between wages and the risk of automation substantially. To check for 

cross-country differences, the relationship is estimated country-by-country (Figure 5.3). 

The relationship is significant and economically large in all countries but the United 

States and the Russian Federation. The relationship is most pronounced in the three Asian 

countries surveyed in PIAAC: Japan, Singapore and Korea.

5.2. FO automatability vs. ALM automatability 

71. The validity of the FO’s engineering bottlenecks as a predictor of labour market 
trends compared to older measures based on the distinction among routine, non-routine 

and interactive tasks is tested in this section using the BIBB/IAB and BIBB/BAuA 

Surveys 2006 and 2012. Section 3. explains how the FO measure of automatability is 

constructed. For a concept of automatability in line with that developed by ALM, routine 

and non-routine tasks are identified following Antonczyk et al. (2008). These are then 

used in place of the variables corresponding to FO’s engineering bottlenecks in the logit 

model. The logit regression models the probability of automation as a function of job 

tasks. Annex B has the details of the estimations. 

72. In a second step, working hours are modelled as a function of automatability, 
hourly wages, age, gender and education, once for FO and once for ALM automatability

in each survey wave.
24 

The results for the case of working hours are presented in 

Table 5.3. In 2006, ALM and FO automatability both render similar estimated 

coefficients: 10 pp higher FO automatability corresponds to 0.18 fewer hours worked and 

10 pp higher ALM automatability corresponds to 0.16 fewer hours worked. 

The differences between the two coefficients are not statistically significant. In 2012, 

the differences seem greater: 10 pp higher FO automatability corresponds to 0.2 fewer 

hours a week, while 10 pp higher ALM automatability corresponds to 0.09 fewer hours 

a week.
25

 However, these coefficients are also not statistically significantly different from 

each other. The difference in the R-squared (0.218 vs. 0.216 in 2012) furthermore 

suggests that there is only a marginal improvement in the model fit when FO is used 

instead of the ALM tasks in 2012 (and no improvement in 2006). 

73.  Differences between the FO and the ALM estimates in the case of hourly wages 
are also found not to be statistically significant (Table 5.4): 10 pp higher automatability 

corresponds with 25-27% lower gross hourly wages in the case of FO automatability and 

with 23 to 30% lower wages in the case of ALM automatability. Judging by the 

R-squared, the ALM model is marginally preferred in 2006 (0.272 for ALM vs. 0.268 for 

FO), and the FO model is marginally preferred in 2012 (0.254 for FO vs. 0.252 for 

ALM). 

74. To summarise, when applied to German data between 2006 and 2012, the more 
recent approach to measuring the risk of automation through identifying engineering 

bottlenecks developed by FO yields similar predictions of labour market outcomes to the 

routine-based approach of ALM. Both approaches show that higher estimated 

automatability is associated with fewer working hours and lower hourly wages at the 

individual level, ceteris paribus. A slight shift in predictive power is observed over time, 

with the routine-based approach fitting the data better in 2006 and the bottlenecks 

approach providing a better fit in 2012, but the difference is only marginal. 

                                                      
24

 These estimates probability suffer from the typical omitted variable biases such as potential 

correlations between unobserved individual characteristics and our measures of automatability. 

However, since both estimates (FO and ALM) are probability equally affected by these, the 

difference between two should still be informative. 

25
 It is striking that the coefficients of automatability with respect to working hours are 

substantially smaller than the ones estimated using the PIAAC. We are not sure what causes this 

difference, but most likely this is due to the differences in the automatability variables between 

PIAAC and BIBB. The coefficients of “female” and “education” have comparable magnitudes 

between the BIBB and the PIAAC, suggesting that the discrepancy is not due to differences in the 

definition of working hours.

6.  Changes in the task content of jobs over time: evidence from Germany and 
the United Kingdom 

75. PIAAC is the first international survey to include a comprehensive assessment of 
the tasks that employees perform in their jobs and the skills required for these tasks. 

Its predecessors, IALS and ALL do not include sufficient information to identify time 

trends in the risk of automation. To fill this gap, country-specific sources exist for the UK 

and Germany dating back to the 1970s (Germany) and the 1980s (UK). This Section 

analyses the changes in task-content of jobs in these two countries over a more recent 

period 1997-2012 in UK and 1999-2012 in Germany. These are the periods for which 

comparable skill survey data can be identified in three broad skill domains: manual, 

social and analytical. Nevertheless, trends in these two countries cannot be generalised to 

other PIAAC participants as they may depend on factors such as the penetration and 

adoption of technology, the productive structure, and the position of the countries in 

global value chains. 

6.1. Skill trends in the United Kingdom 1997-2012 

76. The UK Skills Survey (Felstead, Gallie and Green 2014) offers a rich description 
of the content of jobs held by British employees in the most recent decade and a half. 

Table 6.1 describes the variables that broadly correspond to manual, analytical and social 

skills at the job. 

77. Table 6.2 shows the correlations among the skills and tasks covered by 
the survey. Manual skills correlate positively with other manual skills and negatively with 

social skills (e.g., dealing with people and influencing). This means that people who 

specialise in manual skills are less likely to use social interaction skills at the job. 

These skills also correlate negatively with literacy, numeracy and self-planning. 

However, manual workers do perform problem-solving in their jobs, and in particular the 

part of problem-solving that has to do with detection of a problem/fault and detection of 

the cause that triggered the problem. At the same time, manual workers are less likely to 

engage in problem-solving that works out a solution for the problem. One could say that 

manual workers spend more time on diagnosing problems and less time on actual 

problem-solving. They spend more time in interacting with objects than with people. 

Finally, they have less influence over the work content of their jobs than do people that 

specialise in social and analytical skills. 

78. Social skills coincide with other social skills and also with analytical skills. 
This is important to emphasize: jobs that require analytical work, also require significant 

amount of social interaction and vice versa. Let’s take as an example the skill of 

influencing, which we broadly categorized as a social skill. Employees, who report that 

this skill is important for their job, also report a fair deal of teamwork, dealing with 

people, advising, communicating, but also complex problem-solving, thinking ahead, 

detecting problems, identifying the cause of problems and figuring out a solution to 



74 │ DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM(2018)3 
 

 

AUTOMATION, SKILLS USE AND TRAINING 

For Official Use 

 

a problem. All these co-occurrences are measured at the individual level and this suggests 

that social and analytical tasks are complements in day-to-day work. 

79. Turning to the trends in the demand for manual, analytical and social skills in the 
UK between 1997 and 2012, three binary variables are created for the purpose of the 

analysis
26

: 

 Manual skills equals 1 if at least one of these variables was indicated as very 
important or essential: physical stamina, physical strength or accurate working 

with fingers/hands. Otherwise it equals 0. 

 Analytical skills equals 1 if at least one of these variables was indicated as very 
important or essential: problem-solving, complex problem solving or thinking 

ahead. Otherwise it equals 0. 

 Social skills equals 1 if at least one of these variables was indicated as very 
important or essential: team work, dealing with people or 

counselling/advising/caring for others. Otherwise it equals 0. 

80. Skill demands in the three skill domains are then estimated as a function of time. 
The reference year is taken to be 1997 and skill demand in 2001, 2006 and 2012 is 

expressed as difference relative to the reference year. Logit models are estimated since 

the three general skills are defined as binary variables. The variables of interest are the 

year dummies (2001, 2006 and 2012), while 1997 is the reference year against which the 

trend is estimated. 

81.  Table 6.3 shows the results of estimating these skill requirements as a function of 
time, while controlling for changes in the age structure and the gender structure of the 

working population. In the case of manual skills, an increase is observed in 2001, but the 

trend reverses in 2006 and becomes significantly negative in 2012. In the case of 

analytical skills, a strong positive increase can be seen throughout the whole period. 

Finally, in the case of social skills, an increase is found in 2006 and 2012, while the 

difference between 1997 and 2001 is not significant. Overall, it seems that there is a trend 

towards higher incidence of analytical, but also social tasks, and a weaker trend away 

from the use of manual tasks. 

82. Table 6.4, Table 6.5 and Table 6.6 give a more detailed view on the skill trends by 
domain. The variables of interest are again the year dummies. Table 6.4 shows that the 

trends in the use of manual skills are more nuanced when looking at sub-categories of 

manual skills. For instance, there is no trend in the importance of physical strength and 

physical stamina, but the importance of hands and finger dexterity first increased 

significantly between 1997 and 2001 and then declined somewhat as of 2012. The trends 

are more straightforward in the case of social skills (Table 6.5). Here, all indicators of 

social skills show positive trends either throughout the whole period or in the last two 

periods (2006 and 2012) except for selling of goods and services, where the trend is not 

straightforward and is less economically and statistically significant. Similar to the case 

of social skills, analytical skills show positive trends across the board, either throughout 

                                                      
26

 We chose only three variables for each binary construct in order to stay consistent in the 

measurement across the three domains. We also chose the three variables that could be consider 

most general for each domain and we avoided using variables within domains that carry the same 

type of information (e.g., categorical variable problem-solving and its derived continuous variable 

problem-solving skills).

the whole period, or staring in 2006. One exception are the skills of diagnosing problems 

(problem/fault spotting and problem/fault cause detection). Here we see no change 

between 1997, 2001 and 2006 and a notable negative change in 2012. 

83. Finally, these changes are decomposed using a shift share analysis into 
between-occupational and within-occupational changes ( 

84. Table 6.7). We find that the observed decline in the use of manual skills is mainly 
a result of the changes in the occupational structure of the economy, which has been 

shifting away from occupations that specialise in manual tasks throughout the observed 

period. Within occupations, the manual skill demands first increased between 1997 and 

2001 and then declined. Overall, these dynamics translate into an average increase and 

then decline in the use of manual skills at the job. The use of analytical skills increased 

mainly because analytical tasks gained in importance within the same occupations. In 

addition to this, there is a trend towards expanding the occupations that specialise in 

analytical tasks (between changes). Social skills became more prevalent mainly by 

increasing the within-occupational importance of these tasks.

6.2. Skill trends in Germany 1999-2012 

85. While there are no perfectly comparable variables between the German and 
the UK Skill Surveys, variables that broadly fall within the domains of manual, analytical 

and social skills can be identified in the German BIBB/IAB BIBB/BAuA Surveys 

(Table 6.8). In addition to this, in order to refine measurements, two variables are added 

which are expected to be perfectly negatively correlated with the use of analytical skills at 

work : performing repetitive tasks and performing tasks that are fully prescribed and 

performed by following strict manuals (explicit tasks).

means that a task is performed frequently, very frequently or always, 0 means that a task is performed 

sometimes, seldom or never

86. Table 6.9 shows the correlations among the variables. Similar to what was found 
in the case of the UK, manual skills are positively correlated among each other, but they 

are negatively correlated with analytical and social skills. The German data does not 

make the distinction between diagnosing a problem and acting upon it, so here we cannot 

observe such more nuanced co-occurrences. Analytical skills are correlated with other 

analytical skills and they are negatively correlated with repetitive and explicit tasks. 

They also correlate with social skills (advising, teaching and organizing), but less with 

sales and procurement.

corresponding with the domains of manual, analytical and social skills are created: 

 Manual skills takes a value of 1 if one of these skills/tasks was reported to be used 
frequently: heavy-lifting, repair or manufacturing. Otherwise it takes a value of 0. 

 Analytical skills takes a value of 1 if one of these variables was reported to be 
used frequently: development, information assessment or process improvement. 

Otherwise it takes a value of 0. 

 Social skills takes a value of 1 if one of these variables was reported to be used 
frequently: teaching, advising or organizing. Otherwise it takes a value of 0. 

Table 6.10 shows the results of estimating logit regressions that model the requirements 

of manual, analytical and social skills as a function of time. Here as well, knowing that 

the workforce has been changing in terms of gender and age structure, the impact of 

gender and age is controlled for. The variables of interest are the 2006 and 2012 time 

dummies. They show the average changes in the frequency of skill use compared to 1999, 

the reference year. In the case of manual skills, we observe a decline in 2006, and no 

significant additional change in 2012. In the case of analytical skills, we observe very 

rapid growth, both in 2006 and in 2012. Among the social skills, notable increase in their 

frequency is observed in both periods. A more nuanced version of the manual task trends 

(Table 6.11) shows that the general negative trend is driven by the lower frequency of 

heavy-lifting over time. Repair has not experienced any changes, while, surprisingly, the 

frequency of tasks related to the manufacturing of goods has intensified between 1999 

and 2012. The more detailed estimates of trends among social skills (Table 6.12) show 

consistent increase of all social skills (advising, teaching and organizing), except for sales 

and procurement, which show a negative trend. Finally, we see strong positive trends 

across all analytical tasks: immersing, process improvement, information assessment and 

development (Table 6.13). Among the “anti-analytical” tasks, we see a decline in the 

explicit tasks, but an increase in the reporting of repetitive work. 

88. To summerise, in Germany, strong unambiguous trends towards more analytical 
and more social skills at the workplace are found. The trends of manual skills, however, 

are mixed. Job tasks involving heavy-lifting have been consistently declining between 

1999 and 2012, but production tasks more generally, having increased, not declined.

89. Lastly, the observed trends are decomposed into between and within-occupational 
changes using shift-share analysis (Table 6.14). Similar to the case of the UK, manual 

skills mainly declined by shifting away from occupations that specialise in these skills, 

while within occupations, the use of manual skills even increased somewhat. Analytical 

skills, on the other hand, mainly increased as a result of changes in skill requirements 

within occupations. This as well is similar to what was observed in the case of the UK. 

In addition to within-occupational changes, shifts towards occupations that employ 

analytical skills also contributed to the overall increase. Finally, social skills increased 

significantly both within and between occupations.

7.  How skills use varies across jobs with different degrees of ICT penetration 

90. As elabourated in Section 3, skills and technology have historically been 
considered complements. Better skilled workers adopt technology faster and make better 

use of it. Technology, on the other hand, requires that workers keep abreast of its 

developments and updates. Hence, this is not a one-way causation. Skills and technology 

are mutually reinforcing: skills beget technology and technology begets skills. Although 

this is not the case with all technologies, e.g., industrial robots directly substitute labour, 

many current technologies such as laptops and PCs, software, printers, and phones, are 

complement to skilled workers. This section sheds light on the skills that are 

complemented by ICT and those that are not. 

91. This section uses data from PIAAC, which asked the participants about the use of 
ICT at home and at work. More specifically, the survey asked: Do you use a computer

27
 

in your current job? Those who responded affirmatively were then asked about the 

frequency of e-mail, internet, spreadsheet, Word processor, computer coding and online 

conversations. The survey also asked respondents about the level of computer use: 

straightforward, moderate or complex.
28

 Identical questions were asked for the use of 

computers in everyday life. Based on these original questions, a composite ICT variable 

for the use of ICT at work and in everyday life was derived by the OECD summing 

individual scales and using Cronbach’s alpha to test the consistency of the variables 

included. 
29

The final index constructed this way ranges between 1 and 5 and higher 

values indicate higher frequency of ICT use. This is variable used in the analysis below. 

7.1. Computers and education 

92. Figure 7.1 shows the relationship between computer use and the level of 
education. The figure plots the distributions of the shares of computer users by 

occupation, by educational requirements of the occupation. Only 23% of the workers in 

occupations that typically require lower secondary education or less say they use 

computers at work. This share rapidly increases with required education and it reaches 

                                                      
27 This includes cell-phones and other hand-held electronic devices that are used to connect to the internet, 

check e-mails etc. Computer can be a mainframe, desktop or laptop computer, or any other device that can 

be used to do such things as sending or receiving e-mail messages, processing data or text, or finding 

things on the internet. 

28 Straightforward: for example, using a computer for straightforward routine tasks such as data entry or 

sending and receiving e-mails; Moderate: for example, word-processing, spreadsheets or database 

management; Complex: for example, developing software or modifying computer games, programming 

using languages like java, sql, php or perl, or maintaining a computer network. 

29 Cronbach’s alpha uses the average correlation among the ICT items (emails, information, transactions, 

spreadsheets, word and real-time conversations) to assess their consistency when building an index. See 

Kankaraš et al (2016, p. 98) for more details.

over 98% in occupations that require a bachelor’s degree and close to 100% in 

occupations that require master’s degree or higher. 

93. A strong correlation between the use of ICT and educational attainment is also 
found at the individual level, after controlling for country-specific effects, industry 

effects, and age (Table 7.1, models 1 and 3). Moving two degrees on the scale of ICT use 

at work, e.g., from not being a user, to being a medium-frequency user, corresponds to a 

full educational degree, e.g., from lower secondary to upper secondary. This also holds, 

and is even more pronounced for those that at the time of the survey were not in paid 

employment. The partial correlation remains strong even if instead of industry, we control 

for occupational choice (Models 2 and 4). Since education and occupation are typically 

simultaneously decided by people (i.e., one decides whether to study business, law or arts 

in college), occupational controls are not very interesting covariates and this latter set of 

models is only presented to demonstrate the robustness of relationship between ICT and 

educational achievement even within occupational groups.

7.2. Computers, general skills and specific skills 

94. Through education one acquires various skills: some foundation ones, such as 
literacy and numeracy, but also job-specific ones, such as marketing, arts or medical 

knowledge and some generic skills such as working in teams, being autonomous, 

managing the work of others. Which of these are actually complemented by the use of 

ICT? One of the most important contributions of PIAAC is the assessment of foundation 

skills among adults through an actual test (OECD 2012). 

95. Figure 7.2 shows the relationship between literacy, numeracy and the use of 
computers at work using fitted polynomials and the corresponding 95% confidence 

intervals. Both literacy and numeracy are strongly, and for the most part monotonically, 

related to the use of computers. Strong correlations between general skills and the use of 

ICT at work are found even after controlling for age, educational attainment, 

country-specific effects, and industry-specific effects (Table 7.2).
30

 This is also the case 

for the use of literacy and numeracy at work (Figure 7.3 and Figure 7.4): a very clear 

pattern emerges where higher use of numeracy and literacy correspond to more frequent 

use of ICT. The relations seem particularly strong in the case of numeracy use at work, 

                                                      
30

 The coefficients do not have the most intuitive reading. One standard deviation higher literacy 

corresponds to a quarter of a quintile higher computer use.

and somewhat weaker when it comes to writing reports and filling out forms (measures of 

literacy).

96. Turning to other skills, PIAAC asked its participants about the frequency with 
which they perform various tasks such as cooperating, teaching and selling. 

The frequency with which workers engage in these tasks at work are plotted against the 

frequency of ICT use (Figure 7.5). Three general patterns emerge. First, positive 

relationships between computer use and sharing information, teaching, advising, planning 

work of others, influencing, negotiating and complex problem-solving. Second, negative 

relationships between computer use and working physically for a long time and between 

ICT use and using hands and fingers. Third, inversed U-shape relationship between ICT 

use and cooperating, presenting and selling. In the last set of cases, the use of ICT is most 

frequent among those with medium intensity in these skills. One could speculate that 

people who engage in these job tasks very intensely spend significantly more time in 

direct communication with partners and customers and less in performing these over the 

computer. In general, computers act as augmenting to the analytical skills which trends 

we analysed in Section 5, while the use of ICT becomes irrelevant in jobs requiring 

frequent use of physical skills. ICT use becomes more frequent among those who employ 

social skills, but not always. Cooperation, presentation and sales require moderate use of 

ICT when performed frequently.

7.3. Computers and automatability 

97. Finally, in order to understand the argument of computer-skill complementarity, 
it is instructive to point out the relationship between the occupation-specific use of 

computers and the occupational risk of automation (Figure 7.6). Two observations stand 

out. First, the relationship is negative, meaning that occupations that use computers more 

frequently are at lower risk of automation. This suggests that computers are likely 

augmenting rather than substituting those who use them. Second, the variance in 

computer use increases with the risk of automation. Occupations that are at low risk are 

almost without exception intense computer users. At very high levels of risk, one tends to 

see mainly low users. However, a wide range of occupations in terms of computer use are 

bunched up between the 40 and 60% probability of automation. This is an interesting 

group of occupations and further analysis of the other technologies that they employ, in 

addition to computers, would better reveal what technologies are likely to be 

labour-substituting. In other words, there is lots of unexplained variance in the risk of 

automation if we only focus on the use of computers (or lack of) as potentially 

labour-substituting technology.

98. If ICT act like skill augmenting technologies, which are the technologies that 
directly substitute human work? First, robots directly substitutes labour (Acemoglu and 

Restrepo 2016). But this is also the case for a wide range of moving, driving and 

construction machinery used in the storage, manufacturing, construction and mining 

industries. Assembly line machinery, but also monitoring and checking equipment 

substitute labour. Nowadays, all of these technologies are digitally enabled, but here the 

principles of digitalisation are used in a different way than in typical IC technologies: 

computers, internet, smart phones, wireless technologies etc. Typical ICT is general 

purpose and better skilled people make more creative and more productive use of it, while 

digital solutions in robotics are currently still employed for specific job tasks that robots 

can perform semi-independently over extended periods of time. 

99. Recent developments in computer vision, natural language and translation could 
potentially get integrated into labour substituting and even skill substituting technologies, 

but their commercialisation is still rather limited. Moreover, computers do substitute 

labour, but not the labour of those who use them directly. Let’s take the tax fraud risk 

assessment systems as an example. Tax administrations around the world have been 

recently adopting big data algorithms for tax fraud risk assessment at the taxpayer level. 

These are computer algorithms that evaluate complex data from tax and bank records. 

The employees that develop and use these algorithms are highly educated users of ICT. 

The successful implementation of risk assessment systems does not diminish the need for

these employees (quite on the contrary), but it reduces the need for tax inspectors and 

customs inspectors who traditionally detected fraud without the assistance of algorithms. 

The fraud detection is now partially relegated to the algorithm, where previously it was a 

task fully performed by inspectors.

8.  Robustness checks using country-specific occupational surveys 

100. Throughout this study, PIAAC is used as the main dataset for the empirical 
analysis, except for Section 6 where, in the absence of longitudinal data on skills in 

PIAAC, two country-specific skill surveys, one for the UK and another one for Germany, 

are exploited. In this Section, parallels are drawn between the main findings on the 

relationship between skills and automation in PIAAC and other surveys. In particular, 

the German and the UK surveys are well suited for replicating the estimates of job 

automatability presented in Section 3. 

8.1. Replicating the measurement of the risk of automation for Germany 

101. Every six to seven years since 1979, the German Federal Institute for Vocational 
Education and Training (BIBB) conducts individual-level surveys (BIBB Employment 

Surveys) among employed Germans, asking, among other things, detailed questions about 

the job content, the skills, the knowledge and the technologies used at work. The latest 

survey (BIBB/BAuA Employment Survey) was conducted in 2011 and 2012 and the one 

before that was conducted in 2005/2006 (Rohrbach-Schmidt 2009; Rohrbach-Schmidt 

and Hall 2013). We use these two surveys to assess the risk of job automation among 

workers and to describe the basic characteristics of workers at risk. 

102. To do this, the same approach described in Section 3. is applied to 
country-specific data. The first step consist in finding the best variables to match 

the engineering bottlenecks identified in FO, and in creating a correspondence between 

the binary occupation-level variables of automatability put forward by FO and 

the occupational classification used in the German data (ISCO-88, 4-digit). Table 8.1 

shows the variables corresponding to FO engineering bottlenecks.

103. The results of estimating the probability of automation as a function of 
engineering bottlenecks are shown in Table 8.2. While most variables behave as expected 

– they reduce the probability of automation – two do not: communication and working 

very fast. This is similar to the estimates using PIAAC, where dexterity, communications 

and sales were positively associated with the risk of automation. We also noted that in 

FO, finger dexterity, manual dexterity and cramped workspace are all positively 

correlated with the probability of automation while the opposite is true in the BIBBIn 

terms of analysis of variance (not shown here), R&D and care contribute most. R&D 

explains 18% of the partial and 4.4% of the total variance, while care explains 14% of the 

partial and 3.5% of the total variance. This is different from PIAAC estimates, 

where planning for others, selling and influencing explained most of the variance while 

the closest variable to R&D (complex problem solving) had very little explanatory power. 

104. Figure 8.1 compares the probability of automation for Germany, as estimated 
using PIAAC (left) and using the BIBB Employment Survey (right). The distributions 

differ substantially, with the one estimated using the BIBB showing particularly heavy 

density in the right tail of the distribution. Since both surveys are representative of the 

working population and conducted at about the same time, the differences can be mainly 

attributed to the differences in the variables representing the engineering bottlenecks. 

Hence, as discuss next, one needs to be cautious when making statements about the 

estimated risk of automation.

8.2. Characteristics of jobs at risk in the German data 

105. Using the same method, but different data and a somewhat different set of 
variables results in very different estimates of the probability of automation. 

For Germany, using PIAAC we estimate that about 18% of the current jobs are at high 

(over 70%) risk of automation. The results using the BIBB/BAuA 2012 job survey 

suggest that about 33% of the jobs in Germany are at high risk of automation. 

This suggests that we need to be very cautious when interpreting the findings of this and 

similar studies.
 31

 On the other hand, the results from the two datasets are more aligned 

when it comes to the relative ranking of affected occupations. 

106. Similar to the ranking of occupations by risk of automation in PIAAC, 
the occupational groups that are estimated to have the highest probability of becoming 

automated in the BIBB do not require specific skills or training – notably, labourers in 

mining, construction and manufacturing (Figure 8.2). Then come machine operators and 

assemblers, clerks and sales people. At the other end of the risk spectrum, the probability 

of automation is significantly lower for professionals specialised in teaching and 

healthcare activities. 

Figure 8.2. Mean probability of automation by occupation in the BIBB  

 

Source: BIBB/BAuA Employment Survey 2012. The sample includes employed Germans, age 21-65.  

107. Similar to the findings using PIAAC, the risk of automation is found to decline 
with the level and the length of education (Figure 8.3 and Table 8.3). Again, no evidence 

                                                      
31

 In addition to differences in the variables, there is also a purely statistical reason for these 

differences, which has to do with the level of data aggregation, but this discussion is beyond the 

interest of this study.

of polarisation in terms of skill levels is found. Germany is widely known for its highly 

developed system of vocational training. Interestingly, while having vocational training is 

better than not having one, people in jobs requiring vocational training are still at 

significantly higher automation risk than those in jobs requiring tertiary education. 

Moreover, consistent with the findings using PIAAC, the risk of automation is lower 

among computer users than among non-users (Table 8.4). A mixed picture emerges when 

looking at the complexity and intensity of computer use: non-users or very basic users 

always have the highest risk of automation but the risk does not fall monotonically with 

more complex or frequent use. Finally, also consistent with the international findings in 

PIAAC, the risk of automation first sharply declines and then gradually increases with 

age (Figure 8.4).

32

 The respondents in the BIBB/BAuA survey are 21 years old or older, while the ones in the 

PIAAC can be as young as 16. This is why we miss seeing the risk of automation among those 

younger than 21 in the German data.

year intervals. The last two surveys were conducted in 2006 and 2012. In this section, 

the same approach as for PIAAC (Section 4) and the BIBB is followed to estimate 

the probability of automation using the UK Skills Survey.

 identified by FO and Table 8.6 shows the estimates from a logit model 

linking these variables to the risk of automation. In the case of the UK Skills Survey, 

allowing for non-linear relationships between the indicator of automatability and the 

variables corresponding to engineering bottlenecks improves the model fit significantly 

and hence a specification that allows for non-linearity is chosen to conduct the analysis. 

As a general pattern, most variables are negatively associated with the indicator of 

automatability, as they should be. Exceptions are spotting problems/faults and sales of 

products and services. The latter had a positive sign both in PIAAC and in the BIBB, 

while spotting problems/faults as a variable is somewhat unique to the UK Skills Survey. 

This kind of problem/faults spotting is most common in manual jobs. A good example 

would be spotting irregularities in the functioning of a machine or the quality of a 

product. Unlike all other studies, finger and hand dexterity is negatively correlated with 

the indicator of automatability, just as theorized by FO. This is a peculiarity of this 

survey.

 The UK Skills Survey has richer set of variables that seemed appropriate for capturing aspects 

of the engineering bottlenecks, but these were often only available for specific survey waves and 

were hence limiting the analysis. Moreover, some variables that were available, were not 

significant predictors of automatability. In the current analysis, we only used variables that were 

consistently asked in more than one survey wave, usually in the last three waves and which are 

significant predictors of automatability.

110. Figure 8.5 shows the estimated probability density function of the risk of 
automation. The resulting probability density function for the UK has a number of 

features in common with the one estimated using PIAAC for England and Northern 

Ireland.
34

 One is that the mode is in the left tail of the distribution, suggesting that the 

typical job in the UK is at low risk of automation. Moreover, in both estimates the density 

is shifted away from high risk values, which is the opposite of the estimates for Germany. 

The mean automatability in the UK survey is similar to the one estimated for the UK in 

PIAAC (0.39 vs. 0.42). However, the estimated share of jobs at higher than 70% risk of 

automation is significantly different. Based on the UK Skills Survey estimates, less than 

3% of the jobs are at such high risk of automation. PIAAC estimated that about 12% of 

the jobs in the UK are at high risk. Hence, although this way of reading the estimated 

distribution is attractive, it is highly sensitive to the choice of data.

8.4. Characteristics of jobs at risk in the UK data 

111. For the UK, as we did for the BIBB and PIAAC data, we identify how the risk of 
automation correlates with key individual and job characteristics. First, we look at the 

mean probability of automation by occupation (Figure 8.6). What the UK, the German 

and PIAAC occupational rankings all have in common is that they rank health and 

teaching professionals among the occupations with the lowest risk of automation. For the 

UK skills survey, the risk of automation increases as the level of skill declines, just like in 

PIAAC and the BIBB, and labourers, machine and vehicle operators are found among the 

occupations at highest risk of automation. They are closely followed by office clerks and

sales workers. There are differences as well. Somewhat unexpected judging by the 

previously described occupational rankings of automatability in PIAAC and BIBB, 

skilled agricultural workers have on average the highest estimated probability of 

automation and natural science professionals have a high estimated automatability too. 

112. The average risk of automation declines with the level of education, just as we 
observed in the PIAAC and in the BIBB-based studies (Table 8.7). The share of jobs at 

high risk of automation seems to first increase and then decline with education, but we 

need to be cautious with this interpretation as sample size is small. Also in line with 

previous findings, the risk of automation is higher among those who do not use computers 

than among those who do
35

 (Table 8.8). Those who say that the use of computers is not 

important for their job have significantly higher probability of automation than those who 

say that the use of computers is fairly important, very important or essential. When asked

 The UK Skills Survey asks about the use of computers or automated equipment. This is 

unfortunate because while computers seem skill augmenting, automated equipment (e.g., industrial 

robots) has been shown to directly substitute labour.

113. Finally, the age pattern of automatability in the UK data has a shape which we 
have observed before: it declines until the age of 30 and then it gradually increases again 

(Figure 8.7).  

114. To sum up, when the robustness of the PIAAC-based findings is tested agaist the 
German BIBB Employment Survey and the UK Skills Survey, a surprising level of 

similarity in the findings if found along with some significant differences. What is 

common is how the measure of automatability ranks occupations by their risk of 

automation. Occupations that specialise in teaching and health are among the safest 

occupations. Low skilled occupations, such as labourers in various sectors are at a very 

high risk of automation, but so are occupations with moderate training: machine 

operators, office clerks, and sales personnel. In all three surveys, the risk of automation 

monotonically declines with the level of education. Computer users are at a significantly 

lower risk of automation. The age pattern is very interesting and similar across surveys: 

the risk of automation first sharply declines until the age of 30 to mid-30 and then it 

gradually increases. What is different across the surveys is the absolute estimate of the 

risk of automation. The German data, for instance, gives a significantly higher average 

risk of automation, although the relative ranking of occupational titles along the 

distribution of automatability is similar to our estimates using the PIAAC. The share of 

workers at high or low risk of automation is particularly sensitive to the data source and 

the selected variables. As a result, presenting the risk of automation for these two groups 

might be particularly misleading. It is preferable to focus on average risk and on

9.  The role of initial, employer-sponsored and informal training in helping 
workers adapt to changing skill needs 

115. This Section investigates the role of informal and on-the-job training in helping 
employees at risk of automation to adjust to new skill demands. Before analysing the 

relationships between job automatability and training, it is important to identify 

incentives to provide and participate in training by the different actors involved: the 

incentives of firms to offer training, the incentives of individuals to seek training and the 

role of government sponsored programs to fill the training gap that the private sector may 

fail to fill. 

116. Firms. Human capital theory (Becker 1964) argues that on-the-job training is an 
investment in human capital. Firms train because they expect such training to make 

workers more productive in the future. If firms anticipate that certain tasks are going to be 

automated, they may provide less training to workers in such jobs. However, more often 

than not automation affects a subset of workers’ tasks, and workers in these jobs may 

require training to adapt to the task restructuring that is caused by automation, i.e., 

automation may even increase the need for training. Bessen (2015) showed how the 

diffusion of ATMs, a typical labour substituting technology, transformed the job content 

of bank tellers rather than eliminating these jobs. Cash-handling became less important, 

and marketing and interpersonal skills became more important. The modern tellers are 

now in charge of customer relationships and not only of cash-handling. Larger shares of 

new hires now have a bachelor degree instead of only a high school diploma. In the case 

of ATMs, therefore, employees affected by automation received more and not less 

training. 

117. Employees at risk of automation could of course invest in training on their own 
account. If they anticipate that their current job is being automated, they may spend their 

free time training in a different profession. In such scenario, one should see higher 

incidence of outside-the-job training for those at higher risk. Here as well, the patterns 

may be more complicated. As shown above, the risk of automation declines with 

educational attainment, suggesting that workers who sort themselves in more automatable 

jobs tend to invest less in human capital to start with. As a result, they might also be less 

motivated to learn new things. There might also be financial reasons: lower earnings in 

such jobs result in lower savings that can be invested in education. As a result, 

even though workers in automatable jobs are in higher need of retraining, they may be 

more reluctant to seek retraining. Moreover, the demand for requalification may not be 

met by adequate supply. Government-sponsored training may be in low supply and 

private sector training may either be undersupplied or it may offer marketable skills that 

are very different from those of the affected workers, and hence difficult for them to 

master. It is beyond this study to disentangle demand and supply factors, but the analysis 

below could offer novel insights into the general training propensity and training patterns 

of these employees.

AUTOMATION, SKILLS USE AND TRAINING

118. Overall, the relationship between the risk of automation and training participation 
will depend on several factors: the skill level and interest of workers at risk of automation 

when it comes to obtaining training, the opportunities to reallocate workers within the 

same organisation following re-training, the level of mismatch between their skills and 

the job requirements of the available jobs, and the availability of training outside the job 

through government-sponsored or private sector programmes. The relationship may differ 

for on-the-job training and training that is undertaken to improve the chances of finding a 

new job. Workers at high risk of automation may receive less on-the-job training, but 

may be more likely to invest in training that helps them find a new job. 

119. The analysis below takes advantage of the broad cross-country coverage of 
PIAAC and its training module in order to establish basic empirical facts about the 

relationship between training and automatability, without attempting to disentangle the 

multiple complex factors that lead to these observable patterns. The training module 

distinguishes between on-the-job and off-the-job education and training,
36

 and it also asks 

about the degree to which the training was motivated by job or career perspectives. Only 

job-related training is used in the analysis below. The module, however, does not contain 

information about the actual content of training. To gain insights into this, this analysis is 

complemented with information about occupational qualification and requalification in 

Germany. 

120. The first finding that is consistent among most surveyed countries is that workers 
at risk of automation receive less and not more job-related training than other workers. 

This is the case both with training provided by employers (on-the-job training) and 

training obtained outside the firm (formal education, online courses etc.). Overall, 67% of 

those in the lowest decile of automatability report having attended at least one type of 

job-related training in the last 12 months (employer-sponsored or on own account), while 

this is only the case with 31% of workers in the highest decile of automatability. 

Moreover, in the lowest decile of automatability, people spent 25 hours in job-related 

training annually on average, while in the highest decile of automatability, they spent 

about 59 hours in job-related training. These findings are presented in Figure 9.1. 

Training incidence by degree of job automatability 

121.  

122.  In more detail, the Figure 9.1 shows the share of people that have participated in 
job-related training in the last 12 months as a function of automatability (left axis), 

distinguishing between different types of learning: formal education, distant or open 

education, on-the-job training and other courses/training. The figure additionally shows 

the average number of hours spent in job-related training in the last 12 months (right 

axis). The prevalence of all types of training, as well as the number of hours spent in 

training decline with the risk of automation. 

123. Participation in on-the-job training is the highest among employees in jobs with 
low automatability but declines slowly up to a risk of automation of about 30%, after 

which the decline in the likelihood of on-the-job training accelerates. This suggests that 

employers invest in the retraining of workers even when their tasks are at low or 

moderate risk of automation, but they offer significantly less training to those at the 

highest risk of automation. The observed trend corroborates the argument that re-training

is often provided when occupational tasks are partially automatable, such that workers 

can transition to new tasks within the same organisation, but less so when jobs are almost 

fully automatable, in which case employers may not plan to retain such workers.

124. This bivariate analysis is likely to suffer from omitted variable bias. For instance, 
the majority of training is typically obtained early in one’s career and, at the same time, 

the estimated risk of automation is the highest among youth. Moreover, it has been shown 

above that the use of ICT correlates highly with the risk of automation and there are 

reasons to believe that the use of ICT causally impacts the incidence and level of training. 

To reduce this bias, logistic regressions
37

 are estimated where the type of job-related 

training is modelled as a function of automatability and a set of control variables: use of 

ICT, age, educational attainment and country-specific effects.
38 

The results are shown in 

Table 9.1. The odds of obtaining any type of training, on-the-job and outside the job are 

significantly lower among workers in jobs at higher risk of being automated. Workers in 

fully automatable jobs (automatability = 1) are 4 times (1/0.253) less likely to have 

participated in job-related in the last 12 months than workers in non-automatable jobs 

(automatability = 0). Similarly, they are twice less likely to have obtained formal 

job-related training, 3.5 times less likely to have take online or distant learning, and 3

38
 In spite of the controls, these estimates need to be read with caution as we cannot rule out the 

additional bias stemming from unobservable individual and group characteristics which influence 

individuals’ choices to participate in training.

 Two other observations are worth pointing out. First, the odds of obtaining training increase 

with the level of education. Skills breed skills, it seems. Second, using ICT at work is associated 

with 2.2 times higher odds of any training and in particular distant/open education and on-the-job 

training. It is also associated with 15 hours more training over 12 months. This supports the 

hypothesis made earlier in this report that ICT are skill complementing technologies.

AUTOMATION, SKILLS USE AND TRAINING 

For Official Use 

125. After establishing that workers at high risk of automation receive less job-related 
training overall, this section looks at whether those who do participate in training, and in 

particular those who acquire an additional occupational qualification (i.e. those who 

requalify), choose qualifications for jobs that are less susceptible to automation. In the 

absence of information on the content of training in PIAAC, the BIBB Employment 

Surveys for Germany are used instead (see Section 7 for a description). The data can help 

study whether people use re-qualification to move away from jobs at higher risk of 

automation. 

126. Section 2 showed that over time (1960-2012), in Germany, jobs specialised in 
interactive and non-routine tasks became more common while those rich in manual 

(routine and non-routine) and routine cognitive tasks declined. However, that analysis did 

not explore if this shift in the structure of employment by occupation was driven by 

younger cohorts opting for jobs at lower risk of automation by requalification by adult 

workers from more to less automatable jobs. This section provides evidence that this 

transition was partially enabled by requalification. 

127. The BIBB/BAuA Employment Surveys ask respondents to report up to five 
consecutive trainings that lead to occupational qualification, including information about 

the 2-digit ISCO code corresponding to each qualification.
40

 Such data, in combination 

with the task characteristics of each ISCO category, allowed us to study whether 

individuals transited towards “safer” jobs through requalification. A striking 39.5% of all 

participants in the survey reported having completed at least one re-qualification. A clear 

pattern occurs when the job tasks of the first qualification are compared to those of the 

second qualification. The second qualification has significantly lower risk of automation 

(Table 9.2). 

128. Looking in more detail, the second qualification involves significantly more tasks 
that require creative and social intelligence and fewer tasks that require perception and 

manipulation of objects. As a robustness check, Table 9.2 shows the risk of automation 

calculated with ALM instead of FO job tasks, and it also shows the results for each type 

of ALM task separately. Here as well the same pattern emerges: the second qualification 

is at significantly lower risk of automation, it requires significantly more non-routine 

tasks and fewer routine tasks. 

129. It is important to note that, if anything, the measured adaptation towards “safer” 
jobs is understated. In absence of historical job task data, it is assumed that the job task 

contents within occupations did not change over time (they are kept at constant 2006 

levels). Adaptations which happened within occupational qualifications, like in the case 

of the bank tellers described above, are not captured in this exercise. The analysis 

basically assumes that at any point of time, the job task structure of any occupation is just 

like the one observed in 2006 in Germany. 

130. Also noteworthy is that, although the direction of the requalification is clear and 
significant, the movements away from automatable jobs are very gradual. On average, 

the difference in automatability between the first and second occupational qualification is 

only about 1/7 standard deviation (1/9 S.D. in the case of ALM automatability). People 

do adjust, but radical requalification seems rare. This means that, if the growing jobs are 

                                                      
40

 Prior to 2012, information is even available at the 3-digit ISCO level.

10.  Conclusions 

131. This study assesses the current and potential disruption brought about by 
automation in the labour markets of OECD countries. It identifies workers who are most 

likely to be affected and looks at the extent to which training is helping them adjust to the 

resulting changes in their job tasks. It builds on expert views collected by Frey and 

Osborne (2013) but applies Frey and Osborne’s approach to individual jobs, instead of 

occupations, using PIAAC data for 32 OECD countries. The estimates suggest that 14% 

of jobs in OECD countries participating in PIAAC are at high risk (probability of over 

70%) of being automated based on current technological possibilities. An additional 32% 

of jobs have a probability of being automated between 50% and 70% and could face 

significant changes in their job content. There is large variation in the risk of automation 

across countries. In general, jobs in Anglo-Saxon, Nordic countries and the Netherlands 

are less automatable than jobs in Eastern European countries, South European countries, 

Germany, Chile and Japan. More than two thirds of the variation across countries is 

explained by differences in the way economies organise work within the same economic 

sectors (i.e., their occupational mix within industries and the job task mix within 

occupations), and only 30% is explained by differences in the economic structure of 

economies (i.e., the mix of industries). 

132. The risk of automation declines with the level of education, with the level of 
measured skills (PIAAC’s numeracy and literacy) and with the wage level across almost 

all countries, suggesting that this wave of automation is skill biased. The study, however, 

does not find support for the hypothesis that AI already has a measurable impact on the 

job security of occupations characterised by high levels of education and skills and high 

degrees of non-routine cognitive job tasks. On the other hand, AI appears to affect 

low-skilled jobs more significantly than previous waves of automation. 

133. Another notable finding is that the risk of automation peaks among teen jobs. 
More precisely, the relationship between the risk of automation and age is U-shaped. The 

highest automatability is found among jobs held by youth. The risk then declines to reach 

its lowest value at age 30-35 and then gradually increases again. Although this pattern is 

largely driven by the sorting of youth into automatable occupations (youth are over-

represented in sales, personal care and many elementary occupations), the pattern persists 

even after occupational sorting effects are accounted for. In other words, youth and adults 

do different things at work, even when they hold jobs with the same occupational title. 

These results suggest that automation may have more implications for youth 

unemployment policies than for early retirement policies. The warnings in some 

developed countries that teen jobs have been harder to come by in recent years should be 

taken seriously and studied in the context of job automation. 

134. The study presents evidence that re-qualification is an important mechanism to 
aid the transition from more to less automatable jobs. For Germany more specifically, 

where close to 40% of all employees have undergone at least one occupational 

re-qualification in their career, the second qualification is towards occupations with 

systematically lower risk of automation than the first one. These transitions are however

gradual in the sense that workers choose to requalify to occupations that are skill-related 

to their previous qualification. This means that re-qualification might be more effective in 

situations where differences in the skills content of declining and growing jobs in the 

economy is not too large. In this context, it is encouraging (or at least less discouraging) 

to find that the risk of automation is highly concentrated among youth jobs. Education 

and re-qualification are easier early in one’s career. If teen and student jobs are about to 

decline, education and training will have to find different – possibly, class-based – ways 

of helping youth prepare for the labour market. Separate policies will have to address the 

elevated risk of automation among “older” jobs. Future research should focus on the 

effectiveness of life-long learning, and in particular adult education in helping older 

workers transition to safer jobs. 

135. Overall, it is important to stress that, while job destruction figures estimated in 
this paper are smaller than those obtained based on occupational titles, it is important not 

to dismiss the importance of providing retraining and social protection for the 14% of 

workers whose jobs are at high risk, as well as to those 32% who are likely to face 

significant changes in the way they carry out their work tasks. In addition, the unequal 

distribution of the risk of automation raises the stakes involved in policies to prepare 

workers for the new job requirements even further. 

136. Finally, this study highlights, but does not deal with, some important issues that 
will be the focus of further work. First, as mentioned throughout the report, the focus is 

placed on technological possibilities, abstracting from technology penetration and 

adoption. Ongoing work is expected to shed light on the timing of the risk of automation 

in different industries and countries. Secondly, this study only touches on how 

technological progress may affect wages by highlighting the negative association between 

the estimated risk of automation and hourly wages. This relationship is being looked at 

more in-depth in the context of work on wage polarisation and inequality, leading to a 

broader discussion on the potential need for income redistribution. Thirdly, the regional 

concentration of the risk of automation could amplify its social and economic impact, 

particularly in countries where geographical mobility is low. The OECD is currently 

working on deriving regional estimates of the risk of automation and highlighting the 

policy implications of risk concentration.

137. This appendix explains how we estimate the probability of automation as a 
function of ALM tasks: routine, non-routine and interactive. We follow Antonczyk et al. 

(2008) in classifying tasks into the ALM groups (Table A B.1).

Using a logistic regression we then model the FO 0/1 variable as a function of these job tasks. 

Table A B.2 shows the results of this estimation.  

138. Figure A B.1shows how the distribution of the estimated ALM probability of 
automation compares with the distribution of the estimated FO probability of automation. 

The distributional forms are quite similar, with the ALM probability having somewhat 

higher average (0.53 vs. 0.523, t value = 9.95) and median (0.575 vs. 0.568) values.
