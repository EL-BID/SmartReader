Automation Beyond the Physical: AI in the Public
Sector
26 ways artificial intelligence is, or could, help government do its job.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: Computers or software simulating human intelligence by

changing the way they behave without explicit human intervention.

MACHINE LEARNING: MACHINE LEARNING: A specific component of AI wherein algorithms learn and

change automatically based on patterns in data.

NEURAL NETWORK:NEURAL NETWORK: A computing paradigm that achieves machine learning by feeding

data through multiple layers. Neural networks are named after connections made in

the brain, and are structured to learn in the same way as a brain.

It used to be that the term “automation” meant robotic arms in factories doing repetitive
tasks — fastening one part to another, drilling a screw, folding a piece of material. These
days, the word means a lot more.

AI means automation beyond the physical. It means automation of the tasks that
previously took a living brain to complete — things like conversation, data analysis, even
driving.

And ultimately, AI isn’t anything new; computer scientists have been discussing and
building it for decades now. What’s changed is the availability of cheap computing,
advances in algorithm coding and an abundance of newly available data.

“We’ve just finally had this really good synergy as the technology and the algorithms
both matured at the same time,” said Daniel Castro, vice president of the Information
Technology and Innovation Foundation.

What remains, then, is to apply AI to everyday purposes. And people are doing so, both
in and outside government — it’s just hard to tell sometimes. Because AI, as buzzy as the
term is right now, mostly functions as part of a product. AI is just one step — it doesn’t
necessarily involve gathering data, or doing anything meaningful with it.

“I think people are waiting around for the killer app,” said Steve Nichols, Georgia’s chief
technology officer. “Knowing that it’s coming … and reading about it is one thing, but
then you ask yourself the question, ‘Now what I do? How do I apply this?’ So I think
there’s going to be a gestation where people are figuring out the use cases.”

The technology is, by nature, broadly applicable. If a thing involves data — “data” itself
being a nebulous word — then it probably has room for AI. AI can help manage the data,
analyze it and find patterns that humans might not have thought of. When it comes to
big data, or data sets so big that they become difficult for humans to manually interact
with, AI leverages the speedy nature of computing to find relationships that might
otherwise be proverbial haystack needles.

One early area of government application is in customer service chatbots. As state and
local governments started putting information on websites in the past couple of decades,
they found that they could use those portals as a means of answering questions that
constituents used to have to call an office to ask.

Ideally that results in a cyclical victory: Government offices didn’t have as many calls to
answer, so they could devote more time and resources to other functions. And when
somebody did call in, their call might be answered faster.

With chatbots, governments are betting they can answer even more of those questions.
When he was the chief technology and innovation officer of North Carolina, Eric Ellis
oversaw the setup of a system that did just that for IT help desk calls.

Turned out, more than 80 percent of the help desk’s calls were people who wanted to
change their passwords. For something like that, where the process is largely the same
each time, a bot can speed up the process with a little help from AI. Then, just like with
the government Web portal, workers are freed up to respond to the more complicated
calls faster.

But there’s more to it than that. When it comes to a customer service-type situation, AI
can streamline the process by getting information from a caller while they wait for
somebody to take their call.

“You’re sitting on the phone for five minutes waiting and then a real person asks you,
‘Hey, what’s your name, tell me this, this and this.’ And instead a chatbot could have
gathered that information from you in a very conversational way to begin with,” Ellis
said.

Other governments have taken notice and started tinkering with chatbots in other
contexts as well. In Los Angeles, a city-built chatbot answers business-related questions
for citizens. In Mississippi, people can use the Amazon Alexa artificial intelligence
service to plug into government information about things like taxes and vehicle
registration. In Utah, people can use the state’s driver’s license test studying materials
through Alexa.

Others are using AI to recognize and report objects in photographs and videos — guns,
waterfowl, cracked concrete, pedestrians, semi-trucks, everything. Others are using AI
to help translate between languages dynamically. Some want to use it to analyze the tone
of emails. Some are using it to try to keep up with cybersecurity threats even as they
morph and evolve. After all, if AI can learn to beat professional poker players, then why
can’t it learn how digital black hats operate?

Castro sees another use for the technology, a more introspective one. The problem is
this: The government workforce is a lot older than the private sector, and that can make
it hard to create culture change. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, about 27 percent
of public-sector workers are millennials, compared with 38 percent in the private sector.

“The traditional view [of government work] is you fill out a lot of forms, there are a lot of
boring meetings. There’s a lot of bureaucracy in government,” Castro said. “AI has the
opportunity to change a lot of that, things like filling out forms … going to routine
meetings and stuff.”

As AI becomes more and more ubiquitous, people who work both inside and with
government are coming up with an ever-expanding list of ways to use it. Here’s an
inexhaustive list of specific use cases — some of which are already up and running and
some of which are still just ideas.
