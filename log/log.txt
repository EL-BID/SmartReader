Text:  Apple has integrated 9 000 trees into its futuristic new headquarters campus reflecting research showing that greenery in workplaces increases productivity by 15 percent Several years ago Google s People Analytics division launched Project Aristotle to understand the components of productive teams embracing research that groups are more creative than individuals Private sector businesses are automating tedious tasks augmenting workers with artificial intelligence technologies reskilling and upskilling their workforces focusing on employee wellness and hungrily recruiting talent Government will have to catch up Perhaps nowhere is the gap between the public and private sector greater than in workforce management Most public sector organizations are still locked into decades old employee policies such as rigid job classifications lockstep pay and a reliance on seniority as a substitute for capability The reality is that government agencies are increasingly called upon to address society s most complex challenges while using workforce approaches rooted in the distant past The good news Change is possible and beginning to happen A new Deloitte study explores some of the ways the nature of government work the public workforce itself and the workplace it occupies will all need to continue to evolve Work New technologies can transform the capabilities of a government worker Artificially intelligent chatbots for example can perform triage on citizen questions freeing human attention for less routine queries The Army s recruitment chatbot SGT STAR does the work of 55 recruiters answering 94 percent of questions A Deloitte analysis of AI s potential found that automation could save the federal government as much as 1 2 billion hours of work annually What AI doesn t automate it can enhance Child welfare caseworkers who according to one study spend just 9 percent of their time with children but 37 5 percent of their time on paperwork could use technology to auto populate documentation freeing time for visits AI also can correlate hospital truancy and arrest records to flag children in danger Some restaurant health inspectors already analyze big data to identify likely candidates for inspections In Chicago for instance tests found 24 percent more critical violations and on average isolated dangers from the food system a week earlier For effective work redesign it s helpful to adopt a two pronged strategy of zooming in and zooming out A zooming in approach hones in on individual tasks and processes that have the most potential to be optimized through automation Zooming out entails looking at the bigger picture to define what work redesign means for entire job classifications departments and the organization as a whole Workforce Specialists in fields like cybersecurity agile development and artificial intelligence are not likely to commit decades to one government position and if they did they d still need to swap into the tech sector periodically to sharpen their skills That s why some government technology programs are taking a tour of duty approach letting private sector experts serve in the public sector for a few years on specific projects without locking them into a lifetime of government work At the federal level the General Services Administration s 18F digital services agency the Oak Ridge Institute for Science Education and the Presidential Innovation Fellows program all help government solve problems with temporary outside hires At the state level Michigan s Cyber Civilian Corps a volunteer group of cybersecurity professionals from the private sector and academia as well as government can be called upon if the governor declares a cyber emergency And long term government workers don t need to be stuck in one place A talent cloud can prepare for unexpected staffing needs by identifying in advance workers with special skills and applying them to tasks suited to their expertise Canada is experimenting with letting multiple agencies dip into a talent cloud and hire workers for specific missions Workers keep their union membership rights and benefits but may be called into service by any agency Workplace Empirical science rarely guides hiring But management is becoming more data driven Applying the newest science on team building personal efficiency and employee wellness to government agencies can upgrade the workplace to better attract retain and utilize talent Insights from studies of the composition and functioning of effective teams can inform decisions about using talents more effectively Organizational network analysis for example can use metadata from emails and other sources to map communication patterns in organizations accurately predicting individuals who will be high performers detecting unsatisfied employees six months before they actually quit and identifying leadership behaviors that correlate with success Modern workplace wellness programs are also extremely impactful Improving employee wellness can reduce lost work days increase retention and fuel productivity After the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center provided a physician and nurse case manager for employees it saw an 80 percent decline in lost work days over six years for a cost savings of 1 5 million In short the future of government work will require a level of dynamic workforce management far beyond the current practices of the public sector The potential for government agencies to unlock more human capital potential and make the public sector a magnet for talent is enormous As Buffalo s former mayor demonstrated to bring the right people together you have to know what it takes to make a project succeed Local governments are using internet surveys to better gauge residents needs Some states are finding ways to make rules easier to navigate and less costly for business while continuing to protect the public s interests The amount of missing and unusable public sector data is stunning Every jurisdiction should be comparing itself with its peers to identify problematic practices increase productivity and reduce costs It s all too easy for team members to misunderstand something Effective leaders know the value of the pre brief Our Deputy Chair Karen Chester gave a speech to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia CEDA WA on 17 July 2018 in Perth Jobs matter For almost all of us they are a source of income But they are also a source of self esteem of social interaction a feeling of purpose and even of community And the skills embedded in jobs remain principal drivers of increasing productivity and ultimately wages So when one opines on the future of work people tend to listen But perhaps when one is opining on the future of work today expectations of the listener are more akin to the BBC announcer of Monty Python s Flying Circus and now for something completely different When perhaps it s simply not so different And I guess that may well prove the damp squib hashtag for my talk today We know from history that soothsayers abound when it comes to opining on the future of work Indeed history is littered with the foretelling of a dystopia of jobless woe or a utopia of little need to work at all And the only universal truth seems to be that they were all wrong both happily and unhappily so The 20th century father of the fiscal stimulus John Maynard Keynes foretold in 1930 that In the 21st century a 15 hour work week will suffice as we turn instead to how to use freedom from pressing economic cares And yet despite significant productivity gains since the Keynes 1930 treatise we still all work on average around 40 hours a week In the late 1970s the historian Ian Turner presided over a major symposium on what new technologies would mean for the worker He predicted an imminent period of change as significant as the Neolithic or Industrial Revolutions To quote By 1988 at least a quarter of the Australian workforce would be made redundant by technological change And a similar adage we heard in 1982 from Barry Jones in his book Sleepers Awake technology and the future of work We all know that the late 1980s did see an exponential uptick in the common use of computers in workplaces and even more so in the 90s as the price of the humble computer plummeted But the foretelling of widespread redundancies of the Australian workforce were not seen For throughout the past 100 years it s been more a case of technology remaining the loyal friend not foe of the worker continuing to remove jobs that are often unpleasant physically tiring downright dangerous or just tedious think toll booth operator More recently we ve seen a plethora of papers and reports produced by think tanks academics consultants and platform giants touting analyses of jobs that could be lost as a result of the latest wave of technological change And that latest wave being the digital age and both the resultant automation and artificial intelligence Some of these reports seem to have settled on a nice big round figure of about 40 per cent of today s jobs now being at risk of automation over the next 10 to 20 years Now most of these reports stem from a seminal 2013 paper by Frey and Osborne where US data was used to predict job losses in the future But their approach left out a few things It did not take into account that new technologies can create new jobs Nor did it contemplate that not all tasks within an occupation can be automated or should be automated And we know that the rate of technological adoption will also depend a lot on consumer preferences do you want a robot cutting your hair and the actual cost or put crudely the business case of adoption Others in taking these factors into account suggest 9 of Australian workers are exposed to the risk of automation So a much smaller but not insignificant number And here I ll mention the must read paper by Melbourne University economists Jeff Borland and Michael Coelli Are the Robots Taking Our Jobs Their work lines up with the more considered studies in the US and Europe So let s look at the evidence a common sense thing to do when in the midst of a chorus of now for something completely different To test whether we have strayed into a world of lies lies and damned statistics And in looking at the evidence I ve drawn on some of the Commission s recent endeavour such as our Digital Disruption report 2016 and Shifting the Dial 2017 as well as the work of Jeff Borland and Michael Coelli and that of Bart van Ark of The Conference Board Overall the evidence suggests that labour markets have been pretty well resilient to shocks posed by new technologies of the past century and even the most recent modern bit Occupations skills and jobs come and they go No matter how transformative the technology be it the telephone electricity indoor plumbing refrigeration air transport the personal computer and today s digital No technology has removed people s capacity to work And in productivity terms all have been more transformative than the digital revolution so far with emphasis being on the so far And a bunch of measures suggest that technology is not having as large of an effect as expected at least not in our current modern times The rise of the New Digital Economy which encompasses mobile technology ubiquitous access to the internet and the world of the cloud is unquestionably changing lots of things But to date productivity is not one So much so that this has become known as the Productivity Paradox So whilst our low rate of multi factor productivity growth observed recently is not unique to Australia it has been observed across other countries too it represents something of a puzzle This is because it suggests that at least in aggregate our economies have not become any more efficient in producing things And we know the policy reasons why productivity may have slowed in Australia but this is notwithstanding our purported better ability to exploit information technologies One explanation for this is that there has been a change in the nature of technological progress That recent technologies characterised by some as dramatic have been minor compared to those in the previous century The other explanation one offered by Bart van Ark and perhaps one of intuitive appeal is that whilst we still see rapidly declining ICT prices along with a shift from ICT investment to ICT services perhaps the new digital economy is still in its installation phase And we shouldn t expect to see the productivity dividend until it truly enters the deployment phase This makes sense when you see that in the US the contribution of the most ICT intensive industries to productivity growth has dropped markedly from 46 to 26 in the past decade 2007 16 And for the US and the UK it has even at times registered negative productivity growth in these sectors Which could suggest that the dividend only makes its way into the deployment and hopefully productivity dividend phase once users fully grapple with how to absorb technology effectively So returning to the evidence on the impact on jobs And we do know that there has been automation of many tasks in the workplace But arguably if technology was both disruptive and displacing replacing existing jobs without creating new ones we would expect to see a persistent upward trend in the unemployment rate And we don t Whilst routine manual and routine cognitive jobs have fallen as a proportion of jobs from 50 to 37 non routine manual and non routine cognitive jobs have increased from 42 to 53 Think child care aged care nursing office managers designers and engineers using software Most importantly the aggregate amount of work available to the Australian population on a per capita basis has not seen a decline since the 1980s when computers became common in the workplace The amount of work available has actually increased by about 14 since the early 1980s But that s not to say there hasn t been a lot of change in our workforce and the nature of work since the 1980s Since the 1980s the workforce participation rate for females has increased a lot by some 15 percentage points to now be just over 60 Marriage and even children are placing much less of a brake on economic participation of women Which is both a good thing for the economy and for women There has also been an increase in the incidence of part time jobs by some 25 percentage points since the late 1960s to now account for nearly one third of total employment around 35 in Australia And despite what some have suggested the pace at which workers are changing between jobs in the Australian labour market is not getting quicker Not only is there no evidence that more workers are being forced to work in short duration jobs but what is apparent is that the opposite has happened The proportion of workers in very long duration jobs more than 10 years has increased from just under 20 per cent in 1982 to around 27 per cent in 2016 Which is perhaps unsurprising when you also take into account the participation rate of older Australians 65 in age has risen steeply having nearly doubled in the past 30 years to now represent 12 of our workforce Also a good thing with our ageing population We do know that more workers today have multiple jobs now around 7 of workers And perhaps of much greater significance when workers do change jobs today more are changing occupations some 40 and industries over 50 And it was this modern day workforce reality that informed much of our thinking around the Commission s proposed changes to superannuation default arrangements in our current superannuation Inquiry And our thinking on what is needed from our tertiary education system which I ll return to later And whilst the gig economy is still in its infancy this has not translated yet to any increase in the proportion of the workforce being independent contractors Indeed this has not changed significantly since 2001 it s actually fallen a few percentage points from 20 per cent of employed persons in 2001 to around 18 per cent in 2014 So what does any of this mean or matter for public policy And perhaps here our focus should be two fold First on making sure there are no road blocks to our economy reaching the deployment phase of the digital or any technological age And second making sure we avoid a workforce of have and have nots in the benefits from the changes in the economy and ultimately jobs A sense of equality in the ultimate job productivity and wage dividend So let me pose a few policy questions Are we getting better at assisting transitioning workers We know that structural change whatever its source can result in considerable work and thus life disruption for the workers impacted unless we get the consequential skill adjustment right So have we gotten better in assisting displaced workers get the right skills to transition into new occupations and industries Recent work by the Commission on transitioning regional economies found that effectiveness of government in doing this is at best unclear Some programs found to be not well targeted automotive industry or create conflicting incentives Tasmanian forestry industry And why unclear use of data to simply track the impacted workers and decent evaluation of transitional assistance are largely missing in action Put simply we can and should be doing better Further it s a tad perverse that if the digital economy ultimately disrupts more jobs we do not use the data fuelling that economic activity to assist those disrupted We know of such endeavour in Germany using data to track the worker and the resultant human capital modelling which in turn better informs what requalification programs will deliver a better job transition to a displaced worker Are the right incentives in place to get the workers to the new jobs We know that jobs at least risk of automation jobs that require soft skills such as good old fashioned empathy account for the largest and growing part of our workforce And the latest metrics from the ABS brand new quarterly labour account experimental estimates reveal health care and social assistance as the largest employment sectors accounting for over 1 6 million jobs or 12 2 of all filled jobs This is largely a function of our demographic changes an ageing population women working more along with the NDIS arguably our single biggest social reform since Medicare The Commission s recent review of NDIS costs found that the NDIS workforce was not growing fast enough most regions require between a 50 per cent and 150 per cent increase in the disability services workforce Put simply for the foreseeable future 1 in 5 new jobs in Australia are projected to be for services for the NDIS Thus care is needed to ensure that the demand for these skills and workers is not frustrated by poor incentives The most notable as highlighted in our NDIS review being the need to ensure the pricing of these services allows this massive labour force response to occur Lest we have a program delivering disappointment and not services to the 475 000 Australians with eligible disabilities Is our education and training system fit for purpose for the workers of today and tomorrow Perhaps this is our biggest public policy must have when thinking of ensuring innovation and technology delivers not just more jobs but jobs for most That sense of equality in who shares in the ultimate job productivity and wage dividend And this was a question the Commission sought to ask and answer last year in our inaugural 5 yearly productivity review Shifting the Dial A policy roadmap for Australian Governments on what is needed to deliver on economic participation and productivity two of the three Ps population participation and productivity that matter most for economic growth and ultimately jobs and their real wages And we identified some fundamental fractures in our current education and training system First deteriorating results in subjects that matter for future work think science maths and reading the cognitive trifecta at school Second the VET system is a mess struggling to deliver relevant competency based qualifications Employers today are more satisfied with non accredited training courses 90 than VET 76 Third universities need to improve student employment outcomes delivering qualifications relevant to labour market needs and at a time relevant to the worker s needs Our key educational institutions seem more focused on research than student employment outcomes which is unsurprising given the notable absence of their skin in the game As manifest in 26 of students today not completing their undergraduate studies in less than 9 years Whilst undergraduate underemployment has more than doubled in the last decade to now reach just over 20 Currently the tertiary education system is set up against becoming a chef at age 40 or a dementia care worker at age 50 Retraining is currently inconvenient and expensive and the approach of educational institutions remains outdated and outmoded still emphasising a one career for life approach Which is not the modern day reality for many workers from the metrics cited earlier Taken collectively this unfortunate troika can only put at risk our capacity to deal with future labour market changes in an efficient and equitable way So we ve proposed a few things change for schools evidence and evaluation of what works with teaching for universities incentives be redressed around student employment outcomes and for work skills government to develop two things First tools for proficiency based assessment for skills rather than simply competency based assessment whether they can perform it at all And second a framework to facilitate independent accreditation of skills obtained agnostic of learning method Do current policy settings constrain us getting to and through the installation phase and on to realising benefits in the deployment phase of the digital economy Today s market power arguably resides in data and content The growth of the digital economy automation and artificial intelligence coupled with greater availability of data and algorithm advances will be key drivers of new business activity research endeavour products skills and jobs In short access and use of data and content will be the determining force in realising the economic benefits of the digital economy and artificial intelligence On data the Commission s report last year on Data Use and Availability proposed fundamental and novel changes to data availability and access policy to ensure it generates new economic opportunities and business opportunities driven by consumer needs and preferences A pro consumer and thus pro competition stimulus with the consumer in the drivers seat for their data held with business and government today And the good news is the Government s response to this inquiry has been one of can and will do The Government has committed to support the two most structurally significant recommendations First the passage of national legislation to remove barriers to data sharing and integration across major public interest data sets and create trusted user access And second the complementary legislated concept of a new general Right for Consumers to exercise joint control in the sharing and use of their data So it s now all down to getting the implementation right On content the Commission s Inquiry in 2016 on Intellectual Property Arrangements examined whether those arrangements meet the needs of the Australian economy And the short answer was no for copyright Currently Australia s copyright exceptions are too narrow and prescriptive do not reflect the way people today consume and use content and do not readily accommodate new legitimate uses of copyright material We found ourselves mired in the wrong debate of publishers clamouring for well protected profit for the purported benefit of local authors For access to content be it snippets of images maps pixels words song sounds is needed alongside data to actually do artificial intelligence But our arrangements unlike those in countries like the US South Korea and Israel pose a seemingly impenetrable barrier to AI being alive and well in our economy For in the absence of meaningful reform to copyright Australia will inevitably and demonstrably be a net importer of AI services and products And fair access to content also matters for education Now more than ever workers need flexible access to ongoing learning MOOCs are a key component of providing low cost and flexible access to ongoing learning And in consulting with the states on Shifting the Dial we were implored to think of the transitioning worker in NW Tasmania in our approach to ongoing skills acquisition especially for mature age workers Yet Australia s current system of copyright usage heavily constrain Universities TAFEs and schools from offering MOOCs So on a final note I ve failed dismally to foretell a future of dystopia or utopia and happily so but that doesn t mean that the deployment phase of the digital economy may yet still surprise us And in reflecting on the Inquiries that formed much of the Commission s endeavour over the last five years or so nearly all have dealt in some way shape or form with the now of work and thus the future of work And in doing so tried to view it through the lens of the needs of workers and students And through that lens it affords a sense of what policies new or tweaked will see our economy able to access the installation phase and realise the benefits of the deployment phase of any technological change And perhaps most importantly ensuring those phases see the benefits of jobs productivity and higher wages shared across the workforce Avoiding a world of technology driven haves and have nots Because that s what matters most for the future of work Follow OnSubscribeThe Commission has published an issues paper and one pager for our inquiry into technological

2020Our mission is to help leaders in multiple sectors develop a deeper understanding of the global economy Our flagship business publication has been defining and informing the senior management agenda since 1964 Our learning programs help organizations accelerate growth by unlocking their people s potential Higher costs and rising demand have driven rapid increases in spending on core public services such as education healthcare and transport while countries must grapple with complex challenges such as population aging economic inequality and protracted security concerns Government expenditure amounts to more than a third of global GDP budgets are strained and the world public sector deficit is close to 4 trillion a year At the same time governments are struggling to meet citizens rising expectations Satisfaction with key state services such as public transportation schools and healthcare facilities is less than half that of nonstate providers such as banks or utilities Governments need a way to deliver better outcomes and a better experience for citizens at a sustainable cost A new paper by the McKinsey Center for Government MCG Government productivity Unlocking the 3 5 trillion opportunity suggests that goal is within reach It shows that several countries have achieved dramatic productivity improvements in recent years for example by improving health public safety and education outcomes while maintaining or even reducing spending per capita or per student in those sectors If other countries were to match the improvements already demonstrated in these pockets of excellence the world s governments could potentially save as much as 3 5 trillion a year by 2021 equivalent to the entire global fiscal gap Alternatively countries could choose to keep spending constant while boosting the quality of key services For example if all the countries studied had improved the productivity of their healthcare systems at the rate of comparable best performers over the past 5 years they would have added 1 4 years to the healthy life expectancy of their combined populations That translates into 12 billion healthy life years gained without additional per capita spending It s imperative that governments find a way to unlock that productivity opportunity The challenge is that until now there s been limited progress on measuring government productivity even though productivity is a well established and vital measure of the performance of national economies and private sector businesses As a result it is difficult for governments to gauge the true return on spending and debate is often focused on how to increase inputs and not the quality of outputs Governments typically find it challenging to identify improvement opportunities by learning from other countries or from other regions or sectors within the same country To help close this gap MCG built a comprehensive database and benchmarking methodology the Government Productivity Scope to start to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of government expenditure MCG applied the tool across 42 countries that together make up 80 percent of global GDP focusing on seven sectors healthcare primary secondary and tertiary education public safety road transport and tax collection The research was supplemented with insights from more than 50 interviews with government leaders and more than 200 case studies This paper presents the first version of MCG s analysis which we will continue to extend and refine in dialogue with government leaders and academic experts The initial findings point to dramatic differences in countries relative productivity Even among comparable countries with very similar outcomes the least efficient government currently spends more than twice as much per unit of output as its most efficient peer And while most countries have struggled to contain spending growth in every sector MCG found examples of governments that have reduced expenditure per unit while experiencing improved outcomes These differences point to a tremendous opportunity for governments to boost productivity save money and achieve better outcomes for citizens To realize that opportunity though governments need to deepen their functional capabilities in four key areas finance commercial digital technology and data analytics and talent management As MCG shows pioneering countries have reimagined and strengthened these functions so they play a more strategic leadership role in pursuing efficiency and improving outcomes Across these areas those governments have adopted an ambitious structured approach to transform the effectiveness of the state Please sign in to print or download this article Please create a profile to

represents the biggest leap forward in terms of work productivity since the personal computer and few other industries can benefit from AI as much as government With AI we can change the way government works and help employees do their job better AI is already integrated into numerous cloud platforms and can be used to discover new information and deliver outcomes instantly I like to refer to this as practical AI AI has the potential to improve employee experiences by speeding up decision making and automating mundane and repetitive tasks Bringing machine learning to everyday work enables government agencies and departments to make better decisions faster because they do not have to hunt for data and aggregate it into a spreadsheet By building intelligence into platforms AI helps manage complex workflows and allows organizations to One way that AI will be applied in the workplace is automating service requests Most companies have an IT service desk as well as a customer support center These functions ensure that customers and employees receive help in a timely manner whether it is a request for a new computer a password reset or the status of a repair Manually triaging thousands of incidents or cases categorizing tasks and routing work can consume resources introduce human error and slow resolution In fact a new report from Accenture found that customer support functions spend up to 12 percent of their time categorizing prioritizing and assigning tickets Meanwhile AI accurately categorizes requests nearly instantly It eliminates the bottleneck created by agents having to manually assign categorize and route requests A full two days a week is wasted on manual administrative work according to the recent State of Work survey conducted by ServiceNow If an agency with 5 000 people automated those processes they could get 4 million work hours back a year Adding AI frees up employees to do the work they want to do spurring creativity Nearly half of respondents 48 percent said work levels increased by 20 percent or more after they adopted AI solutions Additionally 91 percent of executives say their skilled employees spend too much time on admin tasks and 93 percent believe that reducing mundane tasks unleashes employee creativity To properly implement AI solutions across government agencies we need to define which tasks are best suited for humans and which ones should be performed by AI The government has a term inherently governmental to describe work processes or decisions that must be done by government employees Contractors do much of the work in our government agencies but certain work is inherently governmental in nature As we move into an age defined by AI we need to identify and define the work processes and decisions that are inherently human We are going to increasingly work in a blended workplace with AI systems and humans working together to achieve a mission There are certain activities within any work environment that can only be performed or should only be performed by humans While there may be many more human activities designated as inherently human in the beginning I believe that as humans become more comfortable with the role of AI in the blended workforce less and less work will be designated as inherently human There will always be a need for humans to remain in charge from factual responsibility and liability aspects as well as from emotional and psychological ones We spend a third of our lives at work It shapes who we are how we feel and how we interact with the world so we must create great work experiences and this is what AI does AI creates work experiences that unleash productivity bringing out the best in us Rather than fearing machines stealing jobs we need to understand how AI will change the way government works though small but practical ways and prepare the workforce of the future for this change About the AuthorBob Osborn is CTO Federal of

for our newsletter I agree to this site s Privacy Policy Thank you for inviting me to speak with you here today In particular I want to thank the Productivity Commission and all involved in the Productivity Hub The previous presenters today have touched on a range of ideas for how we can face the challenge of improving our productivity in a changing world From technology and data to public services and the energy transition I m excited to see forward thinking people working on such a broad range of important topics I d like to commend you all and encourage you to keep up the good work My presentation today will focus on an issue that is at the heart of a productive economy how we approach the rapidly changing world of work I want to talk about how this fits with the overall economic strategy of the Government the core policy areas that we have identified to support New Zealanders in this process and the institutional settings required to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of the Future of Work Economic StrategyBy harnessing the potential of new technology and innovation educating and upskilling our workforce and incentivising research and development we can lift productivity and transition to an economy that is sustainable inclusive and productive That is this Government s overarching economic aim The lessons learned from the Future of Work Commission heavily influenced this Government s economic strategy We aim to shape an economy where we work smarter make better use of our resources ensure everyone who wants to work can work and ensure that the benefits of growth are spread across society In an article published this past weekend Rod Oram argued that we can rise to the immense challenge of making this a high value high wage economy over the next decade The global and local conditions for doing so are the most favourable ever I know there is an appetite among businesses and workers to take up this challenge and I couldn t agree more that the time is right to face up to this Boosting productivity across the economy will be one of the key drivers to improving New Zealanders living standards and wellbeing The Government will put this at the heart of what we do Our focus on lifting wellbeing will require a different approach and different measures of success We want to take a broader view of success and move beyond simple measures such as GDP which while an important measure of economic output does not tell the full story of peoples wellbeing We are working with our Confidence and Supply partner the Green Party on new sustainable development indicators to paint a fuller picture of how well off people are and how the Government can focus its resources best I have also instructed the Treasury to accelerate their work on the Living Standards Framework which measures the impact of policies on four capitals Human Social Natural and Financial Physical I intend to use this framework to inform the Budget process for Budget 2019 making it our first ever Wellbeing Budget By placing wellbeing at the heart of what we do we will be able to measure the extent to which our policies and investments are making real improvements to peoples lives Improving productivity is key to improving wellbeing By producing more from every hour worked businesses become more profitable incomes rise and workers wellbeing rises as time is freed up and purchasing power rises The challenge is how we achieve this The Changing World of WorkThis Government has come into office at an interesting time in New Zealand s economic story Technological advances are transforming our world for example through increased processing power and big data sensors remote work or smart devices The full effect of forces such as automation algorithms and globalisation are not yet known but we do know that they already are and will continue to be disruptive to what only 5 or 10 years ago we considered the status quo My thinking on this topic was shaped by the Future of Work Commission which I chaired for the Labour Party when we were in Opposition It was an ambitious undertaking that saw us engage with thousands of New Zealanders and experts from around the world It is hard to distil that work down to a few points but overall my takeaway is that there is an enormous possibility for us to have productive and fulfilling work over the coming decades But it will only happen if we prepare now We are facing a world where the change has been estimated by McKinsey Global Institute to be occurring at ten times the pace of the Industrial Revolution and 300 times the scale or roughly 3 000 times the impact Every aspect of our working lives is changing Whole jobs are disappearing and almost every job is being re shaped The very notion of what a job is has been challenged by the so called gig economy Advances in technology present both challenges and opportunities for this sometimes all at once For example a company which automates production of its products will experience productivity gains but there might be consequences for the company s workers What happens to those who are laid off How well positioned are they to quickly retrain Could their past training help them swiftly move into other work How can we benefit from changes to the nature of work while negating or limiting the disadvantages We cannot say with any certainty exactly what the world of work will look like but there are some core changes we can identify and the responses to them that are needed This represents both challenges and opportunities How we respond will drive the future of New Zealand s economy and shape how productive sustainable and inclusive our growth will be over the next few decades We all know the story of the New Zealand economy Over the past 20 years New Zealand has generally done well in the creating more part of the productivity equation GDP growth has averaged about 2 8 over that time compared to the OECD average of 2 1 But it s the other part of the equation the resources required to create more where we have been weak Of that headline growth about 1 7 can be attributed to growth in the volume of labour input or simply total hours worked In other words we required strong population growth and more people entering the workforce to ensure more hours were worked in order to increase production More people working is not a recipe for long term sustainable and inclusive growth The portion of that growth which can be attributed to getting more from each unit of labour in producing goods and services has been 1 1 of that 2 8 over the past 20 years that is we are one of the weaker performers in the OECD In fact our relatively low labour productivity growth over a long period of time means the level of labour productivity in New Zealand GDP per hour worked is about 20 below the OECD average The Productivity Commission has told us that New Zealand s shallow capital markets have meant low levels of investment of productive capital the stuff we need to invest in to help us create more from our available resources Our investment in non residential capital per person in the labour force in 2016 was 25 lower than the OECD average In order to get ahead in terms of headline growth we relied on more people coming here to work and those who were already here to enter work We are at a point where the level of labour productivity in New Zealand GDP per hour worked is around 30 below Australia We have to do something different In recent years the main growth drivers have been population growth and a run away housing market That is not a sustainable path and as those forces recede we need to move deliberately and with urgency to establish an economy that is based on a thriving productive sector We also have to ensure that the benefits of this growth translate into meaningful improvements to the living standards of many New Zealanders who missed out in recent years I spoke earlier about our Government s emphasis on wellbeing and delivering higher living standards for all New Zealanders We want to ensure the economy is delivering real benefits to peoples lives rather than simply pursuing growth for the sake of growth Our success in achieving this will largely be determined by how we respond to the challenges we face including New Zealand s productivity challenge With this in mind today I want to talk you through this Government s plan to ensure we are prepared to face the changes that are coming due to technological advances and the changing nature of work In responding to this our Future of Work report identified three core values to drive our response We need to be Inclusive offering opportunity and harnessing the talents of all Resilient to deal with the changes and shocks that are coming our way and Adaptable to be leaders of the change and shape it in line with our values There are a huge range of policy approaches and changes to the way we run our economy that are needed to meet these challenges and take the opportunities that will arise Our Tax Working Group and the reforms we are making to the Reserve Bank Act are an important part of setting the path to a more productive economy That focus on improving productivity is at the heart of the terms of reference for both these reviews Beyond these we had more than 63 recommendations in our report and you will be pleased I am not going to go through them all now I want to touch on just a few of the main themes Just TransitionIn the face of this rapid change it is essential that we have a just transition for those most affected We saw in New Zealand in the 1980s and 1990s the damage that can be done when major changes are made without enough thought or support given to those who face the immediate consequences In this instance I am using that phrase to primarily talk about two things one at a system level the other at a practical on the ground level The government has committed itself to the goal of a net zero carbon economy by 2050 This is an essential shift for New Zealand away from an economy that hastens climate change to one that is more sustainable and develops New Zealand s strategic advantages We will need to ensure this is a just transition where affected industries and communities are given the support to find new sustainable growth opportunities We are in the process of establishing an Independent Climate Commission which will have the job of establishing goals and targets Meanwhile under the leadership of Hon James Shaw a Green Investment Fund is being created to leverage private sector investment to support business developments that will support a low carbon economy Innovation science and research will have significant roles to play in this However New Zealand s total investment in Research and Development is only 1 3 of GDP about half the OECD average When the OECD issued its most recent assessment of the New Zealand economy last year this is what it had to say on R D Expenditure on R D is low as a share of GDP most notably in the business sector Collaboration between firms education and research institutions is low And its advice Increase fiscal support for business research and development Maintain or increase long term support for successful collaboration between research institutions and industry In the Coalition Agreement with New Zealand First we have set a target of hitting an R D spend of 2 of GDP in ten years That s more than a 50 increase in R D investment relative to GDP over that time and will make a significant contribution to improving our productivity Officials say that this is an ambitious goal We believe this can be done with the Government incentivising such vital work by the private sector Minister for Research Science and Innovation Megan Woods has already begun work on overhauling New Zealand s R D regime with Ministers set to discuss officials initial findings later this month We are committed in the first instance to restoring R D tax credits to give firms some certainty about their investments One other key investment identified in our Future of Work programme is in direct support of the technology sector and for businesses to make better use of new technology Research by Swedish academic and technologist Goran Roos found that 55 of New Zealand jobs are at risk due to technological advances and that countries likely to be least affected will be those with the highest levels of economic complexity This is just one of the reasons why it is important for us to diversify our skills base and look for more sustainable drivers of growth By putting the right policies and incentives in place the technology sector can be one of those economic drivers While technological advances present challenges to existing jobs we also have the opportunity to create new forms of work According to NZTech chief executive Graeme Muller only 14 percent of large NZ businesses have deployed any enabling technology for the Internet of Things despite 70 percent believing it will be strategically important for their business to do so Their concerns are largely around costs and changes in technology This Government wants to nurture an environment that gives businesses the confidence to take up new technology Minister Clare Curran is in the process of creating the position of Chief Technology Officer CTO who will report directly to the Prime Minister and Cabinet The CTO will be responsible for introducing and managing a National Digital Architecture and Digital Technology Roadmap They will also work with the wider industry to develop ingenuity and creativity in the ICT sector Our aim is for the ICT industry to be our second largest contributor to GDP by 2025 Learning For LifeThe other critical element of a just transition to this new world of work is how we support people to gain the relevant skills and knowledge We need to both support those workers whose jobs are under threat and prepare those who are yet to start working for the kind of labour market they are likely to enter New Zealand currently spends a fraction of what other countries do on active labour market policies Other countries around the world such as Singapore France and Germany have recognised that they need to both plan ahead for the changes but also provide greater support for people who are displaced by technological change The Future of Work was the catalyst for our three years free training and education policy One of this Government s key policies is to provide one year of free post secondary education or training gradually progressing to 3 years by 2025 In 2018 we will see 30 000 students enrolled in tertiary education courses and 50 000 in industry training without paying fees for their first year of education thanks to this policy This is extremely important for those whose jobs or future jobs are affected by automation and other technologies One aspect of this policy has not had a lot of attention which is for adults who have never trained or studied before They will be able to take up the three years free policy as it is rolled out This can be taken in short bursts or as complete re training This policy also covers the costs of those undertaking apprenticeships and aspects of industry training Because of the relative costs from 2018 this means two years free for apprentices right away For the next generation of people entering the workforce it is essential they are given the skills to be resilient and adaptable In the Future of Work Commission s time we heard from employer after employer that they were looking for people with what we once called soft skills the ability to collaborate be creative and solve problems These ideas lie at the heart of New Zealand s education curriculum but there is work to do to ensure they are developed for all our young people We will be embarking on a host of initiatives to see this happen including reform of our careers advice and guidance in schools to give all young people the opportunity to understand and experience the world of work This will be developed in close cooperation with business and training providers to create a more seamless transition from school to whatever comes next In January Employment Minister Willie Jackson announced the first of a series of initiatives to help give a group of young people who have fallen outside of the system sustainable work opportunities Sadly Maori and Pacifika young people are over represented among this group They are the most at risk of being excluded from the future of work and we need practical programmes that provide work experience to get them back into a training journey In the long term I believe we will need to radically alter the way we think about training and learning and work if we are to continue to lift productivity As the pace of technological change picks up we need to see ourselves as genuinely learning for life In many ways jobs will be events on that learning and training journey rather than the other way around This presents a series of challenges and opportunities for our education and training system that we will look at over the coming years There are of course many other areas of policy response that will contribute to our response to the Future of Work but I wanted to finish today on what systemic changes we will need to ensure we are leading the change rather than being passive recipients of it Active and Capable StateA critical element identified in our Future of Work report is that the state needs to be an active participant in how we shape the future of work It is important to note that by active I do not mean that it controls or dictates what happens but rather that we move beyond the tired and dangerous idea that we can simply leave the response to market forces to decide how New Zealand fares in the future world of work This means working alongside businesses to identify opportunities as noted above in the R and D and Tech sectors for example It means developing a new partnership between the Crown and Maori as the settlement of historic Treaty breaches comes to an end and opportunities for economic development emerge It also means being innovative and entrepreneurial when that is appropriate We are wanting public servants to co design with both politicians and the wider community what we can do to stay ahead of the curve A major example of this is the Provincial Growth Fund developed as part of our coalition agreement with New Zealand First This will see significant investments in the regions of New Zealand to grow sustainable and productive job opportunities The details of the Fund are to be released shortly and will provide some of the most significant development of our regions in decades These will be driven from the ground up with the Government as an active partner A New Social PartnershipIt is my strong belief that the most critical element to New Zealand succeeding in the Future of Work is a renewed social partnership between businesses workers and the government In the course of our Commission we saw examples in both large and small businesses of innovative approaches to this idea Air New Zealand s High Performance Engagement model is one useful example By involving workers in the full range of strategic decisions and change processes Air New Zealand has not only seen significant productivity benefits they have created far more harmonious workplace relations In a number of the new smaller technology businesses we have seen flat management structures and workplace democracy in action that is core to the way they run their businesses These companies give a significant voice to their employees and have seen productivity growth and improved workplace relations as a result We are working with MBIE and others to facilitate these approaches across a range of industries We can also see innovations happening in the way we work An example which has grabbed attention recently is Perpetual Guardian s decision to switch to trial a four day working week for five days pay The move was designed to improve workers wellbeing by giving them more time to spend with family and on other aspects of life with the expectation that this will enhance their productivity during the days they do work the same levels of output for fewer hours worked These are the kinds of practices that we need to see more of If we look at Germany as an example union members often sit on company boards as part of the decision making process ensuring that employee wellbeing is considered alongside high level corporate profit and financial targets It is unsurprising then that German workers on average worked the fewest hours annually in 2016 of all OECD countries with New Zealand workers on average doing 400 more hours every year This is possible because Germany s workers are also some of the most productive in the world I want to see New Zealand reach a point where we are able to work 400 fewer hours a year while producing more than we do today For us to get there we need to make the advances in productivity we have been discussing today Technological improvements will play a huge role in this One of my goals as Minister of Finance is to develop this new partnership at a system wide level to promote a combined work stream on how we can apply these lessons to other industries and sectors My parting challenge to the many public servants here today is to think about how we can do this across Government and break down some of the silos we have created to enable businesses and workers and their representatives to easily engage in such a partnership ConclusionI am most certainly not the first New Zealand politician to both highlight the challenge of low productivity nor to say that we will address it So the proof will be in what we actually do But we are in an environment that has change occurring at a pace and scale we have never seen before We have to take the opportunity now to capitalise on that to finally make the leaps that have so far eluded our country We have already made a start with the initiatives I have mentioned today I want us to re write our productivity story so that New Zealand becomes a leading example of a sustainable and productive economy in which everyone gets a share of economic success We have a long way to go but this Government is committed to tackling the long term challenges that this country has faced for many years I look forward to working with you on this journey Thank you Desktop notifications are on Turn offGet breaking news alerts from The Washington PostTurn on desktop notifications Take a look around the typical home or car today and you can see the impact of digital technology on your everyday activities Organizations of all kinds are using new technologies to deliver game changing products and services impacting all levels of society As more parts of our lives take on digital characteristics it s time to take advantage of computing power that can simplify the relationship between humans and technology to make us all more productive That s where artificial intelligence comes in using computing power to automate routine tasks and provide insights that improve productivity for individuals and organizations While AI is being rapidly applied for commercial use it s also being adopted by government agencies making them more efficient and effective in their missions Working side by side the human AI partnership can handle the challenges of our increasingly data driven economy while enabling innovation that enhances and broadens current mission capabilities Simply put AI is a collection of advanced technologies that lets computers sense understand act and learn more like humans When agencies successfully apply AI models to their data and procedures they can improve productivity reduce risk serve citizens better and free up employees to work on more creative and complex jobs AI takes advantage of vast amounts of available data programming languages that mimic human logic advanced math and the use of smaller cheaper and more powerful electronics to mimic and even improve on human judgment and analysis This all happens at blazing speeds How does it work Here s one example Think about how our world is increasingly connected by hundreds of millions of sensors cameras and mobile devices through the internet It s possible to train AI to analyze that fire hose of incoming data model our multilayered human thought process to interpret images see patterns and report aberrations with superhuman speed and great precision It s not just number crunching It s the application of human like logic to understand data and to improve that logical thinking process over time through repetitive learning All around the federal government AI is making an impact One example the U S Department of Health and Human Services has investigated the use of machine learning and natural language processing two important AI components to become more efficient in processing incoming comments from the public about its regulations Its findings potential savings of up to 300 000 employee hours and millions of dollars annually AI lets you do more with less or broaden your mission with the same resources It will be commonplace within a couple of years said Ira Entis managing director of strategic solutions of Accenture Federal Services The U S Citizenship and Immigration Services has deployed EMMA an AI powered conversational interface that acts as a virtual assistant It s a tool that uses perception planning memory and reasoning to answer plain English questions that come into the agency and guide visitors in either English or Spanish to the right spots on the agency s website This is AI as the UI It s a new way to interact with the agency and it extends the agency s capability 24 7 Every citizen facing agency can employ a similar interface and if they do we ll realize a huge improvement in customer service across the government said Dominic Delmolino chief technology officer of Accenture Federal Services So is AI smart enough to make us humans obsolete No but AI models can seamlessly integrate with the experience workers are already having augmenting manual processes as an assistant reading and understanding forms helping with data entry and making guided recommendations that can reduce errors and even remove potential bias As AI enables analysis of dauntingly vast amounts of data it can help employees achieve significant productivity gains of up to 30 or 40 percent according to Accenture research even with tasks that are already automated AI opens up new approaches for delivering services Instead of requiring a workforce to plow through routine work that low hanging fruit is swept away so they can be more creative in applying techniques or mission processes to achieve their goals in new ways said Delmolino I see AI as a productivity booster There may be some lingering concern about AI taking jobs but that s not really the issue AI is going to help agencies accomplish the totality of their missions more efficiently and effectively The reason those people took those jobs in the first place was to serve the public and execute the mission of their agency AI puts them closer to that mission said Entis AI unlocks the trapped value of data and applies advanced analytics to large data sets to predict trends and deliver new insights It can do so in an unbiased and consistent manner offering transparency and increasing citizens trust that their data is being used responsibly on their behalf Automating routine processes and providing transparent guidance and advice to citizens with helpful AI facilitates a better experience with public services now and in the future For decades we ve had to adapt our human behavior and think like computers to get them to do what we need them to do With AI computers are increasingly able to think like us and adapt to our needs among them the need to be responsible and attentive to objectivity and trustworthiness said Delmolino Ultimately the role of AI is to transform the relationship between people and machines improving how we live and work as individuals and a society Just as the introduction of computer technology in the past has helped government employees work better smarter and faster AI offers those employees new tools to help them make decisions more efficiently and effectively said Biniam Gebre managing director of management consulting for Accenture Federal Services We ll use AI to reinvent processes and remove not only time and distance constraints but also human limitations AI processes will improve themselves as they work combining data in fresh ways to unlock new ideas AI technology is less of a tool and more of a partner a smart fast and indefatigable helper that makes it possible for everyone to do better and more meaningful work Below are terms that are key to understanding

Harnessing the power of AI Source Why Artificial Intelligence is the Future of Growth Accenture 2016 Productivity growth in the United States and other advanced economies has slowed sharply over the past decade If this slowdown persists it will mean more slowly rising living standards and more difficult fiscal challenges What public policies might quicken the pace of productivity growth in the U S We put that question recently to a panel of experts convened by the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy and the Initiative on Business and Public Policy Here are some of their suggestions One solution to the productivity slowdown on which there was broad consensus was the need to enhance competition Competition promotes productivity growth through increased incentives for innovation and through selection If firms have strong incentives to innovate many productivity boosting innovations will come to market Also when only the firms with the highest productivity survive while the least productive firms are forced to exit the market the average productivity will go up Jonathan Baker a lawyer and economist who teaches at American University s Washington College of Law believes that there is room to improve competition in the U S economy Market power is a problem in the U S economy it s plausible that growing market power has contributed to the productivity slowdown he explains Competition can be increased in a number of ways including by strengthening antitrust enforcement and by reforming the patent system so that patents are not used to shut out potential competitors while providing enough incentives for firms to invest in developing innovations Bronwyn Hall emerita professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley suggested that in some industries it s currently too easy to get a patent Most of us who look closely at the patent system think that the requirement for novelty is a little too low And so we do think there s room for reform in the patent area Occupational licensing is another area that might have room for improving competition There s been tremendous growth in this country in occupational licensing requirements And that s got to harm entry barriers and make it hard for people to move in and out of occupations And it s not just doctors it s things like cosmetologists a whole range of jobs says Baker It also is important to avoid policies that might stifle productivity Some of such policies have been popular in this year s political campaign If you think about the ongoing political campaign the policies that have been given a lot of attention include things like restrictions on trade and immigration These are not the kinds of policies you want to think about if you re going to think about enhancing productivity says Robert Barro a Harvard University economist Policies to increase the skills of the workforce are essential to raising productivity as well Isabel Sawhill a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution argued that policies that increase years of schooling might not be enough She stressed the importance of ensuring that those years of schooling actually translate into skills and knowledge She noted that more than two thirds of young adults today would fail to quality for military service because of lack of education drug addiction jail records and other shortcomings which also suggests that they may not have the capabilities to be very productive in the workplace Improving the allocation of funding to research and development is another area that might improve prospects for productivity growth over the long run Hall pointed out that the allocation of federal funding for basic science R D is skewed towards life sciences and argued that this isn t a great strategy We can t tell now what field of science will be useful in the future It s just like the stock market And so all we can do is have a portfolio that is more balanced in the basic science

Lubin 2018Finally economist Brad DeLong of the University of California at Berkeley suggested that policy focus on low hanging fruit those industries that subtract value from our economy rather than add to it One example of such a value subtracting industry is healthcare administration he believes Our doctors nurses and pharmacists do wonderful things but as Princeton s Uwe Reinhart likes to say you do the national income accounting and our healthcare administrators are about one eight as productive as German health care professionals because they re all working against each other either

06 2017Vice Chairman Stanley FischerAt the Washington Transformation Politics Policies Prospects a forum sponsored by the Summer Institute of Martha s Vineyard Hebrew Center Vineyard Haven MassachusettsI want to talk tonight about labor productivity growth Labor productivity is the amount of goods and services produced per hour spent on the job Increases in labor productivity again that s the amount of goods and services produced per hour on the job are a fundamental factor in determining how fast the economy grows and how fast the average standard of living grows And productivity growth can be influenced by government policy about which I also want to say a few words 1Labor productivity growth varies a lot from year to year but it is possible to discern longer historical periods with high or low productivity growth as shown in figure 1 For example labor productivity rose at an average annual rate of 3 1 4 percent from 1948 to 1973 whereas in the period 1974 to 2016 the average growth rate of productivity was about 1 7 percent That is to say that with the important exception of the information technology IT boom beginning in the mid 1990s the U S economy has been in a low productivity growth period since 1974 The record for the past five years has been particularly dismal How much does productivity growth matter A great deal The person who made that clear in an article published in 1957 60 years ago Professor Robert Solow is here tonight That is a pleasure an honor a joy and something of a difficulty for anyone wanting to talk about productivity and its growth in the presence of the master The reason the rate of productivity growth matters so much is that it is a basic determinant of the rate of growth of average income per capita over long periods 2 To understand that one needs to know only the trick of calculating how long it takes for a growing economy to double A good rule of thumb for calculating the time it takes labor productivity or anything else that is growing to double can be calculated by dividing 70 by the growth rate When labor productivity was growing at 3 1 4 percent per year during the 25 years from 1948 to 1973 it took 22 years for labor productivity to double Looking again at Figure 1 in the 42 years from 1974 to 2016 when labor productivity was growing on average at a rate of 1 3 4 percent it would have taken approximately 41 years for labor productivity to double There is a vast difference between the prospects facing the young in an economy where incomes per capita are doubling every 22 years and an economy in which incomes are on average doubling only every 41 years Now productivity statistics are imperfect in many respects for example capturing the value of the seemingly free apps we use on our smartphones is challenging And many of us who live in the modern age cannot believe that the iPhone has not fundamentally changed our lives It has certainly changed our lives to some extent and there is likely some underestimation of productivity growth in the official data But to figure out whether the current degree of data bias has reduced estimated growth we have to ask not whether there is bias but whether the bias has increased To a first approximation one could assume that the rate of bias is constant and does not account for the estimated decline in productivity growth and that we should not dismiss the slowdown as an artifact of measurement difficulties3 That is the conclusion most researchers reach but the data issue is not settled As Bob Solow famously said just before the increase in productivity growth of 1996 2003 the computer is everywhere except in the growth data And there are serious researchers who have made serious arguments that we will soon be seeing more rapid growth in the productivity data Factors determining productivity growth Clearly a key question for economic forecasters and even more so for U S citizens and indeed for the entire global economy is whether we should anticipate a return of the more rapid productivity gains experienced in the IT boom and for the quarter century after the end of World War II or should instead resign ourselves to tepid economic growth in future years And a central policy issue is whether government policies can help push the economy toward a higher productivity regime In this context it is useful to think of labor productivity growth as coming from three sources as shown in figure 2 First greater investment by firms in tangible equipment and structures as well as intangible investments such as software and product designs raise labor productivity Second improvements in labor quality or the capabilities of the workforce contribute as well through education training and experience Finally innovations yield more or better output from the same inputs the same capital and labor such as the introduction of the assembly line and computer aided product design I will consider the role that policy may play through each of these channels It is noteworthy that most of the recent drop in productivity is due to a lower contribution from innovation although weaker investment has played a role as well The contribution to labor productivity from labor quality has changed very little Innovation Our prospects for further significant technological innovations are hotly debated Some observers believe that we have exhausted the low hanging fruit on the productivity tree and in particular that efficiency gains from the use of IT have run their course 4 Other observers argue that we can reach fruit higher on the tree with each passing year These observers believe that innovation yields better tools such as 3 D printers and genetic sequencing equipment which themselves enable further technological advances 5 For what it is worth I believe the early signs of self driving cars the emergence of disease treatments based on genetics and the falling costs for conventional and alternative energy production suggest that we are continuing to innovate both in IT as well as in other parts of the economy One possibility is that we are in a productivity lull while firms reorganize to exploit the latest innovations it took decades before the full benefits of the steam engine electrification and computers were seen 6One way to ensure the vigor of innovation is to support research and development R D and here the recent record is mixed As shown in figure 3 R D spending in the United States softened during the Great Recession R D funded by U S businesses has since recovered However government funded R D as a share of gross domestic product is at the lowest level in recent history A great deal of the R in overall R D is government funded and not tied to a specific commercial goal The applied research built on this basic research ultimately yields productivity gains far into the future 7 Consequently the decline in government funded R D is disturbing To raise productivity and economic well being firms must adopt innovations that emerge from R D as quickly as possible This adjustment may occur as start ups introduce innovation to the market as existing innovative firms expand or as competing firms imitate the innovators Recent research suggests that all three of these channels which reflect the economic dynamism of businesses have been operating sluggishly of late New firms are not created as often as in the past innovative firms are not hiring or investing as aggressively as they once did and the diffusion of innovations is weak from frontier firms to trailing firms 8It is difficult to pinpoint specific policy actions that would address this decline in dynamism Broadly speaking however government policymakers should carefully consider the effects of regulations and tax policy on the free flow of workers capital and ideas Investment In recent years the contribution to labor productivity growth from investment has declined Business fixed investment rose roughly 2 1 2 percent per year on average from 2004 to 2016 compared with about 5 percent from 1996 to 2003 9 Some bright spots do exist Capital expenditure by leading IT companies Google Amazon and the like has soared since 2010 and investment in the energy sector has returned to life Nevertheless firms as a whole seem reluctant to invest This cautious approach to investment may in part reflect uncertainty about the policy environment By one measure U S policy uncertainty was elevated for much of the recovery subsided in 2013 and then rose again late last year underpinned by uncertainty about policies associated with health care regulation taxes and trade 10 Reasonable people can disagree about the right way forward on each of those issues but mitigating the damping effect of uncertainty by providing more clarity on the future direction of government policy is highly desirable particularly if the direction of policy itself is desirable Government investment can be an important source of productivity growth as well For example the interstate highway system is credited with boosting productivity in the 1950s and 1960s 11 That highway system and many other federally supported roadways waterways and structures have been neglected in recent years Indeed real infrastructure spending that is adjusting for inflation has fallen nearly 1 percent per year since 2005 12 This area of government investment deserves more attention Labor Quality Also important to raising labor productivity is investment in human capital workers knowledge and skills Such investment is a particular issue because most forecasts anticipate that the long rise in educational attainment both for college and high school may soon come to an end One area where policy may play a role is promoting educational access and readiness for groups for whom educational attainment is relatively low Recent research has shown a substantial return to public investment in early childhood education for economically disadvantaged groups Such programs increase high school graduation promote income over the life cycle for both participants and their parents and produce other socially beneficial outcomes such as greater health 13At the other end of the education process a college degree has long been considered a worthwhile investment and thus our society should promote access to and readiness for college among a broad range of individuals in particular through federal support for need based financial aid 14Lastly I will note that ultimately the return on the human capital embodied in our workforce is closely tied to public health A rise in morbidity or fall in longevity in the U S population is not a concern only for humanitarian reasons Workers too ill to perform at their potential represent lost productivity and welfare for society as a whole Research has shown just such a trend among prime age non Hispanic Americans without a college degree 15 More study is needed to determine what policies would help reverse this trend and government funding could likely assist the effort More broadly programs to promote clean air and drinking water are examples of public health policies that bolster the health and longevity of the present and future workforce as a whole Concluding remarks To conclude we return to the basic question How much does productivity growth matter The basic answer simple arithmetic says it matters a lot If labor productivity grows an average of 2 percent per year average living standards for our children s generation will be twice what we experienced If labor productivity grows an average of 1 percent per year the difference is dramatic Living standards will take two generations to double 16But fortunately when it comes to productivity we are not simply consigned to luck or to fate Governments can take sensible actions to promote more rapid productivity growth Broadly speaking government policy works best when it can address a need that the private sector neglects including investment in basic research infrastructure early childhood education schooling and public health Reasonable people can disagree about the right way forward but if we as a society are to succeed we need to follow policies that will support and advance productivity growth That is easier said than done But it can be done References

VersionBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System20th Street and Constitution Avenue N W Washington DC 20551The differences in rates of growth are often attributed to two factors government and entrepreneurship The two are not mutually exclusive In the early stages of sustained growth government has often provided the incentives for entrepreneurship to take hold In some economies the development of transportation power and other utilities has been carried out by the government In others the government has offered financial inducements and subsidies The land given U S railroad developers in the second half of the 19th century is a notable example of the latter Another important role governments have played in the early stages is to help establish the sort of capital and money markets in which lenders could have confidence Without financial intermediaries acting as brokers between lenders and business borrowers it is difficult to envisage economic growth taking place on a sustained and rapid basis In the 19th century most liberal thinkers held that the main role for government in a developed capitalist system was that of a policeman to preserve law and order uphold the sanctity of private property and give business as much freedom as possible The Great Depression of the 1930s persuaded many that a laissez faire system did not automatically provide the necessary incentives to the innovation and risk bearing essential for economic growth This led to a good deal of writing on the role that governments might play in stimulating growth Economists have argued that at the very least governments can undertake to prevent serious and prolonged recessions Only in this way can a general business psychology be developed that assumes growth to be the natural course of things so that investment programs will pay off Growth theorists since World War II have gone further arguing that it is not enough simply to achieve full employment periodically Some maintain that it is necessary to maintain full employment over an extended period of time if high growth is to result This argument relates to the earlier point that two economies may experience the same rate of growth of capital but that overall growth and technical progress will proceed at a much more rapid rate in one than in the other because of differences in the quality of new capital goods produced The term enterprise investment has been used to describe the kind of capital formation that involves innovations and that by building ahead of demand generates rapid rates of growth of productivity or technical progress But to get such growth it has been argued an economy must be run flat out at full speed While this has been subject to some dispute there is a fairly general consensus that growth will be faster when unemployment fluctuates within a narrow range and at low levels A variation on this argument is the question of how a government may intervene to determine the distribution of output between those types of expenditure that contribute to growth and those that lead to the immediate satisfaction of consumer demand Here the choice lies between business investment research and education on the one hand and consumption on the other The larger the first three the more rapid will be the rate of growth Governments giving a high priority to growth have various means at their disposal for influencing it Consumption can and has been constrained through increases in income tax rates The same is true of other tax rates such as the property tax the chief revenue source for primary and secondary education in the United States Tax credit for research and development expenditures is a common method for encouraging business outlays that may lead to innovations The same method has been used to stimulate business investment outlays Easy money policies on the part of the central bank whereby the cost of borrowed funds and their availability are indirectly regulated in such a way as to encourage business borrowing may lead to higher levels of real investment The true cost of stimulating growth will always be a temporary cut in current consumption Only in the future can the economic benefits of the higher investment be realized By the same token current consumption can always be enlarged by a neglect of the future It is even possible for current production to be so biased toward the satisfaction of immediate needs that the productive capacity of an economy slowly declines as capital goods are not replaced Between the extremes of total neglect of future generations and the paring down of current consumption to a bare subsistence minimum lie an infinite number of possibilities The belief that governments should have a large say in choosing the right rate of growth has also led some writers to challenge the social and economic value of economic growth in an advanced industrial society They attribute to growth such undesirable side effects of industrialization as traffic congestion the increasing pollution of air and water the despoiling of the landscape and a general decline in man s ability to enjoy the real amenities of life As has been seen growth is really a transformation whereby certain industries experience a rise in importance followed by an eventual decline as the market for their output becomes relatively saturated Demand relatively speaking moves on to other types of industries and products All of this naturally implies a reallocation of resources over time The faster these resources move other things being equal the more rapidly can growth and transformation proceed The argument can be recast in terms of this transformation A slower rate of growth in per capita consumption will slow down the rate of transfer of resources but it may also result in a more livable environment The rate of growth of individual welfare so measured as to take into account non consumable amenities may even be increased Some argue that in a growth oriented society wants are created faster than the industrial machine can satisfy them so that people are more dissatisfied and insecure than they would be if growth were not given such a high value It is held by some critics that in modern industrial society consumption exists for the sake of justifying production rather than production being carried out to satisfy consumer desires These arguments are a powerful challenge to those who see growth as the most important economic goal of a modern society In discussing theories of growth a distinction must be made between theories designed to explain growth or the lack of growth in countries that are already developed and those concerned with countries trapped in circumstances of poverty Most of what follows will be confined to the former As the British economist John Maynard Keynes pointed out in the 1930s saving and investment are not usually done by the same persons The desire to save does not necessarily generate investment If savers attempt to save a larger share of their income than before thereby consuming less and if this is not matched by an equal increase in the desire of others to invest total spending will decline A natural reaction on the part of business will be to cut back on production thereby reducing incomes earned in production The final effect may be a cumulative movement downward as total demand becomes insufficient to employ all of the labour force This break in the circular flow of income and expenditure suggests the possibility of a capitalist economy alternately experiencing periods of prolonged and severe unemployment when desired savings at full employment exceed what the economy wishes to invest at full employment and periods of serious inflation when the inequality is reversed This situation had not been the case historically for developed economies until the early 1970s In the following discussion some attention will be paid to the ways in which the various theories of growth account for this important historical fact We welcome suggested improvements to any of our articles You can make it easier for us to review and hopefully

Economic GrowthSustained long term economic growth comes from increases in worker productivity which essentially means how well we do things In other words how efficient is your nation with its time and workers Labor productivity is the value that each employed person creates per unit of his or her input The easiest way to comprehend labor productivity is to imagine a Canadian worker who can make 10 loaves of bread in an hour versus a U S worker who in the same hour can make only two loaves of bread In this fictional example the Canadians are more productive Being more productive essentially means you can do more in the same amount of time This in turn frees up resources to be used elsewhere What determines how productive workers are The answer is pretty intuitive The first determinant of labor productivity is human capital Human capital is the accumulated knowledge from education and experience skills and expertise that the average worker in an economy possesses Typically the higher the average level of education in an economy the higher the accumulated human capital and the higher the labor productivity The second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change Technological change is a combination of invention advances in knowledge and innovation which is putting that advance to use in a new product or service For example the transistor was invented in 1947 It allowed us to miniaturize the footprint of electronic devices and use less power than the tube technology that came before it Innovations since then have produced smaller and better transistors that that are ubiquitous in products as varied as smart phones computers and escalators The development of the transistor has allowed workers to be anywhere with smaller devices These devices can be used to communicate with other workers measure product quality or do any other task in less time improving worker productivity The third factor that determines labor productivity is economies of scale Recall that economies of scale are the cost advantages that industries obtain due to size Read more about economies of scale in Cost and Industry Structure Consider again the case of the fictional Canadian worker who could produce 10 loaves of bread in an hour If this difference in productivity was due only to economies of scale it could be that Canadian workers had access to a large industrial size oven while the U S worker was using a standard residential size oven Now that we have explored the determinants of worker productivity let s turn to how economists measure economic growth and productivity To analyze the sources of economic growth it is useful to think about a production function which is the process of turning economic inputs like labor machinery and raw materials into outputs like goods and services used by consumers A microeconomic production function describes the inputs and outputs of a firm or perhaps an industry In macroeconomics the connection from inputs to outputs for the entire economy is called an aggregate production function Economists construct different production functions depending on the focus of their studies Figure 1 presents two examples of aggregate production functions In the first production function shown in Figure 1 a the output is GDP The inputs in this example are workforce human capital physical capital and technology We discuss these inputs further in the module Components of Economic Growth An economy s rate of productivity growth is closely linked to the growth rate of its GDP per capita although the two are not identical For example if the percentage of the population who holds jobs in an economy increases GDP per capita will increase but the productivity of individual workers may not be affected Over the long term the only way that GDP per capita can grow continually is if the productivity of the average worker rises or if there are complementary increases in capital A common measure of U S productivity per worker is dollar value per hour the worker contributes to the employer s output This measure excludes government workers because their output is not sold in the market and so their productivity is hard to measure It also excludes farming which accounts for only a relatively small share of the U S economy Figure 2 shows an index of output per hour with 2009 as the base year when the index equals 100 The index equaled about 106 in 2014 In 1972 the index equaled 50 which shows that workers have more than doubled their productivity since then According to the Department of Labor U S productivity growth was fairly strong in the 1950s but then declined in the 1970s and 1980s before rising again in the second half of the 1990s and the first half of the 2000s In fact the rate of productivity measured by the change in output per hour worked averaged 3 2 per year from 1950 to 1970 dropped to 1 9 per year from 1970 to 1990 and then climbed back to over 2 3 from 1991 to the present with another modest slowdown after 2001 Figure 3 shows average annual rates of productivity growth averaged over time since 1950 In recent years a controversy has been brewing among economists about the resurgence of U S productivity in the second half of the 1990s One school of thought argues that the United States had developed a new economy based on the extraordinary advances in communications and information technology of the 1990s The most optimistic proponents argue that it would generate higher average productivity growth for decades to come The pessimists on the other hand argue that even five or ten years of stronger productivity growth does not prove that higher productivity will last for the long term It is hard to infer anything about long term productivity trends during the later part of the 2000s because the steep recession of 2008 2009 with its sharp but not completely synchronized declines in output and employment complicates any interpretation While productivity growth was high in 2009 and 2010 around 3 it has slowed down since then Productivity growth is also closely linked to the average level of wages Over time the amount that firms are willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce If a few employers tried to pay their workers less than what those workers produced then those workers would receive offers of higher wages from other profit seeking employers If a few employers mistakenly paid their workers more than what those workers produced those employers would soon end up with losses In the long run productivity per hour is the most important determinant of the average wage level in any economy To learn how to compare economies in this regard follow the steps in the following Work It Out feature The Organization for Economic Co operation and Development OECD tracks data on the annual growth rate of real GDP per hour worked You can find these data on the OECD data webpage Labour productivity growth in the total economy at this website Step 1 Visit the OECD website given above and select two countries to compare Step 2 On the drop down menu Variable select Real GDP Annual Growth in percent and record the data for the countries you have chosen for the five most recent years Step 3 Go back to the drop down menu and select Real GDP per Hour Worked Annual Growth Rate in percent and select data for the same years for which you selected GDP data Step 4 Compare real GDP growth for both countries Table 2 provides an example of a comparison between Australia and Belgium Step 5 Consider the many factors can affect growth For example one factor that may have affected Australia is its isolation from Europe which may have insulated the country from the effects of the global recession In Belgium s case the global recession seems to have had an impact on both GDP and real GDP per hours worked between 2009 and 2013 though productivity does seem to be recovering Nothing is more important for people s standard of living than sustained economic growth Even small changes in the rate of growth when sustained and compounded over long periods of time make an enormous difference in the standard of living Consider Table 3 in which the rows of the table show several different rates of growth in GDP per capita and the columns show different periods of time Assume for simplicity that an economy starts with a GDP per capita of 100 The table then applies the following formula to calculate what GDP will be at the given growth rate in the future For example an economy that starts with a GDP of 100 and grows at 3 per year will reach a GDP of 209 after 25 years that is 100 1 03 25 209 The slowest rate of GDP per capita growth in the table just 1 per year is similar to what the United States experienced during its weakest years of productivity growth The second highest rate 3 per year is close to what the U S economy experienced during the strong economy of the late 1990s and into the 2000s Higher rates of per capita growth such as 5 or 8 per year represent the experience of rapid growth in economies like Japan Korea and China Table 3 shows that even a few percentage points of difference in economic growth rates will have a profound effect if sustained and compounded over time For example an economy growing at a 1 annual rate over 50 years will see its GDP per capita rise by a total of 64 from 100 to 164 in this example However a country growing at a 5 annual rate will see almost the same amount of growth from 100 to 163 over just 10 years Rapid rates of economic growth can bring profound transformation See the following Clear It Up feature on the relationship between compound growth rates and compound interest rates If the rate of growth is 8 young adults starting at age 20 will see the average standard of living in their country more than double by the time they reach age 30 and grow nearly sevenfold by the time they reach age 45 The formula for growth rates of GDP over different periods of time as shown in Figure 2 is exactly the same as the formula for how a given amount of financial savings grows at a certain interest rate over time as presented in Choice in a World of Scarcity Both formulas have the same ingredients Recall that compound interest is interest that is earned on past interest It causes the total amount of financial savings to grow dramatically over time Similarly compound rates of economic growth or the compound growth rate means that the rate of growth is being multiplied by a base that includes past GDP growth with dramatic effects over time For example in 2013 the World Fact Book produced by the Central Intelligence Agency reported that South Korea had a GDP of 1 67 trillion with a growth rate of 2 8 We can estimate that at that growth rate South Korea s GDP will be 1 92 trillion in five years If we apply the growth rate to each year s ending GDP for the next five years we will calculate that at the end of year one GDP is 1 72 trillion In year two we start with the end of year one value of 1 67 and increase it by 2 Year three starts with the end of year two GDP and we increase it by 2 and so on as depicted in the Table 4 Another way to calculate the growth rate is to apply the following formula Where future value is the value of GDP five years hence present value is the starting GDP amount of 1 64 trillion g is the growth rate of 2 and n is the number of periods for which we are calculating growth Productivity the value of what is produced per worker or per hour worked can be measured as the level of GDP per worker or GDP per hour The United States experienced a productivity slowdown between 1973 and 1989 Since then U S productivity has rebounded the current global recession notwithstanding It is not clear whether the current growth in productivity will be sustained The rate of productivity growth is the primary determinant of an economy s rate of long term economic growth and higher wages Over decades and generations seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita An aggregate production function specifies how certain inputs in the economy like human capital physical capital and technology lead to the output measured as GDP per capita Compound interest and compound growth rates behave in the same way as productivity rates Seemingly small changes in percentage points can have big impacts on income over time Answers to Self Check Questions20 2 Labor
