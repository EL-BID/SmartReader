DEBUG:root:VideoAre the robots coming for government jobs According to Bill Eggers the answer is yes sort of Eggers who runs Deloitte s Center for Government Insights said at a Nov 29 FCW event on government modernization that 20 to 30 percent of all work activities will soon be automatable thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence He pointed to a Deloitte study of the federal workforce that found 4 3 billion hours are spent each year on a wide range of task and activities A huge share of those hours is devoted to essentially moving paper he said while relatively little time goes to coaching and other sorts of human activities But the study also found that four out of five of the most labor intensive activities have either a medium or high automation potential Eggers said That could allow for reductions in certain parts of the workforce he noted but it also frees up time for critical higher value work and the chance to deliver better service by giving the human workforce AI powered support Studies have repeatedly shown Eggers said that it s the human machine pairing that gives the best results he said The full video of Eggers half hour talk which explores the larger implications for government as AI becomes the new electricity is available below Note This dual screen video recording is best viewed when expanded to the full browser window For more

publication has been defining and informing the senior management agenda since 1964 Our learning programs help organizations accelerate growth by unlocking their people s potential Automation and artificial intelligence AI are transforming businesses and will contribute to economic growth via contributions to productivity They will also help address moonshot societal challenges in areas from health to climate change At the same time these technologies will transform the nature of work and the workplace itself Machines will be able to carry out more of the tasks done by humans complement the work that humans do and even perform some tasks that go beyond what humans can do As a result some occupations will decline others will grow and many more will change While we believe there will be enough work to go around barring extreme scenarios society will need to grapple with significant workforce transitions and dislocation Workers will need to acquire new skills and adapt to the increasingly capable machines alongside them in the workplace They may have to move from declining occupations to growing and in some cases new occupations This executive briefing which draws on the latest research from the McKinsey Global Institute examines both the promise and the challenge of automation and AI in the workplace and outlines some of the critical issues that policy makers companies and individuals will need to solve for Automation and AI are not new but recent technological progress is pushing the frontier of what machines can do Our research suggests that society needs these improvements to provide value for businesses contribute to economic growth and make once unimaginable progress on some of our most difficult societal challenges In summary Beyond traditional industrial automation and advanced robots new generations of more capable autonomous systems are appearing in environments ranging from autonomous vehicles on roads to automated check outs in grocery stores Much of this progress has been driven by improvements in systems and components including mechanics sensors and software AI has made especially large strides in recent years as machine learning algorithms have become more sophisticated and made use of huge increases in computing power and of the exponential growth in data available to train them Spectacular breakthroughs are making headlines many involving beyond human capabilities in computer vision natural language processing and complex games such as Go These technologies are already generating value in various products and services and companies across sectors use them in an array of processes to personalize product recommendations find anomalies in production identify fraudulent transactions and more The latest generation of AI advances including techniques that address classification estimation and clustering problems promises significantly more value still An analysis we conducted of several hundred AI use cases found that the most advanced deep learning techniques deploying artificial neural networks could account for as much as 3 5 trillion to 5 8 trillion in annual value or 40 percent of the value created by all analytics techniques Exhibit 1 Deployment of AI and automation technologies can do much to lift the global economy and increase global prosperity at a time when aging and falling birth rates are acting as a drag on growth Labor productivity growth a key driver of economic growth has slowed in many economies dropping to an average of 0 5 percent in 2010 2014 from 2 4 percent a decade earlier in the United States and major European economies in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis after a previous productivity boom had waned AI and automation have the potential to reverse that decline productivity growth could potentially reach 2 percent annually over the next decade with 60 percent of this increase from digital opportunities AI is also being used in areas ranging from material science to medical research and climate science Application of the technologies in these and other disciplines could help tackle societal moonshot challenges For example researchers at Geisinger have developed an algorithm that could reduce diagnostic times for intracranial hemorrhaging by up to 96 percent Researchers at George Washington University meanwhile are using machine learning to more accurately weight the climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AI and automation still face challenges The limitations are partly technical such as the need for massive training data and difficulties generalizing algorithms across use cases Recent innovations are just starting to address these issues Other challenges are in the use of AI techniques For example explaining decisions made by machine learning algorithms is technically challenging which particularly matters for use cases involving financial lending or legal applications Potential bias in the training data and algorithms as well as data privacy malicious use and security are all issues that must be addressed Europe is leading with the new General Data Protection Regulation which codifies more rights for users over data collection and usage A different sort of challenge concerns the ability of organizations to adopt these technologies where people data availability technology and process readiness often make it difficult Adoption is already uneven across sectors and countries The finance automotive and telecommunications sectors lead AI adoption Among countries US investment in AI ranked first at 15 billion to 23 billion in 2016 followed by Asia s investments of 8 billion to 12 billion with Europe lagging behind at 3 billion to 4 billion Even as AI and automation bring benefits to business and society we will need to prepare for major disruptions to work Our analysis of more than 2000 work activities across more than 800 occupations shows that certain categories of activities are more easily automatable than others They include physical activities in highly predictable and structured environments as well as data collection and data processing These account for roughly half of the activities that people do across all sectors The least susceptible categories include managing others providing expertise and interfacing with stakeholders Nearly all occupations will be affected by automation but only about 5 percent of occupations could be fully automated by currently demonstrated technologies Many more occupations have portions of their constituent activities that are automatable we find that about 30 percent of the activities in 60 percent of all occupations could be automated This means that most workers from welders to mortgage brokers to CEOs will work alongside rapidly evolving machines The nature of these occupations will likely change as a result Automation will displace some workers We have found that around 15 percent of the global workforce or about 400 million workers could be displaced by automation in the period 2016 2030 This reflects our midpoint scenario in projecting the pace and scope of adoption Under the fastest scenario we have modeled that figure rises to 30 percent or 800 million workers In our slowest adoption scenario only about 10 million people would be displaced close to zero percent of the global workforce Exhibit 2 The wide range underscores the multiple factors that will impact the pace and scope of AI and automation adoption Technical feasibility of automation is only the first influencing factor Other factors include the cost of deployment labor market dynamics including labor supply quantity quality and the associated wages the benefits beyond labor substitution that contribute to business cases for adoption and finally social norms and acceptance Adoption will continue to vary significantly across countries and sectors because of differences in the above factors especially labor market dynamics in advanced economies with relatively high wage levels such as France Japan and the United States automation could displace 20 to 25 percent of the workforce by 2030 in a midpoint adoption scenario more than double the rate in India Even as workers are displaced there will be growth in demand for work and consequently jobs We developed scenarios for labor demand to 2030 from several catalysts of demand for work including rising incomes increased spending on healthcare and continuing or stepped up investment in infrastructure energy and technology development and deployment These scenarios showed a range of additional labor demand of between 21 percent to 33 percent of the global workforce 555 million and 890 million jobs to 2030 more than offsetting the numbers of jobs lost Some of the largest gains will be in emerging economies such as India where the working age population is already growing rapidly Additional economic growth including from business dynamism and rising productivity growth will also continue to create jobs Many other new occupations that we cannot currently imagine will also emerge and may account for as much as 10 percent of jobs created by 2030 if history is a guide Moreover technology itself has historically been a net job creator For example the introduction of the personal computer in the 1970s and 1980s created millions of jobs not just for semiconductor makers but also for software and app developers of all types customer service representatives and information analysts Partial automation will become more prevalent as machines complement human labor For example AI algorithms that can read diagnostic scans with a high degree of accuracy will help doctors diagnose patient cases and identify suitable treatment In other fields jobs with repetitive tasks could shift toward a model of managing and troubleshooting automated systems At retailer Amazon employees who previously lifted and stacked objects are becoming robot operators monitoring the automated arms and resolving issues such as an interruption in the flow of objects While we expect there will be enough work to ensure full employment in 2030 based on most of our scenarios the transitions that will accompany automation and AI adoption will be significant The mix of occupations will change as will skill and educational requirements Work will need to be redesigned to ensure that humans work alongside machines most effectively Automation will accelerate the shift in required workforce skills we have seen over the past 15 years Demand for advanced technological skills such as programming will grow rapidly Social emotional and higher cognitive skills such as creativity critical thinking and complex information processing will also see growing demand Basic digital skills demand has been increasing and that trend will continue and accelerate Demand for physical and manual skills will decline but will remain the single largest category of workforce skills in 2030 in many countries Exhibit 3 This will put additional pressure on the already existing workforce skills challenge as well as the need for new credentialing systems While some innovative solutions are emerging solutions that can match the scale of the challenge will be needed Our research suggests that in a midpoint scenario around 3 percent of the global workforce will need to change occupational categories by 2030 though scenarios range from about 0 to 14 percent Some of these shifts will happen within companies and sectors but many will occur across sectors and even geographies Occupations made up of physical activities in highly structured environments or in data processing or collection will see declines Growing occupations will include those with difficult to automate activities such as managers and those in unpredictable physical environments such as plumbers Other occupations that will see increasing demand for work include teachers nursing aides and tech and other professionals As intelligent machines and software are integrated more deeply into the workplace workflows and workspaces will continue to evolve to enable humans and machines to work together As self checkout machines are introduced in stores for example cashiers can become checkout assistance helpers who can help answer questions or troubleshoot the machines More system level solutions will prompt rethinking of the entire workflow and workspace Warehouse design may change significantly as some portions are designed to accommodate primarily robots and others to facilitate safe human machine interaction The occupational mix shifts will likely put pressure on wages Many of the current middle wage jobs in advanced economies are dominated by highly automatable activities such as in manufacturing or in accounting which are likely to decline High wage jobs will grow significantly especially for high skill medical and tech or other professionals but a large portion of jobs expected to be created including teachers and nursing aides typically have lower wage structures The risk is that automation could exacerbate wage polarization income inequality and the lack of income advancement that has characterized the past decade across advanced economies stoking social and political tensions Most countries already face the challenge of adequately educating and training their workforces to meet the current requirements of employers Across the OECD spending on worker education and training has been declining over the last two decades Spending on worker transition and dislocation assistance has also continued to shrink as a percentage of GDP One lesson of the past decade is that while globalization may have benefited economic growth and people as consumers the wage and dislocation effects on workers were not adequately addressed Most analyses including our own suggest that the scale of these issues is likely to grow in the coming decades We have also seen in the past that large scale workforce transitions can have a lasting effect on wages during the 19th century Industrial Revolution wages in the United Kingdom remained stagnant for about half a century despite rising productivity a phenomenon known as Engels Pause PDF 690KB after the German philosopher who identified it In the search for appropriate measures and policies to address these challenges we should not seek to roll back or slow diffusion of the technologies Companies and governments should harness automation and AI to benefit from the enhanced performance and productivity contributions as well as the societal benefits These technologies will create the economic surpluses that will help societies manage workforce transitions Rather the focus should be on ways to ensure that the workforce transitions are as smooth as possible This is likely to require actionable and scalable solutions in several key areas There is work for everyone today and there will be work for everyone tomorrow even in a future with automation Yet that work will be different requiring new skills and a far greater adaptability of the workforce than we have seen Training and retraining both midcareer workers and new generations for the coming challenges will be an imperative Government private sector leaders and innovators all need to work together to better coordinate public and private initiatives including creating the right incentives to invest more in human capital The future with automation and AI will be challenging but a much richer one if we harness the technologies with aplomb and mitigate the negative effects James Manyika is chairman and

trapped in a room with its mate looks uncannily like a dog well maybe a mutant dog with a canary yellow body and a proboscis sticking out where its head should be The robot confidently scurries to the door raises itself to the perfect height and then uses its appendage to press down the handle Pulling open the door the robot allows its mate to be first across the threshold before the two of them make their dash for freedom Such is the content of a short video by Boston Dynamics that has gone viral since it was released in February Reactions to it on social media have ranged from amusement soon they ll be opening our fridges and stealing our beer to alarm this is how we die It is the latest evidence of recent remarkable advances in robotics and artificial intelligence robots can now perform backflips and ride bicycles and machines empowered by AI are able to analyze X ray images better than expert radiologists and to teach themselves to play the ancient game of Go better than world champions Yet the dog clip is also powerful because it conjures up a more worrisome vision of robots on the loose beyond the control of us humans Thus it plays into a powerful angst laden contemporary narrative about technology and the future of work and maybe even of mankind itself What really are the risks from this new wave of technology And will the opportunities these advances bring with them outweigh those risks To address such questions about the future it is useful indeed necessary to look to the past Technology has for centuries both excited the human imagination and prompted fears about the effects Back in 1589 Queen Elizabeth I of England refused to grant a patent to a stocking frame invented by one William Lee because Her Majesty was concerned about the effect of the contraption on the livelihoods of those who knitted stockings by hand The Luddite weavers in Britain and silk workers in Lyons France famously staged revolts in the early 19th century against new automated looms that threatened their skilled and well paid jobs And in the realm of fiction imagination has run riot since the Czech writer Karel Capek coined the word robot from a Slavic word for work in his 1920 play Rossum s Universal Robots a k a RUR which ends with the destruction of mankind As one of Capek s characters explains Robots are not people Mechanically they are more perfect than we are they have an enormously developed intelligence but they have no soul For 100 percent of continuous 10 year periods in the United States technologically driven productivity gains have gone hand in hand with rising employment Almost a century later that same concern about soulless hyper intelligence infuses not just movies like The Matrix and mind bending video series like Philip K Dick s Electric Dreams but also warnings about AI and its potential consequences expressed by Elon Musk and the late Stephen Hawking among others Back in the 1950s the German philosopher Martin Heidegger fretted about the risk that humans would become enslaved by the technologies we rely on With the rise of machines able to mimic many human traits from speech albeit still falteringly to facial recognition already significantly more accurately than humans that time appears to be much closer Yet when we switch from philosophy to economics we find a very different story a long historical record of innovation that shows technological change has been overwhelmingly positive for productivity and surprisingly benign when it comes to employment Job displacement has occurred in waves first with the structural shift from agriculture to manufacturing and then with the move from manufacturing to services Throughout productivity gains generated by new technology have been reinvested and the GDP bounce from that productivity eventually raises consumption and on balance increases the demand for labor In McKinsey s research we have sought to quantify this trend and its net impact in several ways For example we looked at the very big picture what happened to employment as productivity grew over the past 50 years We found no tradeoff between the two for 100 percent of continuous 10 year periods in the United States technologically driven productivity gains have gone hand in hand with rising employment Even when measured in one year snapshots productivity and employment have risen together four years in five The personal computer provides an iconic case to support the compatibility of technological progress with job growth We measured how many jobs were lost and how many gained in the United States between 1980 and 2015 as a result of the diffusion of computer technology Several hundred thousand bookkeepers and auditing clerks secretaries and typists did lose their jobs But the overall balance was strongly positive the desktop laptop computer created more than 19 million jobs in industries ranging from computer hardware to enterprise software to online retail sales against the loss of about 3 5 million jobs a net gain of 15 7 million That figure amounts to 18 percent of all the net U S employment created in the period almost one in five jobs Something similar happened with the invention of the automobile which destroyed the horse and buggy business but gave rise to a wealth of new sometimes unimagined products from petroleum based synthetic rubber to motels That said we ignore those left along the way at our peril For the many workers who are displaced painful transitions are a reality In Britain during the industrial revolution starting in about 1800 wages of the masses stagnated for almost a half century despite a strong surge in productivity that enriched the owners of capital a phenomenon often referred to as Engels pause because it was first noted by the German philosopher who co authored with Karl Marx The Communist Manifesto Wages picked up again as the fruits of productivity gains eventually trickled down to workers But eventually can be a long time the Luddites fears were not entirely unfounded And once again today the link between productivity gains and wage growth seems bent if not broken U S median hourly compensation rose only 11 percent from 1973 to 2016 even as hourly labor productivity grew by 75 percent While it is natural to focus on labor displacement through technology one element often overlooked in the discussion of the future of work is the number of jobs that are neither lost nor gained but fundamentally changed for reasons that are hard to predict History again provides some examples When ATMs became as common as vending machines in the 1970s the number of bank tellers actually increased That s because the new technology reduced the costs of processing individual transactions giving the banks incentives to open more branches to meet local demand for other financial services The tellers primary tasks changed from cashing checks and taking deposits to providing advice and selling securities mortgages and the like To be sure this tale is not yet complete with the rise of online banking the demand for tellers has again waned and so their numbers have thinned especially after the 2008 financial crisis But modern economies are nothing if not dynamic and the only certainty is change There s a similar story to be told about jobs and information technology Thanks to the internet and some ingenious software anyone can now dig up information at the blink of a cursor Yet the need for data analysis has exploded even as the need for data gathering clerks and the like has plummeted And so the number of information analysts of the genus homo sapiens has quintupled since 1980 to about two million today This largely comforting history isn t much help in determining whether this time will be different To the point the rise of ever more sophisticated technologies especially artificial intelligence that can be brought to bear on any number of tasks is likely to usher in a new age of rapid workforce transitions The McKinsey Global Institute recently estimated that in our fastest automation adoption scenario as many as 375 million workers worldwide or about 14 percent of the global workforce will need to switch occupational categories by 2030 in order to avoid obsolescence Even if the pace of adoption is slower as in our midpoint scenario some 75 million workers will need to switch occupational categories in the next 10 to 15 years Among the work most vulnerable to automation jobs that require routinized physical activity in a predictable setting and collecting and processing data Some aspects of the current technological transformation seem in line with that of previous eras the rise of computers for example and earlier epochs of technical change such as the diffusion of the steam engine that transformed work across multiple sectors of the economy simultaneously Every new wave of automation seems remarkable at the time and AI is not the first technology to chip away at cognitive tasks Since the birth of computerized spreadsheets in the 1980s machines have tackled ever more sophisticated problems that previously required human brainpower Still other aspects of the new technologies do seem qualitatively different from previous waves of innovation The rate of technological change today is strikingly rapid and while hard to measure appears to be accelerating Consider in this regard the development of deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques based on neural networks the exponential increase in computing capacity made available through the cloud and the sheer volume of data that can be generated These advances are driving AI for example enabling the development of autonomous vehicles but also heralding breakthrough applications such as a heightened ability to diagnose disease with non invasive techniques Accordingly the share of jobs that could be automated could also be larger than historical precedents suggest The future of work looks set to be not a tale of machines replacing humans but of machines complementing humans in the workplace That said we see no evidence to date suggesting that the time it takes for new technologies to be diffused throughout the economy is shrinking Looking at a range of high value technologies over the past 60 years from airbags to MRI machines to smartphones we find that the pace of adoption hasn t changed It still takes between 5 and 16 years to reach 50 percent adoption and 5 to 28 years to reach 80 percent adoption Even highly popular social media applications do not beat this clock Facebook for example was begun in 2004 and had attracted more than 2 2 billion followers 13 years later but the untapped market remains vast Consider too that new technology is rarely applied to a blank canvas a variety of economic and social factors play a big role in determining the pace of adoption They include the cost of developing and deploying the hardware and software labor market dynamics the regulatory environment and social acceptance Computer algorithms in state of the art technology aircraft can do just about anything asked of them without a helping hand but we still insist on humans in the cockpit for peace of mind And who wants to be cared for in a hospital solely by a robot We remain disconcerted by the uncanny valley the term coined by the Japanese robotics guru Masahiro Mori to characterize that unsettling feeling people may experience when facing humanoid robots Indeed for tech luminaries ranging from the MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson to the former Google chairman Eric Schmidt the future of work looks set to be not a tale of machines replacing humans but of machines complementing humans in the workplace The rise of AI and the ascendance of self learned algorithms whose logic can be hard to explain pose some arguably unique problems A recent report from a who s who of experts on the malicious use of AI lists a number of the darkest scenarios from political manipulation through hyper personalized disinformation campaigns to a major increase in sophisticated computer hacking attacks For now AI pioneers including Google DeepMind s chief executive Demis Hassabis are clear that while machines are proving formidable in specific areas such as games we remain a long way away from the time when they will have mastered a general artificial intelligence enabling them to think and act like humans And a number of groups including Stanford University s AI100 with which I am associated are trying to look ahead to study and anticipate how AI will affect the way people live work and play long into the future The challenges here for policymakers and business leaders worldwide are significant We will need to institute retraining of workers on a scale we have not seen for generations We will need to rethink and adapt our social systems to help hundreds of millions of workers affected by the new technologies hopefully handling it better than we have handled globalization in providing both new forms of income and job transition support We will need to find ways to tame the wilder unpredictable side of AI For their part CEOs will need to rethink their organizational structures and processes to take advantage of the technologies and the performance enhancing effects they can have or risk ending up in the recycle bin of business history While all of this may seem intimidating it is still the best way forward We should embrace automation technologies for the productivity benefits they bring even as we deal proactively with the workforce transitions that will accompany adoption Given that demographic trends increased longevity low birth rates are rapidly increasing the dependent population our societies really need that productivity boost Beyond the prosperity and employment these technologies will create there will be other societal benefits new moonshots as we use the power of AI to tackle daunting problems from cancer to climate change We can already see one of the key challenges that of worker retraining or reskilling as some like to call it advancing to the top of the corporate agenda and in some countries also receiving renewed political attention In our recent work on the skills that will be needed by the workforce we found that demand will rise sharply not just for technological skills of all kinds but also for social and emotional skills that is leadership and empathy with customers as well as for higher cognitive skills linked to creativity and complex information processing Business leaders tell us that they believe finding the right talent to help implement automation is critical to their future financial performance and they expect companies to take the lead in the skills upgrade that is required Some firms are already putting in place large scale retraining initiatives AT T is using external education providers including for example Udacity At SAP the German enterprise software company the focus is on in house efforts to create learning journeys for thousands of employees including engineers who need to acquire softer skills as their roles change to service customers directly Walmart has set up more than 100 academies in the United States that provide hands on training for positions that include customer service managers and online grocery pickup While welcome these disparate retraining efforts are barely a start Given the scale of the occupational and skill shifts that we see coming in the next decade much more will need to be done and not just by business Governments and educational establishments working together with philanthropic foundations will of necessity be part of the mix Foundations have the advantage of being able to test innovative programs as pilots and will not face the disadvantage of concern that workers with new skills will subsequently jump ship for a new employer As a starter governments will need to reverse the 20 plus year decline in spending on labor related services no small task in light of tight government budgets and in the United States reflexive opposition to government intervention They will also need to be more flexible in order to adapt to the rapidly changing workplace Mobility is one key yet labor markets have become markedly less dynamic in recent years In the United States for example job reallocation rates have declined by 25 percent since 1990 This is the time to test ideas such as portable benefits that are owned by workers and not tied to particular jobs or companies Technology itself can help facilitate greater mobility especially digital platforms turbocharged by AI that enable matching of people to jobs But we also need to rethink some basic assumptions In order for changing jobs across sectors to become a common practice companies will need to agree on definitions and qualifications for specific skills And a major debate is overdue about credentialing Today higher education encourages the world to judge graduates by their subject knowledge rather than by their skills in problem solving and creative thinking skills that will be especially valuable in an AI enhanced workplace More than anything we need to prepare for this new era in which humans must work alongside smart machines far more intensively President Lyndon Johnson was prescient in this regard writing a half a century ago Automation is not our enemy Our enemies are ignorance indifference and inertia Automation can be the ally of our prosperity if we will just look ahead if we will understand what is to come and if we will set our course wisely after proper planning Back then nobody other than science fiction writers could have imagined robot dogs opening doors and escaping to wherever those androids from Blade Runner found refuge But LBJ s words resonate planning for change has never been

freshly minted college graduate joins the government as a clerk Jane s work consists largely of entering information into databases and creating reports which requires her to spend the better part of her work day seated at a terminal near a mainframe computer that fills an entire room Jane and her colleagues are expected to be at their desks from 9 a m to 5 p m five days a week Jane is grateful to have a steady 9 to 5 job and plans to spend her entire career with her agency Flash forward 40 years and meet Jane s grandson Ian He carries a slim tablet wherever he goes which has more computing power than the mainframe with which Jane worked Ian is constantly tethered to the Internet and works 24 7 from wherever he is Ian expects to switch from project to project and office to office as his career develops and his interests evolve If he feels he has reached the limit of his ability to learn or grow in one role he will look elsewhere for a new opportunity What if the government could give Ian the opportunities and experiences he seeks The GovCloud concept proposed in this paper would restructure government workforces in a way that takes advantage of the talents and preferences of workers like Ian who are entering the workforce today The model is based on a large body of research from interviews with public and private sector experts to best practices from innovative organizations both public and private This is the first generation of people that work play think and learn differently than their parents They are the first generation to not be afraid of technology It s like the air to them Don Tapscott author of Grown Up DigitalThis report details trends in work and technology that offer significant opportunities for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the government workforce It lays out the GovCloud model explaining how governments could be organized to take advantage of its flexibility It examines how work would be performed in the new model and discusses potential changes to government HR programs to support GovCloud Other sections provide resources for executives including a tool to help determine cloud eligibility steps they can take to pilot the cloud concept and future scenarios illustrating the cloud in action The GovCloud model represents a dramatic departure from the status quo It is bound to be greeted with some skepticism Without such innovation however governments will be left to confront the challenges of tomorrow with the workforce structure of yesterday The details of the GovCloud model are open for debate The purpose of this paper is to jumpstart that debate Forty years ago more than half of employed American adults worked in either blue collar or clerical jobs Today less than 40 percent work in these same categories and the share continues to shrink 1 Jobs requiring routine or manual tasks are disappearing while those requiring complex communication skills and expert thinking are becoming the norm 2 Increasingly employers seek workers capable of creative and knowledge based work We should ask ourselves whether we re truly satisfied with the status quo Are our workday lives so fulfilling and our organizations so boundlessly capable that it s now pointless to long for something better Gary Hamel author of The Future of ManagementThe next generation of creative knowledge workers has already entered the job market These Millennials came of age in a rapidly and radically changing world They are the first true digital natives They have grown up with instant access to information through technology As such Millennials have considerably different expectations for the kind of work they do and the information they use The pursuit for variety in work has led Millennials to cite simply needing a change as their top reason for switching jobs 3Advances in technology have also changed the actual ways in which people perform work The ability to crowdsource tasks is one example of this change Since its founding in 2001 volunteers have produced and contributed to over 19 million articles in 281 languages on Wikipedia 4 Built around this concept a burgeoning industry is developing around microtasking dividing work up into small tasks that can be farmed out to workers Amazon s Mechanical Turk rolled out in 2005 allows users to post tasks to a platform where registered workers can accept and complete them for a small fee When this paper was written more than 195 000 tasks were available on Mechanical Turk 5Such technologies may offer suitable possibilities for the public sector Microtask a Finnish cloud labor company maintains Digitalkoot a program that helps the Finnish National Library convert its image archives into digital text and correct existing errors It does so with volunteered labor participants simply play a game in which they are shown the image of a word and then must type it out to help a cartoon character cross a bridge In doing so they are turning scanned images into searchable text greatly improving the search accuracy of old manuscripts 6 At present more than 100 000 people have completed over 6 million microtasks associated with this project 7As the pace of computing power and machine learning increases professors Frank Levy and Richard Murnane contend that more tasks will move from human to computer processing 8 Skeptics need look no further than IBM s Watson a computer that can answer questions posed in natural language In February 2011 Watson defeated two all time champions of the quiz show Jeopardy This was not solely a publicity stunt IBM hopes to sell Watson to hospitals and call centers to help them answer questions from the public 9Around the globe more and more governments are looking to increase telework among employees In 2010 the U S government passed legislation calling for more telework opportunities for government employees Likewise the Australian government in order to attract and retain information and communications technology workers instituted a teleworking policy in 2009 requiring agencies to implement flexible work plans 10 Other countries including Norway and Germany are also focusing on flexible work arrangements to improve public sector recruiting 11 In Canada the government has an official telework policy that recognizes changes are occurring in the public service workforce with a

government based on team collaboration whereby workforce resources can be surged to provide services to government agencies on demand GovLabSource Frank Levy and Richard J Murnane The New Division of Labor How Computers are Creating the Next Job Market Princeton Princeton University Press 2004 p 50 Figure 1 Trends in routine and non routine tasks in the U S 1960 200213These are all powerful steps in the right direction for employees whose natural work rhythms are not locked into 9 to 5 Some companies have taken telework one step further British Telecom is pushing the concept of agile working through its Workstyle Project where employees decide what work arrangements best suit them rather than a rigid definition by location and hours BT Workstyle is one of the largest flexible working projects in Europe with over 11 000 home based workers BT has found that its home enabled employees are on average 20 percent more productive than their office based colleagues 14Similarly U S electronics retailer Best Buy experimented with a Results Only Work Environment ROWE In a ROWE what matters is not whether employees are in their office but rather that they complete their work and achieve measurable outcomes In a ROWE salaried employees must put in as much time as is actually needed to do their work no more no less The decline in routine and manual tasks and the rise of new ways of working is not isolated to the private sector In 1950 the U S federal workforce largely comprised clerks performing repetitive tasks About 62 percent performed these tasks while only 11 percent performed more white collar work By 2000 those relationships were reversed Fifteen percent performed repetitive tasks compared to 56 percent in the white collar categories 16 Similarly in 1944 the number of workers in the UK civil service considered industrial totaled 505 000 By 2003 this number fell to 18 200 with non industrial workers reaching 538 000 in 2004 17 And in Canada in 2006 knowledge based workers represented 58 percent of federal workers in the Core Public Administration up from 41 percent 11 years earlier 18The swelling ranks of non industrial government workers indicate a shift in public sector jobs toward creative collaborative and complex work The workforce structure however designed for clerks of the last century remains largely the same With limited flexibility to distribute resources governments often address change by creating new agencies and programs This can be seen following major events like the outbreaks of the Avian flu and SARs in the past decade 9 11 and the financial crisis of 2008 Source United States Office of Personnel Management A Fresh Start for Federal Pay A Case for Modernization April 2002 p 5 http www opm gov strategiccomp whtpaper pdfFigure 2 The changing U S federal workforce 1950 200015Given increasing budgetary pressures and burgeoning national debts the conventional model of creating new agencies or permanent structures in response to new challenges is unsustainable This is exacerbated by our inability to accurately predict future needs and trends Consider a 1968 Business Week article proclaiming that the Japanese auto industry isn t likely to carve out a big share of the market for itself or the president of Digital Equipment Corporation who in 1977 said t here is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home 19The world is full of experts who attempt to predict the future and fail 20Instead of endeavoring to predict the future governments can choose to create a flexible workforce that can quickly adapt to future work requirements To accomplish this the government can learn from a game changing concept in the technology world cloud computing Major organizations and small startups alike increase their flexibility by sharing storage space information and resources in a cloud allowing them to quickly scale resources up and down as needed Why not apply the cloud model to people The creation of a government wide human cloud could provide significant benefits including A cloud based government workforce or GovCloud could include workers who perform a range of creative problem focused work Rather than being slotted into any single government agency cloud workers would be true government wide employees This section outlines the organizational structure of the GovCloud model which rests on three main pillars a cloud of government workers thin executive agencies and shared services Most government workforce models tend to constrain workers by isolating them in separate agencies Consider the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom and the subsequent slaughter of more than 6 million pigs sheep and cattle The problem of an impacted food supply is complicated In most countries multiple agencies focus on agriculture food production and public health In the United Kingdom the army and even tourism ministries were impacted by the outbreak as agencies became overwhelmed by the number of animals in need of disposal and by the cordoning off of tourist areas to prevent the spread of the disease Yet the structure of government agencies often confines employees to work in information silos creating inherent operational inefficiencies In a cloud workforce model experts in each area could be pulled together to support remedies and propose coordinated corrective measures I want someone saying Did you know that the Ministry of Justice is doing that or could you piggy back on what the communities department is doing or had you thought about doing it in this way You ve got to get away from thinking about centralized command and control Dame Helen Ghosh Permanent Secretary UK Home Office 21The FedCloud modelThe GovCloud model could become a new pillar of government comprising permanent employees who undertake a wide variety of creative problem focused work As needed the GovCloud model could also take advantage of those outside government including citizens looking for extra part time work full time contractors and individual consultants Cloud workers would vary in background and expertise but would exhibit traits of free agent workers self sufficient self motivated employees who exhibit a strong loyalty to teams colleagues and clients Daniel Pink author of Drive The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us argues that 33 million Americans one quarter of the workforce already operate as free agents 22According to the white paper Lessons of the Great Recession from Swiss staffing company Adecco contingent workers those who chose non traditional employment arrangements23 are expected to eventually make up about 25 percent of the global workforce 24These more autonomous workers according to Pink are better suited to 21st century work and are more productive even without traditional monetary incentives 25The fluid nature of the cloud can provide significant benefits The nature of the cloud teams forming and dissolving as their tasks require encourages workers to focus on specific project outcomes rather than ongoing operations Thin agency structures could lead to Greater use of shared services could allow the federal government to The need to support some ongoing missions will remain of course These missions will be carried out by thin agencies Under the cloud concept federal agencies would remain focused on specific missions and ongoing oversight These agencies however would become thinner as many of their knowledge workers transfer into the cloud Thin agencies could also create opportunities to streamline organizations with overlapping missions Employees working in thin agencies could fall into two main categories GovCloud could change the highest levels of public sector workers as we know them today The Senior Executive Service in the United States Permanent Secretaries and Directors General in the United Kingdom and Australia all such senior officials could rotate between agencies shared services and the cloud which would reflect the original intent behind many of these high level offices giving executives a breadth of experience in roles across government to help develop shared values and a broad perspective An important benefit of rotation would be the ability to tap into cloud networks to assemble high performing teams To further focus agencies on specific missions many of their back office support functions could be pulled into government wide shared service arrangements The use of shared services in government has come and gone in waves usually dictated by fiscal necessity Most countries in Europe as part of their e government strategies have placed increased focus of late on developing shared services whether through an executive agency or a CIO as well as working with EU coordination activities And while the decentralized governments of some EU countries such as Germany make shared services more difficult these countries are using states and agencies to pilot innovative approaches 27Other efforts around the world include the U S e Government Act of 2002 which examined how technology could be used to cut costs and improve services More recently the New Zealand government appointed an advisory group in May 2011 to explore public sector reform to improve services and provide better value In their report Better Public Services the advisory group recommended the use of shared services to improve effectiveness in a variety of government settings including policy advice and real estate 29 Following up on this three New Zealand agencies the Department of the Prime Minister the State Services Commission and the Treasury announced in December 2011 that they would share such corporate functions as human resources and information technology 30 And though shared services in Western Australia were shut down other projects in South Australia are moving ahead and already showing savings 31In August 2011 the government of Canada announced the launch of Shared Services Canada a program that seeks to streamline and identify savings in information technology Among its first targets is something as mundane as email But with more than 100 different email systems being used by government employees the potential savings and boost to efficiency could be significant Not only do these incompatible systems cost money by requiring individual departments to negotiate and maintain separate licenses and technical support it also makes it difficult for government employees to communicate with one another and with the public And with no single standard ensuring the security of information transmitted over email becomes more challenging Shared Services Canada will move the government to one email system as well as consolidate data centers and networks ultimately looking for anticipated savings of between CA 100 million and CA 200 million annually 28While the idea of using shared services is not a novel one it is central to the GovCloud model The GovCloud model envisions building upon effective practices and those shared services already in operation to deliver services like human resources information technology finance and acquisitions government wide Workers in these shared services would include subject matter experts in areas like human resources and information technology as well as generalists who support routine business functions The potential for shared services continues to grow As seen with IBM s Watson and Microtask s Digitalkoot new technologies provide an opportunity to accelerate the automated delivery of basic services Some agencies already have begun capitalizing on these trends For example NASA has moved its shared service center website to a secure government cloud facilitating greater employee self service and helping to reduce demand on finite call center resources 32This decision tool is designed to help leaders determine which employees are appropriate for each of the three structures in the GovCloud model the cloud thin agencies and shared services To the cloud GovCloud Project LifecycleManaging employees in the cloud will require governments to reinvent human resource management Individual and team performance evaluations career development pay structures and benefits and pensions would need to change to support GovCloud This section examines possibilities for HR reinvention including performance management career development workplace flexibility and benefits Employees working in the cloud would require an alternative to determine pay and career advancement The government could take its cues from the gaming world and evaluate cloud workers with a point system The manager as we know it will disappear to be replaced by a new sort of business operative whose expertise is assembling the right people for particular projects Daniel Pink author of Free Agent Nation 33An HR management system that incorporates the accumulation of experience points XP through effective work on cloud projects training education and professional certifications could replace the tenure centric models for cloud employees As employees accumulate XP they could level up and take on additional responsibilities in future projects Workers in the cloud could earn XP in four ways After some high profile incidents slow responses to outbreaks of foot and mouth disease flooding that may have been preventable and a farming subsidy system that seemed to result in more chaos than aid the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs DEFRA was looking to reinvent itself In 2006 the department launched DEFRA Renew One of its key goals was to bring the department s policymaking closer to actual delivery to create more responsive processes Organized mainly by policy with fixed teams DEFRA had been unable to redeploy resources as needed in response to a crisis As part of DEFRA Renew a new operating model was implemented that used flexible resourcing where staff were assigned to specific projects for fixed periods This allowed management to measure and build the required capabilities and competencies needed and to allocate resources efficiently to improve overall service quality New roles were also created to support sustainable staff development and resource management in the new model To create buy in for such a fundamental culture shift within the department a facilitative approach to decision making was employed Change management programs and mentoring were extended to all levels of the department including leadership New mechanisms such as approval panels for resources and the use of business cases also worked to push changes among staff and promote collaborative behavior DEFRA Renew was widely recognized as a key enabler in the department meeting required efficiency improvement targets set by the UK government DEFRA moved to a more project based approach with fewer staff in core teams According to Dame Helen Ghosh former Permanent Secretary of DEFRA they could be more responsive now that the management board won t be made up of director generals with individual policy silos 34Just as XP could be gained through learning new skills it could be lost in the following three ways Any serious discussion about creating a new class of government employees requires a fresh look at employee benefits and compensation For example XP could be used to help determine workers salaries but additional research into alternative pension and benefit programs is needed While any discussion on compensation could be contentious a healthy debate among stakeholders from across the government should be welcomed As new roles emerge in the cloud so too could new career paths Career emphasis could move away from time served in a particular pay grade and toward milestones that are meaningful for employee development Each worker may have different career aspirations For instance not all workers aspire to management some may seek to master a particular subject area instead Career advancement in the cloud would not equate to moving up a ladder but rather moving along a lattice Lattice GovCloud ModelHere s how the lattice could work for Ian who we met in the introduction Think of the lattice as a jungle gym The best opportunities to broaden your experience may be lateral or even down Look every which way and swing to opportunities Pattie Sellers Fortune editor at largeCathleen Benko and Molly Anderson the authors of The Corporate Lattice argue that the corporate ladder is giving way to a lattice that accommodates flatter more networked organizations improves the integration of career and life focuses on competencies rather than tenure and helps increase workforce loyalty 35 The lattice metaphor allows employees to choose many ways to get ahead It is unlikely that all workers will thrive in the new GovCloud environment right out of the gate As such it would be important to assess a worker s readiness before placing her in GovCloud and providing training on core competencies critical to cloud success There could also be opportunities to start workers especially those at earlier stages of a career within an agency or shared service to build up expertise in some area before graduating to the cloud Once in the cloud new workers could be paired with mentors who are more experienced to help navigate the cloud experience itself There should be an emphasis on continuous learning in the cloud It would be important for cloud workers to continue to refine their skills develop additional expertise and adapt to new ways of working Not only could continuous learning affect workers career mobility by increasing the depth and breadth of their skills but it could also impact their salary and level by increasing their XP Learning and development in the cloud could take on many themes of next learning Next learning focuses on creating personalized learning experiences that leverage the latest technologies and collaborative communities to deliver education and learning programs that build knowledge bases and promote learning as a focus and passion not just a checkbox in a career 36To broaden cloud worker skills and the ability to handle multiple tasks and work on a variety of projects cloud learning could include the following principles 37In the cloud careers and expertise will be built in new ways and work will be something we do rather than a place we go to As such the cloud will give workers more control over their schedules and workloads By creating a flexible workplace governments could shed a significant amount of physical infrastructure and create shared workspaces Many buildings could be converted into co located spaces teams could use collaboration spaces or videoconferencing centers Some workers might rarely set foot in a government building instead conducting cloud tasks at home and interacting with project teams virtually With advancing communications and mobile technology distance no longer hinders collaboration It no longer matters whether all workers are at an office between 9 a m and 5 p m what matters is whether project teams produce results and whether everyone contributes A more flexible workplace could also take advantage of resources governments might not otherwise have access to Some retiring workers may not want to quit working altogether and a flexible model could be an enticing way to keep their expertise on retainer Alternatively the model could take advantage of would be government employees unwilling to relocate or unable to work a regular schedule By increasing flexibility governments could increase their available resource pool allowing agencies to access the skills and knowledge they need when they need it For an example of how a retiree could interact with the cloud see Appendix C National Security Case Study Don t think governments will ever take to the cloud At the U S Department of State the idea could soon be a reality The Office of eDiplomacy is preparing to pilot a cloud component to its e internship model for American students as part of the Virtual Student Foreign Service VSFS beginning this year The VSFS currently offers e internships to U S university students of multiple month duration By using a new micro volunteering platform State Department offices and embassies around the world will be able to create non classified tasks that take anywhere from a couple of minutes to a couple of days to complete Each task will be tagged by region and or issue and will automatically populate the profiles of students who have indicated those interests Students can then select the tasks that interest them the most or that fit into their schedule To see that the most pressing work is performed first offices and embassies will be able to prioritize their tasks so critical items appear at the top of the queue Imagine a small embassy preparing for a high profile multilateral meeting The preparations for such an event could be daunting for a small staff The power of the cloud could augment an individual embassy s capacity to prepare for a major event and ensure that related items are performed ahead of those that are less critical While there are plenty of incentives for participating in the VSFS micro volunteering platform from an impressive line on a student s resume to the chance to make a difference by working on topics of interest thought is being put into how to creatively incent high performance One idea is to simply invoke students competitive spirit Competition could be encouraged by a monthly leader board which results in bragging rights and potentially even a low cost but high impact reward Transparency is also key to competition with ratings available to State Department staff and other cloud interns and the ability to make short thank you notes from embassies publicly available interns would be keen to make a good impression The potential applications of this type of program are significant Imagine if offices throughout the State Department could tap into the language and cultural expertise of the thousands of foreign national staff members around the globe Providing a platform for those employees to contribute even a small amount of time to discreet tasks that require their expertise could unlock a world of knowledge 38Creating the GovCloud model will require bold leadership and the ideas and initiatives of entrepreneurial executives While a GovCloud model may be years in the making agencies can begin adopting cloud concepts today The GovCloud concept is designed to be versatile as well as applicable to a wide range of entities Depending on your organization government executives wishing to employ GovCloud may choose to apply the concept first to a unit before expanding to other branches or divisions entire agencies or the whole of government Often GovCloud principles are most effectively implemented as part of a larger reform program within a particular agency as with the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs Renew program as described earlier in this report On a smaller scale the UK Cabinet Office used flexible resourcing FR in its Economic Reform Group ERG with a staff of about 400 as part of its cost reduction plans Using a simple database that it had developed and a strong program of communications FR is now used and embraced by all core ERG employees with strong clear ownership from the top another key implementation factor Says Ian Watmore the UK Cabinet Office s former permanent secretary FR means we are able to deploy people much more quickly to priority projects 40Figure 3 outlines how GovCloud can apply to a variety of organizations Most government workforces haven t undergone a broad restructuring in decades In that time the world has been transformed by computers the Internet and mobile communications To respond to a variety of challenges governments have created scores of new organizations However in today s world of budget cuts and increased fiscal scrutiny the constant creation of new permanent structures is not sustainable The GovCloud model could offer a new way to use government resources A cloud of government wide workers could coalesce into project based teams to solve problems and separate when their work is done This could allow governments to concentrate resources when and where they are needed By using this model in conjunction with thinner agencies and shared services governments can reduce back office redundancies and let agencies focus on their core missions This model capitalizes on the work preferences of Millennials the future government workforce who value career growth over job security or compensation 41 The GovCloud model allows employees to gain a variety of experiences in a shorter amount of time and to self select their career direction To support GovCloud governments could establish the processes by which cloud teams would form work and dissolve New ways to evaluate performance and help workers gain skills and build careers should be considered Today s employee classification system stresses job descriptions and time in service this could be transformed with an XP model that emphasizes the individual s ownership of his or her career The GovCloud model will undoubtedly be controversial Many stakeholders from governing bodies to public employee unions must weigh in to shape the future government workforce The transition to a cloud model will not happen overnight or maybe even in the next five years but the conversation starts today Charlie Tierney is a Manager in Deloitte Consulting LLP s Federal Human

Monthly Group All Rights Reserved New studies shed light on the job security of certain government jobs in an increasingly digital age Automation has already altered several industries and it s only a matter of time before it transforms more of them Given that many governments continue to grapple with tight budgets and suppressed staffing levels it s worth considering whether they might one day rely more on automation and technology to carry out tasks performed by humans Recent studies have shed some light on what this might look like particularly in the public sector Automation has already made some forays into government Kirke Everson a KPMG intelligent automation consultant cited chatbots utilized in call centers as an example He suggested that automation could soon replace personnel who perform repetitive back office tasks such as eligibility checks and other procedures following a defined set of rules Government is ripe for automation Everson says But if it requires a large amount of judgments or human interaction maybe you don t start there In the U K an estimated 861 000 public sector jobs could be automated by 2030 according to an analysis by Deloitte and Oxford University Administrative and operative roles which account for 27 percent of the public workforce were identified as having the highest probability of being automated These types of jobs are already declining and the report projects their numbers in the U K to fall further from 87 000 in 2015 to only 4 000 by 2030 A separate Oxford University study examined U S job occupations deeming about 47 percent of total employment in both government and the private sector to be at risk of computerization Some public sector roles considered most vulnerable included library workers postal service clerks and transportation inspectors all positions with highly repetitive tasks Many of the other occupations researchers identified were especially common in transportation These included bus drivers and subway or streetcar operators as well as highway maintenance workers tablecaption font size 11px margin bottom 30px line height 1 2em important The probability of computerization ranges from 0 to 1 with higher values representing more tasks potentially completed by computers Numbers shown for predominately public sector occupations Source The Future of Employment How Susceptible are Jobs to Computerisation by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A Osborne But does this mean large numbers of public employees will one day be out of work Historically industrialization and improvements in technology haven t caused higher long term unemployment It s unknown whether this time will be any different though with economists offering different predictions for automation s effects Neil Reichenberg who heads the International Public Management Association for Human Resources views it more as a shift It s not so much cutting staff as it is moving people to more strategic higher level work he says While technology has already reshaped countless occupations across just about every segment of the economy it hasn t yet prompted the complete elimination of many types of jobs Consider teachers who employ greater use of educational software programs in classrooms These and other types of public employee positions haven t vanished but they do require greater tech skills than in years past Although some might associate automation with armies of robots it s computers that are most responsible for redefining work these days A recent Brookings Institution report assessed digitization or the degree of computer skills and related knowledge typically required of various occupations Several public sector jobs that required few digital skills in 2002 now mandate at least mid level proficiency of computers or other devices Parking enforcement workers and compliance officers for example might have relied entirely on paper records not long ago Today the Brookings data suggests digital skills for these occupations have jumped considerably over the past decade Source Brookings analysis of O Net OES and Moody s data In some ways automating various aspects of jobs could prove to be more difficult in the public sector than in the private sector Unions Reichenberg says will likely oppose efforts expected to result in job losses Last year the union membership rate for government workers was more than five times that of the private sector Still if automation offers governments ways to cut costs without sacrificing quality of services they ll likely consider it Resources remain limited Revenues aren t expected to grow much and total state and local government employment is still below levels reached a decade ago In some jurisdictions automated processes or technologies could enable governments to provide services that otherwise wouldn t be available It s inevitable Reichenberg says If you look at the way we do work today technology is going to play a

Demographic TrendsBy Kim Parker Rich Morin and Juliana Menasce HorowitzThe American workplace is changing rapidly as technology and automation transform the nature of work Even with the economy at or near full employment the public is skeptical that the future will bring more job security and they are wary about the long term impact of technological innovation on workers Only 14 of adults say by the year 2050 the average working person in the U S will have more job security About half 49 say workers will have less job security and 36 say jobs will be about as secure as they are now Men are somewhat more pessimistic than women about future job security and those who attended or graduated from college have a more negative outlook than those who did not continue their education beyond high school In addition Democrats are more likely than Republicans to predict that workers will have less job security in the future While pluralities across racial and ethnic groups anticipate less job security in the future blacks and Hispanics are about twice as likely as whites to say workers will have more job security 24 of blacks and Hispanics say this compared with 9 of whites When asked more specifically about employee benefits in the future public views again skew negative Roughly one in five adults 22 say by 2050 the average working person in the U S will have better employee benefits than they do now About twice that share 41 say benefits will be worse than they are now and 36 say they will be about the same Views on benefits follow similar patterns to those on job security Men are more pessimistic than women and Democrats more downbeat than Republicans And again blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to say things will be better in the future Relatively few adults see an upside for workers from automation and new workplace technologies Roughly half 48 say these advances have mostly hurt American workers while only 22 say they have generally helped About three in ten 28 say automation through new technology has neither helped nor hurt There is a notable age gap in opinions on these changes in the workplace Adults 50 and older are more likely than their younger counterparts to say that automation has mostly hurt workers 55 vs 43 respectively In addition those with a high school degree or less education are more likely than those who attended college to see negative repercussions from new workplace technologies while blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to say these changes have helped workers Looking forward most Americans think automation will reshape the workplace but not necessarily for the better A large majority say 30 years from now robots and computers will do much of the work currently done by humans with 30 saying this will definitely happen and 52 saying it will probably happen Among those who say robots and computers will do much of the work currently done by humans in the future most think this will be a bad thing for the country 40 say this will be somewhat bad thing and 29 say it will be a very bad thing In spite of these negative predictions most workers do not believe that the type of work they currently do will be done by robots or computers in the future 24 say this will definitely not happen and 38 say it probably won t Still a quarter of workers say this probably will happen and 11 say it definitely will Workers with no college experience are among those most likely to say the kind of work they do will be done by robots or computers in the next 30 years 47 of those with a high school diploma or less education say this will happen compared with 38 of those with some college experience and 27 of those with a bachelor s or higher degree Lower income workers also are more likely to say their current work will be done by robots or computers 52 of those with an annual family income of less than 30 000 say this will happen in the future compared with 37 of those with family incomes between 30 000 and 74 999 and 26 among those with incomes of 75 000 or higher Americans have a negative view of the broader impact that automation will have on society Roughly three quarters of adults 76 say inequality between the rich and the poor will increase if robots and computers perform most of the jobs currently being done by humans This sentiment is widely held across most demographic groups Democrats 82 are somewhat more likely than Republicans to say that inequality will increase But even among Republicans 72 say this change is likely The public is also skeptical that more good jobs will be created if robots and computers play a bigger role in the workplace About two thirds of adults 66 doubt that the economy will generate many new better paying jobs if robots and computers mostly replace human labor twice the share that say better jobs will follow widespread implementation of these technologies Higher income adults and those with a bachelor s degree or more education are somewhat more optimistic that new technology will create better jobs But even among these groups majorities say greater automation in the workplace isn t likely to lead to an improved job picture in 30 years Previous research has shown that the vast majority of American workers believe it will be important if not essential for them to get training and develop new skills throughout their work life in order to keep up with changes in the workplace Most adults say the primary responsibility for providing workers with the necessary skills and training resides with the education system and individuals themselves rather than with government or employers When asked who should be most responsible over the next 30 years for making sure American workers have the right skills and training to get a good job about four in ten adults 39 point to the education system An additional 34 say the education system should be second most responsible Similar shares say individuals themselves bear the primary 39 or secondary 30 responsibility for ensuring that workers have the necessary training to get a good job By comparison the public is much less likely to say employers or government should play this role Only 11 of adults say employers should be most responsible for ensuring workers have the right skills and training and the same share say government should be most responsible Some 25 and 11 respectively say employers and government should have secondary responsibility in this area The public sees education playing an even bigger role when it comes to ensuring young adults have the skills and training they need to get a good job Roughly half 53 say the education system should be most responsible for providing young people with the necessary tools to succeed in the labor force while 32 say it should be up to young adults themselves Overall more than eight in ten adults look to the education system to play a primary or secondary role in preparing young people for the workforce About seven in ten say the onus should be on individuals themselves Again a relatively small share of the public says employers 5 or government 10 should bear the most responsibility for providing young adults with the skills and training they need About one in five say either government or employers should be mainly or secondarily responsible for training younger workers Blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to say government should be most responsible for making sure that workers have the right skills and training About one in five blacks 20 and Hispanics 19 look to government to play this role compared with 7 of whites And young adults are significantly more likely than their older counterparts to say the education system should be primarily responsible for this 50 of those ages 18 to 29 say this compared with four in ten or fewer among older age groups There are significant gaps by party on this measure A majority of Republicans 59 say individuals should have the most responsibility to ensure they are prepared for the workplace only 23 of Democrats say the same For their part Democrats are twice as likely as

Miguel Castilla Leave a CommentThe uncertainty of the future of work naturally raises a number of questions It is no wonder Argentina put it on the agenda as one of three priorities to be discussed at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires Will its impact be the same across the globe What jobs will be most affected What new skillsets will be required But above all how can governments prepare and what role can Multilateral Development Banks play All four leading regional development banks recently came together in Washington to present some key perspectives regarding the jobs of the future which can be found in the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives Here are a few worth considering On the one hand Emerging Europe Developing Asia Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean are witnessing how robotics automation and artificial intelligence are lowering costs and increasing productivity providing an opportunity for accelerated growth Countries like Estonia have taken the lead in digital technology youth in Nigeria and Ethiopia are harnessing technology to boost yields in agriculture in Vietnam and Bangladesh Information and Communication Technologies ICT is boosting the service industry and across Latin America and the Caribbean smartphone adoption is expected to reach beyond 70 by 2020 On the other hand as a result of this new wave of technological advances known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution a series of myths emerge that it is important to clarify Myth 1 All regions will be impacted in the same way The truth is that technology will be adopted at varying speeds depending on the region s economic development and demographic trends An aging population in Emerging Europe will face different challenges than Africa where 12 to 15 million young people enter the job market each year Myth 2 Mass unemployment is unavoidable The truth is that the jobless rate will be lower than originally expected Mass unemployment is unlikely to become a reality But the shifts in job opportunities will certainly require flexibility and access to new training tools which may in turn be provided by technology itself Myth 3 Automation will replace all human jobs and tasks The truth is that automation only takes place where it is both technically and economically feasible A human workforce will still be required in most sectors particularly those such as health and education At the same time it would be foolish to ignore the genuine threats of unemployment and increased income inequality that the rapid expansion of new technology will generate Above all as Multilateral Development Banks the question we need to be asking is how can governments ease the transition What can governments do to ensure that the largest number of people possible benefit from this transition Policymakers can take four actions to ease the adoption of technology while mitigating potentially adverse effects on jobs and incomes Multilateral Development Banks certainly have their own role to play not only by acting as think tanks for initiatives on how to capitalize on new technologies and mitigate their negative effects but also in coordinating global or regional policy responses strengthening partnerships between policymakers and employers to jointly identify and address challenges Our products and services will need to adapt A recent IDB health project in the Dominican Republic which uses drones to link remote rural clinics with hospital laboratories is a prime example of this Change will also take place within our workforce Outsourcing the IDB s human resources department from Washington to Costa Rica to ensure efficiency and reduce costs was certainly a step in the right direction It is important that we take the time to seriously identify the opportunities and risks the 21st century global job market presents so that together we can help shape the future of work In the meantime we must also remain relevant for our customer base and at the forefront of innovation Whether we succeed or not is up to all of us Downlaod the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives hereFiled Under Beyond development effectiveness Tagged With labor

confidently scurries to the door raises itself to the perfect height and then uses its appendage to press down the handle Pulling open the door the robot allows its mate to be first across the threshold before the two of them make their dash for freedom Such is the content of a short video by Boston Dynamics that has gone viral since it was released in February Reactions to it on social media have ranged from amusement soon they ll be opening our fridges and stealing our beer to alarm this is how we die It is the latest evidence of recent remarkable advances in robotics and artificial intelligence robots can now perform backflips and ride bicycles and machines empowered by AI are able to analyze X ray images better than expert radiologists and to teach themselves to play the ancient game of Go better than world champions Yet the dog clip is also powerful because it conjures up a more worrisome vision of robots on the loose beyond the control of us humans Thus it plays into a powerful angst laden contemporary narrative about technology and the future of work and maybe even of mankind itself What really are the risks from this new wave of technology And will the opportunities these advances bring with them outweigh those risks To address such questions about the future it is useful indeed necessary to look to the past Technology has for centuries both excited the human imagination and prompted fears about the effects Back in 1589 Queen Elizabeth I of England refused to grant a patent to a stocking frame invented by one William Lee because Her Majesty was concerned about the effect of the contraption on the livelihoods of those who knitted stockings by hand The Luddite weavers in Britain and silk workers in Lyons France famously staged revolts in the early 19th century against new automated looms that threatened their skilled and well paid jobs And in the realm of fiction imagination has run riot since the Czech writer Karel Capek coined the word robot from a Slavic word for work in his 1920 play Rossum s Universal Robots a k a RUR which ends with the destruction of mankind As one of Capek s characters explains Robots are not people Mechanically they are more perfect than we are they have an enormously developed intelligence but they have no soul Almost a century later that same concern about soulless hyper intelligence infuses not just movies like The Matrix and mind bending video series like Philip K Dick s Electric Dreams but also warnings about AI and its potential consequences expressed by Elon Musk and the late Stephen Hawking among others Back in the 1950s the German philosopher Martin Heidegger fretted about the risk that humans would become enslaved by the technologies we rely on With the rise of machines able to mimic many human traits from speech albeit still falteringly to facial recognition already significantly more accurately than humans that time appears to be much closer Yet when we switch from philosophy to economics we find a very different story a long historical record of innovation that shows technological change has been overwhelmingly positive for productivity and surprisingly benign when it comes to employment Job displacement has occurred in waves first with the structural shift from agriculture to manufacturing and then with the move from manufacturing to services Throughout productivity gains generated by new technology have been reinvested and the GDP bounce from that productivity eventually raises consumption and on balance increases the demand for labor In McKinsey s research we have sought to quantify this trend and its net impact in several ways For example we looked at the very big picture what happened to employment as productivity grew over the past 50 years We found no tradeoff between the two for 100 percent of continuous 10 year periods in the United States technologically driven productivity gains have gone hand in hand with rising employment Even when measured in one year snapshots productivity and employment have risen together four years in five The personal computer provides an iconic case to support the compatibility of technological progress with job growth We measured how many jobs were lost and how many gained in the United States between 1980 and 2015 as a result of the diffusion of computer technology Several hundred thousand bookkeepers and auditing clerks secretaries and typists did lose their jobs But the overall balance was strongly positive the desktop laptop computer created more than 19 million jobs in industries ranging from computer hardware to enterprise software to online retail sales against the loss of about 3 5 million jobs a net gain of 15 7 million That figure amounts to 18 percent of all the net U S employment created in the period almost one in five jobs Something similar happened with the invention of the automobile which destroyed the horse and buggy business but gave rise to a wealth of new sometimes unimagined products from petroleum based synthetic rubber to motels That said we ignore those left along the way at our peril For the many workers who are displaced painful transitions are a reality In Britain during the industrial revolution starting in about 1800 wages of the masses stagnated for almost a half century despite a strong surge in productivity that enriched the owners of capital a phenomenon often referred to as Engels pause because it was first noted by the German philosopher who co authored with Karl Marx The Communist Manifesto Wages picked up again as the fruits of productivity gains eventually trickled down to workers But eventually can be a long time the Luddites fears were not entirely unfounded And once again today the link between productivity gains and wage growth seems bent if not broken U S median hourly compensation rose only 11 percent from 1973 to 2016 even as hourly labor productivity grew by 75 percent While it is natural to focus on labor displacement through technology one element often overlooked in the discussion of the future of work is the number of jobs that are neither lost nor gained but fundamentally changed for reasons that are hard to predict History again provides some examples When ATMs became as common as vending machines in the 1970s the number of bank tellers actually increased That s because the new technology reduced the costs of processing individual transactions giving the banks incentives to open more branches to meet local demand for other financial services The tellers primary tasks changed from cashing checks and taking deposits to providing advice and selling securities mortgages and the like To be sure this tale is not yet complete with the rise of online banking the demand for tellers has again waned and so their numbers have thinned especially after the 2008 financial crisis But modern economies are nothing if not dynamic and the only certainty is change There s a similar story to be told about jobs and information technology Thanks to the internet and some ingenious software anyone can now dig up information at the blink of a cursor Yet the need for data analysis has exploded even as the need for data gathering clerks and the like has plummeted And so the number of information analysts of the genus homo sapiens has quintupled since 1980 to about two million today This largely comforting history isn t much help in determining whether this time will be different To the point the rise of ever more sophisticated technologies especially artificial intelligence that can be brought to bear on any number of tasks is likely to usher in a new age of rapid workforce transitions The McKinsey Global Institute recently estimated that in our fastest automation adoption scenario as many as 375 million workers worldwide or about 14 percent of the global workforce will need to switch occupational categories by 2030 in order to avoid obsolescence Even if the pace of adoption is slower as in our midpoint scenario some 75 million workers will need to switch occupational categories in the next 10 to 15 years Among the work most vulnerable to automation jobs that require routinized physical activity in a predictable setting and collecting and processing data Some aspects of the current technological transformation seem in line with that of previous eras the rise of computers for example and earlier epochs of technical change such as the diffusion of the steam engine that transformed work across multiple sectors of the economy simultaneously Every new wave of automation seems remarkable at the time and AI is not the first technology to chip away at cognitive tasks Since the birth of computerized spreadsheets in the 1980s machines have tackled ever more sophisticated problems that previously required human brainpower Still other aspects of the new technologies do seem qualitatively different from previous waves of innovation The rate of technological change today is strikingly rapid and while hard to measure appears to be accelerating Consider in this regard the development of deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques based on neural networks the exponential increase in computing capacity made available through the cloud and the sheer volume of data that can be generated These advances are driving AI for example enabling the development of autonomous vehicles but also heralding breakthrough applications such as a heightened ability to diagnose disease with non invasive techniques Accordingly the share of jobs that could be automated could also be larger than historical precedents suggest That said we see no evidence to date suggesting that the time it takes for new technologies to be diffused throughout the economy is shrinking Looking at a range of high value technologies over the past 60 years from airbags to MRI machines to smartphones we find that the pace of adoption hasn t changed It still takes between 5 and 16 years to reach 50 percent adoption and 5 to 28 years to reach 80 percent adoption Even highly popular social media applications do not beat this clock Facebook for example was begun in 2004 and had attracted more than 2 2 billion followers 13 years later but the untapped market remains vast Consider too that new technology is rarely applied to a blank canvas a variety of economic and social factors play a big role in determining the pace of adoption They include the cost of developing and deploying the hardware and software labor market dynamics the regulatory environment and social acceptance Computer algorithms in state of the art technology aircraft can do just about anything asked of them without a helping hand but we still insist on humans in the cockpit for peace of mind And who wants to be cared for in a hospital solely by a robot We remain disconcerted by the uncanny valley the term coined by the Japanese robotics guru Masahiro Mori to characterize that unsettling feeling people may experience when facing humanoid robots Indeed for tech luminaries ranging from the MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson to the former Google chairman Eric Schmidt the future of work looks set to be not a tale of machines replacing humans but of machines complementing humans in the workplace The rise of AI and the ascendance of self learned algorithms whose logic can be hard to explain pose some arguably unique problems A recent report from a who s who of experts on the malicious use of AI lists a number of the darkest scenarios from political manipulation through hyper personalized disinformation campaigns to a major increase in sophisticated computer hacking attacks For now AI pioneers including Google DeepMind s chief executive Demis Hassabis are clear that while machines are proving formidable in specific areas such as games we remain a long way away from the time when they will have mastered a general artificial intelligence enabling them to think and act like humans And a number of groups including Stanford University s AI100 with which I am associated are trying to look ahead to study and anticipate how AI will affect the way people live work and play long into the future The challenges here for policymakers and business leaders worldwide are significant We will need to institute retraining of workers on a scale we have not seen for generations We will need to rethink and adapt our social systems to help hundreds of millions of workers affected by the new technologies hopefully handling it better than we have handled globalization in providing both new forms of income and job transition support We will need to find ways to tame the wilder unpredictable side of AI For their part CEOs will need to rethink their organizational structures and processes to take advantage of the technologies and the performance enhancing effects they can have or risk ending up in the recycle bin of business history While all of this may seem intimidating it is still the best way forward We should embrace automation technologies for the productivity benefits they bring even as we deal proactively with the workforce transitions that will accompany adoption Given that demographic trends increased longevity low birth rates are rapidly increasing the dependent population our societies really need that productivity boost Beyond the prosperity and employment these technologies will create there will be other societal benefits new moonshots as we use the power of AI to tackle daunting problems from cancer to climate change We can already see one of the key challenges that of worker retraining or reskilling as some like to call it advancing to the top of the corporate agenda and in some countries also receiving renewed political attention In our recent work on the skills that will be needed by the workforce we found that demand will rise sharply not just for technological skills of all kinds but also for social and emotional skills that is leadership and empathy with customers as well as for higher cognitive skills linked to creativity and complex information processing Business leaders tell us that they believe finding the right talent to help implement automation is critical to their future financial performance and they expect companies to take the lead in the skills upgrade that is required Some firms are already putting in place large scale retraining initiatives AT T is using external education providers including for example Udacity At SAP the German enterprise software company the focus is on in house efforts to create learning journeys for thousands of employees including engineers who need to acquire softer skills as their roles change to service customers directly Walmart has set up more than 100 academies in the United States that provide hands on training for positions that include customer service managers and online grocery pickup While welcome these disparate retraining efforts are barely a start Given the scale of the occupational and skill shifts that we see coming in the next decade much more will need to be done and not just by business Governments and educational establishments working together with philanthropic foundations will of necessity be part of the mix Foundations have the advantage of being able to test innovative programs as pilots and will not face the disadvantage of concern that workers with new skills will subsequently jump ship for a new employer As a starter governments will need to reverse the 20 plus year decline in spending on labor related services no small task in light of tight government budgets and in the United States reflexive opposition to government intervention They will also need to be more flexible in order to adapt to the rapidly changing workplace Mobility is one key yet labor markets have become markedly less dynamic in recent years In the United States for example job reallocation rates have declined by 25 percent since 1990 This is the time to test ideas such as portable benefits that are owned by workers and not tied to particular jobs or companies Technology itself can help facilitate greater mobility especially digital platforms turbocharged by AI that enable matching of people to jobs But we also need to rethink some basic assumptions In order for changing jobs across sectors to become a common practice companies will need to agree on definitions and qualifications for specific skills And a major debate is overdue about credentialing Today higher education encourages the world to judge graduates by their subject knowledge rather than by their skills in problem solving and creative thinking skills that will be especially valuable in an AI enhanced workplace More than anything we need to prepare for this new era in which humans must work alongside smart machines far more intensively President Lyndon Johnson was prescient in this regard writing a half a century ago Automation is not our enemy Our enemies are ignorance indifference and inertia Automation can be the ally of our prosperity if we will just look ahead if we will understand what is to come and if we will set our course wisely after proper planning Back then nobody other than science fiction writers could have imagined robot dogs opening doors and escaping to wherever those androids from Blade Runner found refuge But LBJ s words resonate planning for change has never been more important 2019 Milken InstitutePrivacy NoticeShutterstockThere is a strange dichotomy at the moment surrounding the future of work In public political movements throughout the western world have seen populist campaigners railing against the threat to jobs from low wage migrants entering a country and outsourcing to low cost regions by multinationals What hasn t really been touched on is the impact automation might have on jobs in the future What began with the famous study from Oxford University academics Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne back in 2013 which highlighted the huge number of white and blue collar jobs that could be disrupted by automation has progressed to growing interest from governments around the world For instance a report by the British government s Science Technology Select Committee into AI examined the issue from a range of aspects from ethics to employment Watch on Forbes This was followed by a second report from the Chief Scientific Advisor to the British government which looked at the possible benefits to the state of an AI driven world in areas such as tax collection Further afield you have a recent report from the United Nations that looked at the disruptive possibilities of automation in the labor market It suggested that for now at least most of the disruption from automation will be in routine tasks and therefore the biggest impact will be in the developing world rather than the developed world Automation In AmericaDespite the rhetoric from the President elect it s perhaps no surprise that the White House has a view on this topic too and a recent report from the President s Council of Economic Advisors highlights the significant impact on professions such as driving What each of these reports have in common is their advocated response to the threat of automation All highlight the growing importance of education and the ability of people to adapt quickly to changes in the labor market We should not advance a policy that is premised on giving up on the possibility of workers remaining employed the White House paper says Our goal should be first and foremost to foster the skills training job search assistance and other labor market institutions to make sure people can get into jobs This is important because history tells us that technology and automation tend to create more jobs than they destroy but we don t tend to know what those jobs are yet Indeed the U S Department of Labor predicted a few years ago that around 65 of school children today will be employed in jobs that don t yet exist A Glass Half FullIt s also important because there is a backlash against globalization at the moment that is easy to imagine transferring its ire towards technology in the coming years The merits of globalization were quite aptly described by British economist Henry Martyn back in the 1700s He used the analogy of technological innovation to make his point and suggested that by using a tool a sawmill in his case we could perform the work of 30 men with the labor of two men Now of course we could employ those 30 men instead but that would be a waste of human resources The same is true for most technologies and whilst most would surely agree that technology is a force for good it s not an assumption that can be guaranteed Martyn went on to compare this with globalization and suggested that if another country can produce textiles for instance more efficiently than we can then it is akin to having a new technology to do likewise and we should jump at such an opportunity and instead deploy our resources to trade with that nation in areas that we can excel A Measured ResponseWhilst the White House report makes a number of measured responses including greater funding for adult education and an expanded welfare safety net the response of the new Trump administration is much less certain Whilst he currently blames immigration and free trade for the loss of jobs in America it s easy to imagine him flip flopping his attention onto automation if machines represent a more attractive target for him In reality the answers are largely the same in both instances whether it s providing greater support for lifelong learning supporting people to move where the jobs are and so on These responses do necessitate some action on behalf of those that are disrupted by technology however It s not enough to blame an external actor and hope to roll back change it requires one to take control and strive to learn the skills that give you a chance in the labor market This is a topic I ve covered a few times and whilst there is a growing appreciation for the urgency of such measures I can t help but feel that governments around the world are asleep at the wheel For more visit adigaskell org I am a free range human who believes that the future already exists if we know where to look From the bustling Knowledge Quarter in London it is my mission in life t By Mark Baillie 2018 05 24T09 00 34 143Z BusinessThe British government is keen to recognise the importance of artificial intelligence AI and automation in ensuring the long term future success of UK industry In line with this it has acknowledged that one of its grand challenges is putting the UK at the forefront of the AI and data revolution In fact comments from Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond have suggested that large swathes of government activity will soon be performed by AI and automation to free up time for human civil servants Automating some aspects of government jobs will result in savings and efficiencies However there are concerns that public sector workers will be at risk of losing their jobs to AI and automation in the next decade Think tank Reform estimated early last year that 250 000 of the UK s five million public sector workers risk losing jobs to AI and automation in the next 15 years Speaking to a House of Lords committee in 2017 Hammond said The government is looking at how it can apply artificial intelligence There are very significant areas of government activity which involve relatively low level decision making which will be highly susceptible to AI probably over a relatively short period of time which does present the tantalising possibility of being able to drive some real productivity enhancement in the delivery of government processes The truth is that automation in the public sector is already developing at a rapid pace New initiatives range from implementing AI and automation into day to day bureaucratic tasks such as form filling and applying for patents to using facial recognition technologies to verify the identity of individuals entering the UK But it s time to stop viewing AI and automation as an existential threat to our livelihoods Far from replacing people AI and automation will transform the workplace as menial tasks and some non routine jobs are digitalised through AI and process automation enabling greater efficiency while taking away some of the strain of day to day tasks In its industrial strategy report the UK government rightly realised we are at one of the most important exciting and challenging times in the history of global enterprise Importantly that report highlights that Britain is well placed to benefit from this new Industrial Revolution This digital revolution will be powered by humans increasing reliance on AI and automation Set to impact almost every sector of British industry AI and automation is here to stay Organisations are turning to digital transformation to boost innovation and enhance user experience and AI and automation will play a major role in this change While some jobs may disappear or evolve along the road to automation there is considerable opportunity for innovation and change AI and automation can give government departments both at the national and local level much faster access to sophisticated insights Combining this technology and big data will allow them to make better decisions more quickly for a greater number of citizens This ability to rapidly adapt to and drive new innovations is part of what allowed Britain to prosper and develop so quickly during the first industrial revolution After all as the government goes on to note in the industrial strategy report We are an open enterprising economy built on invention innovation and competition We have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business with high standards respected institutions and the reliable rule of law We have achieved near historic levels of employment We are a crossing point for the world because of our geographic position the English language our strong ties our openness to ideas and our vibrant culture Driving an automated future offers a wide range of benefits Not least is the prospect of boosting productivity across all of Britain s leading industries from high tech post industrial manufacturing through to the creative industries sector The UK s industrial strategy has already identified the four grand challenges in the years ahead as artificial intelligence and big data clean growth the future of mobility and meeting the needs of an ageing society Astute investments in AI and automation can enable huge productivity boosts UK consumers are already beginning to recognise that more organisations are embracing this technology and the advantages it can offer including within the public sector In fact after surveying 2 000 UK consumers on their attitudes towards AI and automation in government last year OpenText found that two thirds of UK citizens 66 per cent believe this technology will be introduced into government services within 20 years with 16 per cent claiming that this could happen in the next two years The same poll revealed less fear and uncertainty about the introduction of AI and automation in government than many headlines suggest The majority of those surveyed were not concerned about the implementation of this technology in government with over a quarter 26 per cent going as far as claiming AI and automated technologies would be able to make better decisions than most elected representatives though they would prefer for final decisions to be made by a human Many respondents recognised the immediate benefits of the technology A fifth 20 per cent felt that updating processes by bringing in AI and automation would lead to less admin and form filling Additionally 24 per cent pinpointed reduced waiting times as a major advantage while 19 per cent thought that there would be fewer errors in government as a result of the effective implementation of AI and automation This research shows increasing acceptance of AI and automation as a method to improve services but Britain still has some way to go to fully embrace its potential The UK ranked lowest 16 per cent across the countries surveyed when asked if AI and automated technology would be working in government in the next five years showing more hesitance around its uptake than countries such as France 24 per cent the Netherlands 28 per cent and the USA 22 per cent AI and automation will transform the workplace and bring a wide range of benefits to all sectors including the public sector With the potential to increase the speed efficiency and effectiveness of a wide range of government services AI and automated technologies cannot be ignored While the technology already exists the key challenge over the next few years will be gaining trust amongst both public sector employees and British citizens Mark Baillie director public sector UK Ireland OpenText Image

Facing the Future of Work Facing the Future of Work In the last few years it has felt like every big election has focused on jobs and the threats they supposedly face from trade from immigrants and most accurately from technology No wonder Until recently the forecasts were almost unanimously grim The robots were coming we were told and they d soon make us humans redundant In the summer of 2015 the Atlantic captured the panic with a cover story titled A World Without Work which warned that the moment when machines make workers obsolete may finally be arriving Then on March 18 of this year a self driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Tempe Arizona and the conversation began to shift Suddenly the fear that humans would soon be superfluous started to seem a little less likely Around the same time the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released a new study that gave intellectual and statistical heft to this idea Yes automation will supplant some workers the report found But not nearly as many as we once thought and not nearly as soon As a result what exactly we should expect work to look like in the future has now become a lot more complicated and the discussions about it much more nuanced Which is why Foreign Policy has devoted this special issue to making sense of the emerging reality While the questions still outnumber the answers a few themes have started to surface As Molly Kinder argues in Learning to Work With Robots new technologies will create both winners and losers Artificial intelligence won t eliminate human labor in some cases it will even produce new jobs But automation is rapidly changing the nature of work and governments must help workers adapt Ryan Avent explores this idea further In Then They Came for the Lawyers he shows how manual laborers won t be the only ones forced to contend with a shifting workplace AI will also change the lives of doctors teachers and other professionals Adaptation is key but it s not the only task ahead of us In Protect Yourself Before You Wreck Yourself Michael Lind warns that retraining workers won t be enough governments must also reshape their trade policies to reflect the new era Of course despite the new developments and the strategies meant to deal with them automation still poses plenty of risks In Closing the Factory Doors Christina Larson shows how automated factories by replacing human textile and other light manufacturing workers may deprive poor nations of a traditional route out of poverty But the key point is that the news is far from uniformly bad FP s Ravi Agrawal shows how the much criticized gig economy is proving a boon for the developing world see Why India Gives Uber 5 Stars And as FP s Rhys Dubin reminds us in There s No Such Thing as a Stable Career constant change has been a fact of life for as long as there has been work to do just ask lectors and longshoremen Indeed just about the only factor that has remained the same is humans ability to adjust to new circumstances and generally make their lives better in the process Big changes are coming and plenty of them But there s no reason to think we won t weather them in typical fashion by

might be If government is to remain relevant into the future its people need to think about their audiences every step of the way whatever their role But how do individual public servants with their own skills sets and natural abilities embrace a communications role Sue Cato perhaps Australia s leading issues management practitioner will join us in a facilitated discussion that will empower participants to start to realise their own individual potential to make strategic communication work for them their careers and the areas of public work for which they have responsibility We are living through a fundamental transformation in the way we work Automation and thinking machines are replacing human tasks changing the skills that organisations are looking for in their people But what will the future look like This isn t a time to sit back and wait for events to unfold To be prepared for the future you have to understand it In this session PwC will lead participants through a conversation about what the future of work could look like and how organisations and people can prepare for it now Technological innovations including always on connectivity artificial intelligence

employees wellbeing and create an experience that attracts retains and engages employees to help deliver business results 2018 Breakout Stream 2CitySmart built a digital platform called Reduce Your Juice that households want to use and the results prove the program creates behaviour change This is your chance to learn more about the program that cuts Australians power bills and trial the Reduce Your Juice app You ll also learn more about how this gamified approach and digital scaffold can be applied to other behaviours Program Note This session continues the Reduce Your Juice story that began in session 1A but it is not necessary to have attended that session to get all the benefits and insights from this session The future for policymaking will be a compact between government business and the community to resolve real world problems together More meaningful engagement with expertise in the community can only help to address the complex issues of trust and enhance confidence in public policy solutions Industry Secretary Heather Smith 2018 IPAA address US based CB Insights recently released research that connecting professional expertise that is outside the

develop more innovative creative and unique solutions to complex problems They provide an opportunity for policy innovators to work at a state national and international level to leverage its unique strengths across a range of private and public sector challenges Based in Brisbane Australia and with over 13 300 community experts and growing MindHive is the world s first crowdsourcing consultancy An Airbnb for brains it s aim is to disrupt the 145B consulting world This session will explore the technologies of expertise engaging crowds shared intelligence collaborative problem solving and strategy co design including a series of case studies drawn from across Mindhive and other idea innovation platforms Program Note The story of MindHive s evolution as a collaborative policy and strategy startup continues in Breakout 3B in a session focused on the digital platform and its future ambitions Many jurisdictions nationally and internationally are already using sustainability concepts to springboard new business models and transform their economies across ideas such as the circular economy But while multinationals and local communities alike are seeing economic environmental and social returns in many ways the core of this model is an innovation based on trust This session will explore the concept of the circular economy using a series of case studies to demonstrate the change that is already happening and changing our society and the way its institutions work from one based on take make and dispose to one that is restorative and regenerative by design The fast pace of digital change is re shaping today s workforce PwC research indicates there will be net job creation from technology however there is an increasing consensus across thought and practice leaders that it s time to get practical about assisting all workers to adapt to the digital age The task of retraining talent goes beyond digital upskilling 87 of Australia s CEOs either agree or strongly agree that they need to strengthen the soft skills of employees alongside their digital skills Human skills such as creativity flexibility agility problem solving collaboration adaptability and emotional intelligence are skills that can t be automated and therefore there is much value to gain from harnessing these skills in employees This session will distil the shift towards automation and AI in workplaces generally and the public sector in particular and use this as the beginning of a constructive even personal conversation A conversation that acknowledges and de mystifies their potential and facilitates a way to embrace the competitive advantage for individuals and organisations alike from developing skills that complement and leverage an integrated AI HI

the concept through a digital platform has been central to ensuring the viability of the original concept With MindHive 2 0 a new crowdsourcing and networking platform nearing launch participants will have the opportunity to observe how the theoretical and practical challenges were resolved and have the opportunity to experience the potential for policy and strategy development through the MindHive methodology firsthand To many minds the rise of technology and the state of the environment have a relationship that is parallel at best and inverse at worst A rise in one has too often been seen as necessarily having to come at the cost of the other But advances in technology from 3D printing to social media to big data are fundamental enablers to many of the facets of circular economy How can government enable and capitalise on this shift across portfolios as diverse as energy infrastructure social services and foreign aid This session will combine case studies with practical experience to

when it comes to experiences Government and Enterprise are in the midst of the biggest call to action that we ve had in the last century and it s all coming down to one word Trust This is the new augmented world of humanity and technology fused together at the very core It s also more exciting than ever Just remember this though New world means new rules Global Futurist Chris Riddell will take you on an incredible journey unlocking exciting insights into human change the mega trends of beyond tomorrow and what true innovation in government looks like Welcome to a new Beyond Tomorrow Leaders and organisations are in an overheating crucible of radical transformation showing up their vulnerabilities and lack of agility It is a world characterised by increasing Variety Interdependency Complexity Change Ambiguity Seamlessness and Sustainability VICCASS These exponential changes challenge the established models and approaches of leadership and require very different capabilities and mindsets Leaders need to think differently behave differently and react differently We need to identify leaders early for their agility creativity ability to lead and connect people and teams their thinking patterns and their systems thinking Senior leaders should be measured on their ability to cut through bureaucracy to enable change their ability to create counter intuitive insights and their courage in challenging the norm It s time to change our thinking on who is a leader how they are trained and in what ways they are rewarded and supported Let s rethink reexamine and redesign leadership development and get the right people into leadership roles now while we still can 2018 Breakout Stream 4Most people interested in the field of innovation have heard of agile innovation teams These small entrepreneurial groups are designed to stay close to customers and adapt quickly to changing conditions When implemented correctly they have a reputation for almost always result in higher team productivity and moral faster time to market better quality and lower risk than traditional approaches can achieve But while agile methods caught on first in IT departments and are now widely used in software development the agile approach has potential to transform the public sector in ways far beyond better bits and bytes Conditions are ripe for agile teams in any situation where problems are complex solutions are at first unclear project requirements are likely to change and close collaboration with end users is feasible a description that matches many facing a wide variety of public sector activities This session will provide participants with an opportunity explore what the world of agile can teach them about themselves their work and their potential to serve their clients better whatever their role It will confront some of the common myths and misconceptions about agile and demonstrate how an agile approach can enable teams to deliver sooner and scale faster through a proven learning culture that builds and strengthens the team and its capabilities Navigating today s increasingly complex and volatile business terrain requires deep reservoirs of tenacity optimism and hardiness This session will equip participants with the ability to fundamentally and permanently strengthen their personal resilience by exploring elements of one of the world s most

before it s released Consumer research focuses on generalisations rather than diversity And community engagement processes struggle to reach enough people to uncover local nuances Every day millions of Australians create valuable data online that paints a picture about the places they visit and what they value Neighbourlytics harvests this rich user generated data to help city makers understand the unique identity of the places they plan build and manage Neighbourlytics is a social analytics platform for neighbourhoods pioneering the use of social data to help city makers across Australia understand the unique identity and local nuances of communities This session will not only serve as a deep dive into the practical reality of big data and data innovation for public sectors

NetworkCopyright 2000 2019 Cvent Inc All rights reserved From TV shows like Black Mirror to McKinsey Oxford OECD and Brookfield Institute studies many views of the impact of technology particularly automation on the future of jobs and society is bleak We are told stories of automation that will eliminate broad swaths of jobs opening up opportunity for some and having catastrophic effects for others like non college educated workers Brookfield Institute s The Talented Mr Robot 2016 estimates that nearly 42 of the employed Canadian labour force is at a high risk 70 or higher probability of being affected by automation over the next 10 to 20 years Some speculate like futurist Thomas Frey 2014 that hundreds of new types of jobs resulting from emerging technologies capabilities and needs will emerge to employ those people NESTA predicts that around one tenth of the workforce are in occupations that are likely to grow as a percentage of the workforce Around one fifth are in occupations that will likely shrink This latter figure is much lower than recent studies of automation have suggested This means that roughly seven in ten people are currently in jobs where we simply cannot know for certain what will happen It is clear there is not a consensus on what the overall job loss or creation impact of emerging technologies could be with wide ranging estimates of across sectors Further while predictions for job loss like these abound there are far fewer organizations working on envisioning the future of work and the jobs of the future that will employ the workforce of the future as current jobs are changed by automation and other emerging technologies This is where I ve focused my research with my digitalHKS research fellowship Since January 2018 I ve been collaborating with Bill Eggers and Amrita Datar from the Deloitte Center for Government insights to humanize the future of work and visualize the impact of technology on jobs to empower organizations employees and individuals to create a more positive future This week at MIT s EmTech NEXT Conference Bill and I debuted some of the early products and methods we ve developed together including a Future of Government Work Gallery Walk This gallery walk featured four government jobs of the future depicted through futuristic art text and storytelling including Child Aid Coordinators of the future are smart connected and always prepared the deliver on their mission protecting vulnerable children They safeguard the rights of children and intervene in cases of abuse neglect or ill treatment Garrison Commander of the future uses analytical software virtual reality training tools and secure communications to ensure a smoothly functional military installation that service members family members and civilian employees are proud to call home Mobility Platform Managers of their future and their teams are responsible for managing the city s integrated multimodal transportation network and ensuring the seamless movement of people and vehicles They supervise advanced AI systems that power the mobility platform Public Health and Safety Guardians of the future use the power of data cognitive technologies and their public health expertise to protect the health and safety of citizens The Gallery Walk exhibition seeks to invite observers to consider how emerging technologies will enable government work to become more impactful and productive increase decision making capability and better support the overall wellbeing of the employee while focusing on the core building block of the future of work the individual person doing the job The exhibition seeks to humanize the work transformation we might expect to see by 2025 This work demonstrates that not only new jobs will be created but some existing jobs will change in very real ways that we also need to be prepared for It also provides a story that both employees and employers can relate to in order to help encourage real discussion about these futures and enable people to visualize how they might start to approach those possible destinations Our work reverses the current tendency to go from generalizations about changing technology to assumptions about broad job classifications and instead starts with specifics about particular jobs for a more concrete understanding of what could happen in the workplace The Gallery Walk is just a taste of what we re working on We ve been busy developing content examples of jobs of the future and a method for developing jobs of the future and engagement approaches such as workshops and the gallery walk to encourage engagement and discussion around that content Developing proactive and productive tools for designing the future of work is both timely and important According to McKinsey 375 million workers or roughly 14 percent of the global workforce may need to switch occupational categories as digitization automation and advances in artificial intelligence disrupt the world of work In terms of magnitude it s akin to coping with the large scale shift from agricultural work to manufacturing that occurred in the early 20th century in North America and Europe and more recently in China The task confronting every economy particularly advanced economies will likely be to retrain and redeploy tens of millions of mid career middle age workers As the MGI report notes there are few precedents in which societies have successfully re trained such large numbers of people Both employers and employees will need to own their continued education and skill development in order to fill the jobs of the future Thus employers and employees will need to be given tools to envision the jobs of the future in a more visceral way so we can move towards them as a realistic destination Today society has an opportunity to design a better future given the transformation in jobs and way of working that is coming a future where workers aren t just more productive but where their individual well being is better cared for in a job Emerging technologies will change existing jobs as well as create brand new ones It will affect almost everyone you me our family our neighbors Its time humanize the discussion to one beyond an economic discussion about workforce and labour The individual people that will be affected by this change should also be engaged in this discussion The content and engagement approaches that I ve been developing through my digitalHKS fellowship in partnership with Deloitte are a few ways I believe we can start increasing the diversity of voices in the discussion about the future of work You can hear more about our call to put people back at the center of the future of work discussion in the talk I delivered at EmTech NEXT here https events technologyreview com video watch jenn gustetic harvard people future work Powered by SquarespaceCommentFor many people artificial intelligence conjures up images of sci fi movies and the future They see it as a threat to their jobs and sometimes even their safety but AI represents the biggest leap forward in terms of work productivity since the personal computer and few other industries can benefit from AI as much as government With AI we can change the way government works and help employees do their job better AI is already integrated into numerous cloud platforms and can be used to discover new information and deliver outcomes instantly I like to refer to this as practical AI AI has the potential to improve employee experiences by speeding up decision making and automating mundane and repetitive tasks Bringing machine learning to everyday work enables government agencies and departments to make better decisions faster because they do not have to hunt for data and aggregate it into a spreadsheet By building intelligence into platforms AI helps manage complex workflows and allows organizations to One way that AI will be applied in the workplace is automating service requests Most companies have an IT service desk as well as a customer support center These functions ensure that customers and employees receive help in a timely manner whether it is a request for a new computer a password reset or the status of a repair Manually triaging thousands of incidents or cases categorizing tasks and routing work can consume resources introduce human error and slow resolution In fact a new report from Accenture found that customer support functions spend up to 12 percent of their time categorizing prioritizing and assigning tickets Meanwhile AI accurately categorizes requests nearly instantly It eliminates the bottleneck created by agents having to manually assign categorize and route requests A full two days a week is wasted on manual administrative work according to the recent State of Work survey conducted by ServiceNow If an agency with 5 000 people automated those processes they could get 4 million work hours back a year Adding AI frees up employees to do the work they want to do spurring creativity Nearly half of respondents 48 percent said work levels increased by 20 percent or more after they adopted AI solutions Additionally 91 percent of executives say their skilled employees spend too much time on admin tasks and 93 percent believe that reducing mundane tasks unleashes employee creativity To properly implement AI solutions across government agencies we need to define which tasks are best suited for humans and which ones should be performed by AI The government has a term inherently governmental to describe work processes or decisions that must be done by government employees Contractors do much of the work in our government agencies but certain work is inherently governmental in nature As we move into an age defined by AI we need to identify and define the work processes and decisions that are inherently human We are going to increasingly work in a blended workplace with AI systems and humans working together to achieve a mission There are certain activities within any work environment that can only be performed or should only be performed by humans While there may be many more human activities designated as inherently human in the beginning I believe that as humans become more comfortable with the role of AI in the blended workforce less and less work will be designated as inherently human There will always be a need for humans to remain in charge from factual responsibility and liability aspects as well as from emotional and psychological ones We spend a third of our lives at work It shapes who we are how we feel and how we interact with the world so we must create great work experiences and this is what AI does AI creates work experiences that unleash productivity bringing out the best in us Rather than fearing machines stealing jobs we need to understand how AI will change the way government works though small but practical ways and prepare the

need to fully process data integrate with existing legacy systems and effectively communicate with their stakeholders and citizens while enforcing security privacy and regulations compliance Government workforces are taking on increased workloads with increased expectations and under increased scrutiny while relying on dated and disconnected technology systems to make it all work Enter Intelligent Automation By combining the power of artificial intelligence AI robotic process automation RPA business process management BPM and integration government agencies can address speed process improvement quality accuracy and even the citizen experience At all levels of government automating processes allows time to focus on high value strategic initiatives But in order to enhance programs and services government agencies must first understand how to harness intelligent automation to reap maximum benefits Here are a few benefits that agencies are already seeing with each technology Robotic Process Automation Public sector agencies are finding that RPA bots are valuable for automating mundane repetitive tasks such as cutting and pasting data from one system to another These tools can work with existing IT systems making them a great way to get started Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence AI can solve a number of challenges that the public sector faces today Governments are already implementing AI to improve the quality of citizen engagement and deliver cost savings through chatbots Business Process Management When used effectively BPM can uncover process inefficiencies and improve the quality of end to end processes while also ensuring regulatory compliance and improving government services to citizens by making it easier to modify decision rules and

DEBUG:root:WRITTEN BY Charlie Tierney Steve Cottle Katie JorgensenWind back the clock to 1971 Jane a freshly minted college graduate joins the government as a clerk Jane s work consists largely of entering information into databases and creating reports which requires her to spend the better part of her work day seated at a terminal near a mainframe computer that fills an entire room Jane and her colleagues are expected to be at their desks from 9 a m to 5 p m five days a week Jane is grateful to have a steady 9 to 5 job and plans to spend her entire career with her agency Flash forward 40 years and meet Jane s grandson Ian He carries a slim tablet wherever he goes which has more computing power than the mainframe with which Jane worked Ian is constantly tethered to the Internet and works 24 7 from wherever he is Ian expects to switch from project to project and office to office as his career develops and his interests evolve If he feels he has reached the limit of his ability to learn or grow in one role he will look elsewhere for a new opportunity What if the government could give Ian the opportunities and experiences he seeks The GovCloud concept proposed in this paper would restructure government workforces in a way that takes advantage of the talents and preferences of workers like Ian who are entering the workforce today The model is based on a large body of research from interviews with public and private sector experts to best practices from innovative organizations both public and private This is the first generation of people that work play think and learn differently than their parents They are the first generation to not be afraid of technology It s like the air to them Don Tapscott author of Grown Up DigitalThis report details trends in work and technology that offer significant opportunities for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the government workforce It lays out the GovCloud model explaining how governments could be organized to take advantage of its flexibility It examines how work would be performed in the new model and discusses potential changes to government HR programs to support GovCloud Other sections provide resources for executives including a tool to help determine cloud eligibility steps they can take to pilot the cloud concept and future scenarios illustrating the cloud in action The GovCloud model represents a dramatic departure from the status quo It is bound to be greeted with some skepticism Without such innovation however governments will be left to confront the challenges of tomorrow with the workforce structure of yesterday The details of the GovCloud model are open for debate The purpose of this paper is to jumpstart that debate Forty years ago more than half of employed American adults worked in either blue collar or clerical jobs Today less than 40 percent work in these same categories and the share continues to shrink 1 Jobs requiring routine or manual tasks are disappearing while those requiring complex communication skills and expert thinking are becoming the norm 2 Increasingly employers seek workers capable of creative and knowledge based work We should ask ourselves whether we re truly satisfied with the status quo Are our workday lives so fulfilling and our organizations so boundlessly capable that it s now pointless to long for something better Gary Hamel author of The Future of ManagementThe next generation of creative knowledge workers has already entered the job market These Millennials came of age in a rapidly and radically changing world They are the first true digital natives They have grown up with instant access to information through technology As such Millennials have considerably different expectations for the kind of work they do and the information they use The pursuit for variety in work has led Millennials to cite simply needing a change as their top reason for switching jobs 3Advances in technology have also changed the actual ways in which people perform work The ability to crowdsource tasks is one example of this change Since its founding in 2001 volunteers have produced and contributed to over 19 million articles in 281 languages on Wikipedia 4 Built around this concept a burgeoning industry is developing around microtasking dividing work up into small tasks that can be farmed out to workers Amazon s Mechanical Turk rolled out in 2005 allows users to post tasks to a platform where registered workers can accept and complete them for a small fee When this paper was written more than 195 000 tasks were available on Mechanical Turk 5Such technologies may offer suitable possibilities for the public sector Microtask a Finnish cloud labor company maintains Digitalkoot a program that helps the Finnish National Library convert its image archives into digital text and correct existing errors It does so with volunteered labor participants simply play a game in which they are shown the image of a word and then must type it out to help a cartoon character cross a bridge In doing so they are turning scanned images into searchable text greatly improving the search accuracy of old manuscripts 6 At present more than 100 000 people have completed over 6 million microtasks associated with this project 7As the pace of computing power and machine learning increases professors Frank Levy and Richard Murnane contend that more tasks will move from human to computer processing 8 Skeptics need look no further than IBM s Watson a computer that can answer questions posed in natural language In February 2011 Watson defeated two all time champions of the quiz show Jeopardy This was not solely a publicity stunt IBM hopes to sell Watson to hospitals and call centers to help them answer questions from the public 9Around the globe more and more governments are looking to increase telework among employees In 2010 the U S government passed legislation calling for more telework opportunities for government employees Likewise the Australian government in order to attract and retain information and communications technology workers instituted a teleworking policy in 2009 requiring agencies to implement flexible work plans 10 Other countries including Norway and Germany are also focusing on flexible work arrangements to improve public sector recruiting 11 In Canada the government has an official telework policy that recognizes changes are occurring in the public service workforce with a shift towards more knowledge workers and encourages departments to implement telework arrangements 12Cloud definitionsCloud computing Internet based computing whereby shared resources software and information are provided to computers and other devices on demand like

or community through an open call to a large group of people a crowd asking for contributions WikipediaGovCloud A new model for government based on team collaboration whereby workforce resources can be surged to provide services to government agencies on demand GovLabSource Frank Levy and Richard J Murnane The New Division of Labor How Computers are Creating the Next Job Market Princeton Princeton University Press 2004 p 50 Figure 1 Trends in routine and non routine tasks in the U S 1960 200213These are all powerful steps in the right direction for employees whose natural work rhythms are not locked into 9 to 5 Some companies have taken telework one step further British Telecom is pushing the concept of agile working through its Workstyle Project where employees decide what work arrangements best suit them rather than a rigid definition by location and hours BT Workstyle is one of the largest flexible working projects in Europe with over 11 000 home based workers BT has found that its home enabled employees are on average 20 percent more productive than their office based colleagues 14Similarly U S electronics retailer Best Buy experimented with a Results Only Work Environment ROWE In a ROWE what matters is not whether employees are in their office but rather that they complete their work and achieve measurable outcomes In a ROWE salaried employees must put in as much time as is actually needed to do their work no more no less The decline in routine and manual tasks and the rise of new ways of working is not isolated to the private sector In 1950 the U S federal workforce largely comprised clerks performing repetitive tasks About 62 percent performed these tasks while only 11 percent performed more white collar work By 2000 those relationships were reversed Fifteen percent performed repetitive tasks compared to 56 percent in the white collar categories 16 Similarly in 1944 the number of workers in the UK civil service considered industrial totaled 505 000 By 2003 this number fell to 18 200 with non industrial workers reaching 538 000 in 2004 17 And in Canada in 2006 knowledge based workers represented 58 percent of federal workers in the Core Public Administration up from 41 percent 11 years earlier 18The swelling ranks of non industrial government workers indicate a shift in public sector jobs toward creative collaborative and complex work The workforce structure however designed for clerks of the last century remains largely the same With limited flexibility to distribute resources governments often address change by creating new agencies and programs This can be seen following major events like the outbreaks of the Avian flu and SARs in the past decade 9 11 and the financial crisis of 2008 Source United States Office of Personnel Management A Fresh Start for Federal Pay A Case for Modernization April 2002 p 5 http www opm gov strategiccomp whtpaper pdfFigure 2 The changing U S federal workforce 1950 200015Given increasing budgetary pressures and burgeoning national debts the conventional model of creating new agencies or permanent structures in response to new challenges is unsustainable This is exacerbated by our inability to accurately predict future needs and trends Consider a 1968 Business Week article proclaiming that the Japanese auto industry isn t likely to carve out a big share of the market for itself or the president of Digital Equipment Corporation who in 1977 said t here is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home 19The world is full of experts who attempt to predict the future and fail 20Instead of endeavoring to predict the future governments can choose to create a flexible workforce that can quickly adapt to future work requirements To accomplish this the government can learn from a game changing concept in the technology world cloud computing Major organizations and small startups alike increase their flexibility by sharing storage space information and resources in a cloud allowing them to quickly scale resources up and down as needed Why not apply the cloud model to people The creation of a government wide human cloud could provide significant benefits including A cloud based government workforce or GovCloud could include workers who perform a range of creative problem focused work Rather than being slotted into any single government agency cloud workers would be true government wide employees This section outlines the organizational structure of the GovCloud model which rests on three main pillars a cloud of government workers thin executive agencies and shared services Most government workforce models tend to constrain workers by isolating them in separate agencies Consider the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom and the subsequent slaughter of more than 6 million pigs sheep and cattle The problem of an impacted food supply is complicated In most countries multiple agencies focus on agriculture food production and public health In the United Kingdom the army and even tourism ministries were impacted by the outbreak as agencies became overwhelmed by the number of animals in need of disposal and by the cordoning off of tourist areas to prevent the spread of the disease Yet the structure of government agencies often confines employees to work in information silos creating inherent operational inefficiencies In a cloud workforce model experts in each area could be pulled together to support remedies and propose coordinated corrective measures I want someone saying Did you know that the Ministry of Justice is doing that or could you piggy back on what the communities department is doing or had you thought about doing it in this way You ve got to get away from thinking about centralized command and control Dame Helen Ghosh Permanent Secretary UK Home Office 21The FedCloud modelThe GovCloud model could become a new pillar of government comprising permanent employees who undertake a wide variety of creative problem focused work As needed the GovCloud model could also take advantage of those outside government including citizens looking for extra part time work full time contractors and individual consultants Cloud workers would vary in background and expertise but would exhibit traits of free agent workers self sufficient self motivated employees who exhibit a strong loyalty to teams colleagues and clients Daniel Pink author of Drive The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us argues that 33 million Americans one quarter of the workforce already operate as free agents 22According to the white paper Lessons of the Great Recession from Swiss staffing company Adecco contingent workers those who chose non traditional employment arrangements23 are expected to eventually make up about 25 percent of the global workforce 24These more autonomous workers according to Pink are better suited to 21st century work and are more productive even without traditional monetary incentives 25The fluid nature of the cloud can provide significant benefits The nature of the cloud teams forming and dissolving as their tasks require encourages workers to focus on specific project outcomes rather than ongoing operations Thin agency structures could lead to Greater use of shared services could allow the federal government to The need to support some ongoing missions will remain of course These missions will be carried out by thin agencies Under the cloud concept federal agencies would remain focused on specific missions and ongoing oversight These agencies however would become thinner as many of their knowledge workers transfer into the cloud Thin agencies could also create opportunities to streamline organizations with overlapping missions Employees working in thin agencies could fall into two main categories GovCloud could change the highest levels of public sector workers as we know them today The Senior Executive Service in the United States Permanent Secretaries and Directors General in the United Kingdom and Australia all such senior officials could rotate between agencies shared services and the cloud which would reflect the original intent behind many of these high level offices giving executives a breadth of experience in roles across government to help develop shared values and a broad perspective An important benefit of rotation would be the ability to tap into cloud networks to assemble high performing teams To further focus agencies on specific missions many of their back office support functions could be pulled into government wide shared service arrangements The use of shared services in government has come and gone in waves usually dictated by fiscal necessity Most countries in Europe as part of their e government strategies have placed increased focus of late on developing shared services whether through an executive agency or a CIO as well as working with EU coordination activities And while the decentralized governments of some EU countries such as Germany make shared services more difficult these countries are using states and agencies to pilot innovative approaches 27Other efforts around the world include the U S e Government Act of 2002 which examined how technology could be used to cut costs and improve services More recently the New Zealand government appointed an advisory group in May 2011 to explore public sector reform to improve services and provide better value In their report Better Public Services the advisory group recommended the use of shared services to improve effectiveness in a variety of government settings including policy advice and real estate 29 Following up on this three New Zealand agencies the Department of the Prime Minister the State Services Commission and the Treasury announced in December 2011 that they would share such corporate functions as human resources and information technology 30 And though shared services in Western Australia were shut down other projects in South Australia are moving ahead and already showing savings 31In August 2011 the government of Canada announced the launch of Shared Services Canada a program that seeks to streamline and identify savings in information technology Among its first targets is something as mundane as email But with more than 100 different email systems being used by government employees the potential savings and boost to efficiency could be significant Not only do these incompatible systems cost money by requiring individual departments to negotiate and maintain separate licenses and technical support it also makes it difficult for government employees to communicate with one another and with the public And with no single standard ensuring the security of information transmitted over email becomes more challenging Shared Services Canada will move the government to one email system as well as consolidate data centers and networks ultimately looking for anticipated savings of between CA 100 million and CA 200 million annually 28While the idea of using shared services is not a novel one it is central to the GovCloud model The GovCloud model envisions building upon effective practices and those shared services already in operation to deliver services like human resources information technology finance and acquisitions government wide Workers in these shared services would include subject matter experts in areas like human resources and information technology as well as generalists who support routine business functions The potential for shared services continues to grow As seen with IBM s Watson and Microtask s Digitalkoot new technologies provide an opportunity to accelerate the automated delivery of basic services Some agencies already have begun capitalizing on these trends For example NASA has moved its shared service center website to a secure government cloud facilitating greater employee self service and helping to reduce demand on finite call center resources 32This decision tool is designed to help leaders determine which employees are appropriate for each of the three structures in the GovCloud model the cloud thin agencies and shared services To the cloud GovCloud Project LifecycleManaging employees in the cloud will require governments to reinvent human resource management Individual and team performance evaluations career development pay structures and benefits and pensions would need to change to support GovCloud This section examines possibilities for HR reinvention including performance management career development workplace flexibility and benefits Employees working in the cloud would require an alternative to determine pay and career advancement The government could take its cues from the gaming world and evaluate cloud workers with a point system The manager as we know it will disappear to be replaced by a new sort of business operative whose expertise is assembling the right people for particular projects Daniel Pink author of Free Agent Nation 33An HR management system that incorporates the accumulation of experience points XP through effective work on cloud projects training education and professional certifications could replace the tenure centric models for cloud employees As employees accumulate XP they could level up and take on additional responsibilities in future projects Workers in the cloud could earn XP in four ways After some high profile incidents slow responses to outbreaks of foot and mouth disease flooding that may have been preventable and a farming subsidy system that seemed to result in more chaos than aid the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs DEFRA was looking to reinvent itself In 2006 the department launched DEFRA Renew One of its key goals was to bring the department s policymaking closer to actual delivery to create more responsive processes Organized mainly by policy with fixed teams DEFRA had been unable to redeploy resources as needed in response to a crisis As part of DEFRA Renew a new operating model was implemented that used flexible resourcing where staff were assigned to specific projects for fixed periods This allowed management to measure and build the required capabilities and competencies needed and to allocate resources efficiently to improve overall service quality New roles were also created to support sustainable staff development and resource management in the new model To create buy in for such a fundamental culture shift within the department a facilitative approach to decision making was employed Change management programs and mentoring were extended to all levels of the department including leadership New mechanisms such as approval panels for resources and the use of business cases also worked to push changes among staff and promote collaborative behavior DEFRA Renew was widely recognized as a key enabler in the department meeting required efficiency improvement targets set by the UK government DEFRA moved to a more project based approach with fewer staff in core teams According to Dame Helen Ghosh former Permanent Secretary of DEFRA they could be more responsive now that the management board won t be made up of director generals with individual policy silos 34Just as XP could be gained through learning new skills it could be lost in the following three ways Any serious discussion about creating a new class of government employees requires a fresh look at employee benefits and compensation For example XP could be used to help determine workers salaries but additional research into alternative pension and benefit programs is needed While any discussion on compensation could be contentious a healthy debate among stakeholders from across the government should be welcomed As new roles emerge in the cloud so too could new career paths Career emphasis could move away from time served in a particular pay grade and toward milestones that are meaningful for employee development Each worker may have different career aspirations For instance not all workers aspire to management some may seek to master a particular subject area instead Career advancement in the cloud would not equate to moving up a ladder but rather moving along a lattice Lattice GovCloud ModelHere s how the lattice could work for Ian who we met in the introduction Think of the lattice as a jungle gym The best opportunities to broaden your experience may be lateral or even down Look every which way and swing to opportunities Pattie Sellers Fortune editor at largeCathleen Benko and Molly Anderson the authors of The Corporate Lattice argue that the corporate ladder is giving way to a lattice that accommodates flatter more networked organizations improves the integration of career and life focuses on competencies rather than tenure and helps increase workforce loyalty 35 The lattice metaphor allows employees to choose many ways to get ahead It is unlikely that all workers will thrive in the new GovCloud environment right out of the gate As such it would be important to assess a worker s readiness before placing her in GovCloud and providing training on core competencies critical to cloud success There could also be opportunities to start workers especially those at earlier stages of a career within an agency or shared service to build up expertise in some area before graduating to the cloud Once in the cloud new workers could be paired with mentors who are more experienced to help navigate the cloud experience itself There should be an emphasis on continuous learning in the cloud It would be important for cloud workers to continue to refine their skills develop additional expertise and adapt to new ways of working Not only could continuous learning affect workers career mobility by increasing the depth and breadth of their skills but it could also impact their salary and level by increasing their XP Learning and development in the cloud could take on many themes of next learning Next learning focuses on creating personalized learning experiences that leverage the latest technologies and collaborative communities to deliver education and learning programs that build knowledge bases and promote learning as a focus and passion not just a checkbox in a career 36To broaden cloud worker skills and the ability to handle multiple tasks and work on a variety of projects cloud learning could include the following principles 37In the cloud careers and expertise will be built in new ways and work will be something we do rather than a place we go to As such the cloud will give workers more control over their schedules and workloads By creating a flexible workplace governments could shed a significant amount of physical infrastructure and create shared workspaces Many buildings could be converted into co located spaces teams could use collaboration spaces or videoconferencing centers Some workers might rarely set foot in a government building instead conducting cloud tasks at home and interacting with project teams virtually With advancing communications and mobile technology distance no longer hinders collaboration It no longer matters whether all workers are at an office between 9 a m and 5 p m what matters is whether project teams produce results and whether everyone contributes A more flexible workplace could also take advantage of resources governments might not otherwise have access to Some retiring workers may not want to quit working altogether and a flexible model could be an enticing way to keep their expertise on retainer Alternatively the model could take advantage of would be government employees unwilling to relocate or unable to work a regular schedule By increasing flexibility governments could increase their available resource pool allowing agencies to access the skills and knowledge they need when they need it For an example of how a retiree could interact with the cloud see Appendix C National Security Case Study Don t think governments will ever take to the cloud At the U S Department of State the idea could soon be a reality The Office of eDiplomacy is preparing to pilot a cloud component to its e internship model for American students as part of the Virtual Student Foreign Service VSFS beginning this year The VSFS currently offers e internships to U S university students of multiple month duration By using a new micro volunteering platform State Department offices and embassies around the world will be able to create non classified tasks that take anywhere from a couple of minutes to a couple of days to complete Each task will be tagged by region and or issue and will automatically populate the profiles of students who have indicated those interests Students can then select the tasks that interest them the most or that fit into their schedule To see that the most pressing work is performed first offices and embassies will be able to prioritize their tasks so critical items appear at the top of the queue Imagine a small embassy preparing for a high profile multilateral meeting The preparations for such an event could be daunting for a small staff The power of the cloud could augment an individual embassy s capacity to prepare for a major event and ensure that related items are performed ahead of those that are less critical While there are plenty of incentives for participating in the VSFS micro volunteering platform from an impressive line on a student s resume to the chance to make a difference by working on topics of interest thought is being put into how to creatively incent high performance One idea is to simply invoke students competitive spirit Competition could be encouraged by a monthly leader board which results in bragging rights and potentially even a low cost but high impact reward Transparency is also key to competition with ratings available to State Department staff and other cloud interns and the ability to make short thank you notes from embassies publicly available interns would be keen to make a good impression The potential applications of this type of program are significant Imagine if offices throughout the State Department could tap into the language and cultural expertise of the thousands of foreign national staff members around the globe Providing a platform for those employees to contribute even a small amount of time to discreet tasks that require their expertise could unlock a world of knowledge 38Creating the GovCloud model will require bold leadership and the ideas and initiatives of entrepreneurial executives While a GovCloud model may be years in the making agencies can begin adopting cloud concepts today The GovCloud concept is designed to be versatile as well as applicable to a wide range of entities Depending on your organization government executives wishing to employ GovCloud may choose to apply the concept first to a unit before expanding to other branches or divisions entire agencies or the whole of government Often GovCloud principles are most effectively implemented as part of a larger reform program within a particular agency as with the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs Renew program as described earlier in this report On a smaller scale the UK Cabinet Office used flexible resourcing FR in its Economic Reform Group ERG with a staff of about 400 as part of its cost reduction plans Using a simple database that it had developed and a strong program of communications FR is now used and embraced by all core ERG employees with strong clear ownership from the top another key implementation factor Says Ian Watmore the UK Cabinet Office s former permanent secretary FR means we are able to deploy people much more quickly to priority projects 40Figure 3 outlines how GovCloud can apply to a variety of organizations Most government workforces haven t undergone a broad restructuring in decades In that time the world has been transformed by computers the Internet and mobile communications To respond to a variety of challenges governments have created scores of new organizations However in today s world of budget cuts and increased fiscal scrutiny the constant creation of new permanent structures is not sustainable The GovCloud model could offer a new way to use government resources A cloud of government wide workers could coalesce into project based teams to solve problems and separate when their work is done This could allow governments to concentrate resources when and where they are needed By using this model in conjunction with thinner agencies and shared services governments can reduce back office redundancies and let agencies focus on their core missions This model capitalizes on the work preferences of Millennials the future government workforce who value career growth over job security or compensation 41 The GovCloud model allows employees to gain a variety of experiences in a shorter amount of time and to self select their career direction To support GovCloud governments could establish the processes by which cloud teams would form work and dissolve New ways to evaluate performance and help workers gain skills and build careers should be considered Today s employee classification system stresses job descriptions and time in service this could be transformed with an XP model that emphasizes the individual s ownership of his or her career The GovCloud model will undoubtedly be controversial Many stakeholders from governing bodies to public employee unions must weigh in to shape the future government workforce The transition to a cloud model will not happen overnight or maybe even in the next five years but the conversation starts today Charlie Tierney is a Manager in Deloitte Consulting LLP s Federal Human Capital Practice and a former GovLab Fellow He

Pospisil EU Public Policy and Government Affairs Manager LinkedInPlanning ahead for the demographic and technological changes of the Fourth Industrial Revolution requires policymakers and industry leaders to have access to comprehensive and relevant labor market data Last month we hosted our first European Economic Graph Forum in the European Parliament in Brussels to explore the future of work and impact of access to these insights The event brought together policymakers and key stakeholders to showcase concrete examples of how cities and regions in the EU have been reacting to recent labor market changes and training their workforce to ensure they obtain the skills they need to work in tomorrow s economy Here s a quick recap of our takeaways from the conversation A big thank you to MEP Eva Maydell who hosted us at the Parliament and without whom this conversation would not have been possible For further insights on skills evolution European educational institutions and the importance of creating policy rooted in data enjoy additional highlights from the event below Related TopicsLinkedIn analytics help deepen and enrich European labour market policymakingUnderstanding digital skills in MunichThe latest Economic Graph updates are on our LinkedIn pageWhen we talk about the future of work we often talk about job titles as a proxy for where the economy is heading Machinists and truck drivers are out robotics programmers and project managers are in But as job titles get more and more nebulous what is it that project managers do anyway a new report from the World Economic Forum suggests that we ought to also look at skills Skills are actionable They can guide workers toward understanding their unique value where they are deficient and what they want to learn Especially as more of the workforce shifts toward freelancers it will be skills not job titles that will help workers differentiate themselves Many of the skills for which the WEF predicts demand will grow like active learning and technology design make sense for a world where the rate of technological change is set to accelerate Meanwhile when we think of the skills most likely to be automated routine and repetitive tasks like adding a widget on an assembly line or filling in an accounting form come to mind However some of the skills needs expected to be on the decline in the next five years might come as a surprise In addition to manual labor we ve also already outsourced many cognitive tasks to technology Phones serve as an external hard drive for our brains Task management software replaces some of the responsibilities previously held by managers So even skills which may seem uniquely human like memory and management of personnel will become less important differentiators for human talent as technology advances the WEF suggests Note that while active learning is among the skills expected to be in high demand just a few years from now active listening is not The WEF s full list of 2022 skills might help you think through skills to develop in order to stay relevant in the future By using this service you agree not to post material that is obscene

WagnerRetirement Planning by Tammy Flanagan 2019 by Government Media Executive Group LLC All rights reserved Of course we can t predict the future of either the government workforce or workplace especially not in the distant year 2040 But we can envision what it might look like given what we know about trends underway today The IBM Center as part of it 20th anniversary activities this year is looking twenty years ahead It recently held its first in a series of Envision Government in 2040 sessions starting with the future of work in government This small group session spurred a fast paced conversation that raised more questions than answers but concluded that we need to start preparing now for that future whatever it might be The Workforce The Tech Revolution is happening faster than we are ready to absorb writes Darrell West in a new book to be released in May There will be fewer full time employees in government just look at the staff sizes of places like Facebook and Google which are on the cutting edge of the future workforce in the private sector Estimates of job displacement as a result of a variety of new technologies artificial intelligence robotics 3 D printing nanotechnology virtual and augmented reality etc vary depending on the studies involved Strategists are saying that the role of humans will need to shift from accumulating and synthesizing knowledge which can increasingly be done by artificial intelligence to skills such as empathy experimentation and innovation And this would require a reorientation of our education system With this in mind the emphasis will be on re skilling and re deploying the workforce not replacing it However certain kinds of work may go away Work that is repetitive in nature such as transactional services such as HR and financial management will largely be automated and likely be candidates for being contracted out to the private sector for delivery Some questions raised in the Envision Session The Workplace The increasing interconnectedness among people and machines will increasingly allow people to work from anywhere via virtual reality and other participatory systems allowing individuals and teams to still feel as connected as if they were co located This increase in connectivity will allow opportunities for less physical travel and greater flexibility for geographic locations for individuals and organizations But this also implies greater investments in digital infrastructure to allow this to happen Preparing Today for Change Tomorrow Technology is typically being seen as augmenting not replacing today s workers But increasingly the role of workers will change For example STEM education is seen as important up until about 2035 but increasingly less so as a result of AI advances after that point After that point other human traits will become more important in the workplace such as empathy and imagination As one report notes Computers are great at optimizing but not so great at goal setting or even using common sense What Comes Next The Future of Work envisioning session was the first of several envision sessions in the works The next will focus on the impact of Artificial Intelligence to be followed by several others Each of these sessions are being used to inform selected authors as they draft chapters for our Future of Government 2040 book to be published this Fall

and timely question What knowledge and skills will the next generation of public servants need to be effective The report Preparing Tomorrow s Public Service presents insights on crucial skills from nearly 1 000 rising government leaders and explores how government s managerial capacity can keep pace with the scale and complexity of government s responsibilities Additionally the study provides recommendations to government agencies professional associations and educational institutions on cultivating the most critical capacities for government service With nearly one third of federal career employees eligible for retirement by the end of the decade and similar workforce pressures impacting states and localities these issues are of growing import The rising government managers from the federal state and local levels who were surveyed by the Volcker Alliance convey the importance of skills such as motivating teams perseverance project management and oral communication to succeed in public service Soft skills are rated by this cohort of rising government leaders as relatively more important than other hard skills such as advanced data analytics Given headlines in recent years about the technical challenges facing government such as the launch of healthcare gov or the data breach of federal background check data we expected to hear huge demand for technical training from government employees However what we found came through most clearly in this study said Paul A Volcker former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and chairman of the Volcker Alliance is that public administration is still about people and communications and management skills are as important as they ever were in implementing policies effectively In Preparing Tomorrow s Public Service rising government leaders express a strong commitment to government service and a desire for more networked learning and other professional development opportunities Of those surveyed 75 percent report that they intend to continue in government for the long term Over 50 percent wish they had access to professional development opportunities that were more relevant to them and 74 percent intend to pursue additional professional development Dustin Brown who leads performance and personnel management as the deputy assistant director for management in the US Office of Management and Budget and was interviewed for the report said I appreciate the Alliance shedding light on this important issue to improve the government s ability to recruit skills needed to modernize He added that the Volcker Alliance s findings align with his hiring priorities for the federal government I m not looking for just policy people but for folks who have the change management skills to work across silos Brown said For the types of problems government is trying to solve and the way in which the government is organized we need managers that can lead implementation efforts across organizations and sectors The Alliance recommends a range of ways that government agencies can invest in and support future public servants including mentoring and coaching programs fellowship programs and employee training opportunities Preparing Tomorrow s Public Service highlights some existing programs that are tailored for rising managers as models for other agencies to adopt The Alliance also recommends that graduate programs consider incorporating more field based content and offer more post degree just in time courses and experiences The Volcker Alliance is a 501 c 3 nonprofit organization ImpactoApril 30 2018 by Luis Miguel Castilla Leave a CommentThe uncertainty of the future of work naturally raises a number of questions It is no wonder Argentina put it on the agenda as one of three priorities to be discussed at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires Will its impact be the same across the globe What jobs will be most affected What new skillsets will be required But above all how can governments prepare and what role can Multilateral Development Banks play All four leading regional development banks recently came together in Washington to present some key perspectives regarding the jobs of the future which can be found in the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives Here are a few worth considering On the one hand Emerging Europe Developing Asia Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean are witnessing how robotics automation and artificial intelligence are lowering costs and increasing productivity providing an opportunity for accelerated growth Countries like Estonia have taken the lead in digital technology youth in Nigeria and Ethiopia are harnessing technology to boost yields in agriculture in Vietnam and Bangladesh Information and Communication Technologies ICT is boosting the service industry and across Latin America and the Caribbean smartphone adoption is expected to reach beyond 70 by 2020 On the other hand as a result of this new wave of technological advances known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution a series of myths emerge that it is important to clarify Myth 1 All regions will be impacted in the same way The truth is that technology will be adopted at varying speeds depending on the region s economic development and demographic trends An aging population in Emerging Europe will face different challenges than Africa where 12 to 15 million young people enter the job market each year Myth 2 Mass unemployment is unavoidable The truth is that the jobless rate will be lower than originally expected Mass unemployment is unlikely to become a reality But the shifts in job opportunities will certainly require flexibility and access to new training tools which may in turn be provided by technology itself Myth 3 Automation will replace all human jobs and tasks The truth is that automation only takes place where it is both technically and economically feasible A human workforce will still be required in most sectors particularly those such as health and education At the same time it would be foolish to ignore the genuine threats of unemployment and increased income inequality that the rapid expansion of new technology will generate Above all as Multilateral Development Banks the question we need to be asking is how can governments ease the transition What can governments do to ensure that the largest number of people possible benefit from this transition Policymakers can take four actions to ease the adoption of technology while mitigating potentially adverse effects on jobs and incomes Multilateral Development Banks certainly have their own role to play not only by acting as think tanks for initiatives on how to capitalize on new technologies and mitigate their negative effects but also in coordinating global or regional policy responses strengthening partnerships between policymakers and employers to jointly identify and address challenges Our products and services will need to adapt A recent IDB health project in the Dominican Republic which uses drones to link remote rural clinics with hospital laboratories is a prime example of this Change will also take place within our workforce Outsourcing the IDB s human resources department from Washington to Costa Rica to ensure efficiency and reduce costs was certainly a step in the right direction It is important that we take the time to seriously identify the opportunities and risks the 21st century global job market presents so that together we can help shape the future of work In the meantime we must also remain relevant for our customer base and at the forefront of innovation Whether we succeed or not is up to all of us Downlaod the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives hereFiled Under Beyond development effectiveness Tagged

Asamblea de Gobernadores o sus pa ses miembros The future of work was a big theme at Davos Although perhaps lost among stories about the lack of political big hitters Trump Putin and the scramble for those blue bobble hats there was an important report released by the International Labour Organisation ILO on the future of work There s lots of food for thought in what the ILO commission has produced It was also a reminder of how our anxieties about the future of work are nothing new The ILO report was published to celebrate the organisation s centenary and how back in 1919 the organisation was formed to provide a positive vision of how employees and employers could work together in rebuilding society after the First World War Another relevant anniversary is looming Perhaps not as illustrious as the ILO s birth February will be five years since the UK government published its own future of work study It s worth a read as it tries to anticipate how work will be organised by 2030 You can check it out here There are four scenarios set out for what the world of work might look like There s forced flexibility that s generated modest growth but with poor job security for low skilled The Great Divide is properly dystopian with robust growth driven by high tech but a sharper divergence between the haves and have nots Both could be possible outcomes but thankfully I see us moving in a direction somewhere between the other two scenarios spelt out in the report One is skills activism that sees technological innovation driving automation of more white collar work triggering an extensive government led skills programme The other is innovation adaptation that sees vastly improved productivity through rigorous implementation of ICT solutions Technological innovation is already having a huge impact on major job categories Look at how retail jobs are being lost as e commerce takes over or how banking s business model relies on having much fewer physical branches because of how customer migration to online banking has been accelerated by mobile That s impetus enough for the government to push on skills and education Even though it s estimated 10 billion is spent in this area and there are many initiatives movement is slow because no one has perhaps cracked how to aggressively drive the closing of skills gaps especially for digital The submission of the Local Government Association to a parliamentary review of skills training said despite the billions being spent the skills gap will widen with over four million too few high skilled people to take up available jobs two million too many with intermediate skills and more than six million too many low skilled by 2024 So relying on government alone to close the skills gaps remains challenging though it remains a goal that must be focused on Moreover governments need to address outdated schooling that is increasingly not fit for purpose in the 21st Century I was particularly moved by Seth Godin s education manifesto Stop stealing dreams a powerful argument against school systems designed for the last industrial revolution and not today s fourth industrial revolution We need to take to heart Godin s stark observation that annually our schools churn out millions of workers who are trained to do 1925 style labour and to be compliant consumers rather than creative problem solvers Where I feel more optimistic is how far we have gone to embrace innovation to adapt to the changing world of work Some may contend that the ICT solutions that underpin gig economy firms might not be creating quality jobs But I do feel those innovators are looking to correct their earlier missteps around how they engage with their workers Perhaps what s more significant is how the changing nature of business to be more digital depends on humans with digital skills rather than the march of the robots As I have argued before organisations have realised that their harnessing of technology to drive business improvement will depend on how much they empower their workers to use digital tools to solve problems and improve processes In fact you can see this called out in the 2014 report where it recommends that individuals focus on development of key skills and attributes that will be at a premium in future including resilience adaptability resourcefulness enterprise cognitive skills such as problem solving A week is a long time in politics So perhaps four years is a millennium But I am struck by how governments and agencies like ILO haven t shied away from how the nature of work will be transformed and regardless of how important technology is the answers and outcomes are very human centred At Pegasystems I have overall responsibility for technical sales and I am the company s senior technology architect and evangelist I am also a member of the European Subscribe I want to receive email updates on Apolitical s recent quiz Do you have what it takes for the government jobs of the future tested public servants tech savviness global awareness and aptitude for collaboration and innovation Backed by two years of research it s part of an ongoing effort to understand the readiness of the world s civil servants for the coming digital revolution which is expected to eliminate 77 of administration and operations roles by 2030 Even if your result was The Luddite or Old School there s still time to learn about the technologies and disciplines that will be essential to getting things done in the public service of the future We ve isolated the most important trends here this is why they matter how governments can use them and the best online resources to learn them yourself Big data once a tool reserved for statisticians and intelligence personnel is now indispensable to the functioning of government With it public servants can use evidence to drive decision making rather than guesswork In the private sector a strong linkbetween effective data use and better financial performance has been established but much of government data still lives on paper or in old fashioned systems This coupled with a tendency to treat data analysis as an afterthought when crafting policy prevents governments from reaping its benefits Of course every civil servant need not be a data scientist but they should appreciate its potential to improve the lives of citizens help services function more efficiently and cut costs In the future of work all public servants will deal with data in service delivery which means overcoming a misconception of big data as amorphous and overwhelming Public servants should come to see it as a tool to help government do more for their citizens with less which in this era of shrinking budgets and growing technological innovation is crucial At a time when there is an urgent need to improve the efficiency of public services data analytics has huge potential Eddie Copeland NestaHow to use it Estonia saves more than 2 8 million hours of labour every year through a data exchange network that helped it digitise 99 of government services The system lets citizens pay their taxes in five minutes and incorporate companies in under 20 Police forces in the US are using big data to predict where crime is most likely to occur and allocate officers more efficiently Some cities have cut crime by up to 40 London is using data analytics to predict which children are most at risk for neglect and abuse allowing child services to intervene before something happens The system will save municipalities 910 000 a year Ukraine has clamped down on corruption and saved 37 million on drugs for its health service with a data driven app that compares government purchases to prices listed by other suppliers How to learn The School of Data has courses on the fundamentals of data as well as how to extract map and clean it The Open Data Institute offers classes in open data essentials and finding stories in data It also has offline courses like Open data in a day for government and Managing risk with open data Coursera has a John Hopkins University sanctioned Launch your career in data science class Datacamp teaches data science skills like R SQL and python Dataquest offers beginner intermediate and expert level courses in data analysis and prediction General Assembly has a number of courses in data science and analysis In the US just 27 of citizens are happy with government s digital services Constituents want to interact with government more easily and governments leading the charge in bringing services online are using artificial intelligence AI to do so With AI systems learn from experience and keep improving their performance without humans having to explain how to complete tasks A prime example of this is chatbots virtual assistants that field questions from constituents who would normally have to call a public office or help desk Chatbots which learn from the questions they are asked to continually improve performance help governments serve constituents better and free up public servants time for higher value jobs AI has the potential to rid humans of monotonous work administrative tasks like data sorting filing and searching documents translating materials and drafting briefs among others saving federal governments up to 1 2 billion hu man hours and 41 1 billion annually City officials only work during the day 8am to 5pm Chatbots work 24 7 Ryan Johnson City of North CharlestonHow to use it Governments in the US Singapore and Jersey use chatbots to help citizens cut through bureaucracy and find the answers they need quickly and easily Las Vegas is using AI to predict car crashes with up to 70 accuracy It uses it to warn drivers to avoid the area up to two hours in advance The UK is using a machine learning model that can identify billion dollar pension schemes at risk of collapse New York City is preventing fires by using a prediction tool that has improved the accuracy of inspections by 20 allowing the city to divert crews to the most at risk buildings How to learn Udacity has an introductory course to AI Udemy offers a range of AI courses from fundamental to advanced learning Coursera has a deep learning specialisation taught by Stanford University professors It also offers a range of other AI classes EdX has a variety of introduction to AI courses IBM offers a beginner s guide to artificial intelligence machine learning and cognitive computing Policymakers are often accused of losing sight of the challenges everyday people face Design thinking is a way for governments to leverage the philosophy of user centric companies like Apple which puts customer experience at the centre of product design to solve problems and shape policy Design thinking puts end citizens at the centre of policy formulation in the iterative process public servants form theories about what constituents want by observing them prototype a product or service then test it out on real people This form of empathetic hands on policymaking helps government build services in concert with citizens to meet their needs rather than relying on detached experts The collaborative approach encourages public servants to break out of departmental siloes and tap into more risky innovative service design It s quite messy doing design work But the old ways of thinking just aren t working anymore Sarah Hurcombe the Australian Centre for Social InnovationHow to use it Denmark used design thinking to reorganise waste management in Copenahagen reduce tension between inmates and guards in prisons and transform services for mentally disabled adults in Odense Singapore has redesigned its employment centres to make them calm and easily navigable for stressed job seekers West Hollywood used design thinking to bring the first robotic parking garage to the west coast The US Department of Labour used design thinking to come up with a speed dating approach to teaching job seekers about resume building financial literacy and how to find work How to learn Stanford University offers a world renowned virtual crash course in design thinking Coursera has a University of Virginia backed design thinking for innovation class Ideou teaches a number of courses in design thinking and innovation strategy MIT has a class in mastering innovation and design thinking FutureLearn has a course called designing for the future in which students learn to apply design thinking to modern problems The University of Cincinnati offers and introductory design thinking and innovation course The use of human psychology to drive citizen behaviour was pioneered by the UK government to cut costs and help people make better choices It taps into the minutiae of how people act and uses small nudges such as a text message or personalised letter to prompt behavioural changes The discipline has had an outsize effect on human behaviour the UK Nudge Unit has signed up an additional 100 000 organ donors a year doubled the number of army applicants and helped collect an additional 40 million a year from taxpayers Nudge units use empirical evidence to anticipate how people will react to policy options rather than assuming their response will be rational They have spread to governments across the world including Guatemala the US Australia Germany and Singapore but the use of behavioural insights is still nascent In the future it is expected to have a significant impact on solving problems that stem from ingrained or unconscious bias like gender inequality It s hard for government to admit that something it s doing might not work or that it s failed People are often running blind David Halpern UK Nudge UnitHow to use it The UK Australia and Singapore use a behavioural science and machine learning tool to blind managers to gender and ethnicity allowing them to hire solely based on talent A public university in San Francisco used text message nudges to cut dropouts among low income students by 10 Australia is using nudges to boost women s labour force participation and their visibility in televised sports A Sacramento utility nudged customers to cut their peak hour energy consumption by 12 by automatically enrolling them in an energy saving plan How to learn Read about developing public policy with

FuturesCentre apoliticalco https t co 33hM95VuQZ A few more ideas here https t co g3dNRQ8ppyA few more ideas here by nesta What are the skills and attitudes for successful public problem solving In late November 2018 I delivered the opening keynote at the Future of Work 2018 Conference hosted by the University of Melbourne Center for Workplace Leadership 1 where I described how to keep people at the center of the future of work discussion After my talk find a video of the 45 minute keynote here I was interviewed for a short video segment to share the highlights In preparing for the interview I found the questions to explore a thoughtful comprehensive look at the scope of the discussion on the future of work and thus I wanted to share my answers I am interested in your reactions Do you agree with my thoughts Disagree Why What are some examples of human centric approaches to work within areas of high automation I would approach this question differently While there are some jobs that might have a higher likelihood of automation than others especially those contain significant amounts of routine tasks 2 the World Economic Forum has recently predicted that greater than 50 of all jobs will require significant reskilling and upskilling by 2022 3 This means we will need to consider more human centric approaches in most jobs not just those with a higher proportion of tasks that could be automated In the research I ve been conducting in partnership with Bill Eggers and Amrita Datar from Deloitte and Carlos Teixeira from the Harvard Kennedy School through my current part time fellowship with the Harvard Kennedy School digitalHKS initiative we ve envisioned 6 government jobs of the future with a method that puts humans back at the center for both new and changing jobs Putting the worker first we envision future jobs to place human machine coordination at the core in order to improve productivity and decision making while also increasing the well being of the workers themselves The trick is not to think about what can be automated but also what can be augmented If a human s time could be freed up what higher order value could be accomplished with uniquely human skills Might we be able to deliver more value than human machine coordination than through humans alone or machines alone For example Child case workers in Colorado currently spend less than 10 percent of their work time actually interacting with children and families This impacts their ability to most effectively protect vulnerable children and coordinate services for those children Case workers today spend a large percentage of their time on administrative tasks Our research has envisioned a future where administrative burdens are reduced with the application of technologies to increase the time spent on higher valued work for the customer For example some technology applications could include case management systems powered by cognitive computing to ease scheduling and follow up voice based smart assistants that document case notes after an appointment while the future child aid coordinator travels between appointments robotic process automation tools that automatically process a client s eligibility for services on the fly and using predictive analytics and machine learning to prevent abuse neglect and ill treatment Child aid coordinators should be empowered to customize services for vulnerable children based on the child s own unique circumstances Spending more time with children and families is a critical part to increasing the value created by this work and by applying technology to free time from administrative tasks coordinators are able to spend more time problem solving for their customers What frightens you or stirs you the most about the shift from human power to machine power MIT Professor David A Mindell talks about three myths of 21st century robotics and automation in his book Our Robots Ourselves that I think are particularly relevant to shift the focus of this question The myth of linear progress the idea that technology evolves from direct human involvement into remote presence and then to fully autonomous systems The myth of replacement the idea that machines take over human jobs one for one Myth of full autonomy the utopian idea that robots today or in the future can operate entirely on their own 4 So there s a lot of fear mongering about how quickly and how extremely a shift to machine power will happen Also I think what we have to remind ourselves is that human power alone and machine power alone won t be as great as power achieved through human machine coordination To get the most value we need to design machines that have humans in the loop and empower humans to design work processes where machines are in the loop This is where the greatest value lies but is also where the challenge is because most organizations are not good at integrating new technologies into their business processes One reason they struggle with this not far from the only reason is significant workforce resistance when new technologies are forced on them This is where employees seeing WHY the change is important and why there is a benefit to them to re skill is important Another reason is because true user centered design in the technology development and deployment process is not common practice Organizations must embrace a user centered technology adoption mindset if technology initiatives are to succeed in improving the performance of an organization Co creating a visualization for the jobs of the future as occurs in the workshops Bill Amrita and I have developed can be a powerful tool to enable these actions How futuristic or progressive is the research in this area are we finding out the facts and figures too late There is a lot of research being done in this area but often in silos Conversations about future of work are often segmented between communities People building technologies focus on a technology enabled future Human capital and staffing professionals focus on how workforce changes are affecting the future of work Universities and educators focus on future skills and learning mindsets as being key enablers for the future The urgent need is to build bridges across these communities and research areas since I believe solutions will lie at the intersections of the complex topics including but not limited to Technology development robotics computer and data science engineering etc Economics and economic development policy local state and national Education and learning Workforce development policy Technology ethics Labor relations Business and public sector management Human centered design human factors Architecture and build environment design Business strategy Organizational design Performance management Organizational and Individual PsychologyMIT is one university trying to get ahead of this need for interdisciplinary action oriented research through the Task force on Work of the Future announced off earlier this year but significantly more work can be done in convening these communities for active solution development What s critical to do right now in ensuring the human evolves and doesn t disappear from meaningful work In the near term government employers employees and educators all have a role to play to design a future that is better for humans not worse Employees must not wait around for skill development to be presented to them by their employer a mindset of life long learning will be a key attribute for the future employee Learning doesn t necessarily mean traditional university higher education where costs are becoming unsustainable Learning can happen online through local boot camps by doing through micro courses designed to be taken on demand etc Employees must see that change is coming understand the new skills that will be required for them to succeed in a changed work world and feel empowered to take some of that learning on for themselves Now that s not to say that employers won t also have an important role to play in training employees in the skills of the future like AT T s 1B commitment to re train half of its workforce for the jobs of the future But McKinsey estimates that globally some 500M 900M future workers may need to move to new employers and sectors to find meaningful work 5 That transition will require some initiative on the part of the employee Thus we must create means for individuals to feel empowered and encouraged to do this and reduce fear of the future that could be paralyzing Educators act as a bridge between the future workforce and employers Being an effective bridge should involve identifying the salient knowledge skills and abilities required for the future of work and evolving curriculum and learning environments to prepare students for those futures This requires educators to have a keen understanding of the needs of industry Many institutes of higher education are also completely rethinking how they teach and how students learn and are making education to non traditional students more broadly available through online learning certifications and MOOCs Innovating the learning process itself and the funding model for learning is a critical role of educators and a role all educators should be moving to adopt in the near term Employers must step out of their comfort zone and think about a future where their potential workforce could include not only be full time human employees but contract employees the crowd strategic partnerships and machine intelligence How do you think about integrating the machine as part of the team How does this change the role and skills for managers How might humans and machines combined create a more valued product or service that you provide today The challenge is to not think about the application of machines as an efficiency gain to cut overall costs by reducing human labor but to think about how machines augment humans who can provide higher order cognitive value to the organization Employers should also actively engage their workforce in designing the jobs of the future jobs that use technology to augment current work and that add new value Current employees see problems on the front line and opportunities for additional value creation that management and senior leadership often doesn t see That front line intelligence should be incorporated into designing jobs of the future Designing a future organizational model that harnesses an agile way to leverage human machine coordination to add value is a business imperative Further employers have to be obsessed with creating a learning environment in their organizations This environment should teach existing employees how to fail fast and adapt to changing technologies and customer information regularly but also help new employees onboard much more quickly due to the increasing fluidity of the workforce and increasing incidence of telework remote teams Governments must set economic workforce development training education and technology policies that consider the interdisciplinary issues of the future of work But their role is not only limited to policy making through laws and executive orders They could also Leverage convening power to create a cross sector agenda Encourage experimentation at the state and local level as test beds for national policy Fund programs to re skill employees in parts of the economy that might not be able to afford to do it themselves like small to mid size manufacturers Consider government agency roles and responsibilities to see if policy making across different interdisciplinary areas should be better coordinated Encourage policy making that includes a participatory element to ensure the voices and values of the public not just organizational stakeholders are considered when evaluating policy solutions Ensure trade offs between technology ethics and societal values are considered in economic growth policies Initiate diplomatic efforts to address inequality issues in the future of work EtcMcKinsey 6 Bain 7 and others have also made recent recommendations on what these groups can do to prepare for the future of work How do we rein in the growth of inequality as technology shifts the balance of power and opportunity in society New technology throughout history has been accompanied by fear of that technology Malcolm Frank and others in their book What to Do when Machines do Everything note Many seem to forget that throughout history automation has provided a net benefit to society In the process of automating our work and our society through generation after generation three positive things have repeatedly occurred 1 A new abundance has been created sales of products and services produced by automation now vastly more affordable and of higher quality skyrocket2 With the new abundance overall employment rises even when there is less labor input per unit 3 Society gains a net benefit with higher living standards created by newly affordable products and services 8 However this fourth work revolution does have some unique issues to consider with respect to furthering inequality A primary issue involves the coding of biases into future decision making structures and thus significant discussions have emerged on the ethical use of AI This discussion can often be about how to ensure that the algorithm developers aren t coding their own personal biases into technologies But it can also be about the data that we are using to train our AI if training data is biased or not representative of broader society then we could be making incorrect diagnoses faster or forgetting entire populations in the future we re optimizing for For example a 2010 report from the University of British Columbia warned against the danger of assuming that all of humanity s psychology closely matches the behaviors of 20 something college students They cite evidence that between 2003 and 2007 undergrads made up 80 percent of study subjects in six top psychology journals and that 96 percent of all psychology samples come from countries that make up only 12 percent of the world s population 9 The researchers refer to the sample population as mostly coming from Western Educated Industrialized Rich Democratic WEIRD populations So if a future AI therapist were trained off this data set the accuracy of diagnosis and the effectiveness of treatment may likely underperform with underrepresented communities in the dataset We must be vigilant against potential bias both in our training research data as well as the humans coding the rules else we are likely to further encourage inequitable application of technology What can only humans do and how will this change improve be compromised in the future work economy Humans are still vastly better at problem solving communication knowledge sharing collaboration leadership creativity empathy and the ability to cope with ambiguity and uncertainty 10 In some jobs that conduct routine cognitive tasks machines can actually become smarter than humans when powered by vast amounts of data These jobs may include call centers auditing insurance underwriting and basic tax preparation Some creative cognitive jobs may also be replaced For example powered by significant amounts of viewer data Netflix can set the parameters to create new TV series and movies they know will be enjoyed by their population As described by Jessica Brillhart AI is also creating beautiful art This means humans will need to perform more sophisticated cognitive tasks in the future of work Mohanbir Sawhney suggests a few such jobs in Forbes like managing and designing the future human machine teams and jobs that require social intelligence like providing care to humans nurses counselors physical therapists Also he notes as technology improves the quality of life for society humans may have more free time for leisure which could increase employment in the entertainment and leisure industries 11 All previous work revolutions agricultural and industrial have unlocked new industries and thus new opportunities for jobs while improving the overall quality of life of society though there could be much vigorous debate on the nuances of this statement If history is our guide we would expect to see the same net change over time though the times that society undergoes that transition can be very difficult The relatively good news here is that the transition may be quick occurring within one person s lifetime and not over the course of three lifetimes like previous revolutions This will significantly impact a generation but the overall transition time may be shorter Thus we have an urgent need to act now to minimize the negative effects on this generation with overall progress vigorous guard against embedded bias and human quality of life and equity top of mind References 1 Important Note My work on the Future of Work is conducted as an outside activity from my NASA duties My Future of Work research is done in affiliation with

17a7d6fc3fceTagged future of work technology AI automation human resources skills education jobs government work workPowered by SquarespaceApple has integrated 9 000 trees into its futuristic new headquarters campus reflecting research showing that greenery in workplaces increases productivity by 15 percent Several years ago Google s People Analytics division launched Project Aristotle to understand the components of productive teams embracing research that groups are more creative than individuals Private sector businesses are automating tedious tasks augmenting workers with artificial intelligence technologies reskilling and upskilling their workforces focusing on employee wellness and hungrily recruiting talent Government will have to catch up Perhaps nowhere is the gap between the public and private sector greater than in workforce management Most public sector organizations are still locked into decades old employee policies such as rigid job classifications lockstep pay and a reliance on seniority as a substitute for capability The reality is that government agencies are increasingly called upon to address society s most complex challenges while using workforce approaches rooted in the distant past The good news Change is possible and beginning to happen A new Deloitte study explores some of the ways the nature of government work the public workforce itself and the workplace it occupies will all need to continue to evolve Work New technologies can transform the capabilities of a government worker Artificially intelligent chatbots for example can perform triage on citizen questions freeing human attention for less routine queries The Army s recruitment chatbot SGT STAR does the work of 55 recruiters answering 94 percent of questions A Deloitte analysis of AI s potential found that automation could save the federal government as much as 1 2 billion hours of work annually What AI doesn t automate it can enhance Child welfare caseworkers who according to one study spend just 9 percent of their time with children but 37 5 percent of their time on paperwork could use technology to auto populate documentation freeing time for visits AI also can correlate hospital truancy and arrest records to flag children in danger Some restaurant health inspectors already analyze big data to identify likely candidates for inspections In Chicago for instance tests found 24 percent more critical violations and on average isolated dangers from the food system a week earlier For effective work redesign it s helpful to adopt a two pronged strategy of zooming in and zooming out A zooming in approach hones in on individual tasks and processes that have the most potential to be optimized through automation Zooming out entails looking at the bigger picture to define what work redesign means for entire job classifications departments and the organization as a whole Workforce Specialists in fields like cybersecurity agile development and artificial intelligence are not likely to commit decades to one government position and if they did they d still need to swap into the tech sector periodically to sharpen their skills That s why some government technology programs are taking a tour of duty approach letting private sector experts serve in the public sector for a few years on specific projects without locking them into a lifetime of government work At the federal level the General Services Administration s 18F digital services agency the Oak Ridge Institute for Science Education and the Presidential Innovation Fellows program all help government solve problems with temporary outside hires At the state level Michigan s Cyber Civilian Corps a volunteer group of cybersecurity professionals from the private sector and academia as well as government can be called upon if the governor declares a cyber emergency And long term government workers don t need to be stuck in one place A talent cloud can prepare for unexpected staffing needs by identifying in advance workers with special skills and applying them to tasks suited to their expertise Canada is experimenting with letting multiple agencies dip into a talent cloud and hire workers for specific missions Workers keep their union membership rights and benefits but may be called into service by any agency Workplace Empirical science rarely guides hiring But management is becoming more data driven Applying the newest science on team building personal efficiency and employee wellness to government agencies can upgrade the workplace to better attract retain and utilize talent Insights from studies of the composition and functioning of effective teams can inform decisions about using talents more effectively Organizational network analysis for example can use metadata from emails and other sources to map communication patterns in organizations accurately predicting individuals who will be high performers detecting unsatisfied employees six months before they actually quit and identifying leadership behaviors that correlate with success Modern workplace wellness programs are also extremely impactful Improving employee wellness can reduce lost work days increase retention and fuel productivity After the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center provided a physician and nurse case manager for employees it saw an 80 percent decline in lost work days over six years for a cost savings of 1 5 million In short the future of government work will require a level of dynamic workforce management far beyond the current practices of the public sector The potential for government agencies to unlock more human capital potential and make the public sector a magnet for talent is enormous As Buffalo s former mayor demonstrated to bring the right people together you have to know what it takes to make a project succeed Local governments are using internet surveys to better gauge residents needs Some states are finding ways to make rules easier to navigate and less costly for business while continuing to protect the public s interests The amount of missing and unusable public sector data is stunning Every jurisdiction should be comparing itself with its peers to identify problematic practices increase productivity and reduce costs It s all too easy for team members to misunderstand something Effective

whole nature of work And we need to deal with the massive transitions that are happening in the world of work if we re gonna have a healthy society over the coming decades So how we used to farm was a lot of manual labour and the equipment was getting old and we re dealing with breakdown So we were able to build this facility it s a big technology advancement compared to how we used to farm and now we re able to do less time choring and do other work instead so we re more efficient and it s just a more humane way to harvest milk Sensequake is making cities safer and smarter by combining sensors AI and data analysis to perform structural health monitoring and determine the integrity and natural hazard vulnerability of a structure More and more workplaces are going to need the technologies that are emerging now and in the future And having knowledge of these new technologies is going to be crucial in every sector Skills development is vital right now What skills are we embedding inside of our youth today in order to service these applications service these robots Where are we giving that experiential learning Hopefully there s growth in the dairy industry if we were to stay in our old facility we wouldn t be able to grow it would be a lot of labour milking fewer cows and I d be a last generation farmer I think that Canada has some unique opportunities to be successful because of its place in the world because of its skilled workforce the quality of its education system This opportunity with Future Skills Council and the Centre gives us the time and space to collectively think about how we make the best use of our resources so that we don t find ourselves behind NC INNOVATION GD hrsdc rhdcc gc caWe want to hear from you How do you think the new Canada Service Corps

Communication Centre for the announcement of the Future Skills Centre partners Photo Clifton Li New technology artificial intelligence and global competitiveness are changing the way Canadians work Many of the skills needed for good quality jobs will change in the years to come A Canadian workforce that incorporates new technology and adapts is key to Canada s long term economic growth On February 14 Patty Hajdu minister of employment workforce development and labour and Bill Morneau minister of finance came to campus to announce that Ryerson University will lead the consortium for The Future Skills Centre Centre des Comp tences external link an initiative to help ensure Canadians develop the skills they need to succeed in the new economy Ryerson will be joined in the new Future Skills Centre research initiative by the Conference Board of Canada and Blueprint to spearhead projects across Canada that develop test and measure new approaches to skills assessment and development As Canada s leader in innovative career oriented education Ryerson University is proud to lead the consortium for this important federal government initiative said Ryerson University President Mohamed Lachemi at the official announcement on campus With expertise in multidisciplinary large scale research and evaluation projects Ryerson is a community builder that convenes academics governments non profits and industry to better understand and promote diversity entrepreneurship and employment Ryerson is well positioned to help prepare all Canadians for emerging opportunities today and beyond Fifteen members from Canada s public private labour and not for profit sectors were selected to form the Future Skills Council The council will provide advice to the minister of employment workforce development and labour on emerging skills and workforce trends including national and regional priorities related to skills development for Canadians The world of work is changing and Canadians need to be equipped to seize the opportunities this presents said Hajdu Future Skills is part of the government s plan to build an agile workforce that can find and keep good well paying jobs and strengthen the middle class so that everyone has a fair chance at success today and tomorrow Canada s economy is growing and jobs are being created by Canadians every day but the skills needed to succeed in those jobs can sometimes change rapidly The Future Skills Centre and Council will work with schools businesses and government to make sure Canadians can learn those skills helping them stay competitive in tomorrow s job market said Morneau The Government of Canada is investing 225 million in Future Skills over four years and 75 million per year thereafter The research centre will operate in both official languages at arm s length from the Government of Canada The centre will partner with and fund projects that are led by groups such as provincial and territorial governments Indigenous governments and organizations and not for profit organizations These projects will The centre will allocate 50 per cent of its funding to disadvantaged and under represented groups including up to 20 per cent to address the needs of youth Follow RyersonFacebook opens new window Instagram opens new window Twitter opens new window YouTube opens new window LinkedIn opens new windowThe challenges government faces from automation to digital disruption are fast changing In order to meet them civil servants need to evolve too learning new skills and keeping on top of trends To help with that we ve created this reading list for the new age of government Several of these books and reports deal directly with how the civil service operates Others offer lessons from other industries From how to apply a startup mentality to the public service to the role of art in policymaking here are our top nine instructional and inspirational reads for civil servants We hope you ll find it helpful and feel free to add your own ideas for ones we ve missed in the comments below For more like this see our government innovation newsfeed If We Can Put a Man on the Moon Getting Big Things Done in Government John O LearyOne of the best ways to improve policymaking is to help governments learn from failures which is what this book is devoted to It takes a fine tooth comb to policymaking mistakes made by the US government from the war in Iraq to the response to Hurricane Katrina to Healthcare gov and gives practical advice on how similar crises can be averted in the future It argues that the reason governments fail at large scale transformations is that public servants and politicians keep falling into the same traps This book is an essential guide to improving government by learning from policymaking pitfalls Sprint How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days Jake Knapp John Zeratsky Braden KowitzGovernment tends to move slowly but with the rise of innovation labs that s changing Agile government may be a buzzword but it s now what many departments are aiming for faster design and delivery of policies and services The Sprint formula for testing ideas was developed at Google and has been taken up in more than 100 organisations from schools and startups to non profits and large companies The process is designed to take an idea from prototype to decision in just five days which could save government time and money and cut down on unnecessary red tape Bonus For more on the agile government movement see the Agile Government Handbook Public Servants Art and the Crisis of the Common Good Johanna Burton Shannon Jackson Dominic WillsdonPeople often think of policymaking as practical and technocratic but a growing movement of civil servants in the US UK and beyond are working to bring art and other creative pursuits into the process This book a collection of essays and art projects argues that civil servants should be engaged with art and artists if they want to have better conversations about the future of government Art can help us manage these changes the authors say and shape the landscape of government into something more human This book will make you question what you know about policymaking and rethink the role of creativity in the public sector The Algorithmic Accountability Toolkit AI NowThe growing significance of artificial intelligence to government can t be overstated Even if your job has nothing to do with technology an understanding of how algorithms are used to provide government services allocate resources and make decisions will be critical to the future of government work This toolkit is a comprehensive but easy to understand look at the implications of AI in government and where its use could go wrong It highlights the importance of transparency oversight accountability and citizen input particularly in critical areas like procurement and delves into algorithms vulnerability to human bias and error Simpler The Future of Government Cass SunsteinCass Sunstein spent four years as Barack Obama s regulatory tsar during which time he led a revolution in how government regulates industry His work made federal rules more effective and easier to understand and catalysed changes from simplified mortgages and student loan applications to the improved labelling of food and energy efficient appliances These regulatory changes now help citizens save money and time improve their health and live longer lives This book is a guide to using evidence based policymaking citizen engagement and behavioural science to make government less bureaucratic What is Public Sector Innovation The Observatory of Public Sector InnovationOften seen as an oxymoron by outsiders government innovation is a concept many public servants have heard about but few can define Having a shared understanding of innovation matters without it it s hard to get support for the field and the people who work in it If you re confused about innovation and its ramifications on government at large this is what you should read OPSI s deep dive into what public sector innovation is and how it can be harnessed Hooked How to Build Habit Forming Products Nir EyalLet s face it the private sector is simply better at building products and services that people want to use Citizens dread visiting government offices to apply for a driver s license replace a birth certificate or get a marriage license Perhaps if governments took more of a cue from the private sector they might be able to design services citizens are happy to use This book outlines the Hook Model a four step design process that helps nudge user behaviour and encourage habits Even if you aren t involved in service delivery this book will help you understand the importance of good design Invisibles The Power of Anonymous Work in an Age of Relentless Self Promotion David ZweigThis book is for civil servants who work tirelessly for the public good with little to no recognition Some of the world s most important work is done by invisibles from engineers to interpreters to government employees These professions require expertise skill and dedication but the public is scarcely aware of the work they do In this book David Zweig explores how they find job satisfaction what motivates them and how they define success He found that many of these people share the same core traits and identifies how the rest of us can live more fulfilled lives if we follow in their footsteps Getting the Work Done What Government Innovation Really Looks Like Hana Schank Sara HudsonThis report is a frank and insightful look into what s working in the field of government innovation and what isn t More than 60 interviews with city managers services designers product managers engineers and chief innovation officers offer unprecedented insight into what the day to day work of government innovation is like It delves deeply into the major barriers that plague the field including its lack of community and professional development opportunities It s recommended for any public servant interested in integrating innovation techniques into their work Jennifer

service 2018 Breakout Stream 1For the public sector it is hard to imagine a challenge bigger than gaining and maintaining the trust of our various audiences Be it regulation business attraction logistics compliance or awareness building there are few functions of public sector activity that aren t ultimately dependent on getting a message out But the where and the ways to do that have changed and are changing remarkably And addressing that can t be a merely a function of Corporate Communications teams no matter how good they might be If government is to remain relevant into the future its people need to think about their audiences every step of the way whatever their role But how do individual public servants with their own skills sets and natural abilities embrace a communications role Sue Cato perhaps Australia s leading issues management practitioner will join us in a facilitated discussion that will empower participants to start to realise their own individual potential to make strategic communication work for them their careers and the areas of public work for which they have responsibility We are living through a fundamental transformation in the way we

results prove the program creates behaviour change This is your chance to learn more about the program that cuts Australians power bills and trial the Reduce Your Juice app You ll also learn more about how this gamified approach and digital scaffold can be applied to other behaviours Program Note This session continues the Reduce Your Juice story that began in session 1A but it is not necessary to have attended that session to get all the benefits and insights from this session The future for policymaking will be a compact between government business and the community to resolve real world problems together More meaningful engagement with expertise in the community can only help to address the complex issues of trust and enhance confidence in public policy solutions Industry

solutions to complex problems They provide an opportunity for policy innovators to work at a state national and international level to leverage its unique strengths across a range of private and public sector challenges Based in Brisbane Australia and with over 13 300 community experts and growing MindHive is the world s first crowdsourcing consultancy An Airbnb for brains it s aim is to disrupt the 145B consulting world This session will explore the technologies of expertise engaging crowds shared intelligence collaborative problem solving and strategy co design including a series of case studies drawn from across Mindhive and other idea innovation platforms Program Note The story of MindHive s evolution as a collaborative policy and strategy startup continues in Breakout 3B in a session focused on the digital platform and its future ambitions Many jurisdictions nationally and internationally are already using sustainability concepts to springboard new business models and transform their economies across ideas such as the circular economy But while multinationals and local communities alike are seeing economic environmental and social returns in many ways the core of this model is an innovation based on trust This session will explore the concept of the circular economy using a series of case studies to demonstrate the change that is already happening and changing our society and the way its institutions work from one based on take make and dispose to one that is restorative and regenerative by design The fast pace of digital change is re shaping today s workforce PwC research indicates there will be net job creation from technology however there is an increasing consensus across thought and practice leaders that it s time to get practical about assisting all workers to adapt to the digital age The task of retraining talent goes beyond digital upskilling 87 of Australia s CEOs either agree or strongly agree that they need to strengthen the soft skills of employees alongside their digital skills Human skills such as creativity flexibility agility problem solving collaboration adaptability and emotional intelligence are skills that can t be automated and therefore there is much value to gain from harnessing these skills in employees This session will distil the shift towards automation and AI in workplaces generally and the public sector in particular and use this as the beginning of a constructive even personal conversation A conversation that acknowledges and de mystifies their potential and facilitates a way to embrace the competitive advantage for individuals and organisations alike from developing skills that complement and leverage an integrated AI HI workforce Technological innovations including always on

MindHive model was recognised with national accolades for innovation and public sector design from its earliest days realising the potential of the concept through a digital platform has been central to ensuring the viability of the original concept With MindHive 2 0 a new crowdsourcing and networking platform nearing launch participants will have the opportunity to observe how the theoretical and practical challenges were resolved and have the opportunity to experience the potential for policy and strategy development through the MindHive methodology firsthand To many minds the rise of technology and the state of the environment have a relationship that is parallel at best and inverse at worst A rise in one has too often been seen as necessarily having to come at the cost of the other But advances in technology from 3D printing to social media to big data are fundamental enablers to many of the facets of circular economy How can government enable and capitalise on this shift across portfolios as diverse as energy infrastructure social services and foreign aid This session will combine case studies with practical experience to show the digital revolution in a whole new

advancement we are witness to every single day is at unprecedented levels Technology is changing not only how we interact with each other but also our expectations when it comes to experiences Government and Enterprise are in the midst of the biggest call to action that we ve had in the last century and it s all coming down to one word Trust This is the new augmented world of humanity and technology fused together at the very core It s also more exciting than ever Just remember this though New world means new rules Global Futurist Chris Riddell will take you on an incredible journey unlocking exciting insights into human change the mega trends of beyond tomorrow and what true innovation in government looks like Welcome to a new Beyond Tomorrow Leaders and organisations are in an overheating crucible of radical transformation showing up their vulnerabilities and lack of agility It is a world characterised by increasing Variety Interdependency Complexity Change Ambiguity Seamlessness and Sustainability VICCASS These exponential changes challenge the established models and approaches of leadership and require very different capabilities and mindsets Leaders need to think differently behave differently and react differently We need to identify leaders early for their agility creativity ability to lead and connect people and teams their thinking patterns and their systems thinking Senior leaders should be measured on their ability to cut through bureaucracy to enable change their ability to create counter intuitive insights and their courage in challenging the norm It s time to change our thinking on who is a leader how they are trained and in what ways they are rewarded and supported Let s rethink reexamine and redesign leadership development and get the right people into leadership roles now while we still can 2018 Breakout Stream 4Most people interested in the field of innovation have heard of agile innovation teams These small entrepreneurial groups are designed to stay close to customers and adapt quickly to changing conditions When implemented correctly they have a reputation for almost always result in higher team productivity and moral faster time to market better quality and lower risk than traditional approaches can achieve But while agile methods caught on first in IT departments and are now widely used in software development the agile approach has potential to transform the public sector in ways far beyond better bits and bytes Conditions are ripe for agile teams in any situation where problems are complex solutions are at first unclear project requirements are likely to change and close collaboration with end users is feasible a description that matches many facing a wide variety of public sector activities This session will provide participants with an opportunity explore what the world of agile can teach them about themselves their work and their potential to serve their clients better whatever their role It will confront some of the common myths and misconceptions about agile and demonstrate how an agile approach can enable teams to deliver sooner and scale faster through a proven learning culture that builds and strengthens the team and its capabilities Navigating today s increasingly complex and volatile business terrain requires deep reservoirs of tenacity optimism and hardiness This session will equip participants with the ability to fundamentally and permanently strengthen their personal resilience by exploring elements of one of the world s most advanced scientifically grounded and widely adopted adversity tools By participating attendees will The best places are vibrant and complex But how do you quantify urban life The census is outdated before it s released Consumer research focuses on generalisations rather than diversity And community engagement processes struggle to reach enough people to uncover local nuances Every day millions of Australians create valuable data online that paints a picture about the places they visit and what they value Neighbourlytics harvests this rich user generated data to help city makers understand the unique identity of the places they plan build and manage Neighbourlytics is a social analytics platform for neighbourhoods pioneering the use of social data to help city makers across Australia understand the unique identity and

wider array of education and skills building programs will be created to meet new demands There are two uncertainties Will well prepared workers be able to keep up in the race with AI tools And will market capitalism survive By Lee Rainie and Janna AndersonMachines are eating humans jobs talents And it s not just about jobs that are repetitive and low skill Automation robotics algorithms and artificial intelligence AI in recent times have shown they can do equal or sometimes even better work than humans who are dermatologists insurance claims adjusters lawyers seismic testers in oil fields sports journalists and financial reporters crew members on guided missile destroyers hiring managers psychological testers retail salespeople and border patrol agents Moreover there is growing anxiety that technology developments on the near horizon will crush the jobs of the millions who drive cars and trucks analyze medical tests and data perform middle management chores dispense medicine trade stocks and evaluate markets fight on battlefields perform government functions and even replace those who program software that is the creators of algorithms People will create the jobs of the future not simply train for them and technology is already central It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead Jonathan GrudinMultiple studies have documented that massive numbers of jobs are at risk as programmed devices many of them smart autonomous systems continue their march into workplaces A recent study by labor economists found that one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment to population ratio by about 0 18 0 34 percentage points and wages by 0 25 0 5 percent When Pew Research Center and Elon University s Imagining the Internet Center asked experts in 2014 whether AI and robotics would create more jobs than they would destroy the verdict was evenly split 48 of the respondents envisioned a future where more jobs are lost than created while 52 said more jobs would be created than lost Since that expert canvassing the future of jobs has been at the top of the agenda at many major conferences globally Several policy and market based solutions have been promoted to address the loss of employment and wages forecast by technologists and economists A key idea emerging from many conversations including one of the lynchpin discussions at the World Economic Forum in 2016 is that changes in educational and learning environments are necessary to help people stay employable in the labor force of the future Among the six overall findings in a new 184 page report from the National Academies of Sciences the experts recommended The education system will need to adapt to prepare individuals for the changing labor market At the same time recent IT advances offer new and potentially more widely accessible ways to access education Jobholders themselves have internalized this insight A 2016 Pew Research Center survey The State of American Jobs found that 87 of workers believe it will be essential for them to get training and develop new job skills throughout their work life in order to keep up with changes in the workplace This survey noted that employment is much higher among jobs that require an average or above average level of preparation including education experience and job training average or above average interpersonal management and communication skills and higher levels of analytical skills such as critical thinking and computer skills A central question about the future then is whether formal and informal learning structures will evolve to meet the changing needs of people who wish to fulfill the workplace expectations of the future Pew Research Center and Elon s Imagining the Internet Center conducted a large scale canvassing of technologists scholars practitioners strategic thinkers and education leaders in the summer of 2016 asking them to weigh in on the likely future of workplace training Some 1 408 responded to the following question sharing their expectations about what is likely to evolve by 2026 In the next 10 years do you think we will see the emergence of new educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers in the skills they will need to perform the jobs of the future The nonscientific canvassing found that 70 of these particular respondents said yes such programs would emerge and be successful A majority among the 30 who said no generally do not believe adaptation in teaching environments will be sufficient to teach new skills at the scale that is necessary to help workers keep abreast of the tech changes that will upend millions of jobs See About this canvassing of experts for further details about the limits of this sample Participants were asked to explain their answers and offered the following prompts to consider Several common expectations were evident in these respondents answers no matter how hopeful or fretful they were about the future of skills and capabilities training efforts It is important to note that many respondents listed human behaviors attributes and competencies in describing desirable work skills Although these aspects of psychology cannot be classified as skills and perhaps cannot be directly taught in any sort of training environment we include these answers under the general heading of skills capabilities and attributes A diversifying education and credentialing ecosystem Most of these experts expect the education marketplace especially online learning platforms to continue to change in an effort to accommodate the widespread needs Some predict employers will step up their own efforts to train and retrain workers Many foresee a significant number of self teaching efforts by jobholders themselves as they take advantage of proliferating online opportunities Respondents see a new education and training ecosystem emerging in which some job preparation functions are performed by formal educational institutions in fairly traditional classroom settings some elements are offered online some are created by for profit firms some are free some exploit augmented and virtual reality elements and gaming sensibilities and a lot of real time learning takes place in formats that job seekers pursue on their own A considerable number of respondents to this canvassing focused on the likelihood that the best education programs will teach people how to be lifelong learners Accordingly some say alternative credentialing mechanisms will arise to assess and vouch for the skills people acquire along the way A focus on nurturing unique human skills that artificial intelligence AI and machines seem unable to replicate Many of these experts discussed in their responses the human talents they believe machines and automation may not be able to duplicate noting that these should be the skills developed and nurtured by education and training programs to prepare people to work successfully alongside AI These respondents suggest that workers of the future will learn to deeply cultivate and exploit creativity collaborative activity abstract and systems thinking complex communication and the ability to thrive in diverse environments One such comment came from Simon Gottschalk a professor in the department of sociology at the University of Nevada Las Vegas The skills necessary at the higher echelons will include especially the ability to efficiently network manage public relations display intercultural sensitivity marketing and generally what author Dan Goleman would call social and emotional intelligence This also includes creativity and just enough critical thinking to move outside the box Another example is the response of Fredric Litto a professor emeritus of communications and longtime distance learning expert from the University of S o Paulo We are now in the transitional stage of employers gradually reducing their prejudice in the hiring of those who studied at a distance and moving in favor of such graduates who in the workplace demonstrate greater proactiveness initiative discipline collaborativeness because they studied online Other respondents mentioned traits including leadership design thinking human meta communication deliberation conflict resolution and the capacity to motivate mobilize and innovate Still others spoke of more practical needs that could help workers in the medium term to work with data and algorithms to implement 3 D modeling and work with 3 D printers or to implement the newly emerging capabilities in artificial intelligence and augmented and virtual reality Jonathan Grudin principal researcher at Microsoft commented People will create the jobs of the future not simply train for them and technology is already central It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead Seriously You re asking about the workforce of the future As if there s going to be one Anonymous scientific editorAbout a third of respondents expressed no confidence in training and education evolving quickly enough to match demands by 2026 Some of the bleakest answers came from some of the most respected technology analysts For instance Jason Hong an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University wrote There are two major components needed for a new kind of training program at this scale political will and a proven technology platform Even assuming that the political will and budget existed there s no platform today that can successfully train large numbers of people MOOCs Massive Open Online Courses have a high dropout rate and have serious questions about quality of instruction They are also struggling with basic issues like identification of individuals taking the courses So in short we can train small numbers of individuals tens of thousands per year using today s community colleges and university systems but probably not more Several respondents argued that job training is not a primary concern at a time when accelerating change in market economies is creating massive economic divides that seem likely to leave many people behind An anonymous scientific editor commented Seriously You re asking about the workforce of the future As if there s going to be one Employers either run sweatshops abroad or hire people in the first world to do jobs that they hate while more and more unskilled and skilled people end up permanently on welfare or zero hour contracts And the relatively job secure qualified people who work in the professions are probably a lot closer than they think they are to going over that same cliff The details of how they earn their credentials aren t going to be an issue Most participants in this canvassing wrote detailed elaborations explaining their positions though they were allowed to respond anonymously Their well considered comments provide insights about hopeful and concerning trends These findings do not represent all possible points of view but they do reveal a wide range of striking observations Respondents collectively articulated five major themes that are introduced and briefly explained in the 29 page section below and then expanded upon in more detailed sections Some responses are lightly edited for style or due to length The following section presents a brief overview of the most evident themes extracted from the written responses including a small selection of representative quotes supporting each point Some responses are lightly edited for style or due to length These experts envision that the next decade will bring a more widely diversified world of education and training options in which various entities design and deliver different services to those who seek to learn They expect that some innovation will be aimed at emphasizing the development of human talents that machines cannot match and at helping humans partner with technology They say some parts of the ecosystem will concentrate on delivering real time learning to workers often in formats that are self taught Commonly occurring ideas among the responses in this category are collected below under headings reflecting subthemes Most experts seem to have faith that rapid technological development and a rising wariness of coming impacts of the AI robotics revolution are going to spur the public private and governmental actions needed for education and training systems to be adapted to deliver more flexible open adaptable resilient certifiable and useful lifelong learning Educators have always found new ways of training the next generation of students for the jobs of the future and this generation will be no different Justin ReichJim Hendler a professor of computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute predicted The nature of education will change to a mix of models College education which will still favor multi year residential education will need to be more focused on teaching students to be lifelong learners followed by more online content in situ training and other such elements to increase skills in a rapidly changing information world As automation puts increasing numbers of low and middle skill workers out of work these models will also provide for certifications and training needs to function in an increasingly automated service sector Michael Wollowski an associate professor of computer science at the Rose Hulman Institute of Technology commented We will definitely see a vast increase in educational and training programs We will also see what might be called on demand or on the job kind of training programs We kind of have to as with continued automation we will need to retrain a large portion of the workforce I strongly believe employers will subscribe to this idea wholeheartedly it increases the overall education of their workforce which benefits their bottom line Nevertheless I am a big believer in the college experience which I see as a way to learn what you are all about as a person and in your field of study The confidence in your own self and your abilities cannot be learned in a short course It takes life experience or four years at a tough college At a good college you are challenged to be your best this is very resource intensive and cannot be scaled at this time Justin Reich executive director at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT Teaching Systems Lab observed Educators have always found new ways of training the next generation of students for the jobs of the future and this generation will be no different Our established systems of job training primarily community colleges and state universities will continue to play a crucial role though catastrophically declining public support for these institutions will raise serious challenges David Karger a professor of computer science at MIT wrote Most of what we now call online learning is little more than glorified textbooks but the future is very promising No matter how good our online teaching systems become the current four year college model will remain dominant for quite some time Online teaching will increase the reach of the top universities which will put pressure on lesser universities to demonstrate value One potential future would be for those universities to abandon the idea that they have faculty teaching their own courses and instead consist entirely of a cadre of less well paid teaching assistants who provide support for the students who are taking courses online A few respondents said already established institutions cannot be as fully successful as new initiatives Jerry Michalski founder at REX commented Today s educational and training institutions are a shambles They take too long to teach impractical skills and knowledge not connected to the real world and when they try to tackle critical thinking for a longer time scale they mostly fail The sprouts of the next generation of learning tools are already visible Within the decade the new shoots will overtake the wilting vines and we will see all sorts of new initiatives mostly outside these schooling academic and training institutions which are mostly beyond repair People will shift to them because they work because they are far less expensive and because they are always available Barry Chudakov founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp says education has been liberated because thanks to digital innovation everyone can embed learning continuously in their everyday lives He wrote The key to education in the next 10 years will be the understanding that we now live in a world without walls and so the walls of the school physical and conceptual need to shatter and never go up again In the hopefully near future we will not segregate schooling from work and real world thinking and development They will seamlessly weave into a braid of learning realization exposure hands on experience and integration into students own lives And again the experience of being a student now confined to grade school secondary school and university will expand to include workers those looking for work and those who want or need to retrain as well as what we now think of as conventional education One way we will break down these walls we are already doing so will be to create digital learning spaces to rival classrooms as places where learning happen s Via simulation gaming digital presentations combined with hands on real world experience learning and re education will move out of books and into the world The more likely enhancement will be to take digital enhancements out into the world again breaking down the walls of the classroom and school to inform and enhance experience An anonymous respondent echoed the sentiment of quite a few others who do not think it is possible to advance and enhance online education and training much in the next decade writing These programs have a cost and too few are willing to sacrifice for these programs More such arguments are included in later sections of this report Some respondents expressed confidence in the best of current online education and training options saying online course options are cost effective evolving for the better and game changing because they are globally accessible Those with the most optimism expect great progress will be made in augmented reality AR virtual reality VR and AI While some say 2026 will still be early days for this tech many are excited about its prospects for enhancing learning in the next decade Already today there are quite effective online training and education systems but they are not being implemented to their full potential Edward FriedmanEdward Friedman professor emeritus of technology management at the Stevens Institute of Technology wrote Already today there are quite effective online training and education systems but they are not being implemented to their full potential These applications will become more widely used with familiarity that is gained during the next decade Also populations will be more tech savvy and be able to make use of these systems with greater personal ease In addition the development of virtual reality AI assistants and other technological advances will add to the effectiveness of these systems There will be a greater need for such systems as the needs for new expertise in the workforce increase and the capacity of traditional education systems proves that it is not capable of meeting the need in a cost effective manner The president of a technology LLC wrote Training teaching are all going online partly because of high costs of campus education Richard Adler distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future predicted AI voice response telepresence VR and gamification techniques will come together to create powerful new learning environments capable of personalizing and accelerating learning across a broad range of fields Ray Schroeder associate vice chancellor for online learning at the University of Illinois Springfield commented It is projected that those entering the workforce today will pursue four or five different careers not just jobs over their lifetime These career changes will require retooling training and education The adult learners will not be able to visit physical campuses to access this learning they will learn online I expect that we will see the further development of artificially intelligent teaching specialists such as Jill Watson at Georgia Tech the virtual graduate assistant who was thought to be human by an entire class of computer science students I anticipate the further development and distribution of holoportation technologies such as those developed by Microsoft using HoloLens for real time three dimensional augmented reality These teaching tools will enable highly sophisticated interactions and engagement with students at a distance They will further fuel the scaling of learning to reach even more massive online classes Fredric Litto an professor emeritus of communications and longtime distance learning expert from the University of S o Paulo replied There is no field of work that cannot be learned totally or in great part in well organized and administered online programs either in traditional course formats or in self directed independent learning opportunities supplemented when appropriate by face to face hands on practice situations Tawny Schlieski research director at Intel and president of the Oregon Story Board explained New technologies of human computer interaction like augmented and virtual reality offer the possibility of entirely new mechanisms of education Augmented and virtual reality tools make learning more experiential they engage students with physical movement and they enable interactive and responsive instructional assets As these tools evolve over the next decade the academics we work with expect to see radical change in training and workforce development which will roll into although probably against a longer timeline more traditional institutions of higher learning Many respondents said real world campus based higher education will continue to thrive during the next decade They generally expect that no other educational experience can match residential universities capabilities for fully immersive person to person learning as well as mentoring and socializing functions before 2026 They said a residential university education helps build intangible skills that are not replicable online and thus deepens the skills base of those who can afford to pay for such an education but they expect that job specific training will be managed by employers on the job and via novel approaches Some say major universities core online course content developed with all of the new tech bells and whistles will be marketed globally and adopted as baseline learning in smaller higher education locales where online elements from major MOOCs can be optimally paired in hybrid learning with in person mentoring activities The most important skills to have in life are gained through interpersonal experiences and the liberal arts Human bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion empathy vulnerability and social emotional intelligence Frank ElavskyUta Russmann communications marketing sales professor at the FHWien University of Applied Sciences in Vienna Austria said In the future more and more jobs will require highly sophisticated people whose skills cannot be trained in mass online programs Traditional four year and graduate programs will better prepare people for jobs in the future as such an education gives people a general understanding and knowledge about their field and here people learn how to approach new things ask questions and find answers deal with new situations etc all this is needed to adjust to ongoing changes in work life Special skills for a particular job will be learned on the job Frank Elavsky data and policy analyst at Acumen LLC responded The most important skills to have in life are gained through interpersonal experiences and the liberal arts Human bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion empathy vulnerability and social emotional intelligence These skills are imperative to focus on as the future is in danger of losing these skillsets from the workforce Many people have gained these skills throughout history without any kind of formal schooling but with the growing emphasis on virtual and digital mediums of production education and commerce people will have less and less exposure to other humans in person and other human perspectives Isto Huvila professor at Uppsala University replied The difference between educating to perform and educating to make the future is the difference between vocational education and higher university education Spending four years at a university is not only about learning skills but about bildung self cultivation and socialising in a group that is capable of fostering collaboration much better than an ad hoc group of people But this does not mean that alternative means and paths of learning and accreditation would not be useful as complementary to the traditional system that has limitations as well Dana Klisanin psychologist futurist at Evolutionary Guidance Media R D wrote Educational institutions that succeed will use the tools of social media and game design to grant students access to teachers from all over the world and increase their motivation to succeed Online educational programs will influence the credentialing systems of traditional institutions and online institutions will increasingly offer meet ups and mingles such that a true hybrid educational approach emerges Will training for skills most important in the jobs of the future work well in large scale settings by 2026 Respondents in this canvassing overwhelmingly said yes anticipating that improvements in such education would continue However many believe the most vital skills are not easy to teach learn or evaluate in any education or training setting available today Dozens of descriptive terms were applied by respondents as they noted the skills capabilities and attributes they see as important in workers lives in the next decade The skills needed to succeed in today s world and the future are curiosity creativity taking initiative multi disciplinary thinking and empathy These skills interestingly are the skills specific to human beings that machines and robots cannot do Tiffany ShlainWhile coding and other hard skills were listed as being easiest to teach to a large group in an online setting soft human skills were seen by most respondents as crucial for survival in the age of AI and robotics Devin Fidler research director at the Institute for the Future predicted As basic automation and machine learning move toward becoming commodities uniquely human skills will become more valuable There will be an increasing economic incentive to develop mass training that better unlocks this value Susan Price a digital architect at Continuum Analytics commented Increasingly machines will perform tasks they are better suited to perform than humans such as computation data analysis and logic Functions requiring emotional intelligence empathy compassion and creative judgment and discernment will expand and be increasingly valued in our culture Tiffany Shlain filmmaker and founder of the Webby Awards wrote The skills needed to succeed in today s world and the future are curiosity creativity taking initiative multi disciplinary thinking and empathy These skills interestingly are the skills specific to human beings that machines and robots cannot do and you can be taught to strengthen these skills through education I look forward to seeing innovative live and online programs that can teach these at scale Ben Shneiderman professor of computer science at the University of Maryland observed Students can be trained to be more innovative creative and active initiators of novel ideas Skills of writing speaking and making videos are important but fundamental skills of critical thinking community building teamwork deliberation dialogue and conflict resolution will be powerful A mindset of persistence and the necessary passion to succeed are also critical Louisa Heinrich founder at Superhuman Limited commented Lateral and system thinking skills are increasingly critical for success in an ever changing global landscape and these will need to be re prioritised at all levels of education An anonymous technologist commented Programming and problem solving learning how to work with artificial intelligence and robotics will become more important and more and more workers will be replaced by software hardware based workers Automation will reduce the need for the current workforce and the divide between the upper class and the lower class will continue to eat the middle class Some who are pessimistic about the future of human work due to advances in capable AI and robotics mocked the current push in the U S to train more people in technical skills An anonymous respondent commented Teach a billion people to program and you ll end up with 900 000 000 unemployed programmers An anonymous program director for a major U S technology funding organization predicted We will see training for the jobs of the past and for service jobs The jobs of the future will not need large numbers of workers with a fixed set of skills most things that we can train large numbers of workers for we will also be able to train computers to do better Among the many other skills mentioned were process oriented and system oriented thinking journalistic skills including research evaluation of multiple sources writing and speaking understanding algorithms computational thinking networking and programming grasping law and policy an evidence based way of looking at the world time management conflict resolution decision making locating information in the flood of data storytelling using data and influencing and consensus building A few people mentioned that young adults need to be taught how to have face to face interaction including one who said they seem to be sorely lacking in these skills and can only interact with a cellphone or laptop Because so many intricacies of the workplace the human soft and hard are learned on the job respondents said they expect apprenticeships and forms of mentoring will regain value and evolve along with the 21st century workplace D Yvette Wohn assistant professor of information systems at the New Jersey Institute of Technology wrote Formalized apprenticeships that require both technical skills and interpersonal interaction will become more important Ian O Byrne an assistant professor of literacy education at the College of Charleston replied In the future we ll see more opportunities for online personalized learning This will include open online learning experiences e g MOOCs where individuals can lurk and build up capacity or quench interests I also believe that we ll see a rise in the offering of premium or pay content that creates a space where one to one learning and interaction will allow mentors to guide learners while providing critical feedback We will identify opportunities to build a digital version of the apprenticeship learning models that have existed in the past Alternative credentials and digital badges will provide more granular opportunities to document and archive learning over time from traditional and nontraditional learning sources Through evolving technologies e g blockchain this may provide opportunities for learners to document and frame their own learning pathways An instructional designer with 19 years of experience commented The pattern I m seeing is toward individualized learning almost on the level of tutoring or apprenticeship We ve seen again and again that the broader the audience focus the less the course seems to deliver As for what the skills of the future are they ll be specialized to their fields with a university degree assumed to be a certificate in the ability to learn more about a particular subject specialty You may get a degree in computer software development but the truth is that you still need to be taught how to write software for say the mortgage company or insurance company that hires you The key to the future will be flexibility and personal motivation to learn and tinker with new things As they anticipate the appearance of effective new learning environments and advances in digital accountability systems many of these experts believe fresh certification programs will be created to attest to workers participation in training programs and the mastery of skills Some predict that many more workers will begin using online and app based learning systems Charlie Firestone communications and society program executive director and vice president at The Aspen Institute replied There will be a move toward more precise and better credentialing for skills and competencies e g badging and similar techniques Employers will accept these more as they prove probative And online learning will be more prevalent even as an adjunct to formal classroom learning New industries such as green energy and telemedicine will increase new employment opportunities Despite all of these measures the loss of jobs from artificial intelligence and robotics will exceed any retraining program at least in the short run Sam Punnett research officer at TableRock Media wrote I suspect employers will recognize the new credentialing systems Particularly those certificates awarded for studies in emerging disciplines currently data science appears all the rage and those that reflect an upgrade of previously acquired skills Traditional credentials will continue to hold value but I believe they will be considered in light of a candidates perceived ability in learning how to learn The four year degree and subsequent graduate studies will continue to be less of a guaranty towards employment without work experience Certificates are being viewed more favourably and many universities are lagging in their connection between their pedagogies and working world requirements William J Ward a university communications professor DR4WARD commented Higher Education is doing a poor job of preparing students with the skills they need to succeed in the workforce Online and credentialing systems are more transparent and do a better job on delivering skills People with new types of credentialing systems are seen as more qualified than traditional four year and graduate programs Many workplaces place a higher value on real world work portfolios than they do on a degree or certification yet their hiring systems including AI bots programmed to scan resum s still use the commonly accepted credentials as a basis for interviewing candidates Some respondents hope to see change Schools today turn out widget makers who can make widgets all the same They are built on producing single right answers rather than creative solutions Jeff JarvisA software engineering and system administration professional commented The reliability of the traditional educational system is already being questioned in some fields it s considered common sense that certifications and degrees mean little and that a portfolio references and hands on interviews are much more important for assessing a candidate s ability The unfortunate reality is that many HR departments still post job listings saying degrees and certifications are required as a way of screening candidates Both of those cost a lot of money and neither mean a lot for a candidate s competence I hope this will change both job listings and quality of degrees certifications but don t see it happening soon Meryl Krieger career specialist at Indiana University Bloomington s Jacobs School replied Credentialing systems will involve portfolios as much as resum s resum s simply are too two dimensional to properly communicate someone s skillset Three dimensional materials in essence job reels that demonstrate expertise will be the ultimate demonstration of an individual worker s skills I see credentialing as a piece of a very complex set of criteria these will also incorporate an individual s ability to communicate and work with teams huge in employer requests for new employees which can more readily be documented and tracked through online portfolio tools than through traditional resume formats Thus the educational and training programs of the future will become in their best incarnations sophisticated combinations of classroom and hands on training programs The specific models will necessarily be responding to individual industry requirements Jeff Jarvis a professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism wrote Schools today turn out widget makers who can make widgets all the same They are built on producing single right answers rather than creative solutions They are built on an outmoded attention economy Pay us for 45 hours of your attention and we will certify your knowledge I believe that many not all areas of instruction should shift to competency based education in which the outcomes needed are made clear and students are given multiple paths to achieve those outcomes and they are certified not based on tests and grades but instead on portfolios of their work demonstrating their knowledge While the first three themes found among the responses to this canvassing were mostly hopeful about advances in education and training for 21st century jobs a large share of responses from top experts reflect a significant degree of pessimism for various reasons Some even say the future of jobs for humans is so baleful that capitalism may fail as an economic system The next themes and subthemes examine these responses A large share of respondents predicted that online formats for knowledge transfer will not advance significantly in the next decade The 30 who expressed pessimism were often deeply doubtful about the capabilities of current education systems to adapt to pivot to respond to new challenges as quickly as necessary Interestingly being able to adapt and respond to looming challenges was seen by nearly everyone in this canvassing as one of the most highly prized future capabilities these respondents especially agree that it is important and they say that our human institutions government business education are not adapting efficiently and are letting us down Many of them say that current K 12 or K 16 education programs are incapable of making adjustments within the next decade to serve the shifting needs of future jobs markets Among the other reasons listed by people who do not expect these kinds of transformative advances in job creation and job skill upgrading Some among the 70 of respondents who are mostly optimistic about the future of training for jobs also echoed one or more of the points above mentioning these tension points while hoping for the best Following are representative statements tied to these points and more from all respondents Thomas Claburn editor at large at Information Week wrote I m skeptical that educational and training programs can keep pace with technology Traditional models train people to equate what they do with who they are i e what do you want to be when you grow up rather than to acquire critical thinking and flexible skills and attitudes that fit a rapidly changing world Pamela RutledgeAndrew Walls managing vice president at Gartner wrote Barring a neuroscience advance that enables us to embed knowledge and skills directly into brain tissue and muscle formation there will be no quantum leap in our ability to up skill people Learning takes time and practice which means it requires money lots of money to significantly change the skill set of a large cohort B Remy Cross assistant professor of sociology Webster University commented Lacking a significant breakthrough in machine learning that could lead to further breakthroughs in adaptive responses by a fully online system it is too hard to adequately instruct large numbers of people in the kinds of soft skills that are anticipated as being in most demand As manufacturing and many labor intensive jobs move overseas or are fully mechanized we will see a bulge in service jobs These require good people skills something that is often hard to train online John Bell software developer and teacher at Dartmouth College replied Even today access to information is not the limiting factor in skills education for anyone who can go online While there have been generational gains in the developments of online communities a large scale educational experience either MOOC or on demand broadcasts will not be able to duplicate that Stowe Boyd managing director of Another Voice and a well known thinker on work futures discussed the intangibles of preparing humans to partner with AI and bot systems While we may see the creation and rollout of new training programs he observed it s unclear whether they will be able to retrain those displaced from traditional sorts of work to fit into the workforce of the near future Many of the skills that will be needed are more like personality characteristics like curiosity or social skills that require enculturation to take hold Individual training like programming or learning how to cook may not be what will be needed And employers may play less of a role especially as AI and bot augmented independent contracting may be the best path for many rather than a job Homesteading in exurbia may be the answer for many with forty acres and a bot as a political campaign slogan of 2024 Luis Miron a distinguished university professor and director of the Institute for Quality and Equity in Education at Loyola University in New Orleans wrote Bluntly speaking I have little confidence in the educational sector K 16 having the capacity and vision to offer high quality online educational programs capable of transforming the training needs of the wider society The most important skills are advanced critical thinking and knowledge of globalization affecting diverse societies culturally religiously and politically Pamela Rutledge director of the Media Psychology Research Center wrote The core assumptions driving educational content are not adapting as fast as the world is changing Traditional models train people to equate what they do with who they are i e what do you want to be when you grow up rather than to acquire critical thinking and flexible skills and attitudes that fit a rapidly changing world We have traditional institutions invested in learning as a supply side model rather than demand side that would create proactive self directed learners This bias impacts the entire process from educators to employers It is changing but beliefs are sticky and institutions are cumbersome bureaucracies that are slow to adapt New delivery systems for skills related to technology will be more readily accepted than traditional ones because they avoid much of the embedded bias Successful education models will begin developing mixed methods to leverage technology with traditional delivery and rewrite certification processes with practice relevant standards Justin Reich executive director at the MIT Teaching Systems Lab observed There will continue to be for profit actors in the sector and while some may offer choice and opportunity for students many others will be exploitative with a great er focus on extracting federal grants and burdening students with debt than actually educating students and creating new opportunities John Paine a business analyst commented The competing desires 1 to make educational activity available to all and 2 to monetize the bejeezus out of anything related to the internet will limit the effectiveness of any online learning systems in a more widespread context danah boyd founder of Data Society commented I have complete faith in the ability to identify job gaps and develop educational tools to address those gaps I have zero confidence in us having the political will to address the socio economic factors that are underpinning skill training For example companies won t pay for reskilling and we don t have the political power to tax them at the level needed for public investment in reskilling Furthermore we have serious geographic mismatches underlying discriminatory attitudes and limited opportunities for lower to mid level career advancement What s at stake are not simply skills gaps it s about how we want to architect labor benefits and social safety nets And right now we talk about needing to increase skills but that s not what employers care about It just sounds nice When computer science graduates from CUNY and Howard University can t get a job what s at stake is not skills training Among the future worker capabilities with the highest value in these respondents eyes are the ability to adapt or pivot and the motivation to up skill as needed Many respondents emphasized that the most crucial skill is that people have to learn how to learn and be self motivated to keep learning My biggest concern with self directed learning is that it requires a great deal of internal motivation And I am not confident that individuals will find their way David BersteinDavid Bernstein a former research director wrote The most important skills needed to succeed in the workplace will be flexibility and the ability to adapt and continuously learn My biggest concern with self directed learning is that it requires a great deal of internal motivation And I am not confident that individuals will find their way just as those who enter college today don t know what they want to be when they grow up often until after they graduate So everyone will still need some basic skills interpersonal communications basic arithmetic along with some general culture awareness so they can have that flexibility Any 3 year old can use their parent s smartphone or tablet without reading the manual What I worry about is how well they will adapt when they are 35 or 55 Calton Pu professor and junior chair in software at the Georgia Institute of Technology wrote The most important skill is a meta skill the ability to adapt to changes This ability to adapt is what distinguished Homo sapiens from other species through natural selection As the rate of technological innovation intensifies the workforce of the future will need to adapt to new technology and new markets The people who can adapt the best and fastest will win This view means that any given set of skills will become obsolete quickly as innovations change the various economic sectors precision agriculture manufacturing 4 0 precision medicine just to name a few Therefore the challenge is not only to teach skills but also how to adapt and learn new skills Whether the traditional programs or new programs will be better at teaching adaptive learning remains to be seen Cory Salveson learning systems and analytics lead at RSM US responded The nature of work today and in future is such that if people want to keep increasingly scarce well paying jobs they will need to educate themselves in an ongoing manner for their whole lives Some of these experts say those who aren t motivated to continue to learn and grow will be left behind Scott Amyx CEO of Amyx said online training is advancing and will continue to evolve but The education system is at an inflection point Many ambitious federal and state programs have fizzled to produce dismal to no statistical change in the caliber of K 12 education It s those less educated and less skilled who are most sensitive to technological displacement Online mediums and self directed approaches may be limited in effectiveness with certain labor segments unless supplemented by human coaching and support systems Beth Corzo Duchardt a professor at Muhlenberg College replied Self directed study is a variable that changes the alchemy of teaching and learning It is true that most online courses require self direction Indeed when I advise students I don t recommend that students take online courses unless they have demonstrated an aptitude for self direction But in person courses may also be self directed This works well for some students but not others Students who are self directed often have had a very good foundational education and supportive parents They have been taught to think critically and they know that the most important thing you can learn is how to learn And they are also are more likely to come from economic privilege So not only does the self direction factor pose a problem for teaching at scale the fact that a high degree of self direction may be required for successful completion of coursework towards the new workforce means that existing structures of inequality will be replicated in the future if we rely on these large scale programs Among the 30 of respondents who said they did not think things would turn out well in the future were those who said the trajectory of technology will overwhelm labor markets killing more jobs than it creates They foresee a society where AI programs and machines do most of the work and raise questions about people s sense of identity the socio economic divisions that already distress them their ability to pay for basic needs their ability to use the growing amount of leisure time constructively and the impact of all of this on economic systems It should also be noted that many among the 70 who expect positive change in the next decade also expressed some of these concerns The problem of future jobs is not one of skills training it is one of diminishing jobs How will we cope with a workforce that is simply irrelevant Jennifer ZickermanCory Doctorow activist in residence at MIT Media Lab and co owner of Boing Boing boingboing net responded It s an article of faith that automation begets more jobs than it displaces in the long run but this is a theory free observation based on previous automation booms The current automation is based on general purpose technologies machine learning Turing complete computers a universal network architecture that is equally optimized for all applications and there s good reason to believe that this will be more disruptive and create fewer new jobs than those that came before Glenn Ricart Internet Hall of Fame member and founder and chief technology officer of US Ignite said Up to the present time automation largely has been replacing physical drudgery and repetitive motion things that can and should improve the quality of people s work lives But in the next decade or two there is likely to be a significant amount of technological innovation in machine intelligence and personal assistants that takes a real swipe out of the jobs we want humans to have in education health care transportation agriculture and public safety What are the new jobs we want these people to have If we haven t been able to invent them in response to international trade pacts why are we sure we will be able to create them in the future Richard Stallman Internet Hall of Fame member and president of the Free Software Foundation commented I think this question has no answer I think there won t be jobs for most people a few decades from now and that s what really matters As for the skills for the employed fraction of advanced countries I think they will be difficult to teach You could get better at them by practice but you couldn t study them much Jennifer Zickerman an entrepreneur commented The problem of future jobs is not one of skills training it is one of diminishing jobs How will we cope with a workforce that is simply irrelevant The question isn t how to train people for nonexistent jobs it s how to share the wealth in a world where we don t need most people to work Nathaniel BorensteinNathaniel Borenstein chief scientist at Mimecast replied I challenge the premise of this question that humans will have to be trained for future jobs The jobs of the future are likely to be performed by robots The question isn t how to train people for nonexistent jobs it s how to share the wealth in a world where we don t need most people to work Paul Davis a director based in Australia predicted Whilst such programs will be developed and rolled out on a large scale I question their overall effectiveness Algorithms automation and robotics will result in capital no longer needing labor to progress the economic agenda Labor becomes in many ways surplus to economic requirements This shift will dramatically transform the notion of economic growth and significantly disrupt social contracts labor s bargaining position will be dramatically weakened The nature of this change may require the world to shift to a Post Economic Growth model to avoid societal dislocation and disruption John Sniadowski a systems architect replied The skill sets which could have been taught will be superseded by AI and other robotic technology By the time the training programs are widely available the required skills will no longer be required The whole emphasis of training must now be directed towards personal life skills development rather than the traditional working career based approach There is also the massive sociological economic impact of general automation and AI that must be addressed to redistribute wealth and focus life skills at lifelong learning Tom Sommerville agile coach wrote Our greatest economic challenges over the next decade will be climate change and the wholesale loss of most jobs to automation We urgently need to explore how to distribute the increasing wealth of complex goods and services our civilization produces to a populace that will be increasingly jobless in the traditional sense The current trend of concentrating wealth in the hands of a diminishing number of ultra rich individuals is unsustainable All of this while dealing with the destabilizing effects of climate change and the adaptations necessary to mitigate its worst impacts Some of these experts projected further out into the future imagining a world where the machines themselves learn and overtake core human emotional and cognitive capacities Timothy C Mack managing principal at AAI Foresight said In the area of skill building the wild card is the degree to which machine learning begins to supplant social creative and emotive skill sets This section features responses by several more of the many top analysts who participated in this canvassing Following this wide ranging set of comments on the topic a much more expansive set of quotations directly tied to the set of four themes begins on Page 40 Baratunde Thurston a director s fellow at MIT Media Lab Fast Company columnist and former digital director of The Onion replied Online training and certification will grow significantly in part due to the high expense of formal higher education along with its declining payoffs for certain occupations Why go 100 000 in debt for a four year university when you can take a more targeted course with more guaranteed income generation potential at the end From the employer perspective this type of learning will only grow We are creating a system of on demand labor akin to cloud based labor where companies provision labor resources at will and release them at will not by the year or month but by the job labor unit or small time unit including minutes The automation of human labor will grow significantly And having a workforce trained in discrete and atomizable bits of skills will be seen as a benefit by employers This of course is a terrible soulless insecure life for the workers but since when did that really change anything There will also be a parallel call for benefits professional development and compensation that smooths out the rough patches in this on demand labor life but such efforts will lag behind the exploitation of said labor because big business has more resources and big tech moves too fast for human scale responses of accountability and responsibility To quote Donald Trump Sad Doc Searls journalist speaker and director of Project VRM at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society wrote I don t expect the evolution of work in the connected world to require new educational and training programs Instead I expect we ll see much more adaptive forms of education especially of the self made kind Look at Linux and open source development The world runs on both now and they employ millions of human beings Many or most of the new open source programmers building and running our world today are self taught or teach each other to a higher degree than they are educated by formal schooling Look at Khan Academy and the home schooling movement both of which in many ways outperform formal institutional education The main qualification for programming work isn t a degree It s proven capability This model for employment of self and others will also spread to other professions By the way I don t like the term job It demeans work and reduces the worker to a position in an org chart The great educator John Taylor Gatto who won many awards for his teaching and rarely obeyed curricular requirements says nearly all attempts to reform education make it worse We are by nature learning animals We are each also very different both from each other and from who we were yesterday As a society we need to take advantage of that and nurture our natural hunger for knowledge and productive work while respecting and encouraging our diversity a fundamental balancing feature of all nature human and otherwise Jeff Jarvis professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism wrote At a roundtable on the future convened by Union Square Ventures a few years ago I heard this economic goal presented We need to see the marginal cost of teaching another student fall to zero to see true innovation come to education allowing change to occur outside the tax based and thus safe confines of public education I don t think we ll ever reach zero MOOCs are not the solution But we will likely see a radical economic disruption in education using new tools and means to learn and certify learning and that is the way by which we will manage to train many more people in many new skills Cory Doctorow activist in residence at MIT Media Lab and co owner of Boing Boing boingboing net responded There is for the immediate and medium term a huge shortage of IT talent of course especially security researchers and professionals In part this is driven by the legal and educational framework that takes a zero tolerance approach to the hacking that kids historically engaged in on their way to becoming security researchers If a kid today hacks her school s censoring firewall to look at a blocked site she is expelled and possibly arrested not streamed into an Advanced Placement computer science class We also have a poorly constituted math curriculum for understanding algorithms which is really understanding the statistics of machine learning models An earlier and more enduring focus on stats and statistical literacy which can readily be taught using current affairs for example analyzing the poll numbers from elections the claims made by climate change scientists or even the excellent oral arguments in the Supreme Court Texas abortion law case would impart skills that transferred well into IT programming and especially security Amy Webb futurist and CEO at the Future Today Institute commented Gill Pratt a former program manager of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA recently warned of a Cambrian Explosion of robotics About 500 000 years ago Earth experienced its first Cambrian Explosion a period of rapid cellular evolution and diversification that resulted in the foundation of life as we know it today We are clearly in the dawn of a new age one that is marked not just by advanced machines but rather machines that are starting to learn how to think Soon those machines that can think will augment humankind helping to unlock our creative and industrial potential Some of the workforce will find itself displaced by automation That includes anyone whose primary job functions are transactional bank tellers drivers mortgage brokers However there are many fields that will begin to work alongside smart machines doctors journalists teachers The most important skill of any future worker will be adaptability This current Cambrian Explosion of machines will mean diversification in our systems our interfaces our code Workers who have the temperament and fortitude to quickly learn new menu screens who can find information quickly and the like will fare well I do not see the wide scale emergence of training programs during the next 10 years due to the emergence of smart machines alone If there are unanticipated external events environmental disasters new pandemics and the like that could devastate a country s economy and significantly impact its workforce which might catalyze the development of online learning opportunities Mike Roberts Internet Hall of Fame member and first president and CEO of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN responded MOOCs and related efforts are in their infancy so yes there will be considerable expansion as more is learned about what works and what doesn t work These developments are contributing to a crisis of self confidence in higher ed where traditional scholarship is being challenged on many fronts including the basic definition of education Human brains are complex and it becomes tiresome to see simplistic approaches to education issues Generally an educated person possesses a level of knowledge about the world that allows him or her to use analytical skills induction deduction probability etc to arrive at conclusions that guide behavior The jury is very much out on the extent to which acquisition of knowledge and reasoning skills requires human interaction We now have empirical evidence that a substantial percentage half or more can be gained through self study using computer assisted techniques The path forward for society as a whole is strewn with obstacles of self interest ignorance flawed economics etc If one believes in the singularity it doesn t matter because human machine symbiosis will bury the problem Judith Donath of Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society replied A lot has been written about the need for STEM science technology engineering and mathematics education Here I want to focus on other areas 1 Teaching and Healing As computers robots and other machines take over many jobs we need to reposition the social status of jobs that involve interpersonal care day care teachers nurse elderly coach The issue is not just training but cultural re evaluation of teaching and healing as highly respected skills While technology can assist with this work we mustn t lose sight of the importance of human connections as an end in and of themselves 2 Craft and Repair For the benefit of both the individual and the environment we need to strongly support learning design craft building repair Few of us make anything we use from the building we live in to the objects we own and these things are mostly manufactured as cheaply as possible to be easily bought discarded and bought again in a process of relentless acquisition that often brings little happiness Education here should be integrated into everyday life not just for when one is in school E g much rental housing is in bad repair with tenants waiting weeks months years for even simple fixes a running toilet broken lights a hole in a wall Very easily accessible learning for how to fix these things themselves and making it economically rewarding in the case of a common good is a simple basic example of the kind of ubiquitous craft learning that at scale would be enormously valuable Some of this can be taught online a key component is also online coordination 3 An Informed Citizen What should people know what skills should they have to be informed participants in a democracy Certainly science and technology are important but we need to refocus liberal education not ignore it History in all its complexity Critical thinking how to debate how to recognize persuasive techniques how to understand multiple perspectives how to mediate between different viewpoints Key skill how to research how to evaluate what you see and read David Weinberger a senior researcher at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society said Judging from what we re seeing happening now on the web it seems likely that many of the innovative platforms will be peer to peer Sites like Stack Overflow for software engineers demonstrate a new moral sense that learning in private is selfish Public learning is becoming the norm Brad Templeton chair for computing at Singularity University wrote We will see the start of these technologies but they will not be widespread at the hard problem of adult retraining in 10 years Instead most focus will be on childhood education for the poorer sectors of the world The most important skill flexibility won t be taught easily this way but must become a focus of K 12 education John Markoff former senior writer at The New York Times said We have now passed through the first generation of MOOCs and a new generation of online learning technology is beginning to emerge Udacity is a good example of the trajectory Sebastian Thrun was one of the inventors of the MOOC concept After starting a company to pursue the idea he pivoted focusing specifically on skill oriented education that is coupled directly to the job market Vint Cerf vice president and chief internet evangelist at Google and an Internet Hall of Fame member noted The internet can support remote training and learning These need not be MOOCs Even mobiles can be sources of education I hope we will see more opportunities arising for sharing this kind of knowledge Marcel Bullinga trend watcher and keynote speaker futurecheck replied The future is cheap and so is the future of education I saw an ad already for 1 000 bachelor s level training with an app of course Schools and universities will transform in the same way as shops have done in the past 10 years from analog human first to digital mobile AI first New online credential systems will first complement then gradually replace the old ones The skills of the future Those are the skills a robot cannot master yet Leadership design human meta communication critical thinking motivating cooperating innovating In my black and white moments I say Skip all knowledge training in high schools Main teaching goal We enable you to survive in an ever changing world with ever changing skills and not yet existing jobs of the future We make you better than a robot We let you cooperate with robots We build your self trust We turn you into a decent polite social person And most importantly we do not mix education with religion never Anil Dash entrepreneur technologist and advocate AnilDash predicted These credentials will start to become widespread but acceptance and quality of the training programs will map to the existing systemic biases that inform current educational and career programs Henning Schulzrinne Internet Hall of Fame member and professor at Columbia University wrote Training programs have had the problem that short duration generic programs are often not very effective except as a way to incrementally add very specific skills learn how to operate the new industry specific tool X in a week to the existing repertoire The subject matter specific part of a B S degree in a technical or scientific field takes at least two years often more and these are high intensity full time years often without other responsibilities such as family mostly for students at an age where learning is still natural and easy A large part of this time is spent not in a classroom but becoming fluent through monitored practice including group work internships and other high intensity high interaction apprentice like programs It is hard to see how workers can afford to spend two years without income support while still fulfilling their adult responsibilities such as taking care of their family or elderly parents There are possibilities for adding limited skill sets to otherwise qualified workers e g the ability to program in Python for somebody who already has an economics degree increasing their ability to get their work done The MOOC style programs have shown themselves to be most effective for this delta learning for practicing professionals not turning a high school graduate into somebody who can compete with a college graduate Jamais Cascio distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future responded We will certainly see attempts to devise training and education to match workers to new jobs but for the most part they re likely to fall victim to two related problems 1 The difficulty of projecting what will be the jobs of the future in a world where the targets keep shifting faster and faster Jobs that seem viable may fall victim to a surprising development in automation see for example filmmaking new categories of work may not last long enough to support large numbers of employees 2 We re in an era of general purpose computing which means that our systems are not physically or procedurally limited to a narrow type of work Automation and semi automation e g self checkout stands don t need to completely eliminate a job to make it unable to support large numbers of workers As learning systems improve we will soon if we re not already be at a point where adaptive algorithms can learn new jobs faster than humans Kate Crawford a well known internet researcher studying how people engage with networked technologies wrote We clearly need new educational and training programs to address the deepening precarity of the labor market But to make it successful in that the right training could be developed to make it possible that everyone will have jobs is very unlikely Paul Jones clinical professor and director at the University of North Carolina replied We learn more today by training and information sipping than in the past Training is useful but not the end of education only a kind of education As for sipping you need not know the name of every bear to know you should avoid bears Yet the continual construction of knowledge and cultures requires more from us So far training formally as in Kahn Academy and Lynda com are unarguably effective for continual updates for basic skills No programmer or developer could keep up without the informal training of Stack Overflow Wikipedia hasn t destroyed bar trivia but it has made a dent in our conversational expertise Who played guitar lead on All or Nothing No need for debate A little information sip will let us know We re fine and informed but not educated or learned But what is left out Collaborative construction of knowledge in new areas deeper investigation into known areas and the discovery of entirely new areas of knowledge This is our challenge how to create wisdom from knowledge not just jobs from training and information Bob Frankston internet pioneer and software innovator commented This is a nuanced question We trained generations of people to be phone operators by making it easy to operate the phone aka dialing Today programming is increasingly become a trade The problem with many websites is not so much the training of the programmers as much as getting managers and C level people who understand the new concepts of a world being redefined by software And that s even more true for policymakers We need to think about co evolving work and workers And as always critical thinking will remain the biggest challenge Frank Pasquale author of The Black Box Society The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information and professor of law at the University of Maryland said The biggest danger for the United States educational system is premature vocationalism Rigorous science and humanities courses help students learn how to learn Skills training all too often does not Of course it can complement core academic courses and is likely to be part of a lifetime of learning for those switching occupations But turning high school and college into narrow vocational education programs would make their graduates more vulnerable to robotic replacement not less We need to invest in higher education shoring up support for traditional universities and colleges lest they eventually become bastions for reproduction of an elite leaving the rest of society to untested experiments or online programs Online learning is a good complement for existing colleges but cannot replace them Online only programs emphasize the upside of high tech approaches but rarely grapple with the downside Big data surveillance will track the work students do ostensibly in order to customize learning Get stuck on a lesson Just keep interfacing with a keyboard camera and perhaps haptic sensors Or perhaps IM some reserve army of tutorial labor via digital labor platforms like Mechanical Turk or TaskRabbit Want to prove you aren t faking exams Just let cameras record your every move and keystroke perhaps your eye movements and facial expressions too With new platforms Silicon Valley has lured some universities into giving away lectures for free The colleges think they re establishing good karma with the public but disrupters hope for a more chaotic endgame students deciding to watch free courses then proving their credentials to certifiers who give out badges to signify competence in a skill set The certifiers most likely won t be burdened with any of the teaching research community service counseling career or otherwise recreation social events extracurriculars or other long standing features of residential university communities They will just verify that student X can do task Y It could be a very profitable business If students pay less for actual instruction by experts they have more money to spend on badges This is the for profit model shift money away from instruction and amenities and toward administrator salaries and marketing Unburdened by legacy staff and faculty ed tech firms could muster a just in time workforce to develop new educational technologies Investors could continue unbundling the university into least cost providers of content units student surveillance and badge granting That vision may draw capital but it probably won t be attractive to many students There are serious worries about rapid centralization and reuse of student data by under regulated firms For instance black boxed instructional technology is often run by algorithms that can t be accessed by the students it is assessing Tom Ryan CEO of eLearn Institute Inc responded The degree and perhaps the prestige of the institution gets you the first interview but it is your ability to do good work that keeps the job and move s you to the next level How individuals develop the skills will be less important than having the skills As mastery learning evolves so will our performance based assessment systems providing universities and businesses a greater set of evidence and qualifications then is currently available Our traditional educational systems are burdened by legacy bureaucratic practices that don t contribute to mastery of learning and distract from great teaching and learning People in rural areas don t have physical access to a higher education campus or highly skilled trainers Current job responsibilities don t allow flexible work schedules to seek skills to improve their position K 12 teachers are constantly pulled from class time with students for professional development or during class are required to take attendance complete grade assessments fill out grade checks practice fire drills all degrading quality teaching time If online systems just removed these barriers they would be a great benefit but there is so much more these systems can offer Many of the new skills necessary for jobs of the future require digital skills to be successful Too often education leaders and politicians make unilateral decisions about the interaction between teacher and learner instead of building and maintaining an environment for great teaching and learning to take place Large school systems can t scale major improvements in current systems without leveraging the tools that society and industry are using to transform their practice Barry Chudakov founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp replied One serious drawback to fast tracking needed educational and training programs the people who are creating the jobs of the future have so little time to reflect and gain perspective on the people they will need and how adding these people to their corporate culture changes that culture These entrepreneurs are so busy building technology infrastructures filing patents testing beta incarnations of ideas and processes not to mention navigating the thicket of regulations and restrictions that surround many emerging technologies and industries that they simply don t have time to look around and see the implications of the changes their companies are creating In the near future we will explode the notion of education as a rite of passage for youth happening within the walls of an institution Educational institutions will not disappear but they will change in ways that make them almost unrecognizable by today s models Just as Pokemon Go lifts people out of their chairs into real world environments to explore imaginary captures we will change learning from a passive to an active dynamic experience Three dynamics that will affect all learning and retraining efforts 1 Newer tools are changing our sense of identity 2 We are moving from the fixed point of view that the book gave us to a multiple simultaneous narrative of flow in a networked environment 3 Again since what we think is what we think through we are applying that logic of visual presentation to our presentation and sense of self The first skill needed to succeed in the workforce of the future will be the ability to understand manage and manipulate data Everyone in a technology based profession will need to be a quant quantitative analyst or keep up with the quants Because all human processes and activities can now be quantified and there is considerable exploration and technology development in the application of quantification to everything from our sleep patterns and shopping habits to our emotions and online behaviors many new and important business models are emerging from quantification and the learning algorithms that drive it The second and much more important skill needed to succeed in the workforce of the future will be the ability to find meaning and value in data combined with the problem condition or opportunity the data is outlining Said simply the greatest skill will be the ability to think through the cloud of facts data experience and strategic direction that products and services require Design thinking or visual thinking will be a critical part of managing a data driven world Data mining and management can be taught effectively Thinking problem solving reflection and visioning are difficult to teach at scale Elisabeth Gee professor at Arizona State University and author of What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy commented First many jobs of the future won t require workers with a lot of training Second degrees and credentials have been increasingly promoted by institutions more driven by profit than an interest in preparing students in any meaningful way for employment If the government doesn t step in to restrict such institutions we ll continue to see students graduate with huge debt and little prospect of decent employment Lastly we don t need large scale training of workers we need real education not job focused and opportunities for people to pursue diverse pathways for career development and lifelong learning Patrick Tucker technology editor at Defense One and author of The Naked Future observed Online education offers the opportunity to gather data on student performance continuously or telemetrically What telemetric education offers is the opportunity to continuously and constantly evaluate a student to gain a much more comprehensive understanding of ability retention of information even how other behaviors and factors such as time of day other calendar items nutrition amount of time on Pokemon Go influence learning It offers a more true moving score Learning will become easier and much more of it will happen outside of school settings all of which will diminish the importance of schools and teachers as we know them today But platforms like Coursera can amplify the talents of gifted and effective instructors and reduce the cost of education in the coming decade for all Some schools and colleges will thrive and prosper at a level not seen in their history But they will do so only by transitioning away from today s classroom model toward something else like data driven skills workshops at the high school level and startup incubators or problem solving workshops at the college level We may be conflicted about replacing classes with platforms but if we are to be honest with ourselves we know that we can t prepare coming generations for the challenges of a technological and globalized economy the same way we prepared previous generations to be factory workers The greatest thinker of the 21st century whoever he or she is will understand more about how she thinks and learns than any student in any previous generation and all before ever stepping foot inside a schoolhouse Imagine for a moment the power of knowing beforehand how well you would perform on a test Laura Matzen of Sandia National Laboratory and some of her colleagues have demonstrated that the brain s electrical activity detectable via electroencephalogram EEG predicts how well studied material has been incorporated into memory and thus how well a subject will perform on memory tests Telemetric education also offers the opportunity for everyone to raise his or her hand and be heard That opportunity doesn t come easily in a crowded classroom especially not for women or minority students many of whom feel that if they ask the wrong question or display ignorance they ll confirm some unflattering broadly held perception about their social group David Golumbia associate professor of digital studies at Virginia Commonwealth University commented As an educator I am completely unconvinced by the current rhetoric that says our educational system is unable to meet the needs of current or future workforces This whole argument is a sham meant to attack the fundamental purpose and basis of education Most empirical evidence shows that the premises of this question are incorrect most high skilled jobs of the sort implied here have an oversupply of qualified talent We need more of an emphasis on the fundamental purpose of education not on skills Stephen Downes researcher at the National Research Council of Canada commented We will see educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers because for the most part mechanisms will be in place that enable them to train themselves Within 10 years we should be beginning to see that the idea of providing training education or training is misguided because it s overly expensive and less effective than self managed learning I find it interesting even that the question itself presumes that skills must be taught Which of these skills can be taught effectively via online systems It s not that the skills are taught per se but rather that the skills are learned A wide range of activities may enable skills to be learned especially multidisciplinary skills such as critical thinking or social interaction without specifically teaching those skills There are very few skills that require specific and personal instruction from an expert to learn frankly I can t think of any which means that within 10 years we should at least be able to countenance the possibility that all or nearly all educational programs may be automated Of course they will continue to require the time and participation of the individual learner and in many cases social interaction with other learners but the labor intensive learning industry we have developed to this point will not be required I see no major objections to this argument 1 It may be argued that personal interaction is required in order to get to know a student and therefore anticipate what they need However in 10 years it will be arguable and probably demonstrable that your own computer networks will know you better than any individual instructor could even an instructor who worked with you your entire life Sure there are disasters like the Facebook news stream but people are already amazed at how much Google knows about them And we know that with enough data analytics can outperform humans even in complex tasks 2 It may be argued that personal interaction is required in order to evaluate a student s level of achievement Most actual assessment not to be confused with multiple choice tests in school or professional programs is based on expert recognition The submitted behavior an essay performance in surgery piloting an aircraft in a simulation is not assessed according to whether a set of indicators is achieved this would possibly be a necessary but never a sufficient condition The expert looks at the overall behavior and assesses whether that competency has been met The expert is serving as a proxy for the community at large With modern communications technology this proxy is no longer required Through the course of any given day as a person goes through various activities they interact with dozens of other people either in person or through online interaction Each person responds to them in some way not by testing them but by for example engaging them in conversation asking questions following advice etc These responses over time form a comprehensive and constantly changing assessment of the person An anonymous postdoctoral fellow at Rice University s Humanities Research Center observed So much has been said and challenged over the past three decades about online education I d like to answer this by asking a different set of questions which address recent developments in robotics and artificial intelligence How will autonomous factories in Chicago U S share what they ve learned with factories in Pingdingshan China What credentialing system will self driving cars require How will artificially intelligent laborers learn the skills needed to run a household business government institution or political organization When will universities allow artilect nonhuman artificial intelligence students to enroll in their traditional undergraduate and graduate degree programs and how would students learn the more ephemeral skills like critical thinking from a thinking machine
