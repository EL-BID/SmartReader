Copyright © McKinsey & Company 2017

Since its founding in 1990, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) has sought 
to develop a deeper understanding of the evolving global economy. As the 
business and economics research arm of McKinsey & Company, MGI aims 
to provide leaders in the commercial, public, and social sectors with the facts 
and insights on which to base management and policy decisions. The Lauder 
Institute at the University of Pennsylvania ranked MGI the world’s number-one 
private-sector think tank in its 2015 Global Think Tank Index. 

MGI research combines the disciplines of economics and management, 
employing the analytical tools of economics with the insights of business 
leaders. Our “micro-to-macro” methodology examines microeconomic 
industry trends to better understand the broad macroeconomic forces 
affecting business strategy and public policy. MGI’s in-depth reports have 
covered more than 20 countries and 30 industries. Current research focuses 
on six themes: productivity and growth, natural resources, labor markets, the 
evolution of global financial markets, the economic impact of technology and 
innovation, and urbanization. 

Recent reports have assessed the economic benefits of tackling gender 
inequality, a new era of global competition, Chinese innovation, and 
digital globalization. MGI is led by four McKinsey & Company senior 
partners: Jacques Bughin, James Manyika, Jonathan Woetzel, and 
Frank Mattern, MGI’s chairman. Michael Chui, Susan Lund, Anu Madgavkar, 
Sree Ramaswamy, and Jaana Remes serve as MGI partners. Project 
teams are led by the MGI partners and a group of senior fellows and include 
consultants from McKinsey offices around the world. These teams draw 
on McKinsey’s global network of partners and industry and management 
experts. Input is provided by the MGI Council, which coleads projects 
and provides guidance; members are Andres Cadena, Richard Dobbs, 
Katy George, Rajat Gupta, Eric Hazan, Eric Labaye, Acha Leke, Scott Nyquist, 
Gary Pinkus, Shirish Sankhe, Oliver Tonby, and Eckart Windhagen. In addition, 
leading economists, including Nobel laureates, act as research advisers.

A FUTURE THAT WORKS: 
AUTOMATION, EMPLOYMENT, 
AND PRODUCTIVITY



PREFACE 

Automation is an idea that has inspired science fiction writers and futurologists for more than 
a century. Today it is no longer fiction, as companies increasingly use robots on production 
lines or algorithms to optimize their logistics, manage inventory, and carry out other core 
business functions. Technological advances are creating a new automation age in which 
ever-smarter and more flexible machines will be deployed on an ever-larger scale in the 
workplace. In reality, the process of automating tasks done by humans has been under way 
for centuries. What has perhaps changed is the pace and scope of what can be automated. 
It is a prospect that raises more questions than it answers. How will automation transform 
the workplace? What will be the implications for employment? And what is likely to be its 
impact both on productivity in the global economy and on employment? 

This report was produced as part of the McKinsey Global Institute’s overall research on 
the impact of technology on business and society, and specifically our ongoing research 
program on the future of work and the potential impacts on the global economy of data and 
analytics, automation, robotics and artificial intelligence. In this report, we analyze how a 
wide range of technologies could potentially automate current work activities that people are 
paid to do in the global workforce, and what the impact could be on global productivity. This 
work does not define what the new activities and occupations that will be developed will 
be, nor does it analyze in depth how the economic gains of automation will be distributed or 
provide specific policy recommendations for governments. While we consider a broad range 
of automation technologies, we do not focus specifically on any particular technologies. 
We realize that this area of research is evolving rapidly, given the pace of technological 
advancement, and we plan to update the perspectives presented in this report regularly. 

The research was led by James Manyika, a director of the McKinsey Global Institute 
and McKinsey senior partner based in San Francisco; Michael Chui, an MGI partner in 
San Francisco; and Mehdi Miremadi, a McKinsey partner based in Chicago. MGI and 
McKinsey senior partner Jacques Bughin and McKinsey senior partners Martin Dewhurst,

IN BRIEF 

A FUTURE THAT WORKS: AUTOMATION, 
EMPLOYMENT, AND PRODUCTIVITY 
Advances in robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine 
learning are ushering in a new age of automation, as 
machines match or outperform human performance in a 
range of work activities, including ones requiring cognitive 
capabilities. In this report, part of our ongoing research 
into the future of work, we analyze the automation 
potential of the global economy, the factors that will 
determine the pace and extent of workplace adoption, 
and the economic impact associated with its potential.

  Automation of activities can enable businesses 
to improve performance, by reducing errors and 
improving quality and speed, and in some cases 
achieving outcomes that go beyond human 
capabilities. Automation also contributes to 
productivity, as it has done historically. At a time 
of lackluster productivity growth, this would give a 
needed boost to economic growth and prosperity 
and help offset the impact of a declining share of the 
working-age population in many countries. Based 
on our scenario modeling, we estimate automation 
could raise productivity growth globally by 0.8 to 
1.4 percent annually. 

  About half the activities people are paid almost 
$15 trillion in wages to do in the global economy 
have the potential to be automated by adapting 
currently demonstrated technology, according 
to our analysis of more than 2,000 work activities 
across 800 occupations. While less than 5 percent 
of all occupations can be automated entirely using 
demonstrated technologies, about 60 percent of all 
occupations have at least 30 percent of constituent 
activities that could be automated. More occupations 
will change than will be automated away.

  Activities most susceptible to automation involve 
physical activities in highly structured and predictable 
environments, as well as the collection and processing 
of data. In the United States, these activities make up 
51 percent of activities in the economy accounting for 
almost $2.7 trillion in wages. They are most prevalent 
in manufacturing, accommodation and food service, 
and retail trade, and include some middle-skill jobs. 

  Technical, economic, and social factors will determine 
the pace and extent of automation. Continued 
technical progress, for example in areas such 
as natural language processing, is a key factor. 
Beyond technical feasibility, the cost of technology, 
competition with labor including skills and supply and 
demand dynamics, performance benefits including 
and beyond labor cost savings, and social and 
regulatory acceptance will affect the pace and scope 
of automation. Our scenarios suggest that half of 
today’s work activities could be automated by 2055, 
but this could happen up to 20 years earlier or later 
depending on the various factors, in addition to other 
wider economic conditions. 

  People will need to continue working alongside 
machines to produce the growth in per capita GDP 
to which countries around the world aspire. Our 
productivity estimates assume that people displaced 
by automation will find other employment. The 
anticipated shift in the activities in the labor force is 
of a similar order of magnitude as the long-term shift 
away from agriculture and decreases in manufacturing 
share of employment in the United States, both of 
which were accompanied by the creation of new types 
of work not foreseen at the time.

  For business, the performance benefits of automation 
are relatively clear, but the issues are more 
complicated for policy-makers. They should embrace 
the opportunity for their economies to benefit from the 
productivity growth potential and put in place policies 
to encourage investment and market incentives to 
encourage continued progress and innovation. At the 
same time, they must evolve and innovate policies 
that help workers and institutions adapt to the impact 
on employment. This will likely include rethinking 
education and training, income support and safety 
nets, as well as transition support for those dislocated. 
Individuals in the workplace will need to engage 
more comprehensively with machines as part of their 
everyday activities, and acquire new skills that will be 
in demand in the new automation age.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Automation is not a new phenomenon, and questions about its promise and effects have 
long accompanied its advances. More than a half century ago, US President Lyndon B. 
Johnson established a national commission to examine the impact of technology on the 
economy and employment, declaring that automation did not have to destroy jobs but “can 
be the ally of our prosperity if we will just look ahead.”1 Many of the same questions have 
come to the fore again today, as a result of remarkable recent advances in technologies 
including robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning. Automation now has 
the potential to change the daily work activities of everyone, from miners and landscape 
gardeners to commercial bankers, fashion designers, welders—and CEOs. But how quickly 
will these technologies become a reality in the workplace? And what will their impact be on 
employment and on productivity in the global economy? 

Over the past two years, we have been conducting a research program on automation 
technologies and their potential effects. Some of our key findings include the following.

  We are living in a new automation age in which robots and computers can not only 
perform a range of routine physical work activities better and more cheaply than 
humans, but are also increasingly capable of accomplishing activities that include 
cognitive capabilities. These include making tacit judgments, sensing emotion, or even 
driving—activities that used to be considered too difficult to automate successfully.2 

  The automation of activities can enable productivity growth and other benefits at both 
the level of individual process and businesses, as well as at the level of entire economies, 
where productivity acceleration is sorely needed, especially as the share of the working-
age population declines in many countries. At a microeconomic level, businesses 
everywhere will have an opportunity to capture benefits and achieve competitive 
advantage from automation technologies, not just from labor cost reductions, but also 
from performance benefits such as increased throughput, higher quality, and decreased 
downtime. At a macroeconomic level, based on our scenario modeling, we estimate 
automation could raise productivity growth on a global basis by as much as 0.8 to 
1.4 percent annually. 

  Our approach to analyzing the potential impact of automation is through a focus on 
individual activities rather than entire occupations. Given currently demonstrated 
technologies, very few occupations—less than 5 percent—are candidates for full 
automation today, meaning that every activity constituting these occupations is 
automated. However, almost every occupation has partial automation potential, as a 
significant percentage of its activities could be automated. We estimate that about half 
of all the activities people are paid to do in the world’s workforce could potentially be 
automated by adapting currently demonstrated technologies.

Economic Progress, on August 19, 1964. The report was published in 1966. Technology and the American 
economy: Report of the National Commission on Technology, Automation and Economic Progress, US 
Department of Health, Education and Welfare, February 1966. In December 2016, the White House released 
a new report on the same subject, Artificial intelligence, automation, and the economy. 

2 In this report we focus on the implications of automation technologies rather than on the technologies 
themselves. For a more detailed discussion of machine learning and deep learning technologies see the 
corresponding chapter in The age of analytics: Competing in a data-driven world, McKinsey Global Institute, 
December 2016.



2 McKinsey Global Institute Executive summary 

  The pace and extent of automation, and thus its impact on workers, will vary across 
different activities, occupations, and wage and skill levels. Many workers will continue 
to work alongside machines as various activities are automated. Activities that are likely 
to be automated earlier include predictable physical activities, especially prevalent in 
manufacturing and retail trade, as well as collecting and processing data, which are 
activities that exist across the entire spectrum of sectors, skills and wages. Some forms 
of automation will be skill-biased, tending to raise the productivity of high-skill workers 
even as they reduce the demand for lower-skill and routine-intensive occupations, such 
as filing clerks or assembly-line workers.3 Other automation has disproportionately 
affected middle-skill workers.4 As technology development makes the activities of both 
low-skill and high-skill workers more susceptible to automation, these polarization 
effects could be reduced. 

  Automation will have wide-ranging effects, across geographies and sectors. Although 
automation is a global phenomenon, four economies—China, India, Japan, and the 
United States—account for just over half of the total wages and almost two-thirds the 
number of employees associated with activities that are technically automatable by 
adapting currently demonstrated technologies. Within countries, automation potential 
will be affected by their sector mix, and the mix of activities within sectors. For example, 
industries such as manufacturing and agriculture include predictable physical activities 
that have a high technical potential to be automated, but lower wage rates in some 
developing countries could constrain adoption. 

  Automation will not happen overnight, and five key factors will influence the pace 
and extent of its adoption. First is technical feasibility, since the technology has to be 
invented, integrated and adapted into solutions that automate specific activities. Second 
is the cost of developing and deploying solutions, which affects the business case for 
adoption. Third are labor market dynamics, including the supply, demand, and costs of 
human labor as an alternative to automation. Fourth are economic benefits, which could 
include higher throughput and increased quality, as well as labor cost savings. Finally, 
regulatory and social acceptance can affect the rate of adoption even when deployment 
makes business sense. Taking all of these factors into account, we estimate it will take 
decades for automation’s effect on current work activities to play out fully. While the 
effects of automation might be slow at a macro level within entire sectors or economies, 
they could be quite fast at a micro level, for an individual worker whose activities are 
automated, or a company whose industry is disrupted by competitors using automation. 

  While much of the current debate about automation has focused on the potential for 
mass unemployment, predicated on a surplus of human labor, the world’s economy will 
actually need every erg of human labor working, in addition to the robots, to overcome 
demographic aging trends in both developed and developing economies. In other 
words, a surplus of human labor is much less likely to occur than a deficit of human 
labor, unless automation is deployed widely. However, the nature of work will change. As 
processes are transformed by the automation of individual activities, people will perform 
activities that are complementary to the work that machines do (and vice versa). These 
shifts will change the organization of companies, the structure and bases of competition 
of industries, and business models.

3McKinsey Global Institute A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity

  For business, the performance benefits of automation are relatively clear, but the issues 
are more complicated for policy makers. They should embrace the opportunity for their 
economies to benefit from the productivity growth potential and put in place policies 
to encourage investment and market incentives to encourage continued progress and 
innovation. At the same time, they must evolve and innovate policies that help workers 
and institutions adapt to the impact on employment. This will likely include rethinking 
education and training, income support, and safety nets, as well as transition support for 
those dislocated. Individuals in the workplace will need to engage more comprehensively 
with machines as part of their everyday activities, and acquire new skills that will be in 
demand in the new automation age. 

The scale of shifts in the labor force over many decades that automation technologies can 
unleash is of a similar order of magnitude to the long-term technology-enabled shifts in the 
developed countries’ workforces away from agriculture in the 20th century. Those shifts 
did not result in long-term mass unemployment because they were accompanied by the 
creation of new types of work not foreseen at the time. We cannot definitively say whether 
historical precedent will be upheld this time. But our analysis shows that humans will still 
be needed in the workforce: the total productivity gains we estimate will come about only if 
people work alongside machines. 

GAUGING AUTOMATION POTENTIAL IN THE GLOBAL WORKPLACE TODAY 
The Czech writer Karel Capek coined the word “robot” almost a century ago, in a 1920 
play about factory androids that each do the work of two-and-a-half humans at a fraction 
of the cost.5 Science fiction has since become business fact. Robots are commonplace 
in manufacturing, and algorithms are playing an ever-larger role in companies from UPS 
to Amazon.6 With recent developments in robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine 
learning, technologies not only do things that we thought only humans could do, but also 
can increasingly do them at superhuman levels of performance. Some robots that are far 
more flexible—and a fraction of the cost—of those used in manufacturing environments 
today can be “trained” by frontline staff to perform tasks that were previously thought to be 
too difficult for machines, and are even starting to take over service activities, from cooking 
hamburgers to dispensing drugs in hospital pharmacies. Artificial intelligence is also making 
major strides: in one recent test, computers were able to read lips with 95 percent accuracy, 
outperforming professional human lip readers who tested at 52 percent accuracy.7 

We used the state of technology in respect to 18 performance capabilities to estimate 
the technical automation potential of more than 2,000 work activities from more than 800 
occupations across the US economy, and then broadened our analysis across the global 
economy (see Box E1, “How we established the technical automation potential of the 
global economy”).

4 McKinsey Global Institute Executive summary 

Box E1. How we established the technical automation potential of the global economy 
To assess the technical automation potential of the global 
economy, we used a disaggregation of occupations into 
constituent activities that people are paid to do in the 
global workplace. Each of these activities requires some 
combination of 18 performance capabilities, which we list 
in Exhibit E1. They are in five groups: sensory perception, 
cognitive capabilities, natural language processing, social 
and emotional capabilities, and physical capabilities. 

We estimated the level of performance for each of these 
capabilities that is required to perform each work activity 
successfully, based on the way humans currently perform 
activities—that is, whether the capability is required at 
all, and if so, whether the required level of performance 
was at roughly a median human level, below median 
human level, or at a high human level of performance 
(for example, top 25th percentile). We then assessed the 
performance of existing technologies today based on the 
same criteria. 

This analysis enabled us to estimate the technical 
automation potential of more than 2,000 work activities in 
more than 800 occupations across the economy, based 
on data from the US Department of Labor. By estimating 
the amount of time spent on each of these work activities, 
we were able to estimate the automation potential of 
occupations in sectors across the economy, comparing 
them with hourly wage levels. Drawing on industry 
experts, we also developed scenarios for how rapidly the 
performance of automation technologies could improve in 
each of these capabilities. 

The analysis we conducted for the United States provided 
us with a template for estimating the automation potential 
and creating adoption timing scenarios for 45 other 
economies representing about 80 percent of the global 
workforce. For details of our methodology, see the 
technical appendix.

Only a small percentage of occupations can be fully automated by adapting 
current technologies, but some work activities of almost all occupations could 
be automated 
Unlike some other studies, the core of our analysis focuses on work activities rather than 
whole occupations. We consider work activities a more relevant and useful measure since 
occupations are made up of a range of activities with different potential for automation.8 For 
example, a retail salesperson will spend some time interacting with customers, stocking 
shelves, or ringing up sales. Each of these activities is distinct and requires different 
capabilities to perform successfully. 

Overall, we estimate that 50 percent of the activities that people are paid to do in the 
global economy have the potential to be automated by adapting currently demonstrated 
technology. While less than 5 percent of occupations can be fully automated, about 
60 percent have at least 30 percent of activities that can technically be automated 
(Exhibit E2). While certain categories of activity, such as processing or collecting data, or 
performing physical activities and operating machinery in a predictable environment, have 
a high technical potential for automation, the susceptibility is significantly lower for other 
activities including interfacing with stakeholders, applying expertise to decision making, 
planning, and creative tasks, or managing and developing people (Exhibit E3).

The degree of automation potential varies considerably among sectors 
and countries 
A significant degree of variation among sectors of the economy, and among the 
occupations within those sectors, emerges from this analysis. For example, almost one-fifth 
of the time spent in US workplaces involves predictable physical activity and is prevalent in 
such sectors as manufacturing and retail trade. Accordingly, these sectors have a relatively 
high technical potential for automation using today’s technology. Exhibit E4 shows a range 
of sectors in the US economy broken down into different categories of work activity.9

8 McKinsey Global Institute Executive summary 

Within sectors, too, there is considerable variation. In manufacturing, for example, 
occupations that have a large proportion of physical activities in predictable environments 
such as factory welders, cutters, and solderers have a technical automation potential above 
90 percent based on adapting currently developed technologies, whereas for customer 
service representatives that susceptibility is less than 30 percent. 

While wage and skill levels are negatively correlated with technical automation potential 
(on average, occupations with higher wages and skill requirements have lower automation 
potential, reflecting some skill bias), a large amount of variation underlies the averages. 
Essentially all occupations, whether high skill or low skill, have some technical automation 
potential, including CEOs; we estimate about 25 percent of their work could potentially 
be automated, primarily such tasks as analyzing reports and data to inform decisions, 
reviewing status reports, preparing staff assignments, and so on. 

At a global level, technically automatable activities touch the equivalent of 1.2 billion 
employees and $14.6 trillion in wages (Exhibit E5). Four economies—China, India, Japan, 
and the United States—account for just over half of these total wages and employees; China 
and India together account for the largest technically automatable employment potential—
more than 700 million full-time equivalents between them—because of the relative size of 
their labor forces. The potential is also large in Europe: according to our analysis, 62 million 
full-time employee equivalents and more than $1.9 trillion in wages are associated with 
technically automatable activities in the five largest economies—France, Germany, Italy, 
Spain, and the United Kingdom. 

Our analysis of the technical automation potential of the global economy shows that there is 
a range among countries of about 15 percentage points. Two factors explain this range. The 
first is the sectoral makeup of each economy, that is, the proportion of a national economy 
that is in sectors such as manufacturing or accommodation and food services, both of 
which have relatively high automation potential, compared with the proportion in sectors 
with lower automation potential such as education. The second factor is the occupational 
makeup of sectors in different countries, in other words, the extent to which workers in these 
sectors are engaged in job titles with high automation potential, such as manufacturing 
production, and those in job titles with lower automation potential such as management and 
administration. A detailed look at all 46 countries we have examined is available online.10

10 McKinsey Global Institute Executive summary 

FACTORS AFFECTING PACE AND EXTENT OF AUTOMATION 
While the technology is advancing, the journey from technical automation potential to full 
adoption is nonetheless likely to take decades. The timing is affected by five sets of factors: 

  Technical feasibility. Technology has to be invented, integrated and adapted into 
solutions that automate specific activities. Deployment in the workplace can begin 
only when machines have reached the required level of performance in the capabilities 
required to carry out particular activities. While machines can already match or 
outperform humans on some of the 18 capabilities in our framework, including 
information retrieval, gross motor skills, and optimization and planning, many other 
capabilities require more technological development. In particular, advancements in 
natural language understanding could unlock significantly more technical automation 
potential. Emotional and social reasoning capabilities will also need to become more 
sophisticated for many work activities. For typical work activities, multiple capabilities, 
such as sensory perception and mobility, will be needed simultaneously, and thus 
solutions that integrate specific capabilities in context must be engineered. 

  Cost of developing and deploying solutions. The cost of automation affects the 
business case for adoption. Developing and engineering automation technologies 
takes capital. Hardware solutions range from standard computers to highly designed, 
application-specific hardware such as robots with arms and other moving parts requiring 
dexterity. Cameras and sensors are needed for any activity requiring sensory perception 
capabilities, while mobility requires wheels or other hardware that enable machines 
to move. Such attributes increase costs relative to a general-purpose hardware 
platform. Even “virtual” solutions that are based on software require real investments in 
engineering to create solutions. For deployment, hardware requires significant capital 
spending, and thus automation that requires it has high initial costs compared to wages. 
Software solutions, by comparison, tend to have a minimal marginal cost, which usually 
makes them less expensive than wages and thus they tend to be adopted earlier. Over 
time, both hardware and software costs decline, making solutions competitive with 
human labor for an increasing number of activities. 

  Labor market dynamics. The quality (for instance, skills), quantity, as well as supply, 
demand, and costs of human labor as an alternative affect which activities will be 
automated. For example, restaurant cooking has high automation potential, more than 
75 percent, based on currently demonstrated technologies, but the decision to deploy 
the technology will need to take into account the wage costs of cooks, who earn $11 per 
hour on average in the United States, and the abundance of people willing to working as 
cooks at that wage. Labor market dynamics also differ by geography, not only in terms 
of how different and evolving demographics affect the base supply of labor, but also 
different wage rates. Manufacturing automation is more likely to be adopted sooner in 
countries with high manufacturing wages, such as North America and Western Europe, 
than in developing countries with lower wages. Furthermore, the effects of automation 
can interact with labor market skills and supply. For example, if middle-income workers 
such as clerks and factory workers are displaced by the automation of data collection 
and processing and predictable physical activities, they could find themselves moving 
into lower paid occupations, increasing supply, and potentially putting downward 
pressure on wages. Conversely, they might take time to retrain into other high-
skill positions, delaying their re-entry into the labor force, and temporarily reducing 
labor supply. 

  Economic benefits. In addition to labor cost savings, a business case for automation 
could include performance gains such as increased profit, increased throughput and 
productivity, improved safety, and higher quality, which sometimes exceed the benefits 



11McKinsey Global Institute A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity

of labor substitution (see Box E2, “Automation technologies could provide significant 
performance benefits for companies beyond labor substitution”). For example, the 
benefits of increased production and lower overall maintenance costs by automating the 
control room of an oil and gas production facility dwarf those associated with reduced 
labor costs in the control room. Automated driving of cars and trucks could not only 
reduce the labor costs associated with drivers; it could also potentially improve safety 
(the vast majority of accidents are the result of driver errors) and fuel efficiency. 

Box E2. Automation technologies could provide significant performance 
benefits for companies beyond labor substitution

1 Productivity improvements in a changing world, presentation by Michael Gollschewski, managing director 
Pilbara Mines, Rio Tinto, July 13, 2015.  

2 Rich Evans and Jim Gao, DeepMind AI reduces energy used for cooling Google data centers by 40%, Google, 
blog post, July 20, 2016. 

3 João Bueno, Yran Bartolumeu Dias, Alexandre Sawaya, Jorge Valadas. “End-to-end digitization for securities 
services,” McKinsey on Payments, September 2014.

4 “Barack Obama: Self-driving, yes, but also safe,” Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, September 19, 2016.

The deployment of automation technologies could bring a range of performance benefits for 
companies. These benefits are varied, depending on the individual use case, and potentially 
very substantial—in some cases, considerably larger than cost reductions associated with 
labor substitution. They include, but are not limited to, greater throughput, higher quality, 
improved safety, reduced variability, a reduction of waste, and higher customer satisfaction.

We developed several hypothetical case studies to gain a better understanding of the 
potential for automation in different settings and sought to quantify the economic impact 
of realizing this vision. The case studies are of a hospital emergency department, aircraft 
maintenance, oil and gas operations, a grocery store, and mortgage brokering. The 
results—while forward-looking—are nonetheless striking. The value of the potential benefits 
of automation, calculated as a percentage of operating costs, ranges from between 10-15 
percent for a hospital emergency department and a grocery store, to 25 percent for aircraft 
maintenance, and more than 90 percent for mortgage origination. 

We also see automation being deployed today that is already generating real value. For 
example, Rio Tinto has deployed automated haul trucks and drilling machines at its mines 
in Pilbara, Australia, and says it is seeing 10–20 percent increases in utilization there as 
a result.1 Google has applied artificial intelligence from its DeepMind machine learning to 
its own data centers, cutting the amount of energy they use by 40 percent.2 In financial 
services, automation in the form of “straight-through processing,” where transaction 
workflows are digitized end-to-end, can increase the scalability of transaction throughput 
by 80 percent, while concurrently reducing errors by half.3 Safety is another area that could 
benefit from increased automation. For example, of the approximately 35,000 road death in 
the United States annually, about 94 percent are the result of human error or choice.4

The relative cost of automation can be modest compared with the value it can create. The 
types and sizes of investment needed to automate will differ by industry and sector. For 
example, industries with high capital intensity that require substantial hardware solutions to 
automate and are subject to heavy safety regulation will likely see longer lags between the 
time of investment and the benefits than sectors where automation will be mostly software-
based and less capital-intensive. For the former, this will mean a longer journey to breakeven 
on automation investment. However, our analysis suggests that the business case can be 
compelling regardless of the degree of capital intensity. 



12 McKinsey Global Institute Executive summary 

  Regulatory and social acceptance. Even when deploying automation makes business 
sense, the rate of adoption can be affected by contextual factors such as regulatory 
approval and the reaction of users. There are multiple reasons that technology adoption 
does not happen overnight. The shift of capital investment into these new technologies 
takes time (in aggregate), as does changing organizational processes and practices 
to adapt to new technologies. Reconfiguring supply chains and ecosystems can be 
laborious, and regulations sometimes need to change. Government policy can slow 
adoption, and different businesses adopt technologies at different rates. Changing the 
activities that workers do also requires dedicated effort, even if they are not actively 
resisting. And especially in the case of automation, individuals may feel uncomfortable 
about a new world where machines replace human interaction in some intimate life 
settings, such as a hospital, or in places where machines are expected to make life-and-
death decisions, such as when driving. 

Automation adoption will take decades, across a wide range of 
possible scenarios 
To analyze a range of potential scenarios for the pace at which automation will affect 
activities across the global economy, we constructed a model that simplifies the effects of 
these five factors into four timing stages: capability development, solution development, 
economic feasibility, and final adoption. The S-curve in Exhibit E6 indicates the potential 
time range that emerges from our scenario analyses, with the dark blue line representing an 
“earliest adoption” scenario and the light blue line a “latest adoption” scenario, aggregating 
across all of the activities that account for about 80 percent of the world’s workforce. For 
example, we estimate that adapting currently demonstrated technology has the technical 
potential to automate roughly 50 percent of the world’s current work activities. While the 
date at which this could happen could be around 2055, assuming all the factors are in 
place for successful adoption by then, we modeled possible scenarios where that level of 
adoption occurs up to almost 20 years earlier or later. 

Among the first sectors likely to feel the impact of automation will be those that involve 
types of activities we categorize as having the highest automation potential today based 
on currently demonstrated technology. From a geographical perspective, advanced 
economies are also likely to deploy automation ahead of many emerging economies, largely 
because of higher wage levels, which make a stronger business case for deployment. 

This magnitude of shifts in work activities over multiple decades is not unprecedented. In 
the United States, for example, the share of farm employment fell from 40 percent in 1900 
to 2 percent in 2000, while the share of manufacturing employment fell from approximately 
25 percent in 1950 to less than 10 percent in 2010 (Exhibit E7).11 In both cases, new activities 
and jobs were created that offset those that disappeared, although it was not possible to 
predict what those new activities and jobs would be while these shifts were occurring.

14 McKinsey Global Institute Executive summary 

Modeling scenarios for the pace and extent of automation adoption 
Capability development is the first stage that we modeled for the timing of automation 
adoption. Deployment in the workplace can begin only when machines have reached the 
required level of performance in the capabilities required to carry out particular activities. 

Once the technical capabilities have been developed, they must be integrated into solutions 
that can execute specific activities in context, that is, to create commercially available 
systems. Our analysis suggests that, on average, this solution development process can 
take between one and nine years. 

The third stage we modeled for scenario timelines is when automation is economically 
feasible. For modeling purposes, we assume that adoption begins when the developed 
solution for any given activity is at or below the cost for human workers to perform that 
activity in a specific occupation and within a particular country.12 While the performance 
benefits of automation sometimes exceed those related to labor cost savings, our 
conservative modeling assumes that decision-makers discount the benefits of initial labor 
cost savings by roughly the same amount as they believe the also uncertain non-labor cost-
related benefits will be captured. 

Adoption and deployment of automation, the fourth stage we modeled to develop 
scenarios, can also be a slow process. For our analysis, we looked at the historical adoption 
rates a wide range of 25 technologies, involving both hardware and software, as well as 
business and consumer technologies. The time between the commercial availability of 
these technologies and their eventual maximum level of adoption generally took at least 
nearly a decade and in some cases multiple decades, with the time range between eight 
and 28 years.13 

EVEN AS IT CAUSES SHIFTS IN EMPLOYMENT, AUTOMATION CAN GIVE A 
STRONG BOOST TO PRODUCTIVITY AND GLOBAL GDP GROWTH 
Automation will cause significant labor displacement and could exacerbate a growing skills 
and employment gap that already exists between high-skill and low-skill workers.14 Our 
analysis of automation potential also suggests that many occupations could be partially 
automated before they are fully automated, which could have different implications for high- 
and low-skill workers.15 Especially for low-skill workers, this process could depress wages 
unless demand grows. Viewed through a long-term perspective, however, as we described 
previously, large-scale historical structural shifts in the workplace where technology has 
caused job losses have, over time, been accompanied by the creation of a multitude of 
new jobs, activities, and types of work.16 Furthermore, labor markets can be quite dynamic: 
almost five million people leave their jobs every month in the United States, of whom about 

12 By costs in this case, we mean wages plus benefits, calculated globally on a purchasing power parity basis.
13 Some of the technologies we modeled have not likely yet reached their eventual peak in adoption.

three million do so voluntarily. Most of these people are not unemployed for long periods as 
they move on to other jobs.17 

That said, automation also represents a very substantial opportunity to support global 
economic growth. Our estimates suggest it has the potential to contribute meaningfully to 
the growth necessary to meet the per capita GDP aspirations of every country, at a time 
when changing demographics call those aspirations into question. Indeed, for this growth to 
take place, rather than having a massive labor surplus, everyone needs to keep working—
with the robots working alongside them. 

Automation can help close a GDP growth gap resulting from declining growth 
rates of working-age populations 
GDP growth was brisk over the past half century, driven by the twin engines of employment 
growth and rising productivity, both contributing approximately the same amount. However, 
declining birthrates and the trend toward aging in many advanced and some emerging 
economies mean that peak employment will occur in most countries within 50 years.18 The 
expected decline in the share of the working-age population will open an economic growth 
gap: roughly half of the sources of economic growth from the past half century (employment 
growth) will evaporate as populations age. Even at historical rates of productivity growth, 
economic growth could be nearly halved. 

Automation could compensate for at least some of these demographic trends. We estimate 
the productivity injection it could give to the global economy as being between 0.8 and 
1.4 percent of global GDP annually, assuming that human labor replaced by automation 
would rejoin the workforce and be as productive as it was in 2014. Considering the labor 
substitution effect alone, we calculate that, by 2065, automation could potentially add 
productivity growth in the largest economies in the world (G19 plus Nigeria) that is the 
equivalent of an additional 1.1 billion to 2.3 billion full-time workers (Exhibit E8). 

The productivity growth enabled by automation can ensure continued prosperity in aging 
nations and provide an additional boost to fast-growing ones. Automation on its own will not 
be sufficient to achieve long-term economic growth aspirations across the world; for that, 
additional productivity-boosting measures will be needed, including reworking business 
processes or developing new products and services. 

Potential impact of automation in three groups of countries 
Automation could boost productivity and help close the economic growth gap in the 20 
largest economies in the medium term, to 2030. We have divided these countries into three 
groups, each of which could use automation to further national economic growth objectives, 
depending on their demographic trends and growth aspirations. The three groups are: 

  Advanced economies, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South 
Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These economies typically face an 
aging workforce, with the decline in working-age population growth more immediate in 
some (Germany, Italy, and Japan) than in others. Automation can provide the productivity 
boost required to meet economic growth projections that they otherwise would struggle 
to attain without other significant productivity growth accelerators. These economies 
thus have a major interest in pursuing rapid automation adoption. 

  Emerging economies with aging populations. This category includes Argentina, Brazil, 
China, and Russia, which face economic growth gaps as a result of projected declines in

the growth of their working population.19 For these economies, automation can provide 
the productivity injection needed just to maintain current GDP per capita. To achieve a 
faster growth trajectory that is more commensurate with their developmental aspirations, 
these countries would need to supplement automation with additional sources of 
productivity, such as process transformations, and would benefit from more rapid 
adoption of automation. 

  Emerging economies with younger populations. These include India, Indonesia, Mexico, 
Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Turkey.20 The continued growth of the working-
age population in these countries could support maintaining current GDP per capita. 
However, given their high growth aspirations, automation plus additional productivity-
raising measures will be necessary to sustain their economic development. 

19 The demographic trends are pronounced for China and Russia, while Argentina’s future workforce gap is 
less certain.

20 The populations of Saudi Arabia and Turkey are projected to grow strongly over the next 20 years, but 
slow thereafter.

Potential impact of automation



17McKinsey Global Institute A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity

The advances in automation and their potential impact on national economies could upend 
some prevailing models of development and challenge ideas about globalization. Countries 
experiencing population declines or stagnation will be able to maintain living standards 
even as the labor force wanes. Meanwhile, countries with high birthrates and a significant 
growth in the working-age population may have to worry more about generating new jobs 
in a new age of automation. Moreover, low-cost labor may lose some of its edge as an 
essential developmental tool for emerging economies, as automation drives down the cost 
of manufacturing globally. 

HOW BUSINESS LEADERS, POLICY MAKERS, AND WORKERS CAN PREPARE 
FOR THE NEW AUTOMATION AGE 
Business leaders, policy makers, and workers everywhere face considerable challenges in 
capturing the full potential of automation’s beneficial effect on the economy, even as they 
navigate the major uncertainties about the social and employment repercussions. 

Automation will give business leaders opportunities to improve their 
performance and enter new markets, but they will need to rework their 
processes and organizations 
Automation of various activities can improve the performance of almost any business 
process.21 Beyond enabling reduction in labor costs, automation can raise throughput, 
increase reliability, and improve quality, among other performance gains. 

To assess where automation could be most profitably applied to improve performance, 
business leaders may want to conduct a thorough inventory of their organization’s activities 
and create a heat map of where automation potential is high. Once they have identified 
business processes with activities that have high automation potential, these could be 
reimagined to take full advantage of automation technologies (rather than just mechanically 
attempting to automate individual activities in the current processes). They could then 
assess the benefits and feasibility of these automation-enabled process transformations. 

Taking advantage of these transformations could lead to significant displacements in labor. 
Business leaders would be well served to consider how to best redeploy that labor, whether 
within their own organizations or elsewhere, both to improve their own performance and 
to act as good corporate citizens. Retraining and skill-raising programs will be important 
to support workers shifting to new roles and taking on new activities. It will also be critical 
for corporate leaders to ensure that the organizational elements of their companies are 
adapting to the advent of automation. 

On a strategic level, automation could enable the emergence of massively scaled 
organizations, instantly able to propagate changes that come from headquarters. 
Technology will make measuring and monitoring easier, providing effective new tools for 
managers. However, greater scale means that errors could be more consequential, which in 
turn will require stronger quality controls. 

Even as some corporations could be scaling up, automation and digital technologies more 
generally will enable small players, including individuals and small companies, to undertake 
project work that is now largely carried out within bigger firms. The growth of very small 
and very large companies could create a barbell-shaped economy, in which mid-sized 
companies lose out. In all sectors, automation could heighten competition, enabling firms 
to enter new areas outside their previous core businesses, and creating a growing divide 
between technological leaders and laggards in every sector. 

21 We explore several case studies of the potential transformations of business processes in Chapter 3.



18 McKinsey Global Institute Executive summary 

For policy makers, an embrace of automation could be accompanied by 
measures to raise skills and promote job creation, and by rethinking incomes 
and social safety nets 
Policy makers globally will have a strong incentive to encourage and enable rapid adoption 
of automation technologies in order to capture the full productivity boost necessary to 
support economic growth targets. At the same time, they will need to think through how to 
support the redeployment of potentially large numbers of displaced workers, since the full 
economic benefits of automation depend on workers continuing to work.22 

Early adoption of automation could benefit from policy support, both in regard to 
the technology development, and for its deployment. That will require investment in 
developing the technologies themselves, and also in digitally enabled infrastructure to 
support automation. 

Labor redeployment will be one of the most important societal challenges. Governments 
are often not particularly adept at anticipating the types of jobs that could be created, or 
new industries that will develop. However, they could initiate and foster dialogues about 
what work needs doing, and about the grand societal challenges that require more 
attention and effort.23 Governments could also seek to encourage new forms of technology-
enabled entrepreneurship, and intervene to help workers develop skills best suited for 
the automation age. For example, many economies are already facing a shortage of 
data scientists and business translators.24 Governments working with the private sector 
could take steps to ensure that such gaps are filled, establishing new education and 
training possibilities. 

One of the challenges of the new era will be to ensure that wages are high enough for the 
new types of employment that will be created, to prevent continuing erosion of the wage 
share of GDP, which has dropped sharply since the 1970s.25 If automation does result in 
greater pressure on many workers’ wages, some ideas such as earned income tax credits, 
universal basic income, conditional transfers, shorter workweeks, and adapted social safety 
nets could be considered and tested. As work evolves at higher rates of change among 
sectors, locations, activities, and skill requirements, many workers may need assistance in 
adjusting to the new age. 

Workers will need to work more closely with technology, freeing up more time 
to focus on intrinsically human capabilities that machines cannot yet match 
Men and women in the workplace will need to engage more comprehensively with 
machines as part of their everyday activities. Tighter integration with technology will free up 
time for human workers including managers to focus more fully on activities to which they 
bring skills that machines have yet to master. This could make work more complex, and 
harder to organize, with managers spending more time on coaching.26 

As people make education and career choices, it will be important for them to be made 
aware of the factors driving automation in particular sectors, to help them identify the skills

that could be useful for them to acquire from a labor-market perspective, and what activities 
will be complements of activities that are likely to be automated.27 

High-skill workers who work closely with technology will likely be in strong demand, and 
may be able to take advantage of new opportunities for independent work as the corporate 
landscape shifts and project work is outsourced by companies. Middle-skill workers whose 
activities have the highest technical potential for automation (predictable physical activities, 
collecting and analyzing data) can seek opportunities for retraining to prepare for shifts 
in their activities toward those that are complements of activities the machines will start 
to perform.

Low-skill workers working with technology will be able to achieve more in terms of output 
and productivity but may experience wage pressure given the potentially large supply of 
similarly low-skill workers. 

Education systems will need to evolve for a changed workplace, with policy makers working 
with education providers to improve basic skills in the STEM fields of science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics, and put a new emphasis on creativity, as well as on critical 
and systems thinking. For all, developing agility, resilience, and flexibility will be important at 
a time when everybody’s job is likely to change to some degree. 

Finally, automation will create an opportunity for those in work to make use of the innate 
human skills that machines have the hardest time replicating: logical thinking and problem 
solving, social and emotional capabilities, providing expertise, coaching and developing 
others, and creativity. For now, the world of work still expects men and women to undertake 
rote tasks that do not stretch these innate capabilities as far as they could. As machines take 
on ever more of the predictable activities of the workday, these skills will be at a premium. 
Automation could make us all more human. 

•••

Automation will play an essential role in providing at least some of the productivity boost that 
the global economy needs over the next half century as growth in working-age populations 
declines. It will contribute meaningfully to GDP per capita growth, even if it will not on its 
own enable emerging economies to meet their fast-growth aspirations. Given the range 
of scenarios around the pace and extent of adoption of automation technologies, there 
are sure to be surprises. We will see large-scale shifts in workplace activities over the next 
century. These trends are already under way. Policy makers, business leaders, and workers 
themselves must not wait to take action: already today, there are measures that can be 
taken to prepare, so that the global economy can capture the opportunities offered by 
automation, even as it avoids the drawbacks.

It is easy to become blasé about technological progress in this non-stop, 24/7, digital-
everything-always-and-everywhere era. We take technological advances almost for granted 
and are frustrated when an app that streams the latest Hollywood movies crashes, or a 
smartphone which has many times the processing power of a 1980s Cray 2 supercomputer 
does not fire up the moment we press the “on” button. 

We forget that it was not always this easy. Not so long ago, we had to go to libraries to look 
up quotations and insert compact discs into an audio system to play music. Transmitting 
even tiny amounts of data was complicated by today’s standards; sometimes we had to 
strap bulky acoustic couplers onto a fixed telephone and wait for the modem to screech. As 
the German sociologist Hartmut Rosa has pointed out, we live in an age of acceleration in 
which the art of saving time has reached unprecedented heights thanks to technology, but 
we nonetheless feel that we must run faster just to stay put.28 

Even by these standards, however, some of the most recent developments in robotics, 
artificial intelligence, and machine learning are noteworthy for the advances they represent. 
We are on the cusp of a new automation age in which technologies not only do things that 
we thought only humans could do, but also can increasingly do them at a superhuman level 
of performance. In this report, we focus on the adoption and implications of automation 
technologies rather than on the technologies themselves. However, by way of introduction, 
this chapter lays out some key areas of recent technical advances—and where remaining 
technical obstacles must still be overcome to achieve the full promise of workplace 
automation.29 

AUTOMATION TECHNOLOGIES ARE INCREASINGLY 
OUTPERFORMING HUMANS 
Physical robots have been around for a long time in manufacturing, but now we are seeing 
much more flexible, safer, and less expensive robots engaging in service activities—and 
improving over time as they are trained by their human coworkers on the shop floor.30 For 
example, some hospitals now regularly use automated systems for storing and dispensing 
medication in their pharmacies, eliminating human picking errors, and also have automated 
haul and transport for their clinical supplies.31 The advances in cognitive tasks are no 
less striking. Software has long been able to outperform humans in some areas, such as 
financial-service transactions or route optimization for companies such as UPS.32 Now, 
artificial intelligence is starting to encroach on activities that were previously assumed to 
require human judgment and experience. Exhibit 1 is a non-exhaustive list of some of the 
technologies and techniques that are being developed to enable automation of different 
work activities.

Exhibit 1

Glossary of automation technologies and techniques

Technologies
and techniques Description/examples

Artificial 
intelligence

Field of computer science specializing in developing systems that exhibit “intelligence.” Often 
abbreviated as AI, the term was coined by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956, the 
first conference devoted to this topic

Machine 
learning

Subfield of artificial intelligence developing systems that “learn,” i.e., practitioners 
“train” these systems rather than “programming” them

Supervised 
learning

Machine learning techniques that train a system to respond appropriately to stimuli by 
providing a training set of sample input and desired output pairs. Supervised learning 
has been used for email spam detection by training systems on a large number of 
emails, each of which has been manually labeled as either being spam or not

Transfer 
learning

Subfield of machine learning developing systems that store knowledge gained while 
solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. Often used 
when the training set for one problem is small, but the training data for a related 
problem is plentiful, e.g., repurposing a deep learning system trained on a large non-
medical image data set to recognize tumors in radiology scans

Reinforce-
ment 
learning

Subfield of machine learning developing systems that are trained by receiving virtual 
“rewards” or “punishments” for behaviors rather than supervised learning on correct 
input-output pairs. In February 2015, DeepMind described a reinforcement learning 
system that learned how to play a variety of Atari computer games. In March 2016, 
DeepMind’s AlphaGo system defeated the world champion in the game of Go

Cognitive 
computing

Synonym for artificial intelligence

Neural networks Artificial 
neural 
network

AI systems based on simulating connected “neural units,” loosely modeling the way 
that neurons interact in the brain. Computational models inspired by neural 
connections have been studied since the 1940s

Deep 
learning

Use of neural networks that have many layers (“deep”) of a large number (millions) of 
artificial neurons. Prior to deep learning, artificial neural networks often only had three 
layers and dozens of neurons; deep learning networks often have seven to ten or more 
layers. The term was first used in 2000

Convolution-
al neural 
network

Artificial neural networks in which the connections between neural layers are inspired 
by the organization of the animal visual cortex, the portion of the brain that processes 
images, well suited for perceptual tasks. In 2012, the only entry using a convolutional 
neural network achieved an 84% correct score in the ImageNet visual recognition 
contest, vs. a winning score of 75% the year prior. Since then, convolutional neural 
networks have won all subsequent ImageNet contests, exceeding human performance 
in 2015, above 90%

Recurrent 
neural 
network

Artificial neural networks whose connections between neurons include loops, well-
suited for processing sequences of inputs. In November 2016, Oxford University 
researchers reported that a system based on recurrent neural networks (and 
convolutional neural networks) had achieved 95% accuracy in reading lips, 
outperforming experienced human lip readers, who tested at 52% accuracy.

26 McKinsey Global Institute 1. The new frontier 

Some of AI’s exploits are less heralded than its victory over a human champion of the 
complex board game Go in March 2016.33 For example, a project by Google’s DeepMind 
and the University of Oxford has applied deep learning to a huge data set of BBC programs 
to create a lip-reading system. Trained using more than 5,000 hours of BBC TV programs, 
containing more than 100,000 sentences, it easily outperformed a professional human 
lip-reader. In tests on 200 randomly selected clips, the professional annotated just 
12.4 percent of words without error, while the computer annotated 46.8 percent error-
free—and many of its mistakes were small ones, such as leaving a plural “s” off the end of a 
word.34 

Many other surprising technologies are making advances. Robot “skin” made of a 
piezoelectronic transistor mesh developed by Georgia Tech and covered in thousands of 
mechanical hairs is as sensitive as human skin and able to “feel” textures and find objects 
by touch.35 In the social and emotional realm, Affectiva, a Boston-based company, uses 
advanced facial analysis to monitor emotional responses to advertisements and other digital 
media content, via a webcam.36 In the United Kingdom, the University of Hertfordshire 
has developed a minimally expressive humanoid robot called KASPAR that operates as a 
therapeutic toy for children with autism. Having physical, human-like properties, yet being 
non-human, allows the children to investigate the human-looking features—for example, 
squeezing KASPAR’s nose or tickling its toes—safely and in a way that would not be 
possible or appropriate with a real person.37 

Such advances suggest that an idea toyed with by science fiction writers for at least a 
century—that of robots and other machines replacing men and women in the workplace on 
a large scale—could soon become a reality. We seem to be approaching a new frontier, but 
we have not arrived there quite yet. 

WHERE THE BIGGEST REMAINING OBSTACLES LIE 
The Czech writer Karel Capek first used the word “robot” in 1920, in a play about a factory in 
which androids created partly through a chemical process each do the work of two-and-a-
half humans at a fraction of the cost. One of his characters explains: “Robots are not people. 
Mechanically they are more perfect than we are, they have an enormously developed 
intelligence, but they have no soul.”38 Today, mechanical perfection seems achievable, as 
robots become ever more adept at physical tasks, even if they are still wobbly on uneven 
terrain and consume a lot of energy. Through deep reinforcement learning, they can also 
untie shoelaces, unscrew bottle caps, and remove a nail from the back of a hammer.39 

Their “intelligence,” too, has progressed—but this is where the most formidable technical 
challenges still lie ahead. While machines can be trained to perform a range of cognitive 
tasks, they remain limited. They are not yet good at putting knowledge into context, let alone

pass them by. They generally cannot detect whether a customer is upset at a hospital bill or 
a death in the family, and for now, they cannot answer “What do you think about the people 
in this photograph?” or other open-ended questions. They can tell jokes without really 
understanding them. They don’t yet feel humiliation, fear, pride, anger, or happiness. They 
also struggle with disambiguation, unsure whether a mention of the word “mercury” refers to 
a planet, a metal, or the winged god of Roman mythology. 

Moreover, while machines can replicate individual performance capabilities such as 
fine motor skills or navigation, much work remains to be done integrating these different 
capabilities into holistic solutions where everything works together seamlessly. Combining 
a range of technologies will be essential for workplace automation, but engineering such 
solutions—whether for hardware or software—is a difficult process. The creation of 
solutions that solve specific problems in the workplace is work that will have to be done as 
individual technical challenges are overcome in the lab. Even once the technical feasibility 
issues have been resolved and the technologies become commercially available, it can take 
years before they are adopted. 

Yet, given the speed with which technological advances are happening, reaching and 
crossing the next frontier may just be a question of time. Moore’s law—that the number of 
transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years—may be 
slowing, but we are still seeing massive increases in computing power. Machine learning 
and its subset deep learning continue to advance rapidly, while traditional AI algorithms 
become  more versatile and powerful. Cloud computing and other technologies are opening 
new possibilities for more people to become involved in innovation. Academic research 
in these areas, especially in artificial intelligence, has increased significantly, and global 
markets are taking notice, with growing corporate investment in research and development. 

When large-scale automation does come to the workplace, what will that mean for the 
economy, for jobs, and for the future of work itself? And how fast could it happen? 

Such existential questions are easier to answer through fiction. Capek’s 1920 play about 
robots ends with the destruction of mankind and robots discovering the meaning of love. 
This report, by contrast, seeks to establish a fact base with which to address these issues 
and a foundation for a more informed dialogue. Robots may not have a soul, but their 
potential impact on the global economy can be calculated.

The speed with which automation technologies are emerging, and the extent to which 
they could disrupt the world of work, may appear daunting but is not unprecedented. 
Technological change has reshaped the workplace continually over the past two centuries 
since the Industrial Revolution, and even earlier (see Box 1, “What history teaches us about 
the effect of technological change on work, employment, and productivity”). Nonetheless, 
the latest technological developments will touch every job in every sector and in every 
country. The advances we described in the previous chapter all have practical applications 
in the workplace, and in some cases they have already been adapted, integrated, and 
deployed. Sophisticated machines are replacing human labor in workplaces from factories 
to fast-food restaurants. They are becoming a part of everyday life in fields from journalism 
to law to medicine; at the University of Tokyo, for example, IBM’s Watson made headlines 
in 2016 by diagnosing in a 60-year-old woman a rare form of leukemia that had eluded her 
doctors for months.40 

These technologies bring with them progress, productivity improvements, increased 
efficiencies, safety, and convenience, but they also raise difficult questions about the 
broader impact of automation on the workforce as a whole. Think tanks and organizations 
such as the World Economic Forum are forecasting the likelihood of major job substitution 
by automation.41 Some academic studies estimate that close to 50 percent of US and 
European jobs could be automated, although other studies put that figure much lower (see 
the table “Overview of select recent studies on the impact of automation and the future of 
work,” page 21). 

Some of these projections focus on occupations perceived to be at risk.42 Our approach 
is substantially different: we consider work activities a more relevant and useful basis for 
analysis than occupations. The reason for this is that, within sectors, every occupation 
consists of a number of constituent activities that may have a different technical potential for 
automation. A typical retail salesperson, for example, will spend some time interacting with 
customers, stocking shelves, or ringing up sales. Machines can already outperform humans 
in some of these activities—they are highly adept at managing warehouse inventory, for 
example—and at least one fashion company has a bot that advises clients, via their mobile 
phones, about the best lipstick match.43 But computers and machines are far less adept 
than humans at sensing the emotional state of customers or understanding context. For 
example, no robot yet has the capacity to sense a distressed client and propose offering him 
or her a glass of water or a cup of tea.

Bank data.

The fear of technological innovation destroying jobs and displacing workers 
dates back several hundred years, even before the Luddite movement in Britain 
during the Industrial Revolution that gave its name to militant technophobia. The 
Luddites were textile mill workers in Nottingham who rioted in 1811 to destroy 
the new automated looms that threatened their livelihoods. Ever since, there has 
been no shortage of predictions that machines would replace human laborers, 
with possibly dire effects. Karl Marx wrote in 1858 that “the means of labor passes 
through different metamorphoses, whose culmination is the machine, or rather, 
an automatic system of machinery.”1 

In 1930, the British economist John Maynard Keynes coined the term 
“technological unemployment” to describe a situation in which innovation that 
economized the use of labor outstripped the pace at which new jobs could 
be created. Keynes warned that this was akin to a “new disease”—but he also 
described this malady as being a “temporary phase of maladjustment.”2 

More recently, in 1966, a report from the US National Commission on Technology, 
Automation, and Economic Progress, predicted that “in the new technology, 
machines and automated processes will do the routine and mechanical work. 
Human resources will be released and available for new activities beyond those 
that are required for mere subsistence. The great need is to discover the nature of 
this new kind of work, to plan it, and to do it. In the longer run, significant changes 
may be needed in our society—in education, for example—to help people find 
constructive and rewarding ways to use increasing leisure.”3 

One lesson of history is that deployment of new technologies in the past has led to 
new forms of work, including in cases when shifts in the activities performed in the 
workplace have been very substantial. In the United States, for example, the share 
of farm employment fell from 40 percent in 1900 to 2 percent in 2000; similarly, 
the share of manufacturing employment fell from 25 percent in 1950 to less than 
10 percent in 2010.4 In both cases, while some jobs disappeared, new ones 
were created, although what those new jobs would be could not be predicted at 
the time. 

Technological innovation can create new demand and whole new industries. 
Printing is one example. When the Times of London in 1814 switched to a 
revolutionary steam-powered printing press invented by German engineer 
Friedrich Koenig, the newspaper’s printers staged a revolt that was quelled only 
when the paper promised to keep on displaced workers. That prototype, which 
used steam from water heated by coal to drive the press, initially printed 1,100 
pages per hour, or five times as many as the mechanical press that preceded it. 
By 1820, presses could print 2,000 sheets per hour. By 1828, that doubled to 
4,000. Then came the invention of rotary presses, which in turn enabled huge rolls 
of paper to be loaded into the presses rather than individual sheets. By the 1860s,  



31McKinsey Global Institute A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity

Box 1. What history teaches us about the effect of technological 
change on work, employment, and productivity (continued)
the most advanced presses could print 30,000 pages per hour. The arrival  of 
electricity and the development of linotype and photomechanical processes able 
to reproduce photographs meant that by 1890, the New York Herald was able to 
print 90,000 copies of its four-page paper per hour, with color illustrations. This 
stream of innovation, combined with greater press freedom, drove the growth of 
a vibrant and fast-growing newspaper industry in the United States and Europe, 
creating millions of jobs in printing, journalism, and other related fields.5 

More recent evidence at a macroeconomic level suggests the positive links 
between technological progress, productivity, and jobs continued through the 
20th century. Positive gains in both productivity and employment have been 
reported in the United States in more than two-thirds of the years since 1929.6 
One-third of new jobs created in the United States in the past 25 years did not 
exist, or barely existed, 25 years ago.7 However, in recent years, there has been a 
notable divergence between productivity and pay, and the labor share of income 
has declined in many advanced economies.8 

The question today is whether this latest wave of innovation is by its nature 
substantially different from technological disruptions in the past. As automation 
makes inroads into the workplace, a critical concern is that technology-enabled 
automation could replace not just low-skill jobs—which is what happened in the 
past—but that it could affect all jobs. For now, there is an increasing bifurcation 
in the labor market between a dwindling number of high-skill jobs and many 
low-wage and low-skill service jobs.9 As we detail later in this chapter, even 
high-paying occupations in sectors such as financial services are potentially 
susceptible to automation. Opinions are sharply divided about the medium- and 
long-term effects of this automation wave. In 2014, the Pew Research Center 
conducted a survey of technology professionals and economists and found that 
48 percent of respondents believed new technologies would displace more jobs 
than they would create by 2025.10

32 McKinsey Global Institute 2. The technical potential for automation 

Using data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and O*Net, we have examined in detail 
more than 2,000 work activities for more than 800 occupations across the entire economy. 
We estimated the amount of time spent on these activities and the technical feasibility 
of automating each of them by adapting currently demonstrated technology. Having 
undertaken this analysis of the US economy, we extended our study to 45 other countries, 
using the most comparable data available in each.44 This detailed research enables us 
to draw important conclusions about the technical feasibility of automation for the global 
economy today, as well as for individual professions within specific sectors, from US 
mortgage brokers to Indian farmers. 

Our core findings are that the proportion of occupations that can be fully automated by 
adapting currently demonstrated technology—in other words, all of their activities could 
be automated—is very small, less than 5 percent in the United States. Automation will 
nonetheless affect almost all occupations, not just factory workers and clerks, but also 
landscape gardeners and dental lab technicians, fashion designers, insurance sales 
representatives, and CEOs, to a greater or lesser degree. The automation potential of 
these occupations depends on the types of work activity that they entail, but as a rule of 
thumb, about 60 percent of all occupations have at least 30 percent of activities that are 
technically automatable. 

In the United States, the country for which we have the most complete data, about 
46 percent of time spent on work activities across occupations and industries is technically 
automatable based on currently demonstrated technologies. Exhibit 2 shows the 
distribution range of this automation potential in the United States. On a global scale, we 
calculate that the adaptation of currently demonstrated automation technologies could 
affect 50 percent of working hours in the global economy. This potential corresponds to the 
equivalent of 1.2 billion workers and $14.6 trillion in wages. Among countries, the potential 
ranges between 41 and 56 percent, with just four countries—China, India, Japan, and the 
United States—accounting for just over half the total wages and workers. The potential 
could also be large in Europe: according to our analysis, the equivalent of 62 million full-time 
workers and more than $1.9 trillion in wages are associated with technically automatable 
activities in the continent’s five largest economies alone—France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and 
the United Kingdom. 

In this chapter we describe in detail the technical potential for automation in different sectors 
of the economy and for the global economy as a whole, based on the state of technology 
today. We explain how we calculate technical automation potential and, based on that 
methodology, we identify categories of activities that are the most and the least susceptible 
to automation. This enables us to provide detailed estimates of the technical automation 
potential of sectors and of different occupations within those sectors. We conclude with an 
examination of similarities and differences between countries, both advanced and emerging 
economies, for a global view of automation and its very substantial potential to transform the 
world of work. 

44 For full details of our methodology, see the technical appendix.



33McKinsey Global Institute A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity

ESTIMATING THE TECHNICAL POTENTIAL FOR  WORKPLACE AUTOMATION 
Humans at work carry out a wide variety of activities—whether stapling documents, 
examining spreadsheets, meeting clients, interviewing potential new recruits, lifting crates in 
a store, or planting corn in a field—without consciously analyzing the exact skill sets they are 
using. In fact, each of these actions requires a combination of innate or acquired capabilities, 
ranging from manual dexterity to social perceptiveness. In order to understand and map 
performance requirements for machines in the workplace, we developed a detailed 
framework of 18 human capabilities, including physical, emotional, and cognitive ones. 

It is important to note that when we discuss automation potential in this chapter, we refer 
to the technical potential for automation by adapting technologies that have already been 
demonstrated. As the technology becomes more advanced, that potential will also evolve. 
While this chapter focuses on technologies that have been developed today, later chapters 
estimate the speed with which the technological capabilities are likely to improve and be 
adopted in the workplace.

34 McKinsey Global Institute 2. The technical potential for automation 

It should also be noted that technical feasibility is not the same as actual implementation 
of automation, nor a complete predictor that an activity will be automated. A second factor 
to consider is the cost of developing and deploying both the hardware and the software 
solutions for automation. The cost of labor and related supply and demand dynamics 
represent a third factor: if workers are in abundant supply and significantly less expensive 
than automation, this could be a decisive argument against adoption. A fourth factor to 
consider is the benefits beyond labor substitution, including higher levels of output, better 
quality, and fewer errors. The economic value of these benefits is often larger than that 
of reducing labor costs. Regulatory and social acceptance issues, such as the degree to 
which machines are acceptable in any particular setting, must also be weighed. A robot 
may, in theory, be able to replace some of the functions of a nurse, for example. But for now, 
the prospect that this might actually happen in a highly visible way could prove unpalatable 
for many patients, who expect and trust human contact. The pace at which automation will 
take hold in a sector or occupation reflects a subtle interplay between these factors and the 
trade-offs among them. 

A framework of capabilities to understand the performance requirements of 
work activities 
The framework of 18 capabilities that we developed to assess automation potential 
addresses a wide range of performance requirements. Many of these capabilities 
correspond to the technologies we discussed in the previous chapter. They cover five 
areas: sensory perception, cognitive capabilities, natural language processing, social and 
emotional capabilities, and physical capabilities (Exhibit 3). 

  Sensory perception. This includes visual perception, tactile sensing, and auditory 
sensing, and involves complex external perception through integrating and analyzing 
data from various sensors in the physical world. 

  Cognitive capabilities. A range of capabilities is included in this category including 
recognizing known patterns and categories (other than through sensory perception); 
creating and recognizing novel patterns and categories; logical reasoning and problem 
solving using contextual information and increasingly complex input variables; 
optimization and planning to achieve specific objectives given various constraints; 
creating diverse and novel ideas or a novel combination of ideas; information retrieval, 
which involves searching and retrieving information from a large range of sources; 
coordination with multiple agents, which involves interacting with other machines and 
with humans to coordinate group activity; and output articulation and presentation, 
which involves delivering outputs other than through natural language. These could be 
automated production of pictures, diagrams, graphs, or mixed media presentations. 

  Natural language processing. This consists of two distinct parts: natural language 
generation, which is the ability to deliver spoken messages, including with nuanced 
human interaction and gestures, and natural language understanding, which is 
the comprehension of language and nuanced linguistic communication in all its 
rich complexity. 

  Social and emotional capabilities. This consists of three types of capability: social 
and emotional sensing, which involves identifying a person’s social and emotional state; 
social and emotional reasoning, which entails accurately drawing conclusions based 
on a person’s social and emotional state, and determining an appropriate response; 
and social and emotional output, which is the production of an appropriate social or 
emotional response, both in words and through body language. 



35McKinsey Global Institute A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity

  Physical capabilities. This includes gross motor skills, fine motor skills, navigation, 
and mobility. These capabilities could be implemented by robots or other machines 
manipulating objects with dexterity and sensitivity, moving objects with multidimensional 
motor skills, autonomously navigating in various environments, and moving within and 
across various environments and terrain.

36 McKinsey Global Institute 2. The technical potential for automation 

We estimated the level of performance in each of these capabilities that is required to 
successfully perform each work activity, categorizing whether the capability is required at 
all, and if so, whether the required level of performance is at roughly a median human level, 
below median human level, or at a high level of performance (for example, the top 25th 
percentile).45 We also assessed the performance of existing technologies today against the 
same criteria. 

This framework enabled us to assess the state of technology today and the potential to 
automate work activities in all sectors of the economy by adapting currently demonstrated 
technologies. By evaluating the technologies across a spectrum of performance, we have 
also been able to take into account their potential evolution in the future and resulting 
incremental effect on workplace activities. A detailed account of our methodology is 
contained in the technical appendix. Our assessments are simplifications for modeling 
purposes that synthesize a variety of subcapabilities, not all of which consistently fall into the 
below-median, median, and top-quartile categories. 

Machines will need to be able to use many of these capabilities together in the 
workplace, as humans do 
The 18 capabilities we have identified should not be taken in isolation. They are 
closely interconnected. 

Let us return to our retail salesperson, by way of example, to show the interplay of these 
capabilities. Daily activities may include greeting customers, answering questions about 
products and services, cleaning and maintaining work areas, demonstrating product 
features, and processing sales and transactions. To carry out this range of activities requires 
almost the full spectrum of these capabilities. It starts with the greeting of customers. A 
skilled salesperson will identify the social and emotional state of a customer, accurately 
draw conclusions about how to react to that social and emotional state, and through body 
language, tone of voice, and choice of vocabulary, provide an emotionally appropriate 
response. Cognitive capabilities will be fully used, too. Listening to what a customer says 
and responding requires the ability to understand and generate natural language. Other 
cognitive capabilities employed are the ability to retrieve information (“do we have these 
shoes in stock?”); to reason logically and solve problems (“we don’t have them in your size 
in black, but we do have them in red or brown”); to coordinate with multiple agents (“I’ll 
have one of my colleagues determine if we have the item in stock”), and creativity (“try the 
purple pair, they’re very fashionable this year and will suit you well”). Physical capabilities are 
likewise also needed. They include mobility and navigation (walking to the stockroom), gross 
motor skills (taking the shoe box off a shelf in the stockroom), and fine motor skills (tying 
a lace). 

For now, automation technologies do not have this full range of capabilities to perform at the 
same level as humans, and for many problems, they have yet to be seamlessly integrated 
into solutions. Combinations of social, cognitive, and physical capabilities are required for 
many activities, and we do see patterns about which capabilities are often required together 
(Exhibit 4). For example, an activity that needs any social or emotional capability typically 
needs all of them—sensing, reasoning, and output. Likewise, an activity requiring one form 
of physical capability such as fine motor skills or mobility tends to require multiple physical 
capabilities, including gross motor skills and navigation. However, cognitive capabilities can 
occur in combination with many different capabilities. There is an overlap between creativity 
and optimization and planning, for example, but one can do without the other. Coordinating 
with multiple agents does not automatically entail information retrieval, logical reasoning, or 

45 Among the many factors that define levels of performance are the acceptable error rates, particularly for 
sensory and cognitive activities. For instance, the consequences of false positives or negatives when making 
certain law enforcement or health-care judgments could be much more significant than for other judgments in 
the entertainment industry. 



37McKinsey Global Institute A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity

generating novel patterns. Moreover, where there are cognitive demands, physical demands 
are less likely to be required. 

When machines can take on workplace activities, the nature of work will change. Today, 
only about 10 percent or less of the average human worker’s time at work is spent using 
capabilities such as emotional reasoning and creativity, which many people would describe 
as being a core part of the human experience. The capability most used is recognizing 
known patterns, followed by natural language generation (for example, speaking), sensory

machines to handle more mundane activities, automation could free up women and men to 
use their creative and other talents more than they do now. 

Gauging the automation potential of occupations and sectors of the economy 
through analysis of their constituent activities 
Applying our methodology to the more than 2,000 activities across all sectors of 
the economy carried out by the US workforce—and subsequently adopting similar 
methodology for the global workforce—we found that many types of activities share 
common characteristics that are readily grouped into categories. For example, processing 
data is a very frequent activity common to a large range of occupations in different sectors, 
as is carrying out repetitive physical movement. By analyzing the amount of time spent 
on each of these categories of activity, we were able to estimate the technical automation 
potential of hundreds of occupations across the economy. We have also analyzed the 
implications across wage rates. As noted, the technical ability to automate is only one 
element that will lead to automation actually being deployed in the workplace; given

hardware and software costs and relative wage levels, a coherent business case needs to 
be made, and regulatory, social, and organizational issues also play a role. 

Hourly wage rates are not strong predictors of automation potential 
Occupations across the spectrum of the economy, from CEO to metal welders, have a range 
of automation potential based on today’s technologies. Technically automatable activities 
represent about $2.7 trillion of addressable wages in the United States, or about 46 percent 
of the total hours worked. Automation is sometimes depicted as primarily affecting particular 
groups of workers depending on their wage levels. Our analysis finds that while there is a 
negative correlation between wage rates and technical automation potential, there is a large 
amount of variation, so the hourly wage rate is not a strong predictor of technical automation 
potential.46 In fact, a significant proportion of highly paid work, not just low-wage work, can 
be automated (Exhibit 6). 

People in the lowest wage group, earning less than $15 per hour, carry out work activities 
that have among the highest potential for automation, and as a whole a majority (51 percent) 
of this group’s activities is automatable. However, those earning between $15 and $30 
per hour have an automation potential of 46 percent, which is close to the average for 
the economy as a whole. Above this $15 to $30 wage level, there is no clear pattern or 
correlation between wages and the automation potential of the work. More than 17 million 

46 Using a linear model, we find the correlation between wages and automatability (the percentage of time spent 
on activities that can be automated by adapting currently demonstrated technology) in the US economy to be 
significant (p-value < 0.01), but with a high degree of variability (r2 = 0.19).

40 McKinsey Global Institute 2. The technical potential for automation 

American workers earn between $30 and $45 per hour, but the automation potential of this 
group is similar to that of people earning $90 to $105 per hour, for example. 

Similarly, higher education attainment levels and work experience are correlated with lower 
technical automation potential, but there is also a great deal of variability. 

Technical potential is an important consideration, but other factors including 
cost of automation and wage levels also weigh on the decision to automate 
The deployment of automation technologies in the workplace depends on a range of 
factors, of which the availability of the technology itself is an important one, but not the only 
one. That it is technically possible for a robot to carry out an activity does not mean that it 
will necessarily be deployed to do so in the workplace. Four other factors also need to be 
taken into consideration. The pace at which activities are automated and the extent of that 
automation reflects a subtle interplay between these factors and the trade-offs among them. 

The first factor is the cost. Buying, adapting, and integrating the necessary hardware 
and software to automate activities can be expensive and complex, and before doing so, 
employers need a strong business case. Will machines in fact be able to undertake the 
tasks at hand less expensively and more efficiently, or do human labor and skills still have 
the edge? While it may be possible to automate service at a fast-food restaurant, the cost 
of the machines compared to the cost of humans earning a minimum wage will need to be 
calculated and considered. Indeed, a more clear-cut case for automation may come as 
higher-wage jobs are reviewed for their technical feasibility to be automated. 

The cost of labor and the related supply and demand dynamics may thus play a significant 
role in decisions about automation, and are the second factor. If workers are in abundant 
supply and significantly less expensive than automation, this could be a decisive argument 
against automation. We calculate that just over $1 trillion in wages could be economically 
automated with a technology cost of $20 per hour, and $2 trillion could be captured with an 
automation cost of $10 per hour. Our analysis at the level of individual activities supports the 
argument that some occupations in the middle of the income and skill distribution are more 
susceptible to automation than others at the top and bottom (see Box 2, “Labor market 
polarization and the technical automation potential of occupation families). 

Box 2. Labor market polarization and the technical automation potential of occupation families 

1 David H. Autor, “Why are there still so many jobs? The history and future of workplace automation,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, volume 
29, number 3, 2015. 

A body of work in the economics literature documents 
“polarization” in the labor markets of developed 
countries, in which “wage gains went disproportionately 
to those at the top and at the bottom of the income 
and skill distribution, not to those in the middle.”1 These 
observations have largely been based on workforce 
data from national statistical agencies. Our analysis at 
the level of individual activities supports the argument 
that some occupations in the middle of the income and 
skill distribution are more susceptible to automation than 
others at the top and bottom. As depicted in Exhibit 7, 
occupation families (an aggregation of individual 

occupations) for transportation, office administration, 
and production, in the middle of the distribution, have 
higher percentages of activities with high technical 
automation potential (collecting data, processing data, 
and predictable physical activities) than other occupation 
families lower and higher in the distribution. However, 
one occupation family at the low end of the income 
distribution, food preparation, has the highest percentage 
of time in activities with a high technical potential for 
automation. Furthermore, as technology continues to 
develop over time, the automation potential of different 
activities will also increase.

42 McKinsey Global Institute 2. The technical potential for automation 

A third factor to consider are the benefits of automation beyond labor substitution. These 
can include higher levels of output, raised quality, speed, agility, safety, and fewer errors. 
The potential savings from these benefits can be larger than those from labor costs. 

Finally, there is the issue of social and regulatory acceptability of automation. While self-
driving autos and trucks are undergoing tests in both the United States and Europe, they 
will be able to operate without human co-drivers only when regulators are comfortable with 
them doing so. Social acceptance may be even more difficult. While a robot in theory could 
carry out some functions of a nurse or a home-care help, the human beings on the receiving 
end of their care may balk at the idea. 

Differentiating work activities into seven high-level categories 
Across the more than 2,000 work activities across the US economy that we analyzed using 
Bureau of Labor Statistics data, we identified seven high-level categories of work activity. 
Each of these categories has a different potential for automation. Three categories have 
the highest technical potential for automation: performing physical activity and operating 
machinery in predictable environments, processing data, and collecting data. The other 
four high-level categories have a considerably lower potential for automation: performing 
physical activities and operating machinery in unpredictable environments; interfacing with 
stakeholders; applying expertise to decision making, planning, and creative tasks; and, least 
susceptible to automation, managing and developing people (Exhibit 8).

Performing physical activities and operating machinery in 
predictable environments 
Almost one-fifth of the time spent in US workplaces involves performing physical activities 
and operating machinery in predictable environments, which have the highest automation 
potential of our seven categories, 81 percent. Currently demonstrated technology works 
best in these environments, where changes are relatively easy to anticipate. Physical 
activities in predictable environments figure prominently in sectors such as manufacturing, 
accommodation and food services, and retailing. That makes these sectors among the 
most susceptible to automation. Exhibit 9 shows a breakdown of different sectors of the 
economy based on the seven high-level categories. 

In manufacturing, for example, performing physical activities or operating machinery in a 
predictable environment represents one-third of the workers’ overall time. The activities 
range from packaging products to loading materials on production equipment to welding 
to maintaining equipment. Because of the prevalence of such predictable physical work, 
almost 60 percent of all manufacturing activities could be automated. The overall potential, 
however, masks considerable variance. Within manufacturing, welders, cutters, solderers, 
and brazers, have an automation potential above 90 percent, for example, while that of 
customer service representatives is below 30 percent. 

Manufacturing is the second most readily automatable sector in the US economy. A service 
sector occupies the top spot: accommodation and food services, where almost half of 
all labor time involves physical activities in predictable environments and the operation of 
machinery—including preparing, cooking, or serving food; cleaning food preparation areas; 
and preparing hot and cold beverages. According to our analysis, 73 percent of the activities 
workers perform in the accommodation and food services sector have the technical 
potential for automation. 

Some of this potential is familiar. Automats, or automated cafeterias, for example, have 
long been in use. Now restaurants are testing new, more sophisticated concepts, such 
as self-service ordering or even robotic servers. Solutions such as Momentum Machines’ 
hamburger-cooking robot, which can reportedly assemble and cook 400 burgers an hour, 
could automate a number of cooking and food preparation activities.47 

Data processing and data collection 
Data processing is the second category most readily automatable (69 percent) and 
accounts for 16 percent of all the time spent working in the United States. That is followed 
by data collection (64 percent automation potential and 17 percent of time spent). These 
activities are common to almost all sectors, ranging from human resources staff recording 
personnel history to mortgage brokers filling in forms, medical staff compiling patient 
records, and accounting staff processing payments. These are not just entry-level or low-
wage jobs; people whose annual incomes exceed $200,000 spend some 31 percent of their 
time doing those things as well.

Companies have long automated activities such as administering procurement, processing 
payrolls, calculating material-resource needs, generating invoices, and using bar codes 
to track flows of materials. But as technology progresses, computers are helping increase 
the scale and quality of these activities. For example, a number of companies now offer 
solutions that automate entering paper and PDF invoices into computer systems or even 
processing loan applications. “Robotic process automation” systems use software to 
automate well-defined data transactions currently performed by many workers. 

Financial services and insurance provide one example of this phenomenon. The world of 
finance relies on knowledge work, not physical work: stock traders and investment bankers 
live off their wits. Yet about 50 percent of the overall time of the workforce in finance and 
insurance is devoted to collecting and processing data, where the potential for automation 
is high. Insurance sales agents spend considerable time gathering customer or product 
information, as do underwriters  on verifying the accuracy of records. Securities and 
financial sales agents prepare sales or other contracts. Bank tellers verify the accuracy of 
financial data. As a result, the financial and insurance sector has the potential to automate 
activities taking up 43 percent of its workers’ time. 

Performing physical activities and operating machinery in 
unpredictable environments 
In creating our high-level groupings of activities, we divided the performance of physical 
activities and operation of machinery into two distinct categories depending on the 
environment or setting in which the activity takes place. As we have seen, carrying out this 
type of physical activity in a predictable setting has a rote quality to it, and the technical 
potential to automate is accordingly high, at 81 percent. When the environment or setting is 
unpredictable, however, the automation potential is much lower, at 26 percent. 

Physical activities in an unpredictable environment make up a high proportion of the work 
in sectors such as forestry and construction. Examples include operating a crane on a 
construction site, providing medical care as a first responder, collecting trash in public 
areas, setting up classroom materials and equipment, and making beds in hotel rooms. 
The environment in these examples is not stable and can change in unpredictable ways. 
Carrying out these activities thus requires a high degree of flexibility, which makes them 
harder to automate. For example, people in public areas do not always drop trash in the 
same place, and while sometimes they might drop paper, at other times they leave plastic 
bottles or soda cans. 

Interfacing with stakeholders 
Across sectors of the economy, especially in services, workers interface on a regular 
basis with a wide range of stakeholders—customers, patrons, or visitors. Greeting them, 
for example in a retail store, explaining technical product details or service information 
to customers, including from a call center, responding to complaints and questions, 
scheduling appointments, or providing advice are just some of the numerous types of 
interactions that take can place with stakeholders. These types of activity for now have a 
relatively low potential for automation based on currently demonstrated technologies, just 
20 percent. Social and emotional responses are important for these tasks, as are linguistic 
and cognitive capabilities such as logical reasoning and problem solving. 



46 McKinsey Global Institute 2. The technical potential for automation 

Applying expertise to decision making, planning, and creative tasks 
Even where computers perform above human levels in some well-defined activities such as 
optimizing trucking routes, humans—for now—still need to determine the goals, interpret 
the results, or provide commonsense checks for solutions. Activities that require application 
of decision making, planning, and creativity account for 14 percent, about one-seventh, of 
the total time spent working in the United States, but they have relatively low automation 
potential, at just 18 percent, based on adapting currently demonstrated technologies. These 
activities can be as varied as coding software or creating a menu, developing marketing 
plans, or writing promotional materials. They are common in fields such as education, 
human resources, and finance, and considerable amounts of time spent on them in the 
US economy involve evaluating students’ work, coordinating operational activities, and 
examining financial records or processes. 

Managing and developing others 
The category of activities we describe as managing and developing others has the lowest 
automation potential. Only about 7 percent of time in the workplace is spent on these 
activities, and the potential to automate them is low, about 9 percent. Chief executive 
officers and senior managers spend a significant proportion of their time engaged in such 
activities, which brings down their overall automation potential; about 25 percent of a CEO’s 
daily activities could be automated using currently demonstrated technology, but that mainly 
represents data collection and analysis, rather than talent management. 

Among the sectors, education is among the least susceptible to automation, at least 
for now, with an automation potential of 27 percent. To be sure, digital technology is 
transforming the field, as can be seen from the myriad classes and learning vehicles 
available online. Yet the essence of teaching is deep expertise and experience, and complex 
interactions with other people. Together, those two categories—the least automatable of the 
seven identified in Exhibit 6—account for about half of the activities in the education sector. 

ASSESSING THE AUTOMATION POTENTIAL OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY 
We began our research into automation potential by focusing on sectors of the US economy, 
to establish the methodological framework that underpins our research. We then broadened 
the analysis to a total of 46 countries, using comparable national and international data, 
where available, including wage data from foreign direct investment sources. Details of our 
international methodology are in the technical appendix. 

Overall, currently demonstrated automation technology has the potential to affect activities 
associated with 41 to 56 percent of global wages depending on country (Exhibit 10). This 
amounts to about $14.6 trillion in wages and the equivalent of 1.2 billion workers. As we 
will see in Chapter 4, the actual deployment of automation could vary widely from country 
to country, depending on a number of factors including the level of wages and the cost of 
deploying solutions. 

The key differences in the total wages associated with technical automation potential among 
countries results from differences in the mix of sectors within each economy, the mix of 
occupations within sectors, and wage levels. 

In terms of total wages associated with technically automatable activities, the potential 
is concentrated globally in China, India, Japan, the United States, and the five largest 
European Union countries—France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. These 
are the countries with a combination of the largest labor forces or higher wages. 



47McKinsey Global Institute A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity

Automation potential is concentrated in China, India, Japan, the United States, 
and the largest European Union nations 
More than half the wages and almost two-thirds of the total number of workers associated 
with technically automatable activities are in just four countries—China, India, Japan, 
and the United States. These four together account for about $8 trillion of the wages and 
more than 700 million employees of the global total potentially affected. In the five largest 
European Union economies—France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom—
more than 60 million workers and $1.9 trillion in wages are associated with technically 
automatable activities (Exhibit 11). 

The largest amount of employment associated with technically automatable activities is in 
China and India, because of the relative sizes of their labor force. Technically automatable 
activities make up the equivalent of more than 600 million full-time workers in the two 
countries together. In terms of wages associated with technically automatable activities, 
however, the United States is closer to China’s level ($2.3 trillion in the United States vs. 
$3.6 trillion in China) because of higher wage levels.

48 McKinsey Global Institute 2. The technical potential for automation 

Differences and similarities in automation potential globally 
Our analysis of the technical automation potential of the global economy shows that there is 
a range among countries of about 15 percentage points. Two factors explain this range. The 
first is the sectoral makeup of each economy. That is, the proportion of a national economy 
that is in sectors such as manufacturing or accommodation and food services, which both 
have relatively high automation potential, compared with the proportion in sectors with 
lower automation potential, such as education, management, and health care. The second 
factor is the occupational makeup of sectors in different countries. That is, to what extent 
workers in these sectors are engaged in job titles with high automation potential such as 
manufacturing production, and those in job titles with a lower automation potential such 
as management and administration. This weighting changes the automation potential of a 
sector depending on the country. 

Two examples illustrate these differences. The first is China and India (Exhibit 12). With 
the world’s largest workforces, they have similar automation potential and dynamics 
overall: both have technical automation potential of 50 percent. They have similar top 
sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing, retail, construction, and transportation and 
warehousing, and the automation potential within each sector is very similar. Manufacturing 
and retail play a larger role in China than India, whereas agriculture accounts for a 
significantly greater share of hours worked than in India than in China as a percentage 
of the total. Within the sectors, the essential differences result from varying types of job 
families. For example, India has more welders and sewing machine operators engaged 
in manufacturing production than China, and both of these job families have a higher 
automation potential than many other types of jobs, such as managing and developing 
people, and specialized expert technicians. At the same time, India has a lower proportion 
of jobs requiring interactions with stakeholders and managing and developing people, 
activities with low automation potential.

The second example highlights differences between Japan and the United States 
(Exhibit 13). Japan overall has an automation potential of 55 percent of hours worked, 
compared with 46 percent in the United States. This difference is primarily due to a different 
sectoral mix in the two economies, and within those sectors, a different weighting of jobs 
with larger or smaller automation potential. For example, the automation potential of Japan’s 
manufacturing sector is particularly high, at 71 percent (compared with 60 percent in the 
United States). Japanese manufacturing has a slightly larger concentration of work hours in 
production jobs (54 percent of hours vs. 50 percent) and office and administrative support 
jobs (16 percent vs. 9 percent). Both of these job titles comprise activities with a relatively 
high automation potential. By comparison, the United States has a higher proportion of work 
hours in management, architecture, and engineering jobs, which have a lower automation 
potential since they require application of specific expertise such as high-value engineering, 
which computers and robots currently are not able to do. These differences outweigh 
the higher level of wages in the United States than Japan, which affect the business case 
for automation. 

Similar differences exist among countries globally, for example, between Argentina and 
Brazil, France and Germany, or Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. A detailed look at all 46 
countries we have examined is available online.48

50 McKinsey Global Institute 2. The technical potential for automation 

•••

The technical potential to automate work activities in the global economy by adapting 
currently demonstrated technologies is already close to 50 percent, thanks to rapid 
advances in automation technologies. That does not mean automation will occur overnight, 
however, since technical potential is only one of several factors that will eventually lead to 
automation adoption in the workplace. Only a tiny fraction of entire occupations could be 
automated with current technologies, but activities across a wide spectrum are susceptible, 
especially those involving predictable physical activities, data processing, and data 
collection. What is the outlook for the development of these capabilities? How rapidly could 
technical potential become workplace adoption? And what would the workplace then 
look like? In the following chapters, we model some ways automation could arrive in the 
workplace and lay out timeline scenarios for its actual adoption across the world.

3. FIVE CASE STUDIES 

Our analysis of automation potential inevitably raises 
questions about the practical effect on workplaces 
and on the people who work in them. What exactly will 
change, and how? To develop a vision of automation as 
it could be applied in the workplace, we have created 
hypothetical case studies across different industries that 
suggest how automation could affect specific processes. 
In this chapter, we outline five of these cases by way of 
example. The five are from highly varied sectors and 
involve a broad range of activities across various industry 
sectors and physical settings: a hospital emergency 
department, aircraft maintenance, an oil and gas control 
room, a grocery store, and mortgage brokering. 

For all their differences, our case studies also have 
several essential elements in common. First is the 
changing nature of work itself, which will likely affect all 
workers at all skill levels. There will be less routine and 
repetitive work based on rules-based activities, because 
this can be automated across many occupations and 
industries. This in turn will mean many workers may need 
to acquire new skills. The workplace will become ever 
more a place where humans and technology interact 
productively. A major part of most human jobs will involve 
working together with artificial intelligence, robotics, 
and other technologies. Automation will affect more 
than distinct work activities: processes and procedures 
will also likely have to adapt, too. This in turn will have 
profound implications for how the workplace is structured 
and organized. 

A second essential element of automation in the 
workplace will be its impact on business economics. 
Advances in automation technologies are often depicted 
simplistically as robots replacing humans. In fact, in 
evaluating the economics of our case studies, we see 
that automation’s effects are twofold. While it will result 
in some degree of labor substitution in all five of our 
case studies, it will also drive significant performance 
and quality gains in four of the five and, in one of 
these cases—the oil and gas control room—these 
performance improvements far outweigh the gains from 
labor substitution. These improvements are the result 
of automated systems carrying out a range of activities 
better than human workers, and include eliminating 
waste, improving efficiencies, heightening safety, and 
enhancing quality. As a rule of thumb, capital-intensive 

industries tend to accrue automation benefits mostly 
through performance gains, as capital is better utilized, 
while labor-intensive sectors tend to benefit more from 
labor substitution. Together they provide a strong 
rationale for the deployment of automation technology. 

The third essential element is that the business case 
for automation is often strong. The relative cost of 
automation is likely to be modest compared with the 
value it can create. The types and sizes of investment 
needed to automate will differ by industry and sector. 
For example, industries with high capital intensity that 
require substantial hardware solutions to automate and 
are subject to heavy safety regulation will see longer lags 
between the time of investment and the benefits than 
sectors where automation will be mostly software-based 
and less capital-intensive. For the former, this will mean a 
longer journey to breakeven on automation investment. 
However, our analysis suggests that the business case is 
compelling regardless of the degree of capital intensity: 
the run-rate benefits of investment in automation in our 
case studies are between three and 11 times the costs of 
that investment. 

These case studies are not precise projections. The vision 
of the future they provide is based on the hypotheses of 
industry experts about how these processes could be 
transformed by automation. While these case studies are 
partly anecdotal, we nonetheless believe they are a useful 
exercise that could indicate key benefits and challenges 
related to developing and deploying automation 
technologies in various sectors, as well as providing 
a vision of how automation could actually transform 
the workplace. 

For all five cases, we outline two scenarios: an “interim” 
future state as automation technology is deployed in 
current processes and structures, and a “provocative” 
future state in which we envisage automation being used 
in a changed structure or process environment that is 
tailored to maximize its advantages. We also outline 
some of the likely barriers to automation deployment in 
each of the cases, including legal and policy obstacles, 
organizational impediments to change, difficulties 
in integrating technology, economic viability, and 
human reluctance to accept technology solutions in 
certain situations. 



54 McKinsey Global Institute 3. Five case studies 

IN A HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, LESS WAITING FOR 
BETTER DIAGNOSES AND TREATMENT 

49 ProPublica lists average waiting and treatment times in US emergency rooms, broken down by state, at https://projects.propublica.org/
emergency/. See also Lisa Esposito, “Enduring really long waits at the emergency room,” US News and World Report, May 8, 2015.

50 2015 Medical malpractice payout analysis, Diederich Healthcare, May 2015.
51 The unsettling feeling that people may experience when humanoid robots or audiovisual simulations closely resemble humans is known as 

“uncanny valley,” a term coined by a Japanese robotics professor, Masahiro Mori, in a 1970 essay. The eeriness is largely prompted by the 
machine’s appearance, which is realistic but not convincingly so.

52 Cheryl Gutherz and Shira Baron, “Why patients with primary care physicians use the emergency department for non-emergency care,” Einstein 
Journal of Biology and Medicine, volume 18, number 4, 2001.

Two common characteristics of many hospital emergency 
departments today are their high level of human 
interaction and long patient waiting times; in the United 
States it is rare to be discharged in less than two hours 
on average.49 Automation has the potential to reduce 
those waits and increase productivity, as doctors and 
nurses focus more effectively on better outcomes, and 
machines take on routine activities such as registration, 
checkout, and dispensing of prescriptions (see illustration, 
“Hypothetical future state of a highly automated 
emergency department”). Predictive health care using 
sensing wearables to check vital medical signs and 
remote diagnostics could cut patient waiting times. For 
hospitals, automation could streamline billing and other 
administrative activities.

To achieve such outcomes, hospitals will need to make 
significant investment in automation technology, along 
with time and capital to train staff. They will also need to 
redesign process workflow. Doctors and nurses will have 
to become comfortable working closely with and trusting 
automated systems. Safety and liability are significant 
challenges in a sector where malpractice suits are 
common; in the United States, about $3.6 billion was paid 
out in malpractice suits in 2014, and artificial intelligence 
companies could find themselves on the receiving end.50 
Stringent privacy regulations will need to be safeguarded. 
The emergency room is also a place where human 
unease with machines could be strong: people who 
come to hospitals for medical emergencies usually want 
and need to interact with qualified humans and may 
not feel comfortable with machines, however medically 
competent.51 

In emergency departments in the United States today, 
about 80 to 85 percent of the patients are walk-ins, and 
about the same percentage of the total are treated and 
sent home usually with prescribed medicines.52 Patients 
interact with a range of workers. First are the medical 
secretaries who enter and validate patient information. 

Triage nurses check vital signs, request laboratory tests 
or imaging, and decide to discharge or refer a patient 
to see a doctor. Doctors examining a patient prescribe 
medicines and decide to discharge, admit to hospital, or 
refer the patient to a specialist. Lab technicians conduct 
tests. At the end of the process, medical secretaries 
collect payment or compile documentation for an 
insurance claim.

At least some of these activities could be fully or partially 
automated. They include the initial work of gathering 
patients’ information, checking vital signs and requesting 
lab reports. Lab registration and tests are also potentially 
automatable, as is the end process of payment. Some 
aspects of a doctor’s work in an emergency department 
are also potentially automatable—not just the data 
collection that takes up some of a doctor’s time, but 
also some areas of disease diagnosis, and even some 
aspects of medical procedures and surgery. For example, 
in radiology, computers are already analyzing X-rays, 
CT scans, and MRI imagery. Completely automated 
diagnosis is not likely to happen quickly, partly for reasons 
of patient acceptance, and partly because of the technical 
difficulty of integrating data from multiple sources 
(including natural language understanding, recognizing 
and processing the patient’s emotions) to determine a 
diagnosis and course of treatment. Automated diagnostic 
advice is thus likely to augment doctors’ decision making 
before fully automated diagnosis, except perhaps in 
special instances, such as radiology,  or cell pathology 
(checking for abnormalities through a microscope).

Overall, we calculate that about 30 percent of the benefits 
of automation in an emergency room would come 
from performance gains, and 70 percent from labor 
substitution. Productivity could rise substantially, while 
the number of full-time equivalents could decline by about 
half, with the main reductions at the registration desk and 
in lab testing.

FOR AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE, AUTOMATION WILL RAISE SAFETY, 
IMPROVE DEFECT DETECTION, AND REDUCE TIME WASTED ON 
WALKING AND WAITING 

53 Stephen Holloway, Straight and level: Practical airline economics, Routledge, 1997.
54 US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015.
55 Mary S. Reveley et al., Causal factors and adverse events of aviation accidents and incidents related to integrated vehicle health management, 

National Aeronautics and Space Administration, March 2011.
56 Jeffrey O’Brien, “Maintenance: What causes aircraft accidents?” Fiix, May 9, 2012.

Maintaining a commercial aircraft takes an average 
of about 8,000 technician hours per plane annually.53 
Technicians conduct visual inspections of the aircraft for 
signs of physical wear and damage. They also remove 
and replace parts, conduct a sign-off for quality, and 
handle administrative tasks, including supplying records 
to the Federal Aviation Administration where needed. 
These are jobs that involve spending considerable 
amounts of time on walking around the aircraft and 
waiting on parts, planes, or people. They are also 
dangerous: in 2013, 57 job-related deaths in the United 
States were in aircraft maintenance.54 

Automation could have a major beneficial impact on 
the sector (see illustration, “Hypothetical future state of 
highly automated aircraft maintenance”). First, removing 
technicians from fall hazards and fuel tanks would 
represent a significant improvement in safety. Second, 
robots equipped with image process algorithms already 
do a better job than humans at image identification, and 
deploying them would improve the detection of defects in 
the aircraft; maintenance errors caused more than one-
third of the 179 commercial jet engine accidents between 
1988 and 2013.55 Automated warehouse systems 
could eliminate about 75 percent of the time wasted by 
walking around the aircraft, picking up tools and parts, 
and improved sensors and analytics could raise the 
proportion of predictive maintenance, which is less costly 
than reactive maintenance. For maintenance companies, 
the savings from reduced waste and a move to on-

demand maintenance would save costs. Automation 
could enable experts to monitor all maintenance from a 
command center, which would reduce variability, and 
ensure better data collection. Consumers would benefit 
from these savings if they are passed on in the form of 
lower flight costs. About half of engine-related delays 
today are caused by maintenance issues, and so flight 
delays could also be reduced.56 

For technicians themselves, automation could change the 
workplace and their roles. Much of the routine work they 
carry out, including walking around the plane, moving it, 
and logging work records, could be automated. Already in 
an interim phase, remotely controlled robots could crawl 
through planes and inspect fuel tanks. High-resolution 
cameras guided by experts could inspect exteriors. 
Artificial intelligence algorithms could suggest potential 
problems based on logs even before inspection takes 
place. In our more advanced automation scenario, 
small robots could inspect the airframe without moving 
panels. Automated tugs would move planes, while 
robotic carts bring and remove parts and tools based 
on scheduling routines. These and other changes would 
allow technicians to be more focused on knowledge and 
handling exceptions, which require greater training. 

Overall, we estimate that 35 percent of the value created 
by automation in aircraft maintenance could come from 
performance gains, while 65 percent could potentially 
come from labor substitution.

IN AN OIL AND GAS CONTROL ROOM, PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE 
AND OTHER ADVANCES COULD BRING SIGNIFICANT 
PERFORMANCE GAINS 

57 Occupational fatalities during the oil and gas boom—United States, 2003–2013, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, May 29, 2015.

58 Elly Earls, “Staying one step ahead with predictive maintenance technology,” Mining-technology.com, October 15, 2013.

Most of the gains of automation in oil and gas control 
rooms are likely to come from higher productivity and 
safety (see illustration, “Hypothetical future state of 
automation in oil and gas operations”). A control room is 
an operations center that monitors and controls upstream 
exploration and drilling operations. For now, key roles in 
the oil and gas sector are divided between onshore and 
offshore facilities, with operations and maintenance on an 
offshore rig largely overseen and carried out by managers 
and workers on the rig, while teams of petroleum and 
other engineers provide technical support and coordinate 
activities from headquarters onshore. Offshore work 
can be a dangerous business: the job-related fatality 
rate of people working in extraction operations in 2013 
was four times the average for the US economy.57 The 
performance and training of offshore operators vary, 
and errors are sometimes made, including ones with 
severe consequences. 

Automation technologies can considerably raise the 
performance of control rooms by removing operators 
from environments that are hazardous and expensive 
to maintain and by capturing data that can be used for 
predictive and preventive maintenance and operational 
best practice. Centralizing expertise in an onshore 
location can improve strategy planning and the 

effectiveness of event responses. In our more futuristic 
scenario, permanent seafloor robots could undertake 
repairs or conduct additive manufacturing, while 3D 
printers on a surface vessel could print out replacement 
parts as needed. Robots would conduct standard 
maintenance, and operating algorithms developed using 
historical logs could deliver more efficient operations and 
greater safety. 

The advantages of automation in this case include better 
personnel safety, greater efficiency, higher throughput, 
improved agility, and cost reductions from relocating 
operators from remote sites to centralized offices. 
Improved sensors for remote operations and analytics 
can enable predictive maintenance, which is just one-
quarter the cost of reactive maintenance.58 

Overall, we estimate that 80 percent of the value created 
from automation in oil and gas control rooms would 
come from performance gains, with the rest from labor 
substitution. To reap such gains will require the integration 
of technologies so that cognitive, sensory perception, 
and physical capabilities can be deployed on site. Data 
scientists, engineers, and developers will be needed to 
develop algorithms that optimize remote management.

AT A GROCERY STORE, IMPROVED CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE 
AND HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY, AS THE NEED FOR HUMAN 
STAFF DECLINES 

59 Amazon in December 2016 launched a store without cashiers, Amazon Go. Leena Rao, “Amazon Go debuts as a new grocery store without 
checkout lines,” Fortune, December 5, 2016.

Imagine walking into a grocery store and being greeted 
by name, courtesy of facial recognition software. Thus 
begins a highly personalized shopping experience that 
is faster, more tailored to your preferences, and more 
convenient than shopping today. If you cannot find what 
you are looking for, you provide instant feedback. You 
might use personalized coupons on your mobile device. 
Once you have finished your selection, an automated 
back-room service sends out your goods, or a drone 
drops them off at your home. Best of all, there is no line 
for payment because there is no physical checkout. The 
store senses what goods you have with you when you 
walk out of the store, and payment is accurately and 
automatically deducted from your preferred account (see 
illustration, “Hypothetical future state of automation in a 
grocery store”). 

We are not all that far from such a scenario today. Stores 
still have physical shelves, but self-checkout kiosks are 
becoming commonplace and are a short step from 
automatic payment and shipping.59 Robot cleaners and 
automated storerooms already exist. Augmented virtual 
reality product views are just a question of time, where 
consumers will be able to look at displays of goods 
(probably using special glasses or other technology) to 
find out more information about the product such as 
ingredients and nutritional details. One of the biggest 
overall benefits of automation in retail will be the improved 
customer experience, as the online and offline shopping 
experience merges into one, even as it becomes 
more individualized. 

From the employment perspective, our case study 
suggests that automation in grocery stores could have a 
significant impact on staffing needs, with a reduction of 
about 65 percent of hours, mainly for front-end cashiers 
and people engaged in stocking and cleaning. Some 

workers could be repurposed toward higher value-added 
activities such as customer engagement. 

The retail sector overall will face some significant 
changes. Space productivity will rise, and that in turn 
will reduce the need for large stores. Smaller stores 
require less investment; we estimate savings of 60 to 
80 percent. Lower inventory and working capital will also 
be a feature of the new retail business landscape, as the 
brick-and-click models merge into a seamless whole, and 
retailers leverage physical stores as distribution centers. 
Data analytics will enable retailers and manufacturers to 
customize and target promotions. 

Some customers may find marketing use of their personal 
data, including location-based alerts, overly intrusive. 
Many jobs in retail are entry-level, low-skill ones, and 
the elimination of many such positions could cause a 
public outcry. Training will be essential so that staff can 
troubleshoot technical and other problems and make 
recommendations. From a technology perspective, 
sensory perception will need to be integrated with pattern 
matching, so that customers are recognized and given 
relevant recommendations. 

While the potential savings from smaller formats, less 
inventory, and lower payroll could be significant, the slim 
margins in retailing may mean that only large chains 
will have the capital needed to make the investment in 
full automation. Overall, we estimate that the benefits 
of automation will be three times the cost. Along with

MORTGAGE APPLICATIONS: SPEEDING UP THE 
PROCESS, REDUCING DROPOUT RATES, AND RAISING 
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION 

60 Evan Nemeroff, “Survey shows average mortgage closing time hits three-year low,” National Mortgage News, August 22, 2014.

The financial-service industry has been at the forefront 
of adopting automation technologies for a range of 
back-office work. This case shows how that degree of 
automation could reach even higher levels. It focuses 
on the business of processing mortgage applications, 
which consists in large part of collecting and processing 
data, two categories of activity that already have a high 
automation potential, by adapting currently demonstrated 
technologies. Our scenarios for automation in this 
process accordingly correspond to a sharp reduction 
in the overall required labor hours, of between 55 and 
85 percent. The speed with which mortgages are 
processed could accelerate substantially. For now, it 
takes an average of 37 days to approve a mortgage 
application in the United States, of which about 14 to 
21 days are spent on the mechanics of application 
processing.60 In our interim automation scenario, in 
which technology is deployed in current processes and 
structures, this could drop to less than six days. In a more 
futuristic scenario, in which the processes themselves 
change, mortgage approvals could come through in less 
than a day. The shorter turnaround time could improve 
the dropout rate by possibly 30 percent or more, as many 
people who apply for mortgages today drop out as a 
result of the lengthy process. 

For mortgage companies, the improvements derived 
from automated processes could lower default risks 
and eliminate inconsistencies in processing, thereby 
reducing the need for human performance management. 
Automation could also create a potential for partnership 
between mortgage companies and real estate agents for 
real-time lead generation, mortgage application, and loan 
fulfillment. Customer satisfaction could rise as a result 
of instant pre-approval, hassle-free applications, and 
much faster turnaround. Moreover, some of the industry’s 
challenges, including human bias in underwriting and 
the difficulty that underserved borrowers can have in 
accessing affordable capital, could also be eased by 
automated processes. 

Of our five cases, however, the automation of mortgage 
applications will potentially weigh most heavily on labor. 
The vast majority of the impact in this process, about 
88 percent, would come from labor substitution gains, 
compared with just 12 percent from performance gains. 
Moreover, the business case to move to automation is 
strong, since the software costs could be relatively low, 
and wages of loan officers are relatively high, at $35 per 
hour.61 The run-rate benefit from automated mortgage 
origination could be as much as 11 times the cost of 
automation itself, according to our estimates, easily the 
highest ratio of our five case studies. 

For mortgage brokers, automating and speeding up the 
approval processes will allow more time on complex 
tasks such as advising customers or handling exceptions 
that require human expertise and judgment, as well as 
additional time to manage unusual applications. That 
in turn will require more training. Data scientists will 
also be needed to increase the accuracy of algorithms 
used in processing, and to integrate platforms and data 
sources. Nonetheless, there is likely to be considerable 
restructuring and elimination of redundant positions in 
the core application processing functions, which could 
require managing labor issues, including helping to 
redeploy displaced workers. 

To reap the full benefits of automation, the entire 
mortgage approval process will need to be redesigned 
and piloted in select branches to ensure all necessary 
resources are available. There are technological 
challenges in ensuring end-to-end integration with 
systems from retail banks and underwriters, such as 
handling documents, messaging, and conducting risk 
analysis. However, given the potential cost savings and 
fairly certain return, financial institutions have an incentive 
to invest in automation for their mortgage origination 
activities, much as they have for straight-through 
processing of other types of transactions.

•••

No sector of the economy will be immune to automation. While our five hypothetical case 
studies are not precise predictions about how automation will be deployed in the workplace, 
they do signal some of the key benefits and challenges to come. Integrating technological 
capabilities, retraining staff, adjusting processes, and, in some sectors, working out how to 
make workers and customers comfortable interacting with machines rather than humans, 
are among the considerable changes that will be required to maximize the benefits from 
automation. Gains from labor substitution could be significant, but they will vary from 
sector to sector. Performance gains, in the form of better quality, greater safety, and higher 
productivity, could also be substantial, to judge by the findings of our case studies. How 
quickly will any of this happen? In the next chapter, we analyze the factors that will hasten 
or slow the adoption of automation, and project timelines for its implementation in the 
global economy.

Automation will be a global force, affecting all countries, all sectors, all jobs, and all work 
activities. Already today, machines and algorithms are playing a much larger role in the 
workplace, but how soon will it be before we all feel the impact of automation technologies? 
Could machines really carry out much or most of the work humans do today—and if so, 
by when? 

In this chapter, we describe factors that can affect the pace and extent to which automation 
is adopted in the global economy. We also present the results of a model that includes 
a range of potential scenarios illustrating how the automation of existing work activities 
could evolve. 

FIVE FACTORS INFLUENCING AUTOMATION OF WORK ACTIVITIES 
Overall, we have identified five broad factors that can influence the pace and extent 
of automation of work activities. They are: technical feasibility; the cost of developing 
and deploying solutions; labor market dynamics; economic benefits; and social and 
regulatory acceptance. 

Technical feasibility 
Technology has been automating human activities for centuries, from the printing press 
to the steam engine and the internet, and fundamentally reshaping the economy in 
the process. Over the past two centuries, the share of people working on the land in 
advanced economies has fallen from a majority to a tiny fraction. More recently, the United 
States and other advanced economies have seen a decline in the share of the workforce 
engaged in manufacturing. Technological advances require basic scientific research, but 
in order for these advances to be adopted, they also require engineering solutions, or 
“applied research.” Both take time to develop. There is a lag between a technology being 
demonstrated, and a viable product being developed using that technology. Orville and 
Wilbur Wright pioneered flying an aircraft in 1903, for example, but it took 11 more years 
before the first commercial flight, across Tampa Bay, in Florida, took place, and the true birth 
of commercial aviation in the United States is usually dated back to 1926, when pioneering 
operators had to begin complying with federal regulations.62 There was a similar lag in the 
development of automobiles, between German engineers Nikolaus Otto, Gottlieb Daimler, 
and Wilhelm Maybach, patenting the compressed charge, four-cycle engine in the 1870s 
and production of automobiles on a commercial scale some 15-20 years later. Solutions 
have to be engineered for specific use cases. While from a “scientific” perspective, a light 
passenger vehicle is conceptually the same as a tractor-trailer, the engineering required to 
develop these two solutions has very different specifications and each requires time and 
energy. Similarly, while you could view predictive maintenance of a complex engineered 
system such as a power plant and preventive health care for a congestive heart failure 
patient (predictive maintenance of the “human system”) as being conceptually the same 
problem, actually creating the software and models to prevent a failure in these two systems 
require quite distinct and considerable engineering efforts. 

At times, a paradigm shift is needed in how a new technology should be applied. When 
steam engines in factories began replacing the water wheel, everything was driven from a 
central mechanical drive. The first attempts at using electricity tried to duplicate this, but

4. FACTORS AFFECTING THE PACE 
AND EXTENT OF AUTOMATION 



66 McKinsey Global Institute 4. Factors affecting the pace and extent of automation 

only really made a difference when people realized it would be more efficient to distribute 
electrical energy through the building, and have separate electric motors in individual 
machines, rather than one central motor that distributes mechanical energy.63 

Today, technological advances in automation abound in areas from physical hardware and 
robotics to artificial intelligence and software, as we discussed in Chapter 1. Yet much of 
the innovation that we are seeing, from self-driving cars to digital personal assistants such 
as Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, and Google Assistant, are still in development—and often 
imperfect. That means there remains a lot of work to be done by scientists and engineers.64 

Cost of developing and deploying solutions 
The cost of automation technologies will affect when and where they are deployed. 
The costs of developing and deploying solutions have to be recouped. Even when the 
technology is purchased from a supplier, the supplier will amortize the development costs 
into the pricing. 

Developing and engineering automation technologies takes capital. Some technologies 
require substantial physical infrastructure such as tooling and laboratories. But even 
“virtual” solutions that are based on software require real investments in engineers to create 
solutions. A decade ago, the largest corporate research and development spending was 
to be found in automotive and pharmaceutical companies; today, technology companies 
dominate, with companies including Amazon, Alphabet, Intel, and Microsoft spending 
more than $10 billion apiece on annual R&D.65 Hiring talent can also be costly. Google, for 
example, acquired DeepMind Technologies in 2014, at an estimated price of $500 million. 
With approximately 75 DeepMind employees at the time of the deal, the price tag was nearly 
$7 million per employee. This is in line with other estimates by experts, who say that “aqui-
hires” of cutting-edge AI startups cost around $5 million to $10 million.66 

Deploying automation technologies also incurs costs. For physical technologies, these 
are real capital expenditures. Industrial robots cost from tens of thousands to millions of 
dollars. Replacing an ordinary heavy truck with a self-driving truck requires an expenditure 
of capital. And the self-driving truck will likely be more expensive than the truck it replaces, at 
least when the technology is first released. 

These deployment costs are lower for software-based solutions, especially when 
delivered remotely through the cloud, and where the software is sold as a service, thereby 
turning capital expenditure into operating expenditure. But “the cloud” has a real physical 
instantiation as data centers and networks, and they in turn represent costs. Moreover, 
deployment of a software (or hardware) solution can almost never be done without 
significant implementation services, such as the costs of customizing the software for an 
individual organization, changing the processes within an organization, and training staff. 
For enterprise software, the associated implementation services often cost several times 
the costs of the software itself. All these costs affect the business cases for where and when 
automation is adopted.

Labor market dynamics 
The labor costs associated with work activities that could potentially be automated are 
another factor that will affect the pace and extent of automation. These costs are affected by 
the complex dynamics of labor markets. 

Even for the same activity, for example, entering data into a financial system, there is a wide 
range of wages paid, across different positions—from accounting clerks to chief financial 
officers—and in different companies, for example a small, family-owned business compared 
with a Global 50 corporation. Wage rates also vary by geography. 

Labor supply is determined by demographics, with the share of the working-age population 
potentially declining in many countries in coming decades. But it also varies in terms of 
skills, which are affected both by intrinsic talents of individual human beings, as well as by 
education and training that people receive. People can learn new skills but it takes time and 
money (see Box 3, “Technological change and skills”) 

Labor markets are dynamic systems. Supply, demand, and wages all vary over time. If 
automation frees up human capital, then supply will increase, which could be redeployed 
into other positions if the demand exists. But there could be a skills mismatch, which 
will require time and training, delaying redeployment. There could also be information 
asymmetries, which digital labor markets could help address.67

& Company, 2014.

Economists who study the impact of technological 
innovation on the workforce have noted varying effects 
on workers at different skill levels, depending on the time 
period.1 In the 19th century, for example, technological 
changes raised the productivity of lower-skill workers and 
created new opportunities for them, at times replacing 
the craftsmanship of higher-skill artisans. This so-called 
unskill-biased technical change reduced the value 
of some high-skill workers even as it boosted lower-
skill ones. 

With the advent of information technology and the 
internet, the reverse has happened: the productivity of 
higher-skill workers, especially those engaged in abstract 
thinking, or with creative and problem-solving skills, 
has increased, while the relative demand for lower-
skill workers has not. This phenomenon of skill-biased 
technical change is manifested in a number of ways. In 
advanced economies, median income households have 

been receiving a lower share of the total wage share of 
GDP, in part because demand for less-skilled workers 
has dropped, even as demand for high-skill labor has 
risen.2 In 1981, college-educated workers in the United 
States earned a 48 percent wage premium over high 
school graduates. By 2005, that premium had risen 
to 97 percent—in other words, an American college 
graduate earns almost twice as much as a high school 
graduate.3 

What will the spread of automation mean for workers at 
different skill levels? Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee 
discuss a new shift to “talent-biased technical change” 
which has created very high demand for superstars such 
as experts in artificial intelligence or data scientists.4 Our 
analysis suggests that all workers at all skill levels have 
the potential to be affected at least partially by automation 
based on currently demonstrated technologies. 



68 McKinsey Global Institute 4. Factors affecting the pace and extent of automation 

Demand is also not static. New types of work activities and jobs are created all the time, 
even as new technologies come on the market. Bank tellers and ATMs are one example. 
ATMs were first installed in the United States and other developed economies in the 1970s, 
and from the mid-1990s, banks rapidly increased their use of ATMs. Contrary to some 
expectations, their advent actually increased the demand for human tellers, for two reasons. 
First, ATMs reduced the cost of operating a bank branch, and banks responded by opening 
more branches. Fewer tellers were needed in each branch, but more branches meant 
that teller jobs did not disappear. Second, the tasks that ATMs could not do—in particular, 
developing relationships with clients such as small businesses—became more valuable. For 
tellers, the nature of their activities changed, with cash handling becoming less important 
and human interaction more important.68 

The relative costs of labor vs. automation will affect the pace and extent of adoption. If 
workers are in abundant supply and significantly less expensive than automation, this could 
be a decisive argument against it. For example, food service is one activity with a high 
automation potential based on adapting currently available technologies. However, current 
wage rates for this activity are among the lowest in the United States, reflecting both the 
skills required and the size of the available labor supply. Since restaurant employees who 
cook earn an average of about $10 per hour, a business case based solely on reducing 
labor costs may be unconvincing. 

Economic benefits 
The potential economic benefits from automation are not limited to labor cost reductions. 
As we noted in the case studies in Chapter 3, performance gains include increased profit, 
increased throughput and productivity, improved safety, and higher quality, which are harder 
to quantify than labor costs but no less tangible. In our hypothetical look at automation 
of an oil and gas control room, for example, performance gains accounted for more than 
three-quarters of the total benefits. There are also indirect benefits, such as wage growth, 
and automation’s potential to create business and economic incentives that drive corporate 
decision making, and unleash entrepreneurial energy. Automation could also spur policy 
makers. However, these indirect benefits will have to be netted out against indirect costs 
caused by automation, such as those associated with labor displacement 

Regulatory and social acceptance 
Automation faces some significant regulatory and social barriers to implementation. They 
include safety and liability issues. One accident could trigger stringent regulations. Artificial 
intelligence used in military robots or autonomous vehicles may have to make judgments 
that harm people, creating moral controversy. Technology makers could also be exposed to 
legal product liability if robots malfunction. 

Privacy is also a potential barrier, especially in areas where personal data is highly sensitive, 
such as health care; already, health care IT can struggle to link together different data sets 
due to mandatory anonymization of data. 

From a social perspective, too, automation will need to overcome some barriers. If many 
workers lose jobs and are unable to find new ones, the social and political pressures against 
automation could become significant. Humans may not want to adopt new technologies or 
work with automated products due to fears about job security. 

Finally, personal preferences and discomfort with technologies could prevent automation in 
settings where human relationships are important, such as for caregivers.

MODELING SCENARIOS FOR POTENTIAL PACE AND EXTENT OF ADOPTION 
To analyze a range of potential scenarios for the pace at which automation could affect 
activities across the global economy, we constructed a model that synthesizes the effects 
of these five factors into four timing stages. We estimate when automation technologies will 
reach each level of performance across 18 capabilities, the time required to integrate these 
capabilities into solutions tailored for specific activities, when economic feasibility makes 
automation attractive, and the time required for adoption and deployment (Exhibit 14). 
We modeled scenarios incorporating these stages for each individual activity in every 
occupation for all sectors across 46 countries that account for about 80 percent of the 
world’s workforce. 

Exhibit 14

SOURCE: McKinsey Global Institute analysis 

NOTE: Economic benefits affect both when adoption will begin and its pace. For determining economic feasibility, we assume that decision-makers discount the 
uncertain benefits of initial labor cost savings by roughly the same amount as they believe the also uncertain non-labor cost-related benefits will be captured.

70 McKinsey Global Institute 4. Factors affecting the pace and extent of automation 

The scenarios we have modeled create a time range for the potential pace of automating 
current work activities. We have created two theoretical bookends, an “earliest” scenario, 
in which all of the modeling parameters are flexed to the extremes of the set of plausible 
assumptions that would result in faster automation development and adoption, and a 
“latest” scenario, in which we flex all of the parameters in the opposite direction. The reality 
will likely fall somewhere between the two. Modeling all of these factors, the date at which 
50 percent of the world’s current work activities are automated could be around 2055, but 
we posit possible scenarios where that level of adoption occurs up to almost 20 years earlier 
or later. (Exhibit 15). 

We stress that we are not making specific point predictions; we use scenarios to describe 
the envelope of potential outcomes, and we fully acknowledge the simplification that comes 
with any modeling exercise. For example, we do not account for all of the dynamics of the 
labor market described above, including whether wages for specific occupations would 
decline because displaced workers would increase labor supply. 

The model is likely to be precisely wrong but we hope it is directionally right with regard 
to overall findings. Occupations within sectors with high automation potential today, jobs 
that involve types of activities that we categorize as easiest to automate, such as physical 
activities in a predictable environment or data collection and processing, will most likely 
be among the first to feel the impact of automation. From a geographical perspective, 
advanced economies are likely to deploy automation ahead of many emerging economies, 
because of higher wage levels, which make a stronger business case for deployment, as 
well as the nature of the solutions that will be needed to integrate the technologies into 
the workplace.

Furthermore, while the macro effects on a nation’s entire economy may be quite slow (we 
model the adoption of automation across several decades), the micro impact on particular 
work activities, in certain sectors, and in individual countries, could be quite fast, as 
competitive pressures come together with advances in technological development. That 
is, for an individual worker who is displaced by automation, or a company whose industry is 
disrupted by competitors using automation to shift the basis of competition, these effects 
could occur quickly indeed. 

DEVELOPING AUTOMATION CAPABILITIES IS A KEY INITIAL DETERMINANT OF 
ADOPTION TIMELINES 
The deployment of automation in the workplace can begin only when machines have 
the capabilities required to carry out particular work activities. Technological innovation 
must first deliver the technical capability before a workplace solution can be developed 
and deployed. 

In Chapter 2, we outlined 18 performance capabilities required to carry out the range of 
work activities and the current state of the technology for those capabilities as measured 
against human performance. Along with our assessment of the current state, we developed 
progression scenarios for each of these capabilities. We did so through surveys of academic 
and industry experts and through an extrapolation of metrics including recent commercial 
successes and the historical trajectory of the capabilities, along with a range of other 
predictors. Details of our methodology can be found in the technical appendix. 

While machines can already match median human performance or even exceed the 
top levels of human performance in some of the 18 capabilities, such as, for example, 
information retrieval, gross motor skills, and optimization and planning, many other 
capabilities require more technological development, for example to raise natural language 
understanding and logical reasoning to a median human level. 

Scenarios for achieving higher levels of performance capabilities 
Exhibit 16 shows a potential range of time frames for technology to attain the next level of 
performance for each capability. From a technical standpoint, some of these performance 
capabilities are quite far advanced, and developing top-quartile human performance may be 
relatively fast, although there are some significant variations among the different capabilities. 

  Sensory perception is already at median human performance. A robot “tongue” can 
already detect the color index and alcohol content of beer with more than 80 percent 
accuracy, for example.69 For tactile perception, which can already exceed top-quartile 
human performance for several dimensions, key challenges include miniaturizing the size 
of hardware and adapting the sensors to function in different environments.70 

  Cognitive capabilities are considerably more varied in their performance compared 
to humans. Information retrieval, optimization and planning, and recognizing known 
patterns and categories have already reached the top quartile of human performance, 
whereas generating novel patterns, creativity, coordination with multiple agents, and 
logical reasoning and problem solving are still at a relatively early stage. In terms of 
coordinating with multiple agents, robots already have demonstrated the ability to 
coordinate with similar types of robots.71 Their ability to collaborate with humans is still at 
an early stage. Automated creativity is perhaps the furthest away; computer creativity for 
now requires human involvement to judge the quality of work or to provide direction.

  Social and emotional capabilities for now are below median human performance levels. 
Despite advances in artificial intelligence, machines still have difficulty identifying social 
and emotional states (sensing), drawing accurate conclusions about them (reasoning), 
and responding with emotionally appropriate words or movements to them (output). 

  Physical capabilities are already at top-quartile human performance for gross motor 
skills and navigation, which has enabled wide deployment of robots in industrial 
automation, military, and defense—and given consumers turn-by-turn navigation apps 
for their smartphones. For fine motor skills, we estimate that top-quartile performance 
could be achieved when robotic hands have the same degrees of freedom as human 
hands. Mobility remains a challenge, especially vertical mobility such as climbing stairs 
and ladders.

Natural language capabilities are critical for automation across many activities 
Natural language understanding is of critical importance for a wide range of applications in 
the workplace. Despite some technical advances in this capability, including the accuracy 
of machine translation, machines still have a long way to go to achieve median human 
performance. The speed of technological advances in natural language capabilities in the 
future will substantially affect the timelines for automation overall. 

The development of higher levels of natural language understanding is the single most 
important factor constraining the technical automation potential of activities for which 
the current performance level of technologies is insufficient. In the earliest scenario for 
automation, the current level of performance in natural language constrains the proportion 
of all activities that can be automated by 18 percent. In the latest scenario, the current level 
of natural language understanding would hinder automation of 40 percent of activities, since 
other capabilities will have reached their required performance levels by then. 

Natural language processing capabilities have advanced in recent years and will likely 
continue to develop and improve, led by their use in auto (in-vehicle speech recognition), 
health care (clinical documentation improvements), and general personal use (virtual 
assistants in both mobile and fixed devices). Technology companies and venture capitalists 
continue to invest heavily in technologies related to natural language processing. Algorithms 
can write passages and new articles that are largely indistinguishable from those written by 
humans, and many experts expect continued rapid technical advances; by 2018, according 
to one prediction, machines could write as much as 20 percent of all business content.72 

HISTORICAL TIME FRAMES FOR DEVELOPING SOLUTIONS THAT INTEGRATE 
MULTIPLE CAPABILITIES 
Many of the 18 performance capabilities in our framework operate together. To arrange 
tables or dining areas as well as a human waiter, for example, machines will need some 
capacity for natural language understanding and generation, an ability to recognize known 
patterns, retrieve information, coordinate with multiple agents, and navigate. Furthermore, 
machines will need optimization and planning capabilities, fine motor skills, gross motor 
skills, and mobility. Developing solutions for this type of multi-capability activity requires time 
and technology. 

To develop scenarios for the times required for solution development, we looked at historical 
precedents, examining almost 100 existing automation solutions that use hardware or 
software or both. We collected details of the development time and the technical capabilities 
that were integrated, recording the number of years from the initial research to the product 
launch, and identifying as many as three of the most relevant capabilities out of our 18 
that were used. For example, Viv, an artificial intelligence technology that aspires to be 
the “intelligent interface for everything,” combines logical problem solving with natural 
language understanding and generation, and took four years to integrate.73 PillPick, a 
pharmacy automation system that helps hospitals eliminate the risk for medication errors 
during packaging and dispensing, combines fine motor skills with sensory perception, and 
took two years to develop.74 For each activity for which a solution needs to be developed, 
we used the 25th and 75th percentile time frames for the capabilities whose historical 
development times at those points were longest. For more details of our methodology, see 
the technical appendix.

74 McKinsey Global Institute 4. Factors affecting the pace and extent of automation 

On average, we found that solution development takes one year for our earliest scenario 
and nine years for the latest. Some of the longest time frames were for social and emotional 
capabilities, whereas a number of the cognitive capabilities can be integrated much more 
rapidly (Exhibit 17). 

MODELING THE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF AUTOMATION 
Our model assumes that the adoption of automation will begin after it becomes 
economically feasible—that is, when the economic benefits exceed the costs. These 
benefits include not only labor cost reductions, but also other performance improvements 
such as higher throughput or improved quality, as discussed earlier in this chapter. However, 
particularly early in the adoption cycle, the certainty that these benefits can be captured 
will be lower until they are demonstrated at scale. Thus, for the purposes of modeling, we 
assume that adoption begins when the cost of automating a particular activity (for a specific 
occupation in a country) is at parity for the cost of human labor for the same activity. To be 
fair, the certainty that labor cost savings can be completely captured will also be somewhat 
lower early in the adoption cycle. On a net basis, our model assumes that decision-

makers discount the benefits of initial labor cost savings by roughly the same amount as 
they believe the also uncertain non-labor cost-related benefits will be captured. In our 
experience, business leaders tend to view labor cost savings as being more predictable 
than other benefits. 

Moreover, as we will discuss in the section on the international impact of automation, the 
overall lower level of wages in some emerging economies could mean that automation 
proceeds more slowly there than in advanced economies, where wages are higher than the 
global average. The cost of labor is not necessarily fixed, however. The related labor supply 
and demand dynamics are also a factor in the timeline for automation, as discussed above, 
but we do not model these dynamics. 

ADOPTION OF AUTOMATION TECHNOLOGIES AFTER COMMERCIAL 
AVAILABILITY CAN TAKE YEARS 
Even when a solution to automate an activity is commercially available, and implementing 
the solution makes rational economic sense, adoption still takes time—and can be very 
costly. Full adoption across an entire sector of any technology, particularly those that are 
integrated into the workplace, takes years. Individual decision makers must become aware 
of the potential, and there is always a spectrum of willingness to adopt, a phenomenon 
well documented in the research studying the diffusion of innovations.75 Capital has to be 
deployed, technology acquired and installed, and processes transformed, within or across 
enterprises. Often, regulations need to change, and individual workers and employees have 
to become accustomed to the new technologies and processes. 

From a review of the historical rate of adoption of previous technologies, the time from 
commercial availability to 90 percent adoption ranges from approximately eight to 28 years 
(for 50 percent adoption, the range is between about five and 16 years). This lag applies 
not only to hardware-based technologies that are capital-intensive and require physical 
installation; even technologies that are made available purely online take years to be 
adopted. A fast-growing consumer service such as Facebook began in 2004, and as of 
this writing, has not yet reached full adoption, even of non-China internet users (see Box 4, 
“Adoption of hardware vs. software/cloud-based technologies”). Furthermore, that decade 
of adoption does not even take into account previous instances of social networking 
services. Automation technologies that would be incorporated into the workplace require 
even more user and process changes than a consumer service that individuals can 
adopt independently. 

To create scenarios for the rate of automation adoption, we analyzed adoption rates of 25 
previous technologies to establish a range of timelines. We incorporated these historical 
examples into classic S-shaped adoption curves. (Exhibit 18).76 We analyzed both 
hardware and software/online technologies, and we divided them into groups representing 
technologies with the fastest and the slowest adoption. Technologies with the fastest 
adoption rates include stents, airbags, MRIs, TVs, and online air booking. The slower 
adoption category include cellphones, personal computers, dishwashers, and pacemakers.

76 S-shaped adoption curves were studied for consumer technologies by Frank Bass, “Comments on ‘A 

new product growth model for consumer durables,’” Management Science, volume 50, number 12, 
December 2004. 



76 McKinsey Global Institute 4. Factors affecting the pace and extent of automation 

Box 4. Adoption of hardware vs. software/cloud-based technologies 
Hardware-based automation technologies, such as robots and self-driving 
vehicles, have requirements that can lengthen the time of adoption, that is, 
substantial capital requirements and the need to physically produce and 
deploy these technologies. 

These requirements are much lower for software-based technologies, 
particularly those that are deployed through cloud technologies, that is, 
where the bulk of the computing occurs at centralized data centers that are 
accessed through networks. For these technologies, customers often pay for 
these services on an on-demand basis, reducing the need for the customer 
to deploy capital expenditure or manage for peaks in capacity (the cloud 
provider takes on these tasks). In general, the marginal cost of producing one 
more instance of a piece of software tends toward zero. And there are several 
cases of specific pieces of consumer applications, particularly those that have 
“gone viral,” whose adoption seems to have been extraordinarily fast, such as 
Pokemon Go. 

Does this mean that we should expect the adoption of software/cloud-based 
automation technologies to be much faster than for other technologies? 
In examining the historical record, we find that the adoption of software-
based technologies falls within the envelope of the adoption rates of other 
technologies, that is, ranging from eight to 28 years to reach close to full 
adoption. In particular, for technologies that will be implemented in the 
workplace, the technical deployment of the technology represents only a 
fraction of the time and cost necessary to embed the technology into the 
processes and practices of an enterprise. We examined the adoption of 
cloud-based versions of enterprise resource planning (ERP), supply chain 
management (SCM), and customer relationship management (CRM). While 
these technologies have not yet reached a plateau in adoption, their adoption 
curves all fall within the range of adoption of other technologies. For instance, 
cloud CRM was first offered by Salesforce in 1999, and adoption of that 
technology still continues to grow. 

Even for consumer online technologies, for which the bureaucracy of an 
enterprise is not a barrier to adoption, the behavior changes necessary for 
adoption take time to proliferate, particularly when these technologies are 
appropriately viewed by category, rather than a specific service (for example, 
Pokemon Go was not the first mobile game, and has not yet come close to full 
adoption). Take consumer social networking as another example. Facebook, 
only one example of a social networking platform, and not the first, was 
launched in 2004, and over a decade later, adoption continues to grow, both of 
that platform and other social networking platforms. Peer-to-peer (P2P) mobile 
payments is another consumer technology whose adoption rate falls within the 
envelope of other technologies. 



77McKinsey Global Institute A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity

The adoption of technologies within enterprises include factors beyond those that underpin 
consumer adoption. For example, the technology adoption literature discusses rank effects 
(that is, how the different individual characteristics of firms, such as their size, can affect 
the rate and extent to which they adopt new technologies) and the effects of competitive 
dynamics (that is, how the adoption of new technology by one company in an industry 
could influence the adoption of technology by other companies in that industry).77 We do 
not model firm-level adoption dynamics; our model takes advantage of the fact that at a 
high level for economies and industries, the net result of the enterprise adoption factors are 
S-shaped curves that resemble those for consumer adoption.

This combination of technical feasibility, solution development, economic feasibility, and 
adoption enables us to model a set of scenarios that encompass various time frames for 
the pace of automation. To illustrate, we detail a specific example, driving heavy trucks (see 
Box 5, “Driving heavy trucks: Modeling scenarios for adoption of automation”). 

Adoption will ultimately depend on several factors include overcoming possible policy 
barriers and resistance to automation, which are meant to be captured in scenarios in the 
adoption stage of the model. For instance, given the importance of technological advances, 
intellectual property or regulatory issues could delay certain companies from being able to 
deploy specific technologies.

Bureau of Labor Statistics taxonomy.

3 Taxonomy and definitions for terms related to driving automation systems for on-road motor 

vehicles, Society of Automotive Engineers, September 30, 2016.

To illustrate how we model scenarios for the pace and extent of automation, 
let us consider the single but widely performed work activity of driving, for one 
common occupation: heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers.1 This occupation 
is a significant source of employment, with more than 20 million workers 
worldwide, of whom 3.2 million are in India, 2.9 million are in China, 1.6 million 
are in the United States, and one million are in Japan.2 

From a purely technical standpoint, the technologies to automate the 
required capabilities for this activity already exist. Some of the 18 individual 
performance capabilities we use in our framework are not required for this 
activity, including the three social and emotional capabilities, but for other 
capabilities, existing technology has demonstrated the necessary constituent 
performance levels to potentially enable driving. However, in order to automate 
the activity of driving (“Level 4” autonomy as classified by the Society of 
Automotive Engineers), these individual capabilities must be integrated into a 
solution, in other words the hardware and software that would constitute an 
autonomous driving truck must still be engineered.3 Based on the historical 
time frames required to create solutions that involve the capabilities necessary 
to automate this activity, we estimate the time required to engineer such a 
solution could take more than seven years, which we use as basis for our latest 
adoption scenario. Conversely, because existing automation technology has 
met the levels of performance required across all of the necessary capabilities, 
and we do not know how far along pre-existing engineering efforts might be, 
our model also accepts the possibility that an organization could announce 
a Level 4 autonomous truck immediately, which we use as the basis for our 
earliest adoption scenario. 

Then comes the question of economic feasibility. In our model, adoption 
begins when the cost of automation reaches parity with the cost of human 
labor, for an individual occupation within a specific market (which we model 
at the level of countries). Of course, there are other economic benefits which 
could contribute to the business case for automation. In the case of driving 
heavy trucks, for example, these could include higher fuel efficiency, improved 
safety, increased asset utilization, and so on. However, particularly early in the 
adoption cycle, the certainty that these benefits can be captured will be lower 
until they are demonstrated at scale. To be fair, the certainty that labor cost 
savings can be completely captured will also be somewhat lower early in the 
adoption cycle. On a net basis, our model essentially assumes that decision-
makers discount the benefits of initial labor cost savings, because of initial 
uncertainty, by roughly the same amount as they believe the also uncertain 
non-labor cost-related benefits will be captured. 



79McKinsey Global Institute A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity

4 There could be a potential retrofit opportunity for more recent vehicles with electronic control systems, and 
perhaps the number of autonomous trucks necessary to meet current demands could be lower than the 
current number of trucks because of higher utilization. However, the basic point remains, that adoption will 
take years and large amounts of capital to reach its maximum level.

Box 5. Driving heavy trucks: Modeling scenarios for adoption  
of automation (continued)
Using these assumptions, the time at which we model adoption beginning 
is sensitive to the cost of labor in different markets. For our example, we 
compare the United States with China (Exhibit 19). Total wages paid to heavy 
and tractor-trailer truck drivers exceed $328 billion worldwide, of which almost 
$60 billion is paid in the United States, and more than $33 billion is paid in 
China. Because of the significantly higher level of wages in the United States, 
automation is modeled to become economically feasible faster there. Under 
our scenarios, the cost of the automation could be below US wage levels 
within three to ten years after Level 4 autonomy is available, whereas in China it 
could take 10 to 16 years. 

Finally, once automation becomes economically feasible, adoption can still 
be a long process, even when the business case is compelling. In this case, 
there are approximately two million tractor-trailers in the United States, each 
of which is typically on the road for about 20 years, and cost about $160,000 
apiece. Replacing the current fleet would cost $320 billion, not including the 
additional technology for autonomous driving (whose cost we do model as 
declining over time), and would be certain to take many years.

80 McKinsey Global Institute 4. Factors affecting the pace and extent of automation 

MODELING THE PACE AND EXTENT OF AUTOMATION ACROSS ACTIVITIES 
AND SECTORS 
Each of the four stages affects the overall pace of automation reflected in the model. 
Technical feasibility accounts for much of the variance in our modeled scenarios, but 
economic feasibility is also a significant factor, especially in the earliest scenario, where our 
modeling suggests it could hold up adoption and deployment for eight to nine years for 
some activities (Exhibit 20). 

Several of the 18 performance capabilities are potential bottlenecks in the model. The 
types of activities that today have among the lowest potential for automation, such as 
managing and developing people, applying expertise and experience, and interfacing 
with stakeholders, will all require substantial further advances in social and emotional 
capabilities, as well as in natural language understanding and creativity. These activities 
typically require at least a median-level human performance in social and emotional 
capabilities, for example. As we have seen, these capabilities are particularly difficult 
to develop, and most related technologies are in nascent stages and may take several 
decades to mature. This potentially could delay the development, integration, and 
deployment of automation as a whole. 

Along with timelines for capability development, whether hardware or just software is 
required is also a key determinant of scenarios in the model, because this will affect the 
economic viability of automation. Hardware requires significant capital spending, and thus 
we model with relatively higher initial costs. For example, sensory perception capabilities 
need cameras and sensors. Mobility requires wheels or other hardware that enable 
machines to move. Software solutions, by comparison, are relatively less expensive to 
deploy and thus we model with relatively lower costs compared to hardware solutions. 
Some 98 percent of the solutions for predictable physical activities are hardware ones, 
whereas hardware represents only about 30 percent of processing data solutions. 

This hardware-software distinction helps explain differences in the pace of automation 
adoption across different types of activities. For example, under our earliest scenario, the 
model suggests that unpredictable physical labor activities—which require substantial 
hardware for successful automation—will have much slower adoption rates than for 
activities that consist of processing data, which primarily require software solutions. 

As we will detail in our discussion of country differences below, the modeled time frame 
for physical activities is longer in emerging economies largely because of lower wages 
compared to the cost of hardware-based automation solutions.

GLOBAL TIMELINES: MODELING ADOPTION OF AUTOMATION BY COUNTRY 
Automation will be a global force that affects all countries, whether they are emerging 
economies or advanced ones. In the earliest scenario we modeled, automation could 
account for more than 50 percent of working hours in two-thirds of countries within just 
20 years, by 2036. In the latest scenario we modeled, more than half of all countries will have 
50 percent automation or more within 50 years, by 2066 (Exhibit 21). 

In the early years of automation adoption, our model shows the impact being felt most 
strongly in a few advanced economies, especially Germany, Japan, and the United States. 
These countries have both high wages and major industries that already have a high 
potential for automation based on existing technologies. As automation is adopted in more 
countries around the world, the impact will become especially pronounced in China and 
India, because of their large workforce. Initially, our model shows automation affecting 
workers there in manufacturing and retailing because of their high automation potential, but 
in the longer term its largest impact will be in agriculture, which is where hundreds of millions 
of Chinese and Indians earn their livelihood.

Adoption of automation could be faster initially in advanced economies than emerging 
ones because of wage levels and integration solution costs. Higher wages in advanced 
economies and hardware costs will likely make automation economically viable faster 
there than in emerging economies. In Japan, the United States, and Europe’s five largest 
economies—France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom—this is likely to mean 
earlier adoption in a range of sectors, especially manufacturing and services. In the United 
States, for example, our model shows manufacturing, retail, health care, transportation, 
accommodation and food services, and administrative services to be among the first 
sectors affected. In terms of the impact on workers, sectors that are large employers, 
such as health care, will be affected even though their expected automation adoption rate 
(48 percent) is lower than some other high-adoption sectors such as accommodation and 
food services (83 percent) in 2036 under earliest scenario. 

Initially, technologies with physical capabilities are the most likely to become available, and 
will be increasingly adopted in sectors such as manufacturing and retail. As adoption in 
these sectors approaches 100 percent, their contribution to overall adoption rates will hit 
a plateau. Once the technology to replicate cognitive and natural language understanding 
capabilities has been mastered, services sectors globally will be affected, and the pace 
and extent  of overall automation will pick up, especially in advanced economies with large 
service sectors. 

For all advanced economies, the business case for automating will become stronger as 
solutions for technology integration in the workplace become cheaper. Exhibit 22 shows the 
estimated wages corresponding to automation adoption by country. 

In China, India, and other emerging economies, cost and relative lower wage levels will 
likely delay adoption. Manufacturing relies heavily on predictable physical activities, and 
automating them will require hardware solutions that require considerable up-front capital 
investment. This may not be economical in emerging economies, given the lower cost of 
labor there, until the cost of the solutions drops sharply. 

Emerging economies could achieve a pace of automation similar to that of advanced 
economies if solutions become cheaper, possibly through localized innovation. Adoption 
could also be accelerated as a result of policy measures, increased competition, a lack of 
legacy systems that could be a brake on automation implementation, and a high degree of 
technological literacy. 

In sectors where software solutions to integrate automation technologies will be required, 
the pace of automation across emerging and advanced economies could be similar. For 
example, we model similar rates of automation adoption in the finance and insurance 
sectors—which are characterized by a high proportion of data processing and collection—in 
both the United States and China. Software, which has a relatively minimal marginal cost, 
accounts for just over half the technology integration solutions needed in this sector, and 
the global disparity in wages is not as pronounced in some areas. For example, architects 
or investment bankers in emerging economies are relatively well paid. Moreover, wage 
distribution globally is fairly similar for real estate, rental and leasing activities, health care, 
and social assistance.

The largest impact on workers could be felt in labor-intensive sectors in China 
and India, whereas in other countries it will be felt across multiple sectors 
In analyzing the potential impact of automation on workers, we make a number of 
assumptions. We calculate the impact based on the current number of full-time equivalents 
in each sector and do not take into account any possible growth in their numbers per sector 
or the movement of labor from one sector to another. We also assume that the technologies 
we identify will emerge throughout the world and that they will be adopted only when they 
become economically feasible. 

China and India both have very large farming sectors, with about 230 million people out 
of a working population of 450 million in India alone working in agriculture. In China, more 
than 200 million work on the land out of a total workforce exceeding 770 million. Given the 
employment size of this sector, even a relatively low rate of automation adoption of about 
10 percent could have significant employment consequences in both countries. 

In both China and India, the impact of automation on employment could also be felt in the 
retail and manufacturing sectors, as both have a relatively high potential for automation and 
a sizable labor force. In the five major European countries, Japan, and the United States, the 
employment impact will likely be spread across multiple sectors, especially in the event that 
large-scale automation begins relatively soon. A detailed view of our model of automation 
impact on individual countries is available via an interactive graphic online.78 

•••

Automation technologies will be increasingly adopted in every industry, every sector, 
and every country in the world, but there is considerable uncertainty about the speed 
and intensity with which they will arrive. These will depend on several key variables, both 
technical and economic. Machines will need to be able to simulate the full range of human 
performance capabilities, and solutions to integrate the technology into the workplace will 
need to be adopted. Only when costs have fallen below wage levels will automation become 
economically viable, and ultimately adopted. All of this could happen within two decades 
for a wide range of activities and sectors, but it could also take much longer. Whatever the 
time frame, the consequences will be significant not just for individual workers and sectors 
but also for the global economy as a whole. In the next chapter we look at how automation 
could upend some cherished notions about productivity, growth, and development.

86 McKinsey Global Institute 4. Factors affecting the pace and extent of automation 

© Laboratory/Alamy Stock Photo



The world is in need of a new engine of GDP growth. Shifting demographics in many 
countries brought on by aging populations and declining birthrates are reducing the share 
of working-age populations and creating an economic growth gap: in the not-so-distant 
future, without an acceleration in productivity growth, there will not be enough workers for 
countries to meet their aspirations for growth in GDP per capita. 

In this context, automation could be a significant opportunity. Our estimates suggest it could 
help serve as a new productivity engine for the global economy, bridging that economic 
growth gap. Automation could raise global productivity by as much as 0.8 to 1.4 percent 
annually. While that will not be enough to ensure all countries meet their per capita GDP 
growth aspirations, it will make a major contribution toward that goal. 

In order for this growth to take place, people will need to keep working—alongside the 
robots that will help provide the productivity boost. Even with automation, a deficit of labor 
is more likely than a surplus. Yet the adoption of automation will change the nature of work, 
and the public debate about it often focuses on the prospect that it could lead to very 
large-scale unemployment. Such fears are not new: already back in 1966, a US government 
commission noted concerns that technological change “would in the future not only cause 
increasing unemployment, but that eventually it would eliminate all but a few jobs, with the 
major portion of what we now call work being performed automatically by machine.”79 

In fact, the large-scale shifts in employment that automation will enable are of a similar 
order of magnitude to the long-term technology-enabled shift in the developed countries’ 
workforces away from agriculture in the 20th century. That movement did not result in 
long-term mass unemployment because it was accompanied by the creation of new 
types of work not foreseen at the time. We cannot definitively say whether things will be 
different this time. But our analysis does show that automation will fundamentally alter the 
workplace, requiring all workers to cohabit extensively with technology and reshaping the 
corporate landscape. 

THE PRODUCTIVITY BOOST FROM AUTOMATION COULD BRIDGE A LOOMING 
ECONOMIC GROWTH GAP 
GDP growth was exceptionally brisk over the past half century, driven by the twin engines 
of employment growth and rising productivity. However, declining birthrates and the 
trend toward aging in many advanced and some emerging economies mean that peak 
employment will occur in most countries within 50 years. The workforce in Japan is already 
shrinking in size, and the total number of workers in China will start to decline within a 
decade. This expected decline in the share of working-age population will place the onus 
for future economic growth far more heavily on productivity gains. Employment growth of 
1.7 percent annually between 1964 and 2014 in the G19 countries and Nigeria is set to fall to 
just 0.3 percent per year.80 

79 Technology and the American economy, Report of the National Commission on Technology, Automation and 
Economic Progress, US Department of Health, Education and Welfare, February 1966.

80 The global productivity challenge created by waning employment growth is detailed in our report Global 
growth: Can productivity save the day in an aging world? McKinsey Global Institute, January 2015. The 
G19 countries are the G20 minus the European Union: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, 
Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the 
United Kingdom, and the United States. Including Nigeria, these 20 countries generate more than 80 percent 
of global GDP.

5. AN ENGINE OF PRODUCTIVITY 



88 McKinsey Global Institute 5. An engine of productivity 

Prior MGI research has shown that even if productivity growth maintains its 1.8 percent 
annual rate of the past half century, the rate of GDP growth will fall by as much as 40 percent 
over the next 50 years. On a per capita basis, the GDP growth decline is about 19 percent 
(Exhibit 23). In order to compensate for slower employment growth, productivity would need 
to grow at a rate of 3.3 percent annually, or 80 percent faster than it has grown over the past 
half century.81 

The size of the workforce over the next 50 years is too small to maintain current 
per capita GDP growth without accelerating productivity growth 
An economic growth gap has opened up as a result of the shrinking workforce. The number 
of full-time equivalents needed just to maintain the current GDP per capita over the next 
50 years is larger than the number of workers who will be available, given demographic 
trends in most countries. We estimate this gap in economic output as being about 
130 million full-time equivalents (FTEs) for the G19 countries and Nigeria alone. (In other 
words, the economic output equivalent to an additional 130 million full-time workers would 
be needed to maintain current GDP per capita, assuming no productivity gains.) If countries 
are to achieve more ambitious longer-term growth in line in line with their development and 

81 Global growth: Can productivity save the day in an aging world? McKinsey Global Institute, January 2015. 
Our estimate of employment growth’s contribution to GDP growth in this report differs slightly from this earlier 
research, as we have assumed productivity measured in each country, rather than a global average.

the aspirations of their citizens goals (that is, growth in GDP per capita), the gap would be 
considerably larger—the economic output of about 6.7 billion FTEs by 2065 (Exhibit 24). 

For the purposes of our analysis, we based our country-level GDP projections on 
McKinsey’s proprietary Global Growth Model. This model projects a global GDP growth 
rate of 2.9 percent, resulting in an annual productivity growth of 2.8 percent. For advanced 
economies overall, the projections in the McKinsey model result in a compound annual 
growth of GDP per capita to 2030 of 1.4 percent, and 3.4 percent for emerging economies.

For the G19 countries and Nigeria that we discuss in this report, the model projects GDP 
growth of 2.7 percent, resulting in GDP per capita growth of 2 percent to 2030.82 

The growth gap between the projected growth and growth that must be provided by 
productivity increases is most pronounced in fast-growing countries such as China, India, 
Indonesia, and Nigeria, but it is also prevalent in Germany and Japan and other countries 
that are already experiencing a slowdown or decline in the working-age population. 
Furthermore, productivity growth has slowed in many countries.83 

Exhibit 25 illustrates the need for continued productivity growth, even just to maintain GDP 
per capita (an admittedly unsatisfactory outcome) in both the medium term (by 2030) and 
in the long term (by 2065) for the 20 largest economies in the world. Without productivity 
growth, aging countries with older demographics simply would not have enough workers 
needed to maintain GDP per capita. Younger countries have more than enough workers to 
maintain GDP per capita. 

Automation can help bridge the projected growth gap by compensating for the 
slowdown in workforce growth 
Our analysis of the automation adoption scenarios suggests that automation could help 
bridge the projected growth gap caused by a deficit of full-time equivalents worldwide. 
Automation alone will not be sufficient to achieve long-term target growth across the world, 
given the decline in the working-age population and the need for high productivity to achieve 
that target. Especially in fast-growing countries, other measures to boost productivity will be 
needed. However, notably, the productivity gains from automation could suffice to at least 
maintain today’s GDP per capita. 

Our methodology takes into account only labor substitution gains. Other performance 
gains—in the form of improved quality, fewer breakdowns, greater safety, and so on—would 
come on top of this overall productivity boost. We also assume that human labor displaced 
by automation would rejoin the workforce and be as productive as it was in 2014, that is, 
new demand for labor will be created. In some ways, this is a conservative assumption, 
given that if automation produces productivity gains, we assume displaced labor reenters 
the workforce at a lower level of productivity than the level of labor productivity at the time 
the displacement occurs. Others could argue that the activities performed by workers who 
are displaced by automation could have lower levels of economic output than the activities 
that had been taken over by machines. In any case, it is vital that there be new demand for 
labor displaced by automation. 

82 McKinsey & Company’s proprietary Global Growth Model provides complete time-series data for more 
than 150 concepts and 110 countries over 30 years. It incorporates more than a dozen major international 
databases from such institutions as the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, 
and the Bank for International Settlements. The structure of the model emphasizes the drivers of economic 
growth, including demographic factors, education, energy supply, physical capital, and some determinants 
of total factor productivity. It captures the long-term effects of urbanization and industrialization, as well as 
the impact of sociopolitical institutions, especially on finance and governance. Because business-cycle 
fluctuations affect growth in the short term, the model also links trade and international capital flows, credit 
and asset markets, and the monetary relationships that determine inflation, interest rates, and exchange rates. 
See the technical appendix for more details. The growth model shows a compound annual growth rate for 
GDP and GDP per capita for 2015 to 2030 by country as follows: China 5.1 percent GDP, 4.9 percent GDP 
per capita; France 1.0 percent and 0.6 percent; Germany 1.3 percent and 1.6 percent; India 5.8 percent and 
4.8 percent; Italy 0.5 percent for both GDP and GDP per capita; Japan 1.0 percent and 1.3 percent, United 
Kingdom 1.5 percent and 1.0 percent; United States 2.2 percent and 1.4 percent.

Only considering the labor substitution effects on current work activities, and assuming 
that displaced labor reenters the workforce at 2014 levels of productivity, we estimate 
that, by 2065, the productivity enabled by automation could potentially increase economic 
growth by 0.8 percent to 1.4 percent annually, the equivalent of 1.1 billion to 2.3 billion FTEs.

94 McKinsey Global Institute 5. An engine of productivity 

While our estimates of the productivity boost from automation are substantial, they are of an 
order of magnitude comparable to major technologies that have been introduced in the past 
two centuries. For example, between 1850 and 1910, the steam engine has been estimated 
to have enabled productivity growth of 0.3 percent per annum. Analyses of the introduction 
of robots in manufacturing and IT estimate that they have accounted for annual productivity 
increases of 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively (Exhibit 28).84 One difference is 
that automation of current work activities as we have analyzed it encompasses multiple 
technologies, not just one. 

The productivity potential of automation is a multiplier of other productivity levers. 
Economies that have relatively low productivity can also accelerate productivity growth 
through other means, for example by adopting best practices from other countries with 
high productivity, in order to reap the full benefits of automation’s potential and achieve a 
faster growth trajectory. Previous MGI research has estimated that about three-quarters 
of potential productivity improvements could come from the broader adoption of best 
practices and technologies, as companies catch up with sector leaders. The remaining 
one-quarter would come from technological, operational, and business innovations that go 
beyond best practices and push the frontier of the world’s GDP potential. Business leaders 
and policy makers can encourage this acceleration of productivity by removing barriers 
to competition in service sectors, investing in physical and digital infrastructure, exploiting

border flows, and crafting a regulatory environment that fosters increased productivity and 
innovation.85 

THE IMPACT OF AUTOMATION WILL VARY AMONG ECONOMIES DUE 
TO DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS, WAGE LEVELS, PRODUCTIVITY, AND 
GROWTH ASPIRATIONS 
While automation at a global level can be a significant economic growth engine by 
helping reduce the growth gap created by a shrinking workforce, its effects will play out 
differently in different countries, depending on the demographic situation in each country, 
current productivity levels, wage levels, GDP growth aspirations, and adoption scenarios 
for automation. 

As we have seen, countries with high shares of aging populations, such as Germany and 
South Korea, will have a more urgent need for the productivity boost that automation can 
provide. But countries with a range of demographic profiles and growth aspirations also 
face challenges and opportunities. We identify three groups of countries, each of which 
may be able to use automation to further national economic growth goals. The groups are 
advanced economies with aging or shrinking workforces, emerging economies with aging 
workforces, and younger emerging economies whose workforces are still growing and 
which have high aspirations for future economic growth. 

Advanced economies with shrinking workforces could benefit rapidly from 
automation to compensate for demographic pressures on growth 
Countries including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, the 
United Kingdom, and the United States, with an aggregate annual GDP growth aspiration 
until 2030 of 1.8 percent, stand to benefit from automation in the medium term. These 
advanced economies face a deficit of full-time equivalents even to maintain current GDP 
per capita because of their aging populations. Automation could provide enough of a 
productivity boost for them to achieve projected GDP for the next few decades. 

These countries have considerable incentives to accelerate the pace of automation by 
investing in research and development, encouraging the development of hardware and 
software solutions to integrate automation technology advances, and other measures that 
could make automation more economically feasible. This could more than compensate for 
the demographic changes that would otherwise likely slow down economic growth. 

Exhibit 29 uses the United States as an example of this group. It shows that automation 
could make a significant contribution to the productivity increase that the United States 
needs to achieve GDP per capita growth. The United States faces a shortfall of around 
15 million workers already by 2020 just to maintain current GDP per capita. Automation, if 
adopted early enough, could enable the United States not only to maintain GDP per capita, 
but also to attain the GDP per capita growth rate projected for the economy for the next 
several decades, despite the aging population. 

85 Global growth: Can productivity save the day in an aging world? McKinsey Global Institute, January 2015.



96 McKinsey Global Institute 5. An engine of productivity 

Emerging economies with aging workforces will get a productivity boost 
from automation but will also need to find additional sources to maintain their 
growth trajectory 
This category includes Argentina, Brazil, China, and Russia, which all face economic growth 
gaps as a result of projected declines in the working population. Their first distinguishing 
factor is that their current productivity is not sufficient to support GDP per capita over 
the long run. For these economies, automation could provide the productivity injection 
necessary just to maintain GDP per capita. However, to achieve a faster growth trajectory 
that is more commensurate with their developmental aspirations (GDP growth of 4.1 percent 
and GDP per capita growth of 3.8 percent), these countries would need to supplement 
automation with additional sources of productivity, such as process transformation and 
other technologies. 

This grouping is not monolithic, and there are some divergences based on demographic 
and economic growth differences. Argentina, Brazil, and Russia, for example, are projected 
to have lower GDP per capita growth than China. Argentina and Brazil have younger 
populations than China and Russia; the median age is about seven years lower. They also 
have significantly faster-growing populations. 

While these economies could receive a strong productivity boost from automation, their 
wage levels are lower than in the advanced economies we discussed above, and their 
overall adoption of automation may be slower as a result, since the business case for 
adoption may be less compelling. As we have seen, in these countries it could take longer 
for the cost of automation solutions, especially if they involve hardware, to make automation 
feasible when compared to the costs of human labor.

97McKinsey Global Institute A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity

Policy measures including encouraging increased competition and the development of 
a high standard of technological literacy in the population at large could help speed the 
process of automation adoption. China, for example, already has the highest rate in the 
world for technology-enabled payment platforms; a recent report by market research firm 
Nielsen found that 86 percent of Chinese paid for online purchases with digital payment 
systems, double the global average.86 

A second distinguishing factor for these economies that will affect the impact of automation 
is that their overall productivity levels tend to be relatively low compared with those of 
advanced economies. To capture the full multiplier effects from automation, and achieve 
their aspirations for a continued fast-growth trajectory, these countries will need to 
supplement automation with other levers to enhance productivity. 

Exhibit 30 shows the example of China from this group of fast-growing emerging 
economies. China’s population is aging rapidly, which means that in the longer term its 
working-age population will peak as early as 2024 and could shrink by one-fifth.87 Within 
the next decade, its workforce will be short of the equivalent of about 600 million workers 
to attain the projected growth if it does not drive productivity improvements. Early adoption 
of automation could lessen this gap by about 100 million FTEs, but the country still faces a 
likely shortfall.

In Exhibit 31, we highlight Brazil as another example in this group. The model shows that 
early adoption of automation could allow Brazil to meet its medium term GDP per capita 
growth expectations. But finding additional levers to accelerate Brazil’s productivity growth 
would be beneficial in both the medium term, as the majority of the adoption scenarios show 
automation not providing sufficient economic growth to meet projected GDP per capita 
growth, and in the long term. 

Emerging economies with younger populations will get a boost from 
automation but will need other productivity gains to ensure sufficient longer-
term growth 
The third grouping we identify are emerging economies with younger populations. These 
include India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Turkey. Saudi 
Arabia is something of an anomaly in this group because of its high wages adjusted for 
purchasing power parity (see Box 6, “With a combination of strong population growth and 
high wages, Saudi Arabia is atypical”). These countries all have aspirations for high long-
term growth, in order to lift living standards for the rising population. At the same time, these 
countries have strong population growth rates. The ratio of working to total population will 
peak in the 2050s (except in Turkey and Saudi Arabia, where it will peak early), ensuring 
they have the necessary workforce to maintain GDP per capita. Even so, in these countries, 
automation on its own will not suffice to meet the growth aspirations, and other productivity 
levers will be needed. Exhibit 33 shows how the productivity impact of automation could 
play out in Nigeria, which has the highest population growth rate of the group. Still, to meet 
the projected GDP per capita growth, it faces a shortfall of ten million workers in 15 years. 
Early adoption of automation could close this gap.

Box 6. With a combination of strong population growth and high 
wages, Saudi Arabia is atypical 

1 Saudi Arabia beyond oil: The investment and productivity transformation, McKinsey Global 
Institute, December 2015.

2 Ibid.

Saudi Arabia and some of its neighbors in the Middle East are experiencing 
relatively slow growth, but they have both high wages, measured at 
purchasing power parity, and a growing workforce. Saudi Arabia, for example, 
has a demographic bulge: more than half the Kingdom’s population is younger 
than 25, and by 2030 the number of Saudis aged 15 years and over will likely 
increase by about six million. Based on historical trends in participation, this 
upcoming demographic bulge could almost double the size of the Saudi labor 
force.1 Its productivity growth of 0.8 percent between 2003 and 2013 was well 
below the average for its G20 peers.2 

Automation could provide a considerable productivity boost to these 
countries, enough to meet GDP per capita growth aspirations. Moreover, 
automation will be economically feasible in these economies rapidly, because 
of their relatively high wage levels. The challenge for governments in these 
countries will be to create additional human jobs to employ the large cohort of 
young people who will reach working age in the near future. However, the ratio 
of working-age population to total population will peak in the 2030s, reversing 
the previous demographic dividend and making continued productivity gains 
more important (Exhibit 32).

AUTOMATION’S IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT COULD BE OF THE SAME ORDER 
OF MAGNITUDE AS PREVIOUS MAJOR STRUCTURAL ECONOMIC SHIFTS 
A recurring question about automation is its effect on employment. Many forecasters paint 
a sometimes dire picture of what the adoption of automation could do for jobs, particularly 
blue-collar jobs. The World Economic Forum, for example, has predicted that more than five 
millions jobs could be lost to robots in 15 major developed and emerging economies over 
the next five years.88 

The advent of large-scale automation in the workplace will undoubtedly alter the nature of 
the workplace, and the nature of work itself, as machines increasingly take over activities 
that were hitherto the domain of human workers. But to some extent, this is an old story. 
Telephone operators in the 1950s needed to physically connect switchboard plugs, but 
these jobs no longer exist today, as no physical capabilities are required to connect calls. 
Telex and telegraph operators are a dying profession. The typing pool that was a mainstay 
of office life in the 1950s and 1960s has not survived. In their place have come myriad new 
jobs born of the technological developments, from call center employees to IT help desk 
personnel. Personal assistants no longer take dictation, but monitor email. 

88 The future of jobs: Employment, skills, and workforce strategy for the fourth Industrial Revolution, World 
Economic Forum, January 2016. Other forecasters have made specific predictions about large-scale 
job losses related to automation or painted scenarios of a world without work. See Jeremy Bowles, The 
computerization of European jobs, Bruegel, July 2014; Martin Ford, Rise of the robots: Technology and the 
threat of a jobless future, Basic Books, 2015; and Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A. Osborne, The future of 
employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerisation? Oxford Martin School, September 17, 2013.

101McKinsey Global Institute A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity

Such anecdotal evidence is underscored by macroeconomic data. Positive gains have been 
reported in both productivity and employment in the United States in more than two-thirds 
of the years since 1929 despite the rapid onward march of technological development.89 
One-third of new jobs created in the United States in the past 25 years did not exist, or 
barely existed, 25 years ago.90 Moreover, every three months about 6 percent of US jobs are 
destroyed by shrinking or closing businesses, while a slightly larger percentage of jobs are 
added.91 This is not just a US phenomenon; findings from other countries indicate that these 
are global trends. For example, a detailed analysis of the French economy by McKinsey’s 
French office, published in 2011, showed that while the internet had destroyed 500,000 
jobs in France in the previous 15 years, it had created 1.2 million others, a net addition of 
700,000, or 2.4 jobs created for every job destroyed.92 

Will this pattern continue with automation, or could things be different this time? (See Box 7, 
“Is this time different?”). Certainly the scale and potential scope of the work activities that 
have the potential to be automated are very substantial indeed. Our model contemplates the 
possibility that hundreds of millions of workers will have to shift the activities they are paid 
to do. 

Yet even this sort of large-scale structural economic shift over such a long period of time 
is not unprecedented. In the United States, for example, the share of farm employment fell 
from 40 percent in 1900 to 2 percent in 2000, while the share of manufacturing employment 
fell from 25 percent in 1950 to less than 10 percent in 2010 (Exhibit 34).93 In both cases, the 
jobs that disappeared were offset by new ones that were created, although what those new 
jobs would be could not be ascertained at the time. 

Whatever the net impact on employment, the nature of work will change with automation. 
There will be tighter integration between humans and machines than there is today, and this 
will increase overall efficiency, since machines will be more accurate with the activities that 
they take on. This will free up humans to perform tasks that use higher-level capabilities, 
especially those that require social and emotional ones.

Automation of human work activities has been occurring for at least the past 
two centuries, and while these technologies have automated a wide range 
of activities people had formerly been paid to do, new activities, occupations 
and jobs have been created. This has offset what would have become a 
situation of mass unemployment, had new demands for human labor not 
been produced. 

But is this time different? Are we reaching a point where the pace and/or types 
of automating work activities will outstrip the global economy’s ability to create 
new activities and jobs for people to be paid to do? 

In some ways, this is an “evergreen” issue, in that these questions and 
concerns have accompanied the adoption of automation through history. 
Beyond the time of the Luddites in 19th-century Britain, John Maynard Keynes 
wrote about the “new disease” of technological unemployment during the 
Great Depression.1 Over the years, many have speculated about decreasing 
demand for human labor as machines automate more work, including Keynes, 
in the same article from 1930 quoted above, and the 1966 US Commission 
on Technology, Automation and Economic Progress. But while the workweek 
has declined from working 10-18 hours per day, six days per week, during the 
Industrial Revolution to about eight hours per day, five days per week in the 
mid-20th century, it has not declined substantially since that point in many 
developed countries. 

Some argue that there are factors suggesting that this time is different. Eric 
Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee describe an inflection point between 
the first machine age, based on the automation of physical tasks through 
mechanization, and a second machine age, based on the automation 
of cognitive tasks through digital technologies.2 Digital technologies’ 
basic capabilities, including computing power, storage capacity, and 
communications throughput, appear to be developing exponentially. For 
example, Moore’s Law suggests that the computing power that can be 
purchased for $1 doubles roughly every two years. Chroniclers of “exponential 
technologies” such as Ray Kurzweil extrapolate out to a time when a 
computer will have the computing power of a human brain, and beyond, 
potentially pointing to a future in which, combined with the appropriate 
software, an “artificial general intelligence” could be created that rivals that of 
human beings. Others point to a dimension of human work described by the 
economists Daron Acemoglu and David Autor: between routine and non-
routine work.3 While much of the work that had historically been automated 
was routine (for example, what we describe in this report as predictable 
physical activities and the collection and processing of data), many of the 
examples of newer automation technologies that we find remarkable automate 
what we would have described as non-routine work. That includes driving cars 
in busy streets, or diagnosing disease. 



103McKinsey Global Institute A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity

Box 7: Is this time different? (continued)
However, the labor market has until now always adapted to the replacement of 
jobs with capital, with price effects tending to balance the forces of automation 
and creating new complex tasks for people to be paid to do. The December 
2016 US White House report on artificial intelligence and automation states: 
“Recent research suggests that the effects of AI on the labor market in the 
near term will continue the trend that computerization and communication 
innovations have driven in recent decades… The economy has repeatedly 
proven itself capable of handling this scale of change, although it would 
depend on how rapidly the changes happen and how concentrated the losses 
are in specific occupations that are hard to shift from.”4 To support some of 
the assumptions in our modeling analyses, we argue that many of the factors 
affecting the pace and extent of automation adoption, such as the engineering 
of solutions to specific problems, and particularly the non-technical 
organizational change management, regulatory and acceptance dynamics 
around technology adoption, have not changed. 

However, changing other assumptions in our model could lead to significantly 
different outcomes. For instance, our assumptions on the time required to 
develop capabilities and integrate and customize them into solutions that solve 
specific problems assumes that these activities will primarily be performed 
by people. But in a world where machines can teach themselves, these time 
frames could be considerably different from our assumptions. 

We also only analyze the automation of current work activities at the 
performance levels at which humans currently perform them. If machines 
can perform these tasks at significantly higher levels, and/or other new 
productive activities, then productivity growth could accelerate even faster 
than we modeled. Similarly, we modeled workers displaced by automation 
returning to the workforce at the productivity of workers in 2014; if they return 
at higher levels of productivity (for example, at the average level of productivity 
of workers at the time they are displaced), then overall productivity growth will 
also accelerate. Could this lead to a surplus of labor? This would depend on 
the economy’s ability to create new and more things to pay people to do. 

Is this time different? We can’t definitely say—but the question is a familiar one.

AUTOMATION COULD CHALLENGE SOME CONVENTIONAL BELIEFS ABOUT 
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND PATHS TO PROSPERITY 
The advances in automation we have outlined and their potential impact on national 
economies could upend some prevailing models of development and challenge ideas about 
globalization. Among other possible repercussions, it could skewer conventional wisdom 
about the economic advantages of having a high birthrate. Low-cost labor may lose its 
edge as an essential development tool for emerging economies, as costs of automation 
fall. And these economies, in turn, will have new opportunities to leapfrog into higher-value 
manufacturing and services—including IT—that will enable them to compete head-on 
with advanced economies. Automation could also accelerate the diminishing of trade of 
physical goods that began a decade ago, as digital cross-border flows consolidate their 
pre-eminence. 

Automation could reverse a demographic dividend for economies 
The country scenarios we have outlined above could overturn ideas about the relationship 
between economic growth and population growth. The declining fertility rates and aging 
trends that have taken hold in a broad range of countries including China, Germany, Italy, 
and Russia have long been viewed as harbingers of weaker economic growth in the future—
and a major policy challenge. The aging and shrinking of the workforce is unprecedented in 
modern history, and one of its consequences is that the number of retirees will likely grow 
more than twice as fast as the labor pool, leaving fewer workers to support the elderly.94 
Conversely, countries with a high birthrate and a growing working-age population were 
viewed as having an opportunity to achieve more rapid GDP growth, as they could build 
future growth on the twin pillars of productivity and employment growth.

Automation could help change that scenario. Countries experiencing population declines 
or stagnation will be able to make use of it to help maintain living standards even as the 
labor force wanes. Meanwhile, countries with high birthrates and a significant growth in 
the working-age population may have to worry about where new jobs will come from in a 
new machine age. This is especially the case for high-income and low-growth countries, 
including some in the Middle East. 

The stakes are high because of the sheer numbers of people who have lifted their living 
standards as a result of countries following the classic developmental path—and the millions 
more who still hope to do so. In India, the impact of automation on employment could affect 
working hours of the equivalent of 220 million people; in China, that rises to 380 million full-
time equivalents. 

Chinese companies still have low levels of automation overall, although they are moving to 
ramp up. There are only 36 robots per 10,000 Chinese manufacturing workers, about half 
the average of all advanced economies and about one-fifth the US level.95 Auto factories 
are less than 30 percent as automated as US plants, and food processing is only about 
12 percent as automated as US food processing.96 This gap reflects the cost of Chinese 
manufacturing labor, which has risen but remains low by the standards of advanced 
economies. The average manufacturing worker makes about 10 percent of the average US 
manufacturing wage, for example. Our research finds that most Chinese manufacturers 
are not yet able to realize the maximal value from robots due to a production process that is 
less than optimal. Chinese companies may adopt a hybrid model that mixes the speed and 
precision of automation with the flexibility of human labor. 

Low-cost labor: No longer a development panacea? 
Starting already in the 1880s in Japan, country after country around the world including 
South Korea, Taiwan, and most notably China, has followed a familiar pattern of 
development. A combination of low-wage agriculture and manufacturing—at times often 
backed by protectionist policies to encourage import substitution and boost exports—
creates jobs and swells household income. As workers become more productive and 
households more prosperous, manufacturing moves up the value chain, producing higher 
quality products. Country dwellers flock to cities to join this industrialization wave, creating 
urban pockets of consumers with disposable income that helps generate greater prosperity. 
This trend has been driven by a huge influx of 1.2 billion people joining the global labor 
market between 1980 and 2010, and it has brought millions out of poverty. In 1990, about 
23 percent of the world’s population belonged to the “consuming class,” by which we mean 
that they earned more than $10 per day. In 2010, that share had risen to 36 percent of the 
global population, and we project it will exceed 50 percent by 2025.97 

That labor-intensive economic development model is still largely intact and is being followed 
by countries from India to South Africa. For countries still stuck in poverty, including in sub-
Saharan Africa, it remains the obvious path to prosperity. But in the new world that is taking 
shape, low-cost labor may lose some of its edge as an essential developmental tool for 
countries, as automation drives down the cost of manufacturing globally. Indeed, research 
by the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik suggests that a “premature deindustrialization” is 
already taking place in some emerging economies, although he ascribes that more to trade 
and globalization than to technological progress.98

106 McKinsey Global Institute 5. An engine of productivity 

As we have seen, the type of activities most susceptible to automation includes physical 
activity or operating machinery in a predictable setting—in other words, highly routine 
work. A number of occupations in manufacturing sectors that use low-cost labor fit into this 
category, such as sewing machine operators, who have a 98 percent automation potential. 
Agriculture, too, has a high automation potential because much of its activity is both physical 
and predictable, and thus replaceable by machines. The speed of adoption of automated 
technology depends in part on the size of the firms. For example, in India, where much 
farming is on a small-scale family subsistence model, changing to larger-sized farms would 
sharply raise the automation potential. 

For advanced economies that have lost manufacturing jobs over the past decades because 
of competition from lower-cost labor and the buildup of supply chains elsewhere, the drive 
to automation may end or even reverse the outflow. The wage gap between advanced 
and emerging economies is wider in manufacturing than for other sectors. At the same 
time, companies in advanced economies often have a greater ability to fund the capital 
expenditure that is needed to build highly automated manufacturing plants. 

That does not mean jobs will flow back in large numbers, since only a very small part of 
manufacturing value added is driven by labor cost, and any “re-onshoring” that does take 
place will likely happen in highly automated plants. Moreover, for companies in advanced 
economies, the business case for automation is not simple: hardware and software can 
be costly, and integrating them successfully is laborious. But machines also have some 
clear advantages: they can run continuously and do not require large human resources 
departments. Operations are easier to manage if they are next door, which makes oversight 
and shipping easier than if operations were halfway around the world. Politically and from a 
public relations standpoint, too, it can be advantageous to be seen as a local stalwart. 

New opportunities for higher-value manufacturing and services 
through automation 
Growing use of automation across sectors and within sectors raises the prospect that 
some countries could leapfrog in the future to become active in industries where they are 
now weak or have little presence and either no infrastructure base or one that is aging and 
technically obsolete. For example, Saudi Arabia and Iran have aspirations to build up an 
automotive industry to serve not just the domestic market but also the wider Middle East 
region. They both have domestic supplies of raw materials, such as iron ore and bauxite, 
and plentiful energy; deploying automation technologies could help them leapfrog into state-
of-the-art manufacturing. In Russia, where the number of employees will likely decrease by 
30 percent over the next half century as a result of a declining birthrate, automation could 
compensate for the smaller workforce and revitalize growth in manufacturing sectors. 
New technologies and integrated solutions might reduce capital expenditure, benefiting 
emerging economies with limited resources. They also potentially provide the ability for 
emerging economies to create economies of scale. 

Emerging economies could gain an edge in some service sectors, including health care 
and social assistance, IT, and professional, scientific, and technical services. That is 
because the gap in wages between countries for these services is less pronounced than it 
is for manufacturing, and the cost of the software needed to compete on a global scale is 
much lower. 



107McKinsey Global Institute A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity

Automation could accelerate the diminishing of physical trade 
What we now can see as the heyday of globalization, the 20-year period that began in the 
mid- to late 1980s, the global flows of goods, services, and finance grew rapidly, outpacing 
GDP growth. Since the global financial recession in 2008 and slow recovery, however, that 
rapid expansion has stopped in its tracks. Growth in global goods trade has flattened, trade 
in services has posted only modest growth, and financial flows have fallen sharply. At the 
same time, data flows have soared, with cross-border bandwidth growing 45 times larger 
since 2005. Data flows now account for a larger impact on of global GDP than does global 
trade in goods.99 

Automation could to some extent push this trend further, as companies rely less on 
traditional shipping methods and more on digital transactions and exchanges. For example, 
3D printing, if widely adopted by global manufacturers, could reduce global trade volumes 
as more products are “printed” where they are consumed. There are already examples 
of this at work, such as GE Aviation, which is beginning to use 3D printing to produce fuel 
nozzles for its new Leap engine.100 A fuel nozzle made the traditional way consists of 20 
components, with a supply chain that spans countries. 3D printing allows the company 
to produce best-quality nozzles in one piece, at one location, eliminating the need to ship 
intermediate parts across borders. 

At the same time, the rise of digital platforms such as Alibaba, Amazon, and eBay changes 
the economics of doing business across borders, bringing down the cost of international 
interactions and transactions. These platforms create markets and user communities 
with global scale, providing businesses in advanced and emerging economies alike with 
a huge base of potential customers and effective ways to reach them. Companies based 
in developing countries can overcome constraints in their local markets and connect with 
global customers, suppliers, financing, and talent far more easily than they ever could.101 

•••

Automation can quickly become a new engine for the global economy at a time when the 
working-age population in numerous countries is stagnant or falling and productivity growth 
is struggling to compensate. Whatever their economic structure, wage levels, growth 
aspirations, or demographic trends, countries around the world could benefit from adopting 
automation to maintain living standards and help meet long-term growth aspirations. The 
rapid development and growing adoption of automation technologies will create myriad 
new opportunities even as they likely disrupt the world of work and challenge long-held 
conventions about the global economy and paths to prosperity. In order to make the most 
of the potential offered by automation and, at the same time, manage its consequences on 
companies, national economies, and workers around the world, policy makers, business 
leaders, and men and women everywhere will need to think through the implications that 
these new technologies will bring and prepare for significant changes. In our final chapter, 
we discuss how stakeholders around the world can position themselves to benefit fully from 
automation’s potential while avoiding its pitfalls.

Automation’s challenge for policy makers, business leaders, and workers everywhere is a 
formidable one: how to capture the positive effect on the global economy, at the same time 
as navigating what is likely to be a complicated period ahead, one with potentially epochal 
social, economic, and employment repercussions. 

At a time of sluggish GDP growth and weak productivity gains—and when demographic 
trends are starting to work against growth in a broad range of countries—automation 
could serve as an unforeseen boon to the world economy. Yet anxieties about lost jobs 
and reduced incomes are already creating a backlash against globalizing and modernizing 
trends, especially in advanced economies, influencing election outcomes in several 
countries. Ever since the Industrial Revolution, evolving technologies have aroused fears as 
well as excitement. The risk that automation could become a scapegoat is real. 

As already noted, the public debate over automation takes place against a backdrop of a 
growing gap in incomes and employment prospects of high-skill and low- and middle-skill 
workers.102 The share of national income that is paid to workers, the so-called wage share, 
has been declining in many advanced economies even as productivity has risen, suggesting 
a disconnect between productivity and incomes, which automation could potentially 
exacerbate further. The wage-share decline is due in part to the growth of corporate profits 
as a share of national income, as a result of rising capital returns to technology investments, 
lower returns to labor from increased trade, rising rent incomes from homeownership, and 
increased depreciation on capital.103 

Moreover, there is already a significant mismatch of skills in the global workforce, with high 
levels of youth unemployment and, at the same time, a shortage of job seekers with critical 
skills. Overcoming this mismatch is a complex undertaking that requires close cooperation 
among education providers, governments, and businesses.104 

Uncertainty about the timing of automation adoption and its potentially variable impact 
from sector to sector, from country to country, and from workplace to workplace, make 
the challenge of preparing for it even more complex. Yet preparation is both possible and 
necessary, within the business world, at a policy level, and for individuals. Automation 
technologies are advancing rapidly, and those who harness them effectively and take the 
lead in their sectors will gain a competitive advantage.105 It is never too early to think through 
strategic options and appropriate responses. 

102 See the discussion of technical change and skills in Chapter 4.
103 While overall spending on capital goods has been weak, there has been considerable investment in 

information technology, whose prices have declined. See Loukas Karabarbounis and Brent Neiman, The

6. PREPARING FOR DISRUPTION 



110 McKinsey Global Institute 6. Preparing for disruption 

AUTOMATION WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMPANIES 
TO CAPTURE VALUE, BUT IT WILL HEIGHTEN COMPETITION AND REQUIRE 
CHANGED BUSINESS ROLES AND WORKFLOWS
Capturing the full opportunities offered by automation including both the labor substitution 
and other performance benefits is likely to give companies a competitive advantage, but 
doing so will likely require them to conduct a thorough review of corporate activities and 
potential overhaul of business processes and workflows. 

Automation will enable new forms of competitive advantage, but it will also 
require companies to raise their game just to keep up
There are many opportunities for companies to take advantage of the potential of 
automation to seek competitive advantage. Automation of various activities can improve the 
performance of almost any business process, as we noted in our case studies in Chapter 3. 
Certainly, automation can be used to transform the costs of a process by reducing 
labor costs, for example when end-to-end digitization is used to create straight-through 
processing of a transactional process. As we have also documented, automation can not 
only enable a reduction in labor costs, it can also bring a range of other benefits related to 
performance improvements, such as greater throughput, improved reliability, raised quality, 
better safety, and other gains. Straight-through processing of financial transactions, for 
instance, is usually faster than the manual process it replaces, and reduces the number of 
errors introduced into the process.

Thus, any of the benefits that automation can unlock could become a basis of competition.  
An industrial company that is able to ensure significantly lower downtime than its 
competitors by automated monitoring and predictive maintenance of its equipment can 
compete on this basis of better reliability. A consumer company that can provide faster 
delivery and 24x7 customer service, through automation in its supply chain and contact 
centers, can compete on the basis of being more responsive to its customers. Automation 
can also enable companies to create new products, services and/or business models, 
for example, a professional services company that is able to provide customized advisory 
services to small and medium-sized businesses, or even consumers, through an automated 
conversational interface.

Some of the strategic capabilities that automation can unlock are more subtle and wide-
ranging than improving the performance of a particular process or offering. Some forms 
of automation, for example those that are based on machine learning techniques such as 
deep learning, improve their performance over time when they have access to more data. 
Companies that are able to create platforms with increasing returns to scale can create 
network effects that result in winner-take most dynamic. Machine learning on user data 
allows the platform to become more compelling to users, which in turn generates more 
data.106 We have seen these types of dynamics in online search platforms, social media 
platforms, media delivery platforms, and increasingly platforms that support activities in 
the physical world, such as platforms for Internet of Things data, healthcare, and travel 
and transportation.

Automation could also unlock the otherwise unlikely combination of scale and agility, 
with the ability to instantly propagate changes across an entire organization. When an 
organization’s activities are controlled by automatic systems, modifying the behavior of the 
enterprise can be accomplished by software download, rather than an extensive change 
management program. When automation is used to augment human management, 
traditional organizational orthodoxies, such as about spans of control, can be challenged. 
For example, Uber takes advantage of automation for coordination, and has only about one 

106 Michael Chui and James Manyika, “Competing at the digital edge: Hyperscale businesses,” McKinsey 
Quarterly, March 2015.



111McKinsey Global Institute A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity

human manager per 1,000 drivers compared with a typical limousine company that has 
about one manager per 20 to 30 drivers. However, greater scale and speed also means that 
the effects of negative changes are amplified. And these are not the only challenges that 
automation could bring to businesses. From a technology standpoint, as software and data 
underlie nearly all new automation technologies, cybersecurity issues become more critical 
than ever.

Strategically, automation can also heighten competition, enabling startups or firms 
from other sectors to encroach on new turf and exacerbating a growing divide between 
technological leaders and laggards in every sector.107 At the same time automation can 
support increasing scale, it also can provide the leverage that enables smaller companies 
to compete with much larger firms. When the basis of competition using automation is 
algorithms and data, the raw materials of competition are more readily accessible, through 
the cloud and open data. For example, we have seen the advent of new competitors in the 
media and game sectors deploying automation tools to quickly gain the reach of much more 
established players.

The fact that automation displaces human work activities creates a set of real challenges for 
companies that deploy it. Worker displacement creates the potential for labor unrest, and 
the size and scope of retraining/placement programs, whether put in place by companies or 
others, will have to mirror the size and scope of automation programs. The effective use of 
automation requires the transformation of processes, changing what people do, even those 
that are not made redundant by automation. In general, workflows will change, and new 
roles will emerge, such as that of robot trainer or exception handler.

Companies embracing automation could experiment and map areas of likely 
impact, even as they focus on workplace changes and new skills for workers
Companies who recognize both the opportunities and threats of automation to 
competitiveness will engage and embrace the potential that these technologies represent, 
prioritizing a set of active experiments to start climbing the learning curves earlier 
rather than later. To help diagnose where automation could most profitably be applied 
to improve performance, business leaders may want to conduct a thorough inventory 
of their organization’s activities and create a heat map of where automation potential 
is high. Business processes shown to have activities with high automation potential 
could be reimagined under scenarios where they take full advantage of automation 
technologies (rather than mechanically attempting to automate individual activities using 
current processes). The benefits and feasibility of these automation-enabled process 
transformations could then be used to prioritize which processes to transform using 
automation technologies.

Business leaders and their organizations will also need to become more knowledgeable 
about the evolution of the technologies themselves, understanding the art of the 
possible, and the potential for the future, in order to best position their enterprises to take 
advantage of automation. This is not just “book knowledge” that comes from reading 
about technologies, or visiting global centers of innovation, but practical knowledge that 
comes from devoting some resources to continually and purposefully experimenting with 
technologies on real problems, and then scaling those that demonstrate promise.

Perhaps the most vital component to being successful at deploying automation is the hard 
work that has to be done to prepare and adapt human capital to work in complementary 
ways with technology. As our activity-based analysis has shown, almost every role will 
change, and every workflow eventually will be transformed. Workers will have to be 
continually retrained as the work activities that they do, to work alongside machines, 

107 This is already happening with digital technologies. See ibid.



112 McKinsey Global Institute 6. Preparing for disruption 

continue to evolve. Others will have to be redeployed, potentially to other positions in the 
economy, and businesses have a role to play in aiding these transitions. This will require 
not only changes in skills, but also changes in mindsets and culture, in a world where 
work activities continue to change, and “co-workers” include not only other people, but 
also machines.

FOR POLICY MAKERS, AN EMBRACE OF AUTOMATION COULD GO HAND IN 
HAND WITH MEASURES TO SUPPORT LABOR DEPLOYMENT 
Policy makers must recognize the pressing need for productivity acceleration to 
compensate for demographic aging shifts in order to enable GDP per capita growth. 
Automation technologies can provide a major contribution to accelerating productivity 
growth. Thus there are two broad categories of issues for policy-makers to consider. First, 
how can we accelerate the development and deployment of automation to generate greater 
growth in productivity? Second, how can we support the redeployment to other productive 
activities of workers whose activities are automated? 

Policy makers can accelerate early development and adoption of 
automation technologies 
Early adoption of automation could benefit from policy support, both in regard to the 
technology development and for its deployment. This support could include investments 
in developing the technologies themselves, including funding basic research and support 
for commercialization, as well as supporting investments in digitally enabled infrastructure 
for automation. 

Investment in enabling infrastructure for automation adoption could be an early priority, 
especially for emerging economies that may not be as digitally enabled as some advanced 
economies. In general, large-scale automation will require substantial investment, and 
the tax and other treatment of this investment could enable—or hinder—the adoption of 
automation technologies. For regulators, automation can pose challenging issues for safety 
and liability; for example, in the case of self-driving vehicles, who could be held liable for 
accidents—the automaker, the owner, or the algorithm creator? Thoughtful regulatory dialog 
and policy making will be important to ensure that the benefits of automation are achieved 
while protecting other societal concerns. 

Engaging a broader societal dialog about automation, the need for productivity growth, 
and shifts in labor markets is another role that policy-makers can play. Deployment of some 
technologies could face concerted opposition from unions or other labor organizations over 
concerns about the employment impact. Governments will need to find cogent answers and 
coherent policies to engage in these debates 

Exposing and stimulating the work that needs doing 
Governments are often not particularly able by themselves to anticipate the types of jobs 
that could be created, or new industries that will develop (and they are not alone in this 
limitation). However, they are well positioned to catalyze dialogues about what work needs 
doing, and the grand societal challenges that require more attention and human effort.108 
The 1966 US Report of the National Commission on Technology, Automation and Economic 
Progress devoted multiple chapters to “Unmet Human and Community Needs,” including 
sections on education, healthcare, urban transportation, air pollution, water resources, 
housing, and international development, all of which seem as relevant in this era as they 
were 50 years ago.109 Perhaps a similar report today would add caring for the elderly to the 
list, as we have documented the demographic effects of aging.

Economic Progress, US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1966.



113McKinsey Global Institute A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity

While policy-makers might not be able to predict the new activities and occupations that can 
be created, they can help create the conditions under which innovation in the use of human 
labor becomes more likely. Governments could also encourage new forms of technology-
enabled entrepreneurship. Digital technology itself can enable new forms of entrepreneurial 
activity. Workers in small businesses and self-employed occupations can benefit from 
higher income earning opportunities. A new category of knowledge-enabled jobs will 
become possible as machines embed intelligence and knowledge that low-skill workers 
can access with a little training. In India, for example, Google is rolling out the internet Saathi 
(friends of the internet) program in which rural women are trained to use the internet and 
then become local agents who provide services in their villages through internet-enabled 
devices. The services include working as local distributors for telecom products (phones, 
SIM cards, and data packs), field data collectors for research agencies, financial-service 
agents, and para-technicians who help local people access government schemes and 
benefits through an internet-based device. There is a need for these services in rural India 
where broad internet reach and digital literacy are still low, but where an increasing number 
of services are being provided online. Google’s program aims to create more than 50,000 
internet Saathis who will provide services to more than 50 million households in rural India.110 

Addressing wages, skills gaps, and labor market mismatches 
One of the challenges of the new era will be to ensure that wages are high enough for the 
new types of employment that will be created, to prevent continuing erosion of the wage 
share of GDP, which has dropped sharply since the 1970s.111 While some governments 
may be tempted to look for ways to slow automation adoption, out of concern for possible 
employment effects, such moves could prove counterproductive, holding back productivity 
without protecting jobs durably. 

Automation could exacerbate a skills gap, even as it touches all occupations. There is 
already a growing divide in income advancement and employment opportunities between 
high-skill workers and those who are low- and medium-skill. In the past two decades, 
there has been a clear pattern of consistent job growth for high-skill workers and little or no 
growth for low- and middle-skill ones. For example, in 1981, college-educated workers in 
the United States earned a 48 percent wage premium over high school graduates. By 2005, 
that premium had risen to 97 percent—in other words, an American college graduate earns 
almost twice as much as a high school graduate.112 The growing gap between productivity 
and wages is not new, but automation could accelerate the process. In its 2016 report on 
automation, the White House noted that the trend toward skill-biased change brought about 
by computerization and communications innovations is likely to continue in the decade 
ahead as a result of artificial intelligence’s effects on the labor market.113 

To address this gap, policy makers could work with education providers to improve basic 
skills through the schools system and put a new emphasis on capabilities that are among 
the most difficult to automate, including creativity, understanding human emotions, and 
managing and coaching others. For people who are already in the workforce, they could 
intervene to help workers develop skills best suited for the automation age. For example, 
many economies are already facing a shortage of data scientists and business translators.114 
Governments working with the private sector could take steps to ensure that such gaps

are filled, with new education and training possibilities established rapidly and prioritized. 
They could also foster the growth of technology-enabled solutions for the labor market that 
improve matching and access to jobs, such as online talent platforms.115 As automation 
reshapes the workplace, independent work could become increasingly important, and 
policy makers will want to address issues such as benefits and variability that these 
platforms can raise. 

Furthermore, while important work that needs doing might be identified, there is a possibility 
of market failures in the wages that might be paid for that work, a situation for which public 
policy interventions might be appropriate. 

Rethinking social support 
Full or partial automation will result in labor displacement, and it will be important to 
support workers as they transition from one set of activities to another. As work evolves at 
higher rates of change between sectors, locations, activities, and skill requirements, many 
workers may need assistance in adjusting to the new age. This could involve providing 
support during transitional periods, for example retraining or income support. While our 
modeling suggests a higher likelihood of labor shortages than labor surpluses, there might 
be people whose skills and capabilities are mismatched to the work that needs doing, or 
where wages are put under pressure by specific increases in labor supply (for example, 
within a geography, for workers with particular skills, in specific industries). In these cases, 
adapted social safety nets could help provide support. Various ideas have been considered, 
including work sharing, negative income taxes, and universal basic income (see Box 8,  
“When some old policy ideas are new again”). 

FOR WORKERS, AUTOMATION WILL CHANGE MANY WORK PROCESSES AND 
REQUIRE A CLOSER COLLABORATION WITH TECHNOLOGY 
Regardless of the longer-term implications, in the short to medium term, men and women 
in the workplace will need to engage more comprehensively with machines as part of their 
everyday activities. Tighter integration with technology will free up time for human workers 
including managers to focus more fully on activities to which they bring skills that machines 
have yet to master. This could make work more complex, and harder to organize, with 
managers spending more time on coaching. 

As young people in particular make education and career choices, it will be important for 
them to be made aware of the factors driving automation in particular sectors, to help them 
identify the skills that could be useful for them to acquire from a labor-market perspective, 
and what activities will be complements of activities that are likely to be automated.116 

High-skill workers who work closely with technology will likely be in strong demand. Those 
involved in developing and deploying automation technologies will have many opportunities. 
In addition, workers who are paid to do activities that are complements of automation 
will also find themselves in an advantageous position, as Brynjolfsson and McAfee have 
described it, racing with the machines rather than racing against the machines.117 These 
and other workers may be also able to take advantage of new opportunities for independent 
work as the corporate landscape shifts and more project work is outsourced by big 
companies. Low-skill workers working with technology will be able to achieve more in terms 
of output and productivity but may experience wage pressure given the potentially larger 
supply of similarly low-skill workers.

Education systems will need to evolve for a changed workplace, with policy makers working 
with education providers to improve basic skills, with a new emphasis on topics such as 
creativity, emotional intelligence, and leading and coaching others. For all, developing agility, 
resilience, and flexibility will be important at a time when everybody’s job is likely to change 
to some degree. 

Finally, automation will create an opportunity for those in work to make use of the innate 
human skills that machines have the hardest time replicating: social and emotional 
capabilities, providing expertise, coaching and developing others, and creativity. For 
now, the world of work still expects men and women to undertake rote tasks that do not 
stretch these innate capabilities as far as they could. As machines take on ever more of the 
predictable activities of the workday, these skills will be at a premium. Automation could 
make us all more human.

completion rates rose. The drawback was that non-primary income earners (often mothers of small children) dropped out of the labor force.

Manitoba, May 2008.

Many of the potential policy measures that could be 
adopted to help the labor force adjust to the impact 
of automation are not entirely new. The 1966 US 
Commission on Technology, Automation, and Economic 
Progress recommended taking actions that included 
improving education and training, facilitating better 
matching between workers and work (including greater 
transparency for workers), creating portable benefits 
that follow workers across different jobs, and increasing 
work-hour flexibility. These are all ideas that find echoes in 
today’s discussions around the world.1

Another idea that has returned is providing a universal 
basic income, in other words, providing all citizens 
with an unconditional sum of money. Automation has 
given it a new lease of life among policy makers, some 
academics and a number of business leaders in Silicon 
Valley, although it remains controversial.2 In a June 2016 
referendum, Swiss voters overwhelmingly rejected a 
proposal to establish a universal basic income.3 

A full basic income program has never been enacted 
and properly studied. However, in Finland, an experiment 
that started on January 1, 2017, will pay an unconditional 

basic income of 560 euros per month for two years to a 
random sample of 2,000 individuals drawn from current 
working-age beneficiaries of unemployment benefits. The 
experiment is aimed at comparing the employment rate of 
beneficiaries of the basic income with those who receive 
traditional unemployment benefits.4 

Others have suggested that if we need human labor 
working alongside automation to achieve economic 
growth, social assistance programs should incentivize 
work, such as negative income taxes. The history of a 
negative income tax for low-paid workers spans back 
to the 1940s, when it was proposed by British politician 
Juliet Rhys-Williams, and it was advocated by Milton 
Friedman in the 1960s. In 1975, the United States 
introduced a negative income tax, the earned income tax 
credit, which provides income subsidies to the working 
poor. The program has survived for 40 years and today 
annual payments range from $500 for an individual 
with no children earning less than $14,820, to $6,242 
for a family with three or more children and household 
income of less than $53,267.5  Other countries have 
similar programs.

•••

Considerable uncertainties surround the advent of the automation era—and have done 
so for years. A half century ago, a US commission on technology, automation, and 
economic progress wrestled with some of the same questions about the future of work and 
employment that we do in this report.118 The speed with which automation will be adopted 
into the workplace will vary, and the effects on employment, on national economies, and 
on businesses and workers globally will play out in myriad ways. At its core, however, 
automation represents a considerable opportunity for the global economy at a time of weak 
productivity and a declining share of the working-age population. For corporate leaders, 
too, automation will reshape the business landscape and create considerable future value. 
How to capture the opportunities and prepare for the possible consequences will be a key 
political, economic, corporate, and social question going forward. This is not something 
that can be watched from the sidelines. Automation is already here, and the technological 
advances continue. It is never too early to prepare.

TECHNICAL APPENDIX 



120 McKinsey Global Institute Technical appendix 

1. ASSESSMENT OF TECHNICAL POTENTIAL FOR AUTOMATION 
We assess the technical potential for automation of the global economy through an 
analysis of the component activities of each occupation. Our analysis covers 46 countries 
representing more than 80 percent of the global economy. We used databases published 
by institutions including the World Bank and US Bureau of Labor Statistics 2014 O*Net 
database to break down about 800 occupations into more than 2,000 activities, and we 
determined the performance capabilities needed for each activity based on the way humans 
currently perform them. 

We further break down activity into 18 capabilities and assess the technical potential of 
those capabilities. This framework is informed by academic research, internal expertise, and 
industry experts. For each capability, we define four possible levels of requirement, ranking 
from not required to the equivalent to top-quartile human performance. Exhibits A1 to A4 
give a high-level summary of the capabilities and the four continuum criteria.

Assigning the required level of capabilities to activities 
We used a machine-learning algorithm to score the more than 2,000 work activities in 
relation to the 18 performance capabilities. To train the algorithm we devised a list of 
keywords that we shared with experts. The algorithm scores each activity by matching 
keywords from the capability to the activity title. Where we found anomalies, special 
requirements, or a need for nuance, we made adjustments, for example, in assessing the 
level of capabilities needed to navigate in extreme weather or on uneven surfaces and other 
unpredictable settings, or the different physical capabilities required by a kindergarten 
teacher compared with a middle school teacher.

2. MODELING OF AUTOMATION ADOPTION TIMELINES 
Our adoption model assesses the automation development and adoption timeline at activity 
level for more than 800 occupations across 19 sectors as well as 46 countries, which 
represent more than 80 percent of the global economy. We divide the adoption process 
into four phases: technical feasibility, solution development, economic feasibility, and end-
user adoption. 

Technical feasibility 
For a work activity to be automated, every performance capability needed to carry out that 
activity must advance to the required technical level. To develop progression scenarios 
for the development capabilities, we used survey findings, extrapolation of metrics, and 
other predictors of technical advances. We conducted interviews with industry leaders and 
academic experts. We also looked at some recent commercial successes showcasing 
capabilities, as well as historic trajectory of capabilities. We then adjusted the result using 
some identified constraints that could limit the progression of certain capabilities. 

To improve accuracy, we looked at other predictors, including from the press, companies, 
research groups, and relevant industries. These predictors include research and 
technological breakthroughs, trends in publications, and patents as a measure of research 
potential. We also looked at predictors of computational resources that are required for 
capabilities as compared with Moore’s law. Another important predictor is open source and 
crowdsourcing developments that could potentially accelerate the technology growth. 

Based on the assessment, we projected the reasonable expected time frames to reach the 
next level of performance for each capability. 

Solution development 
To estimate how long it would take to develop a solution that could integrate automation 
technologies after the establishment of technical feasibility, we used a three-step process. 

First, to understand the solution development life cycle, we collected the development time 
and technical capabilities for more than 100 previously developed automation solutions, 
including both hardware and software solutions. We recorded the number of years from 
initial research to development (product launch) as well as up to three of the most relevant 
capabilities for each. 

Second, we generated solution development scenarios, taking the 25th and 75th percentile 
development time for each of the 18 capabilities across all of its associated solutions. 

Third, we estimated the solution development time for a given work activity based on the 
maximum solution development time of capabilities that activity required. Several examples 
are assessed to ensure accuracy, and we assign 25th and 75th percentile to the earliest/
latest scenario correspondingly. 

Economic feasibility 
Once a solution is developed, we assume the activities will start to be automated after the 
cost of the solution falls below the level of wages for that activity. For this calculation, we took 
into account both the evolution of solution costs and the evolution of wages. 



125McKinsey Global Institute A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity

Solution cost evolution 
Based on the capability requirements, solutions are classified into two categories, hardware 
and software. If a solution requires sensory perception, fine motor skills and dexterity, gross 
motor skills, or mobility, it is classified as a hardware solution. Otherwise, it will be classified 
as a software solution. For a given solution, the initial cost is estimated as a percentage of 
the highest hourly wage for the corresponding activity across all the countries we modeled. 
We estimated the initial cost by looking at several examples of solutions developed using 
different mixes of hardware and software. Based on our research, most of the software 
solutions have relatively low initial costs as a percentage of the human labor cost. Some 
solutions that require a combination of both software and hardware components have a 
higher initial cost. To be conservative, we exclude certain solutions, whose advantages 
are to be derived from only very specific scenarios or include non-economic benefits such 
as increased quality and efficiency as well as decreased error rates. The range of initial 
solution cost we model for hardware is 20 to 70 percent of the highest hourly wage for the 
corresponding activity in the world, and 0 to 20 percent for software. 

In our model, the solution costs decrease as technology advances, with hardware solution 
costs declining by 16 percent per year and software solution costs declining by 5.3 percent 
per year. We triangulate consumer price index and supplier surveys to estimate the 
hardware solution cost reduction. For this, we use computer software and accessories 
indexes to estimate software solution cost reduction, and, for, consumer price inflation, we 
used consumer price index data for personal computers and peripheral equipment, and for 
computer software and accessories from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. For software 
solution costs we used a survey of prices from the International Federation of Robotics. 
Further work could be done to refine the estimation; however, given software’s low starting 
cost, annual reduction has little impact on final automation results. 

Wage evolution 
We model the wage evolution for each country in two stages. From today until 2030, we 
apply country-level growth estimates for all countries. The McKinsey Global Growth Model 
provides wage data to 2030 for G20 countries and other major regions. We use best proxy 
to estimate the remaining 26 countries not covered by the McKinsey model. As the data 
are in local currency, we convert it into 2010 constant US dollars, by dividing nominal GDP 
by corresponding country-level consumer prices (2010 base) and times the exchange rate 
to the dollar (2010 base). We then calculated a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for 
each country. For 2030 onward, we group the 46 countries for which we have data into two 
cohorts using a cutoff country-level annual wage, based on the wage distribution from 2016 
to 2030. Countries within the same cohort grow at same rate. The cohort-level wage growth 
rate is then estimated using the CAGR from 2016 to 2030 of the corresponding G20 country 
within the cohort. The cutoff level also evolves at 2.66 percent annually, which is the median 
G20 CAGR between 2016 and 2030. We reclassify countries each year. As a country 
advances into the next cohort, the appropriate growth rate will be applied. The detailed 
proxy assignment and grouping is listed in Exhibit A5. 



126 McKinsey Global Institute Technical appendix 

Adoption and deployment 
Adoption can start once solutions are economically feasible, but several factors can still 
hinder or enable both the timing and the pace of adoption. Solutions requiring different 
technologies have different levels of ease. It takes time to integrate capabilities needed into 
current technical platforms and combine them as an organic entity. Barriers also exist from 
the organization side. Human talent and organization structures might act as bottlenecks to 
implementation. Policies and law could also slow down or speed up technology innovation 
and adoption. Finally, consumers might have varied preferences for automated solutions 
due to perceived fears and emotional reactions, which could affect the adoption timing.

To incorporate all these factors, we use the mathematics of the Bass diffusion model, a 
well-known and widely used function in forecasting, especially for new products’ sales 
forecasting and technology forecasting. 

Where F(t) is the installed base fraction (that is, adoption of given technology or product) 
and f(t) is the corresponding rate of change. 

The function in our case also contains two key parameters: p parameter (inherent tendency 
of consumers to adopt new technology), and q parameter (the tendency of consumers to 
adopt based on peer adoption). Parameters are estimated through ordinary least square 
regression. In the absence of data, p and q parameter values from meta-analyses can be 
used if saturation value is known or can be guessed. 

We then simulate two scenarios for known historic technology adoption curves (see 
Exhibit 21 in the main report). The technologies we used are stents, airbags, laparoscopic 
surgery, MRI, smartphones, TVs, antilock braking systems, online air booking, cellphones, 
color TVs, SxEW leaching (copper), personal computers, electronic stability control, 
instrument landing systems, dishwashers, and pacemakers. The fitted values of parameters 
p and q are consistent with other academic research.119 It takes about five years to 
reach 50 percent adoption in the earliest scenario and approximately 16 years in the 
latest scenario. 

 

3. ECONOMIC MODELING 
To better understand the economic implication of automation, we examine it at both the 
global and country levels. Key assumptions are similar across the two levels. The global level 
is essentially an aggregated version of major countries including the G19 and Nigeria. 

Our analysis is based on three primary components at country level: projected number of 
full-time equivalents (FTE), the number of full-time employees needed to maintain GDP per 
capita and achieve GDP per capita projection, and automation output. 

Projected number of full-time employees 
The projected FTE data indicates the labor force evolution. For a given year in a given 
country, it is calculated as: 

119 Based on an empirical generalization from 218 technologies. See Fareena Sultan, John U. Farley, and Donald 
R. Lehmann, “Reflections on ‘A meta-analysis of applications of diffusion models,’” Journal of Marketing

We modeled different segments: ages 0–14, ages 15–24, ages 24–64 female, ages 24–64 
male, and ages 65-plus. For each segment we gathered data on: 

  Population: Our model uses the United Nations projection on population to 2065. 

  Labor participation rate: We use historical data from the International Labour 
Organisation to 2012. We estimate future participation conservatively, taking the highest 
rate between 2007 and 2012 and fixing it for the future for each segment. For the 
participation rate of the 0–14 age segment, we assume it will remain the same as in 2012. 

  Unemployment rate: We again use data from the ILO and assume it will be at the long-
term steady state average moving forward. 

GDP per capita projection 
From today to 2030, we use the GDP projection from the McKinsey Global Growth Model. 
From 2030 to 2065, we made GDP projection with a cohort growth model. Based on the 
distribution of GDP per capita as of today, we grouped countries into two cohorts and 
calculated the cohort-level growth rate. Countries within same cohort grow at the same rate. 
The cutoff of groupings also evolve every year at 1.58 percent, which is the average CAGR of 
all countries from 2016 to 2030. 

The two cohorts are as follows: 

  Nine high-income countries, with a 1.08 percent growth rate from 2030 onwards: 
Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, United Kingdom, and 
United States. 

  Eleven middle-income countries, with a 2.04 percent growth rate from 2030: Argentina, 
Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, 
and Turkey. 

Number of FTEs needed to maintain GDP per capita or its projection 
Assuming zero productivity growth, we calculate the required level of FTE to maintain both 
the GDP per capita as of today and the projected GDP per capita. As to maintain current 
GDP per capita, number of FTE needed is calculated by using current GDP per capita times 
total population and divided by current productivity as of 2014. The number of FTE required 
to maintain projected GDP per capita is calculated in a similar way. With projected GDP 
per capita mentioned above, the result is then multiplied by total population and divided by 
productivity as of 2014 to get the number of FTE needed. 

Automation output 
Using the projected FTE and estimated automation adoption, we calculate automation 
output under different scenarios by multiplying them together. This enables us to gauge 
automation impact in terms of human labor. To maintain consistency with other data 
sources we leveraged, we made several additional assumptions. We consider only those job 
activities that are available and well defined today. Also, we assume automation has a labor 
substitution effect but no other performance gains, to be conservative. Finally, we assume 
labor replaced by automation will rejoin the workforce at the same of productivity as today. 
We also assume that additional output from automation will not decrease even if the total 
number of FTEs declines as a result of demographic changes. 



129McKinsey Global Institute A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity

Basic assumptions and calculations remain the same at the global level. The only 
difference is that we average key indicators such as global growth based on averaged GDP, 
population, and participation rate as well as unemployment rate across G19 plus Nigeria. 
We make an adjusted calculation for the number of FTE at a global level. Given the nature 
of FTE, it must be aggregated with adjustments based on corresponding country-level 
productivity. We essentially recalculate the global level average productivity using country-
level data as follows: 

The global level averaged productivity is then divided by global-level GDP to calculate 
corresponding number of FTE. Without this adjustment, the number of FTE needed to 
maintain GDP growth will be inflated given difference on productivity across countries. 

4. KEY PROXIES AND DATA SOURCES 
All of the findings about automation derived from our model are backed up by the database 
we built, which captures detailed information from country, sector, job, and specific activity 
level, corresponding time spent, and wages for certain activities. At each industry, job, and 
activity level, we also calculated the corresponding impact using wage and number of full-
time employees. Exhibit A6 shows the database structure and key calculations. We leverage 
many data sources, both internal and external, however, some approximation was needed 
since the data are not comprehensive.

To gain insights on the impacts of automation, it is important to look at occupations as well 
as activity levels. However, time spent on each activity by occupation is not directly available. 
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics 2014 O*Net database provides frequency scores for each 
activity ranging from 1 (with a significant range of year level) to 7 (with a significant range of 
hour level). The score is used to calculate corresponding time factors. We plot these scores 
against the time factor, which is assigned for given integer frequency. Assuming there are 
2,080 working hours per year, we scale to calculate time spent on each activity by job title.

131McKinsey Global Institute A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity

Data mapping and approximations 
To compensate for a lack of consistent categorizations and level granularity of labor data 
across all countries, we made estimates by mapping, proxies, and approximations. For 
major countries, we extracted high-level employment data for nine major occupations 
across 19 sectors from Oxford Economic Forecasts. India’s data were used to estimate 
the agriculture sector for Brazil. We then combined these data with our own international 
employment database, which contains detailed occupation data for Australia, Brazil, 
Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. For all other countries where 
data were missing, we defined and assigned proxies to them, based on GDP per capita and 
output per capita, sector mix, and education levels. The key proxy defining process contains 
two parts, the proxy for 39 major countries and the proxy for selected African countries. 

For the 39 major countries, we leveraged existing external and internal McKinsey & 
Company resources and assigned different proxies to countries within each industry. Taking 
agriculture, which has 28 percent of the global employees, as an example, we use India 
to approximate China and Indonesia, given the similarity in farm size and GDP per capita. 
For smaller industries, we use a weighted combination between Brazil and the developed 
countries for which we have detailed data.

Half a century ago, a US commission appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson 
examined automation’s effect on employment and the economy.

RELATED MGI RESEARCH

Digital America: A tale of the haves and 
have-mores (December 2015) 
While the most advanced sectors, companies, 
and individuals push the boundaries of 
technology use, the US economy as a whole is 
realizing only 18 percent of its digital potential.

The Internet of things: Mapping the value 
beyond the hype (June 2015) 
If policymakers and businesses get it right, 
linking the physical and digital worlds could 
generate up to $1.1 trillion a year in economic 
value by 2025.

A labor market that works: Connecting 
talent with opportunity in the digital age 
(June 2015) 
Online talent platforms are increasingly 
connecting people to the right work 
opportunities. By 2025 they could add 
$2.7 trillion to global GDP, and begin to 
ameliorate many of the persistent problems in 
the world’s labor markets.

Global growth: Can productivity save the 
day in an aging world? (January 2015) 
Without action, global economic growth 
will almost halve in the next 50 years. This 
MGI report offers a solution: a dramatic 
improvement in productivity.

The age of analytics: Competing in a data-
driven world (December 2016) 
Big data’s potential just keeps growing. 
Taking full advantage means companies must 
incorporate analytics into their strategic vision 
and use it to make better, faster decisions.

Independent work: Choice, necessity, and 
the gig economy (October 2016) 
The MGI report examines all the ways people 
are earning income, as well as the challenges 
independent work presents.

Poorer than their parents? Flat or 
falling incomes in advanced economies 
(July 2016) 
The real incomes of about two-thirds of 
households in 25 advanced economies were 
flat or fell between 2005 and 2014. Without 
action, this phenomenon could have corrosive 
economic and social consequences.

Digital Europe: Pushing the frontier, 
capturing the benefits (June 2016) 
Europe is operating below its digital potential. 
Accelerating digitization could add trillions 
of euros to economic growth in less than 
a decade.
