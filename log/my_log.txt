societal challenges in areas from health to climate change At the same time these technologies will transform the nature of work and the workplace itself Machines will be able to carry out more of the tasks done by humans complement the work that humans do and even perform some tasks that go beyond what humans can do As a result some occupations will decline others will grow and many more will change While we believe there will be enough work to go around barring extreme scenarios society will need to grapple with significant workforce transitions and dislocation Workers will need to acquire new skills and adapt to the increasingly capable machines alongside them in the workplace They may have to move from declining occupations to growing and in some cases new occupations This executive briefing which draws on the latest research from the McKinsey Global Institute examines both the promise and the challenge of automation and AI in the workplace and outlines some of the critical issues that policy makers companies and individuals will need to solve for Automation and AI are not new but recent technological progress is pushing the frontier of what machines can do Our research suggests that society needs these improvements to provide value for businesses contribute to economic growth and make once unimaginable progress on some of our most difficult societal challenges In summary Beyond traditional industrial automation and advanced robots new generations of more capable autonomous systems are appearing in environments ranging from autonomous vehicles on roads to automated check outs in grocery stores Much of this progress has been driven by improvements in systems and components including mechanics sensors and software AI has made especially large strides in recent years as machine learning algorithms have become more sophisticated and made use of huge increases in computing power and of the exponential growth in data available to train them Spectacular breakthroughs are making headlines many involving beyond human capabilities in computer vision natural language processing and complex games such as Go These technologies are already generating value in various products and services and companies across sectors use them in an array of processes to personalize product recommendations find anomalies in production identify fraudulent transactions and more The latest generation of AI advances including techniques that address classification estimation and clustering problems promises significantly more value still An analysis we conducted of several hundred AI use cases found that the most advanced deep learning techniques deploying artificial neural networks could account for as much as 3 5 trillion to 5 8 trillion in annual value or 40 percent of the value created by all analytics techniques Exhibit 1 Deployment of AI and automation technologies can do much to lift the global economy and increase global prosperity at a time when aging and falling birth rates are acting as a drag on growth Labor productivity growth a key driver of economic growth has slowed in many economies dropping to an average of 0 5 percent in 2010 2014 from 2 4 percent a decade earlier in the United States and major European economies in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis after a previous productivity boom had waned AI and automation have the potential to reverse that decline productivity growth could potentially reach 2 percent annually over the next decade with 60 percent of this increase from digital opportunities AI is also being used in areas ranging from material science to medical research and climate science Application of the technologies in these and other disciplines could help tackle societal moonshot challenges For example researchers at Geisinger have developed an algorithm that could reduce diagnostic times for intracranial hemorrhaging by up to 96 percent Researchers at George Washington University meanwhile are using machine learning to more accurately weight the climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AI and automation still face challenges The limitations are partly technical such as the need for massive training data and difficulties generalizing algorithms across use cases Recent innovations are just starting to address these issues Other challenges are in the use of AI techniques For example explaining decisions made by machine learning algorithms is technically challenging which particularly matters for use cases involving financial lending or legal applications Potential bias in the training data and algorithms as well as data privacy malicious use and security are all issues that must be addressed Europe is leading with the new General Data Protection Regulation which codifies more rights for users over data collection and usage A different sort of challenge concerns the ability of organizations to adopt these technologies where people data availability technology and process readiness often make it difficult Adoption is already uneven across sectors and countries The finance automotive and telecommunications sectors lead AI adoption Among countries US investment in AI ranked first at 15 billion to 23 billion in 2016 followed by Asia s investments of 8 billion to 12 billion with Europe lagging behind at 3 billion to 4 billion Even as AI and automation bring benefits to business and society we will need to prepare for major disruptions to work Our analysis of more than 2000 work activities across more than 800 occupations shows that certain categories of activities are more easily automatable than others They include physical activities in highly predictable and structured environments as well as data collection and data processing These account for roughly half of the activities that people do across all sectors The least susceptible categories include managing others providing expertise and interfacing with stakeholders Nearly all occupations will be affected by automation but only about 5 percent of occupations could be fully automated by currently demonstrated technologies Many more occupations have portions of their constituent activities that are automatable we find that about 30 percent of the activities in 60 percent of all occupations could be automated This means that most workers from welders to mortgage brokers to CEOs will work alongside rapidly evolving machines The nature of these occupations will likely change as a result Automation will displace some workers We have found that around 15 percent of the global workforce or about 400 million workers could be displaced by automation in the period 2016 2030 This reflects our midpoint scenario in projecting the pace and scope of adoption Under the fastest scenario we have modeled that figure rises to 30 percent or 800 million workers In our slowest adoption scenario only about 10 million people would be displaced close to zero percent of the global workforce Exhibit 2 The wide range underscores the multiple factors that will impact the pace and scope of AI and automation adoption Technical feasibility of automation is only the first influencing factor Other factors include the cost of deployment labor market dynamics including labor supply quantity quality and the associated wages the benefits beyond labor substitution that contribute to business cases for adoption and finally social norms and acceptance Adoption will continue to vary significantly across countries and sectors because of differences in the above factors especially labor market dynamics in advanced economies with relatively high wage levels such as France Japan and the United States automation could displace 20 to 25 percent of the workforce by 2030 in a midpoint adoption scenario more than double the rate in India Even as workers are displaced there will be growth in demand for work and consequently jobs We developed scenarios for labor demand to 2030 from several catalysts of demand for work including rising incomes increased spending on healthcare and continuing or stepped up investment in infrastructure energy and technology development and deployment These scenarios showed a range of additional labor demand of between 21 percent to 33 percent of the global workforce 555 million and 890 million jobs to 2030 more than offsetting the numbers of jobs lost Some of the largest gains will be in emerging economies such as India where the working age population is already growing rapidly Additional economic growth including from business dynamism and rising productivity growth will also continue to create jobs Many other new occupations that we cannot currently imagine will also emerge and may account for as much as 10 percent of jobs created by 2030 if history is a guide Moreover technology itself has historically been a net job creator For example the introduction of the personal computer in the 1970s and 1980s created millions of jobs not just for semiconductor makers but also for software and app developers of all types customer service representatives and information analysts Partial automation will become more prevalent as machines complement human labor For example AI algorithms that can read diagnostic scans with a high degree of accuracy will help doctors diagnose patient cases and identify suitable treatment In other fields jobs with repetitive tasks could shift toward a model of managing and troubleshooting automated systems At retailer Amazon employees who previously lifted and stacked objects are becoming robot operators monitoring the automated arms and resolving issues such as an interruption in the flow of objects While we expect there will be enough work to ensure full employment in 2030 based on most of our scenarios the transitions that will accompany automation and AI adoption will be significant The mix of occupations will change as will skill and educational requirements Work will need to be redesigned to ensure that humans work alongside machines most effectively Automation will accelerate the shift in required workforce skills we have seen over the past 15 years Demand for advanced technological skills such as programming will grow rapidly Social emotional and higher cognitive skills such as creativity critical thinking and complex information processing will also see growing demand Basic digital skills demand has been increasing and that trend will continue and accelerate Demand for physical and manual skills will decline but will remain the single largest category of workforce skills in 2030 in many countries Exhibit 3 This will put additional pressure on the already existing workforce skills challenge as well as the need for new credentialing systems While some innovative solutions are emerging solutions that can match the scale of the challenge will be needed Our research suggests that in a midpoint scenario around 3 percent of the global workforce will need to change occupational categories by 2030 though scenarios range from about 0 to 14 percent Some of these shifts will happen within companies and sectors but many will occur across sectors and even geographies Occupations made up of physical activities in highly structured environments or in data processing or collection will see declines Growing occupations will include those with difficult to automate activities such as managers and those in unpredictable physical environments such as plumbers Other occupations that will see increasing demand for work include teachers nursing aides and tech and other professionals As intelligent machines and software are integrated more deeply into the workplace workflows and workspaces will continue to evolve to enable humans and machines to work together As self checkout machines are introduced in stores for example cashiers can become checkout assistance helpers who can help answer questions or troubleshoot the machines More system level solutions will prompt rethinking of the entire workflow and workspace Warehouse design may change significantly as some portions are designed to accommodate primarily robots and others to facilitate safe human machine interaction The occupational mix shifts will likely put pressure on wages Many of the current middle wage jobs in advanced economies are dominated by highly automatable activities such as in manufacturing or in accounting which are likely to decline High wage jobs will grow significantly especially for high skill medical and tech or other professionals but a large portion of jobs expected to be created including teachers and nursing aides typically have lower wage structures The risk is that automation could exacerbate wage polarization income inequality and the lack of income advancement that has characterized the past decade across advanced economies stoking social and political tensions Most countries already face the challenge of adequately educating and training their workforces to meet the current requirements of employers Across the OECD spending on worker education and training has been declining over the last two decades Spending on worker transition and dislocation assistance has also continued to shrink as a percentage of GDP One lesson of the past decade is that while globalization may have benefited economic growth and people as consumers the wage and dislocation effects on workers were not adequately addressed Most analyses including our own suggest that the scale of these issues is likely to grow in the coming decades We have also seen in the past that large scale workforce transitions can have a lasting effect on wages during the 19th century Industrial Revolution wages in the United Kingdom remained stagnant for about half a century despite rising productivity a phenomenon known as Engels Pause PDF 690KB after the German philosopher who identified it In the search for appropriate measures and policies to address these challenges we should not seek to roll back or slow diffusion of the technologies Companies and governments should harness automation and AI to benefit from the enhanced performance and productivity contributions as well as the societal benefits These technologies will create the economic surpluses that will help societies manage workforce transitions Rather the focus should be on ways to ensure that the workforce transitions are as smooth as possible This is likely to require actionable and scalable solutions in several key areas There is work for everyone today and there will be work for everyone tomorrow even in a future with automation Yet that work will be different requiring new skills and a far greater adaptability of the workforce than we have seen Training and retraining both midcareer workers and new generations for the coming challenges will be an imperative Government private sector leaders and innovators all need to work together to better coordinate public and private initiatives including creating the right incentives to invest more in human capital The future with automation and AI will be challenging but a much richer one if we harness the technologies with aplomb and mitigate the negative effects James Manyika is chairman and

trapped in a room with its mate looks uncannily like a dog well maybe a mutant dog with a canary yellow body and a proboscis sticking out where its head should be The robot confidently scurries to the door raises itself to the perfect height and then uses its appendage to press down the handle Pulling open the door the robot allows its mate to be first across the threshold before the two of them make their dash for freedom Such is the content of a short video by Boston Dynamics that has gone viral since it was released in February Reactions to it on social media have ranged from amusement soon they ll be opening our fridges and stealing our beer to alarm this is how we die It is the latest evidence of recent remarkable advances in robotics and artificial intelligence robots can now perform backflips and ride bicycles and machines empowered by AI are able to analyze X ray images better than expert radiologists and to teach themselves to play the ancient game of Go better than world champions Yet the dog clip is also powerful because it conjures up a more worrisome vision of robots on the loose beyond the control of us humans Thus it plays into a powerful angst laden contemporary narrative about technology and the future of work and maybe even of mankind itself What really are the risks from this new wave of technology And will the opportunities these advances bring with them outweigh those risks To address such questions about the future it is useful indeed necessary to look to the past Technology has for centuries both excited the human imagination and prompted fears about the effects Back in 1589 Queen Elizabeth I of England refused to grant a patent to a stocking frame invented by one William Lee because Her Majesty was concerned about the effect of the contraption on the livelihoods of those who knitted stockings by hand The Luddite weavers in Britain and silk workers in Lyons France famously staged revolts in the early 19th century against new automated looms that threatened their skilled and well paid jobs And in the realm of fiction imagination has run riot since the Czech writer Karel Capek coined the word robot from a Slavic word for work in his 1920 play Rossum s Universal Robots a k a RUR which ends with the destruction of mankind As one of Capek s characters explains Robots are not people Mechanically they are more perfect than we are they have an enormously developed intelligence but they have no soul For 100 percent of continuous 10 year periods in the United States technologically driven productivity gains have gone hand in hand with rising employment Almost a century later that same concern about soulless hyper intelligence infuses not just movies like The Matrix and mind bending video series like Philip K Dick s Electric Dreams but also warnings about AI and its potential consequences expressed by Elon Musk and the late Stephen Hawking among others Back in the 1950s the German philosopher Martin Heidegger fretted about the risk that humans would become enslaved by the technologies we rely on With the rise of machines able to mimic many human traits from speech albeit still falteringly to facial recognition already significantly more accurately than humans that time appears to be much closer Yet when we switch from philosophy to economics we find a very different story a long historical record of innovation that shows technological change has been overwhelmingly positive for productivity and surprisingly benign when it comes to employment Job displacement has occurred in waves first with the structural shift from agriculture to manufacturing and then with the move from manufacturing to services Throughout productivity gains generated by new technology have been reinvested and the GDP bounce from that productivity eventually raises consumption and on balance increases the demand for labor In McKinsey s research we have sought to quantify this trend and its net impact in several ways For example we looked at the very big picture what happened to employment as productivity grew over the past 50 years We found no tradeoff between the two for 100 percent of continuous 10 year periods in the United States technologically driven productivity gains have gone hand in hand with rising employment Even when measured in one year snapshots productivity and employment have risen together four years in five The personal computer provides an iconic case to support the compatibility of technological progress with job growth We measured how many jobs were lost and how many gained in the United States between 1980 and 2015 as a result of the diffusion of computer technology Several hundred thousand bookkeepers and auditing clerks secretaries and typists did lose their jobs But the overall balance was strongly positive the desktop laptop computer created more than 19 million jobs in industries ranging from computer hardware to enterprise software to online retail sales against the loss of about 3 5 million jobs a net gain of 15 7 million That figure amounts to 18 percent of all the net U S employment created in the period almost one in five jobs Something similar happened with the invention of the automobile which destroyed the horse and buggy business but gave rise to a wealth of new sometimes unimagined products from petroleum based synthetic rubber to motels That said we ignore those left along the way at our peril For the many workers who are displaced painful transitions are a reality In Britain during the industrial revolution starting in about 1800 wages of the masses stagnated for almost a half century despite a strong surge in productivity that enriched the owners of capital a phenomenon often referred to as Engels pause because it was first noted by the German philosopher who co authored with Karl Marx The Communist Manifesto Wages picked up again as the fruits of productivity gains eventually trickled down to workers But eventually can be a long time the Luddites fears were not entirely unfounded And once again today the link between productivity gains and wage growth seems bent if not broken U S median hourly compensation rose only 11 percent from 1973 to 2016 even as hourly labor productivity grew by 75 percent While it is natural to focus on labor displacement through technology one element often overlooked in the discussion of the future of work is the number of jobs that are neither lost nor gained but fundamentally changed for reasons that are hard to predict History again provides some examples When ATMs became as common as vending machines in the 1970s the number of bank tellers actually increased That s because the new technology reduced the costs of processing individual transactions giving the banks incentives to open more branches to meet local demand for other financial services The tellers primary tasks changed from cashing checks and taking deposits to providing advice and selling securities mortgages and the like To be sure this tale is not yet complete with the rise of online banking the demand for tellers has again waned and so their numbers have thinned especially after the 2008 financial crisis But modern economies are nothing if not dynamic and the only certainty is change There s a similar story to be told about jobs and information technology Thanks to the internet and some ingenious software anyone can now dig up information at the blink of a cursor Yet the need for data analysis has exploded even as the need for data gathering clerks and the like has plummeted And so the number of information analysts of the genus homo sapiens has quintupled since 1980 to about two million today This largely comforting history isn t much help in determining whether this time will be different To the point the rise of ever more sophisticated technologies especially artificial intelligence that can be brought to bear on any number of tasks is likely to usher in a new age of rapid workforce transitions The McKinsey Global Institute recently estimated that in our fastest automation adoption scenario as many as 375 million workers worldwide or about 14 percent of the global workforce will need to switch occupational categories by 2030 in order to avoid obsolescence Even if the pace of adoption is slower as in our midpoint scenario some 75 million workers will need to switch occupational categories in the next 10 to 15 years Among the work most vulnerable to automation jobs that require routinized physical activity in a predictable setting and collecting and processing data Some aspects of the current technological transformation seem in line with that of previous eras the rise of computers for example and earlier epochs of technical change such as the diffusion of the steam engine that transformed work across multiple sectors of the economy simultaneously Every new wave of automation seems remarkable at the time and AI is not the first technology to chip away at cognitive tasks Since the birth of computerized spreadsheets in the 1980s machines have tackled ever more sophisticated problems that previously required human brainpower Still other aspects of the new technologies do seem qualitatively different from previous waves of innovation The rate of technological change today is strikingly rapid and while hard to measure appears to be accelerating Consider in this regard the development of deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques based on neural networks the exponential increase in computing capacity made available through the cloud and the sheer volume of data that can be generated These advances are driving AI for example enabling the development of autonomous vehicles but also heralding breakthrough applications such as a heightened ability to diagnose disease with non invasive techniques Accordingly the share of jobs that could be automated could also be larger than historical precedents suggest The future of work looks set to be not a tale of machines replacing humans but of machines complementing humans in the workplace That said we see no evidence to date suggesting that the time it takes for new technologies to be diffused throughout the economy is shrinking Looking at a range of high value technologies over the past 60 years from airbags to MRI machines to smartphones we find that the pace of adoption hasn t changed It still takes between 5 and 16 years to reach 50 percent adoption and 5 to 28 years to reach 80 percent adoption Even highly popular social media applications do not beat this clock Facebook for example was begun in 2004 and had attracted more than 2 2 billion followers 13 years later but the untapped market remains vast Consider too that new technology is rarely applied to a blank canvas a variety of economic and social factors play a big role in determining the pace of adoption They include the cost of developing and deploying the hardware and software labor market dynamics the regulatory environment and social acceptance Computer algorithms in state of the art technology aircraft can do just about anything asked of them without a helping hand but we still insist on humans in the cockpit for peace of mind And who wants to be cared for in a hospital solely by a robot We remain disconcerted by the uncanny valley the term coined by the Japanese robotics guru Masahiro Mori to characterize that unsettling feeling people may experience when facing humanoid robots Indeed for tech luminaries ranging from the MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson to the former Google chairman Eric Schmidt the future of work looks set to be not a tale of machines replacing humans but of machines complementing humans in the workplace The rise of AI and the ascendance of self learned algorithms whose logic can be hard to explain pose some arguably unique problems A recent report from a who s who of experts on the malicious use of AI lists a number of the darkest scenarios from political manipulation through hyper personalized disinformation campaigns to a major increase in sophisticated computer hacking attacks For now AI pioneers including Google DeepMind s chief executive Demis Hassabis are clear that while machines are proving formidable in specific areas such as games we remain a long way away from the time when they will have mastered a general artificial intelligence enabling them to think and act like humans And a number of groups including Stanford University s AI100 with which I am associated are trying to look ahead to study and anticipate how AI will affect the way people live work and play long into the future The challenges here for policymakers and business leaders worldwide are significant We will need to institute retraining of workers on a scale we have not seen for generations We will need to rethink and adapt our social systems to help hundreds of millions of workers affected by the new technologies hopefully handling it better than we have handled globalization in providing both new forms of income and job transition support We will need to find ways to tame the wilder unpredictable side of AI For their part CEOs will need to rethink their organizational structures and processes to take advantage of the technologies and the performance enhancing effects they can have or risk ending up in the recycle bin of business history While all of this may seem intimidating it is still the best way forward We should embrace automation technologies for the productivity benefits they bring even as we deal proactively with the workforce transitions that will accompany adoption Given that demographic trends increased longevity low birth rates are rapidly increasing the dependent population our societies really need that productivity boost Beyond the prosperity and employment these technologies will create there will be other societal benefits new moonshots as we use the power of AI to tackle daunting problems from cancer to climate change We can already see one of the key challenges that of worker retraining or reskilling as some like to call it advancing to the top of the corporate agenda and in some countries also receiving renewed political attention In our recent work on the skills that will be needed by the workforce we found that demand will rise sharply not just for technological skills of all kinds but also for social and emotional skills that is leadership and empathy with customers as well as for higher cognitive skills linked to creativity and complex information processing Business leaders tell us that they believe finding the right talent to help implement automation is critical to their future financial performance and they expect companies to take the lead in the skills upgrade that is required Some firms are already putting in place large scale retraining initiatives AT T is using external education providers including for example Udacity At SAP the German enterprise software company the focus is on in house efforts to create learning journeys for thousands of employees including engineers who need to acquire softer skills as their roles change to service customers directly Walmart has set up more than 100 academies in the United States that provide hands on training for positions that include customer service managers and online grocery pickup While welcome these disparate retraining efforts are barely a start Given the scale of the occupational and skill shifts that we see coming in the next decade much more will need to be done and not just by business Governments and educational establishments working together with philanthropic foundations will of necessity be part of the mix Foundations have the advantage of being able to test innovative programs as pilots and will not face the disadvantage of concern that workers with new skills will subsequently jump ship for a new employer As a starter governments will need to reverse the 20 plus year decline in spending on labor related services no small task in light of tight government budgets and in the United States reflexive opposition to government intervention They will also need to be more flexible in order to adapt to the rapidly changing workplace Mobility is one key yet labor markets have become markedly less dynamic in recent years In the United States for example job reallocation rates have declined by 25 percent since 1990 This is the time to test ideas such as portable benefits that are owned by workers and not tied to particular jobs or companies Technology itself can help facilitate greater mobility especially digital platforms turbocharged by AI that enable matching of people to jobs But we also need to rethink some basic assumptions In order for changing jobs across sectors to become a common practice companies will need to agree on definitions and qualifications for specific skills And a major debate is overdue about credentialing Today higher education encourages the world to judge graduates by their subject knowledge rather than by their skills in problem solving and creative thinking skills that will be especially valuable in an AI enhanced workplace More than anything we need to prepare for this new era in which humans must work alongside smart machines far more intensively President Lyndon Johnson was prescient in this regard writing a half a century ago Automation is not our enemy Our enemies are ignorance indifference and inertia Automation can be the ally of our prosperity if we will just look ahead if we will understand what is to come and if we will set our course wisely after proper planning Back then nobody other than science fiction writers could have imagined robot dogs opening doors and escaping to wherever those androids from Blade Runner found refuge But LBJ s words resonate planning for change has never been

playlists Image attribution When technology advances too quickly for education to keep up inequality generally rises Erik Brynjolfsson Director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital EconomyThe rapid pace of technical advances and the increasing feasibility of automation has created questions about the future of work and its potential for displacing workers Estimates of the scale of threatened jobs over the next decade or two range from 9 to 47 according to a 2016 White House research report This is defined as those working in jobs where more than 70 of their activities can be automated On average nearly one half 46 of work activities in the country are currently automatable Share of Jobs with Highly Automatable Skills by EducationMost of this risk is concentrated among lower paid lower skilled and less educated workers Workers earning below 20 per hour face a greater than 80 chance of displacement More than two out of five workers without a high school degree have job skills that are considered highly automatable These projections should raise concerns about the ability of communities to tackle existing issues of social equity and affordable housing that could be exacerbated by automation Share of Jobs with High Probability of Automation by Occupation s Median Hourly WageJob tasks that are most susceptible include predictable physical tasks which make up 8 of all work tasks data processing 16 processing and data collection 17 On the other end of the spectrum work that either involves managing others 7 or applying expertise 14 proves the least susceptible However even these jobs aren t immune to some degree of automation This magnitude of shifts in work activities over multiple decades is not unprecedented The share of U S farm employment fell from 40 in 1900 to 2 in 2000 while the share of manufacturing employment fell from approximately 25 in 1950 to less than 10 in 2010 In both cases new activities and jobs were created that offset those that disappeared What may be unprecedented is the pace of the change and scale of people affected That said a decline in immigration to the United States and the aging population decline in the share of the working age population will open economic growth gaps at the same time that we re seeing job disruption due to automation We will see large scale shifts in workplace activities over the next century and these trends are already underway These shifts are inherent in automation technologies and also a consequence of a shifting labor demographic Millennials who already constitute the largest workforce population in the U S are demanding greater flexibility and autonomy than previous generations Building an educated workforce and rethinking our educational and training programs is the most critical task in preparing for the future of an automated world says Erik Brynjolfsson director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy and co author of The Second Machine Age Work Progress and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies Individuals will be required to have not only coding skills he says but also more diverse math reading interpersonal and creative skill sets According to the National League of Cities The Future of Work in Cities report nearly all 95 of the 11 6 million jobs that have been created since the last recession required some postsecondary education While science technology engineering and math STEM skills are emphasized many employers are also looking for primary and secondary educational systems to address gaps in workplace competencies like teamwork problem solving and communication STEM skills may power new technologies but the soft skills of collaboration critical thinking and interpersonal skills are vital components of the jobs likely to endure automation The balance of these skills will remain essential to prepare students with the human digital capabilities they will need As more restaurant orders are automated and shopping moves further online humans who work in these retail sectors will be expected to provide the customer with something extra something social to shift toward selling more personalized or unique experiences what the experts call the commodification of experience New technology and peer to peer platforms as well as a greater emphasis on personal craftsmanship and human ability have fueled the growth of a creative class of individuals capable of marketing their work from home This emphasis will likely continue to spread across the lower skilled labor market where individuality and a personal touch are valued and where services cannot be outsourced or easily automated Cities should encourage entrepreneurship and reduce barriers to innovation For example they can limit the number of occupational licenses necessary or streamline the process to get new licenses The 21st century worker will need a lifelong learning mindset to be successful and use digital resources to enable digital skills development The nation will need to reverse its declining investment in our workforce if we are going to sufficiently prepare people for future jobs in an era of automated work Scholarship Sacramento Valley Vision based in Sacramento created a comprehensive online platform of local scholarships for students who live in the Sacramento region to help address the growing costs of advanced education tuition at four year public colleges is up 33 since the 2007 08 school year They have identified approximately 350 000 in local scholarship funds in Sacramento County Since the program s inception in 2013 it has reached more than 1 000 students and their families with scholarship education and one on one and group mentoring Degrees At Work in Louisville In 2010 Louisville made a citywide commitment to add 55 000 college degrees 40 000 bachelor s and 15 000 associate degrees to its workforce by 2020 They first targeted the lowest hanging fruit the more than 90 000 local adults who had already completed some college coursework Degrees At Work aims to help 15 000 working adults earn degrees by 2020 working with local companies that have stepped up to provide tuition reimbursement

answer is yes sort of Eggers who runs Deloitte s Center for Government Insights said at a Nov 29 FCW event on government modernization that 20 to 30 percent of all work activities will soon be automatable thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence He pointed to a Deloitte study of the federal workforce that found 4 3 billion hours are spent each year on a wide range of task and activities A huge share of those hours is devoted to essentially moving paper he said while relatively little time goes to coaching and other sorts of human activities But the study also found that four out of five of the most labor intensive activities have either a medium or high automation potential Eggers said That could allow for reductions in certain parts of the workforce he noted but it also frees up time for critical higher value work and the chance to deliver better service by giving the human workforce AI powered support Studies have repeatedly shown Eggers said that it s the human machine pairing that gives the best results he said The full video of Eggers half hour talk which explores the larger implications for government as AI becomes the new electricity is available

Backward the protagonist Julian West wakes up from a 113 year slumber and finds the United States in 2000 has changed dramatically from 1887 People stop working at age forty five and devote their lives to mentoring other people and engaging in volunteer work that benefits the overall community There are short work weeks for employees and everyone receives full benefits food and housing 1 The reason is that new technologies of the period have enabled people to be very productive while working part time Businesses do not need large numbers of employees so individuals can devote most of their waking hours to hobbies volunteering and community service In conjunction with periodic work stints they have time to pursue new skills and personal identities that are independent of their jobs In the current era developed countries may be on the verge of a similar transition Robotics and machine learning have improved productivity and enhanced the economies of many nations Artificial intelligence AI has advanced into finance transportation defense and energy management The internet of things IoT is facilitated by high speed networks and remote sensors to connect people and businesses In all of this there is a possibility of a new era that could improve the lives of many people 2 Yet amid these possible benefits there is widespread fear that robots and AI will take jobs and throw millions of people into poverty A Pew Research Center study asked 1 896 experts about the impact of emerging technologies and found half of these experts 48 percent envision a future in which robots and digital agents will have displaced significant numbers of both blue and white collar workers with many expressing concern that this will lead to vast increases in income inequality masses of people who are effectively unemployable and breakdowns in the social order 3 These fears have been echoed by detailed analyses showing anywhere from a 14 to 54 percent automation impact on jobs For example a Bruegel analysis found that 54 of EU jobs are at risk of computerization 4 Using European data they argue that job losses are likely to be significant and people should prepare for large scale disruption Related Technology Innovation How artificial intelligence is transforming the world Darrell M West and John R Allen Tuesday April 24 2018 TechTank Artificial intelligence deepfakes and the uncertain future of truth John Villasenor Thursday February 14 2019 Technology Innovation What is artificial intelligence Darrell M West Thursday October 4 2018Meanwhile Oxford University researchers Carl Frey and Michael Osborne claim that technology will transform many sectors of life They studied 702 occupational groupings and found that 47 percent of U S workers have a high probability of seeing their jobs automated over the next 20 years 5 A McKinsey Global Institute analysis of 750 jobs concluded that 45 of paid activities could be automated using currently demonstrated technologies and 60 of occupations could have 30 or more of their processes automated 6 A more recent McKinsey report Jobs Lost Jobs Gained found that 30 percent of work activities could be automated by 2030 and up to 375 million workers worldwide could be affected by emerging technologies 7 Researchers at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD focused on tasks as opposed to jobs and found fewer job losses Using task related data from 32 OECD countries they estimated that 14 percent of jobs are highly automatable and another 32 have a significant risk of automation Although their job loss estimates are below those of other experts they concluded that low qualified workers are likely to bear the brunt of the adjustment costs as the automatibility of their jobs is higher compared to highly qualified workers 8 Related Books Going Mobile By Darrell M West 2014 Behavioral Science Policy Volume 1 Number 2 Edited by Craig Fox and Sim B Sitkin 2016 Behavioral Science Policy Volume 1 Number 1 Edited by Craig Fox and Sim B Sitkin 2015While some dispute the dire predictions on grounds new positions will be created to offset the job losses the fact that all these major studies report significant workforce disruptions should be taken seriously If the employment impact falls at the 38 percent mean of these forecasts Western democracies likely could resort to authoritarianism as happened in some countries during the Great Depression of the 1930s in order to keep their restive populations in check If that happened wealthy elites would require armed guards security details and gated communities to protect themselves as is the case in poor countries today with high income inequality The United States would look like Syria or Iraq with armed bands of young men with few employment prospects other than war violence or theft Yet even if the job ramifications lie more at the low end of disruption the political consequences still will be severe Relatively small increases in unemployment or underemployment have an outsized political impact We saw that a decade ago when 10 percent unemployment during the Great Recession spawned the Tea party and eventually helped to make Donald Trump president With some workforce disruption virtually guaranteed by trends already underway it is safe to predict American politics will be chaotic and turbulent during the coming decades As innovation accelerates and public anxiety intensifies right wing and left wing populists will jockey for voter support Government control could gyrate between very conservative and very liberal leaders as each side blames a different set of scapegoats for economic outcomes voters don t like The calm and predictable politics of the post World War II era likely will become a distant memory as the American system moves toward Trumpism on steroids 1 Edward Bellamy Looking Backward 2000 1887 Houghton Mifflin 1888 2 Darrell M West The Future of

of Automation for Jobs in OECD Countries Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Working Paper 189 2016 Donald Trump entered office on a promise to bring back jobs and lift up the white working class While 53 percent of Americans earning less than 30 000 a year voted for Hillary Clinton the counties she won made up 64 percent of America s GDP in 2015 Trump won over five times as many counties as Clinton but these counties constituted only 36 percent of America s GDP in 2015 Trump also surpassed Clinton in places where voters are most at risk of losing their jobs due to automation and won support among those who had already lost out as a result of technological changes in the workplace A National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that the more robots introduced in a commuting zone between 1993 and 2007 the more likely the area went to Trump However Trump s economic message and governance so far has focused almost entirely on job loss due to trade and he has said little on how automation challenges his constituency On the other hand Barack Obama warned in his final speech as president that the next wave of economic dislocation won t come from overseas It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes many good middle class jobs obsolete In the fall of 2016 the White House released a report on automation that outlined its likely impacts on lower wage earners and the prospects for deepened wage inequality Research from Oxford University predicts 47 percent of jobs are likely to be automated within a decade or two and a study by the McKinsey Global Institute finds that 46 percent of time spent on existing work activities will become automated However when asked about the threat of losing jobs to automation Secretary Treasury Steve Mnuchin said the issue is not even on our radar screen I m not worried at all Not everyone agrees Larry Summers who originally argued that automation would help the economy by creating new jobs has since stepped back from this position warning This isn t some future possibility This is something that s emerging before us right now MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson concurs This is the biggest challenge for our society for the next decade While much has been written on the policy challenges automation poses little has been written on the political dynamics it is likely to produce Unsurprisingly political leaders tend to shy away from discussing the issue It is difficult to antagonize technological advancement automation is often the result of corporate investment it yields growth and achieves efficiency and average Americans save on products and services as a result And some make the case that automation is not happening fast enough citing dismal productivity gains The competing theses on the likely effects of automation differ in their understanding of how today s technological shifts compare to past radical changes in the economy Nonetheless policy recommendations that confront technological unemployment can insure against the worst case scenario And as similar disruptions originate from trade and technological improvement similar policies can ameliorate the consequences of dislocation produced by trade and tech shocks Pursuing such policies could also present a political opportunity to restore some sober analysis and much needed non partisan problem solving This would require a response somewhat antithetical to our politics one that is forward thinking and anticipates voters concerns While 65 percent of Americans believe that within 50 years robots and computers will likely complete work performed by humans today 80 percent of Americans do not expect their jobs will disappear While poorer and less educated Americans demonstrate greater concern for the prospect American workers overall worry more about displacement by other workers industry trends and mismanagement Given that few voters are preoccupied with disruptive changes to work stability through technological advancements there exists little incentive for politicians to tackle it But doing so provides two important opportunities at a time ripe for political renewal First addressing automation upends a politics that relies heavily on antagonism Unlike trade few voters reject the benefits of technological change and automation offers no foreign scapegoats like cheap labor abroad or multilateral trade to accuse of stealing jobs Subsequently it is difficult to claim political victories and publically take on opponents Second while workers are concerned about more immediate threats tackling automation would require modernizing the social safety net to not only improve the working lives of Americans today but also to respond to the changing nature of work itself As Brookings Mark Muro writes programs should be anticipatory and offer support when disruption is forecast but not yet hitting home This might require openness to challenging some of the premises that have long guided partisan economic platforms Because automation is predicted to yield greater economic growth while at the same time displacing many workers traditional conservatives will have to embrace some degree of government intervention An inability to adapt conservative economic governance to confront the features of radical shifts in the labor market could prove electorally costly Americans likely to be the most affected by automation live in Republican districts but in areas that have experienced the greatest shocks from automation the 2016 presidential vote was closer This presents an opportunity for Democrats to contend for the support of these voters If Democrats fail to address these voters needs the party might miss an opportunity to reassert a strong economic message and reconnect with a working class base Joseph Parilla and Mark Muro have suggested the creation of a Universal Basic Adjustment Benefit to tackle the dislocation likely to become an increasingly routine feature of the labor market Inspired by calls for a Universal Basic Income UBI the adjustment would include job search counseling worker training funding relocation grants and wage insurance Given that UBI has attracted support from a group of odd bedfellows that includes American Enterprise Institute s Charles Murray and Andy Stern the former president of the Service Employees International Union a Basic Adjustment Benefit might be able to generate similar cross ideological interest In fact it might even prove more palatable than UBI proposals as the benefit would target moving workers back into the labor market and would combine many welfare programs that could be administered flexibly at the local level The consequences of failing to incorporate automation into our political dialogue are potentially high In the Midwest manufacturing job loss bred feelings of economic frustration that led many to favor a populist candidate who gave them something to blame which exemplifies the frustrations likely to take hold as the threat of technological unemployment mounts Additionally many of the jobs expected to disappear as a result of automation are held by white males without college educations a group Trump won handily Without efforts to ensure workers without a college degree can participate in the economy of the automated era the growing education divide producing the kind of populist backlash here and across the west is likely to deepen Ian Bremmer warns the audience about the dangers of automation at an Intelligence Squared U S debate Can we all agree that Google Duplex demo was eerie A robot posing as a human being scheduled a reservation over the phone We all knew artificial intelligence was coming but it was breathtaking to hear software come to life Before we go any further let s get our terms straight Automation and artificial intelligence are not the same thing According to Dave Evans Automation is software that follows pre programmed rules Artificial intelligence is designed to simulate human thinking Automation in this context refers to the impact of artificial intelligence on tasks that only humans can perform today Even if you re skeptical of Google Duplex in light of the current backlash Alexa has made her way into millions of homes Amazon and Google are proving the value of artificial intelligence to consumers Apple still has a ways to go with Siri While Alexa won t take down the government there was a recent debate about the impact of automation on democracy that s worth watching Intelligence Squared U S features debates about current events Each episode puts forward a provocative motion like Automation Will Crash Democracy Two teams of two debate the motion There are polls conducted at the beginning and at the end of the debate A team wins by persuading audience members to change their opinion Ian Bremmer and Yascha Mounk argued for the motion insisting automation will crash democracy Andrew Keen and Alina Polyakova argued against the motion It s unclear whether the middle class can survive an AI revolution It could leave very few jobs for the masses In this scenario the rich would end up with even more power And without a middle class it s hard to sustain a healthy democracy Not scary enough for you Tech pioneers like Elon Musk and Bill Gates have spoken out about the dangers of artificial intelligence Although Gates thinks Musk should take it down a notch Musk is so concerned that he co founded OpenAI The nonprofit which he also chairs researches artificial intelligence to make the technology safer and more accessible Ian Bremmer one of the debate s participants recently published a bestselling book titled Us vs Them The Failure of Globalism Even though the motion didn t reference China Bremmer invoked the country for good reason Bremmer insists the US could be at a disadvantage Right now it s either Silicon Valley or it s China Those are the drivers of automation Since the actual government drives innovation in China they can leverage the technology and advance it The United States government doesn t have that level of control over its technology sector Moreover based on the recent Facebook hearings it s hard to imagine the US government confronting the threat of automation in a meaningful way Mounk fears a consolidation of power So I think that there s two different ways in which democracy might come under pressure The first is that there s going to be enclaves of very rich people who actually own all of the productive material in society which is the machines and robots and so on being asked to give up more and more money in order to finance that nice universal basic income scheme Throughout the debate he derides universal basic income as a program that can easily be abused Mounk thinks democracy is far fetched in this new world We ve only ever had democracy in the time period from the French Revolution until today when political leaders needed citizen armies when we could rely on average citizens to stand up to defend the country against enemies abroad and to keep the peace at home He believes the rich will protect themselves with their own robot armies and no longer need the middle class The counterarguments from Andrew Keen and Alina Polyakova were more optimistic Keen is an entrepreneur and author Polyakova is a fellow at the Brookings Institute They believe regulation will provide the proper guard rails for innovation That s why they reject all the doomsday scenarios that could result from automation Polyakova also has faith in new industries if we look at every technological revolution we see far more jobs created or people transitioning into a different industry versus just mass unemployment It s easy to hold the AI revolution up to the industrial revolution but it s different While I believe automation will create new jobs the current rate of change is so unprecedented it s hard to compare it to the past Both sides of the debate agree regulation can thwart many of the potential threats of automation It s unclear where the United States will find the political will to respond given its current legislative gridlock The artificial intelligence revolution will challenge America s system of government but it s still worth wondering can democracy survive Find out which team won the

decades These jobs are not necessarily disappearing but they are transforming as artificial intelligence machine learning and advanced robotics tackle more roles in the workplace Policymakers should act now to help New Yorkers prepare for the changes that are coming to the world of work by Matt A V ChabanTags automation new york state economic opportunity workforce opportunity innovation economy tech middle class jobs projectIt has taken decades for New York State s economy to rebound from the effects of offshoring and globalization From Buffalo and Rochester to Binghamton and Riverhead the state has shed hundreds of thousands of jobs particularly in manufacturing and related industrial sectors and upstate job growth has been comparatively slow Yet in the years ahead New York State will need to contend with an even more powerful and fast moving economic force automation Machine learning robotics and artificial intelligence are poised to bring about massive changes to a much larger swath of the economy in the years ahead sweeping not just through factory floors but office towers hospital wards and main streets Automation has the potential to displace workers in a growing range of occupations as varied as bookkeepers and x ray technicians paralegals and food prep workers The result is that both traditional and emerging industries will be transformed with significant effects on New York s workforce This research provides the first comprehensive look at the automation potential of every occupation statewide and in each of New York s ten regions Our study finds that New York State is less susceptible to automation than the nation as a whole But it also reveals that more than 1 2 million jobs in the state about 12 percent of the state s workforce could be largely automated using technology that exists today These are jobs in which 80 percent or more of their associated tasks could be done by machines To be clear automation is not expected to eliminate all or even most of these jobs Indeed this analysis shows that there are only about 24 740 jobs in the state that are 100 percent automatable As with other major economic transformations such as the Industrial Revolution the dawn of electricity and the Internet age some jobs will disappear many will be created and in the end most will simply change There is immense potential for jobs across New York to be transformed Statewide the equivalent of 41 2 percent of all job tasks could be performed by machines in the coming decade On this score New York is actually better off than the nation where 51 percent of all job tasks could be done by machines according to an analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute on which this report is based This is not to suggest that 41 percent of jobs in the state will be eliminated that is simply the scope of job responsibilities that could change as more of today s work whether taking orders entering data or even driving is done by machines The potential for automation is spread fairly evenly across the state Of all regions the automation potential is highest in Western New York where 44 5 percent of all job tasks could be done using existing technology Other regions with high automation potential include Central New York 44 4 percent the North Country 44 3 percent the Mohawk Valley 43 8 percent and Long Island 43 7 New York City has the lowest potential for automation as detailed by the Center in a January report just 39 percent of jobs in the five boroughs stand a high likelihood of being automated But other regions also have a comparatively lower potential for automation such as the Capital Region 42 percent and the Hudson Valley 42 2 percent 1 This research part of our Middle Class Jobs Project a research initiative funded by Fisher Brothers and Winston C Fisher also finds that the jobs that offer New Yorkers a foothold in the economy and a gateway to the middle class are the ones most threatened by automation Such is the case with the state s roughly 155 000 food preparers and servers including fast food workers the largest group whose tasks are highly susceptible to automation 87 percent of their job tasks could be automated It s also the case for the state s 124 000 accounting and bookkeeping clerks 86 percent automation potential and the 181 000 who drive tractor trailers delivery trucks and buses 78 to 85 percent automation potential Additionally there are 112 000 stock clerks and 34 000 dishwashers whose jobs are all roughly 86 percent automatable Even among the state s 20 000 chief executives computers will be able to perform 25 percent of their work in the coming decades That s a notch more vulnerable than the state s 211 000 janitors since machines are predicted to do only 22 percent of all custodial tasks although smart mops could well become part of the job We also conclude that the strongest effects are on lower and middle income jobs the first rungs of the state s economic ladder where the impact of automation is likely to be significant Among the 100 most automatable occupations in the state with at least 1 000 workers 68 percent make less than 40 000 per year while 31 percent make between 40 000 and 80 000 annually and only one of those positions crane operators makes more In total the equivalent of 186 billion wages could be impacted by automation Precisely because it will be difficult to predict exactly which jobs will be impacted by automation and where policymakers business leaders and educators across New York have all the more reason to start preparing now In many parts of the state the same communities that have struggled with the loss of industrial and manufacturing jobs are likely to confront even greater challenges in the years ahead Meanwhile areas that have benefited from new jobs in industries like restaurants and retail will not be immune to the forces of automation Preparing New York State for the future of work is a job that starts today Automation and the Empire StateThe effects of automation will be felt in every corner of the state although some regions rely more heavily on highly automatable jobs In evaluating the likelihood that a machine could perform each job s component tasks this analysis reveals which occupations are most likely to be augmented and supplanted in the decades to come One key factor in determining automatability is the prevalence of work that is highly routine whether physically or cognitively Where job tasks are more variable relying on interpersonal relationships and quick judgement calls humans continue to have the edge The effects of automation may no longer be confined to the factory floor but production occupations remain the most susceptible to displacement That s a major reason why Western New York where manufacturing still accounts for almost 1 in 10 jobs is the state s most vulnerable region The average job in the nine regions excluding New York City is about 10 percent more likely to be automated than it is in the five boroughs although rates for every region remain below the national average New York City with a large number of workers in high touch healthcare jobs managerial positions customer service and the creative economy is the region of the state least vulnerable to the effects of automation That said more than one third of the state s most highly automatable jobs are in New York City more than 454 000 in total However four regions across the state are home to more than 100 000 highly automatable jobs and all ten regions have at least 20 000 jobs that are highly automatable This includes 182 650 in Long Island 116 330 in the Hudson Valley 105 200 in Western New York 80 470 in the Finger Lakes 72 770 in the Capital Region 57 800 in Central New York 40 990 in the Southern Tier and 22 080 in the North Country The most automatable jobs in each region are relatively consistent statewide as the breakdown below reveals Close to 2 percent of the state s workforce is employed in food preparation and serving jobs including fast food and those jobs are spread across the entire state The same goes for jobs filling orders or driving delivery trucks As a result automation is likely to transform not only those regions with a traditional reliance on manufacturing but other parts of the state that have seen the service sector expand significantly over the past two decades Automation in New York State Region by Region All statewide data is for 2017 regional data 2016 the most recent years available Capital RegionCentral New YorkFinger LakesHudson ValleyLong IslandMohawk ValleyNew York CityNorth CountrySouthern TierWestern New York Additional details about automatable jobs can be found here Statewide Capital Region Central New York Finger Lakes Hudson Valley Long Island Mohawk Valley New York City North Country Southern Tier Western New York While some regions are more dependent on certain fields for employment every region of the state has large numbers of workers in similar occupations In addition to food preparation and serving jobs including fast food which are prevalent statewide and highly automatable there are thousands of New Yorkers in every region employed in personal care which is quite resilient to automation retail which is only somewhat durable and bookkeeping which is rather vulnerable All of these jobs may change significantly as new technology is developed and adopted but most workplaces will still need help with this work and someone will have to perform it The result is that the skills required to access even entry level opportunities may increase even as humans continue to hold most of the jobs that exist today Many of the state s most automatable occupations are also expected to add jobs over the next decade although an increased pace of technology adoption could change this Such trends may appear to counter the headlines of kiosk filled McDonald s restaurants and Shake Shacks and autonomous Tesla built tractor trailers although some of these changes are already underway The tipping point for many jobs may well be more than a decade out however the growth of jobs in highly vulnerable industries only underscores the urgent need to prepare the state s workforce for the changes to come There are some regional variations The persistence of manufacturing jobs which account for 9 percent of all jobs in Western New York and 6 percent in Central New York could help explain why both are relatively more vulnerable than New York City 2 percent the Capital Region 4 percent and the Hudson Valley 3 4 percent Long Island s large share of jobs that are at least 50 percent automatable may have some correlation with a higher number of office administrative positions which are almost one in five jobs in Nassau and Suffolk counties That compares to one in six on average in the state and in New York City The five boroughs also employ a lower number of workers in transportation fields 4 9 percent than is typical in the rest of the state 5 3 percent Indeed all manner of factors not just economic or technical could determine whether a business decides to replace some or all of its workers with machines It is not just a matter of how soon fully autonomous dishwashers can be developed but if it would be worth paying to buy and maintain such a machine when most human dishwashers make minimum wage In other cases the complexity of job tasks is a key determinant while accounting clerks whose job tasks consist largely of routine data entry are highly vulnerable to automation accountants are the second largest highly resilient occupation in the state There are also political factors powerful unions have kept subway and train conductors employed despite automatability rates approaching 95 percent and social ones There are some 151 380 waiters in the state the 11th largest profession and just over three quarters of their work 76 9 percent is automatable Yet many people go out to eat as a special treat and value the human connection that a server provides and restaurants may find that humans are more effective at upselling a second round of drinks than any robot However some venues and businesses like airport terminals and fast food outlets have demonstrated a willingness to make this shift leading to the even higher automatability of fast food workers and the heightened risks for the entry level positions with the lowest barriers to entry Although relatively few of the fastest growing occupations in New York State are highly automatable the vast majority of growing fields will experience major changes The average automation potential of the 50 fastest growing occupations is nearly 39 percent This approaches the statewide average and is a reminder of just how much most jobs will change with two in five job tasks able to be done by machines instead of people in the near future Jobs in Major Occupational Categories That Are at Least Half Automatable All statewide data is for 2017 regional data 2016 the most recent years available As a result New Yorkers will require a new level of tech fluency to be prepared for the jobs of tomorrow many of which will become augmented by computers robots artificial intelligence and machine learning For example retail workers may need to manage Internet connected point of sale and inventory management systems and build advanced customer profiles while personal care workers may need to update client records using their smartphones or set up remote doctor visits via FaceTime Critical thinking adaptability and the ability to learn new tools will be crucial for most workers in the future as it should be now for the policymakers educators and business leaders responsible for preparing for the coming world of work The promise of automation is as great as any perceived peril but only if New Yorkers are ready to tackle these new and evolving occupations Photo Credit Franck V

Agenda intertwines agencies and initiatives governmentwide in a strategy to overhaul federal IT data management and workforce infrastructures But few agencies have the potential to feel that impact like the Office of Personnel Management Tasked with bringing more IT and cybersecurity talent into the government at a time when both are in high demand globally the agency must also navigate the fundamental reshaping of the government s civilian workforce which is increasingly being fueled by the emergence of technologies like artificial intelligence and automation In its Federal Workforce Priorities Report released last week OPM estimates that 45 percent of work activities could be automated today based on technology available in 2016 and five percent of all federal jobs could be done completely by machines That leaves the agency at a crossroads in how it shapes the future of the federal workforce and the services it will provide said Don Kettl a professor at the University of Maryland s School of Public Policy and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution This will not be your mother and father s OPM by the time we are done for sure he said The idea of managing an OPM purely on the basis of trying to create rules to make the existing system work will be a pretty bad fit for the system we know we are going to need To capitalize on a seismic change in the nature of work combined with a shrinking federal workforce the Trump administration and OPM have proposed an initiative to reskill some existing federal workers to into higher value work activities jobs while leveraging automation technology to streamline administrative functions As part of the PMA the Office of Management and Budget and its Office of Federal Procurement Policy will identify three areas suited for automation and develop pilots for them by the first quarter of 2019 By the second quarter of 2019 OMB will develop a plan to reskill federal workers impacted by automation efforts while an OPM pilot will assess the skills those employees will need The results of those pilots could be pivotal for agencies looking to stretch their budget said Mallory Barg Bulman vice president of research and evaluation at the Partnership for Public Service Bulman said a January 2018 report conducted by the Partnership and the IBM Center for The Business of Government found federal entities like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Air Force were already leveraging AI to gain efficiencies in how they collect data and navigate acquisition rules and regulations Federal agencies are looking for ways to do more with less she said The places where we ve seen it be successful are places where agencies have taken routine and tedious tasks and really found ways to automate it But even with the capabilities and resources gained by automation the emphasis placed on employee skills and the ability to recruit and retain those employees becomes greater and that s where OPM s role in reskilling and training becomes even more pronounced The truth is providing opportunities for training can really be a profound retention tool Bulman said When we looked at the Best Places to Work in the Federal Government scores for the Senior Executive Service members particularly those who were new to the SES and on the younger end training was the most powerful predictor of their intent to stay But because the PMA tries to tackle government s most difficult challenges in order to modernize it Kettl said OPM s role will be paramount We try to think broadly about the strategic role of government and the strategic transformation of its workforce to make that happen This is a very big deal he said It s something that s very important very fundamental and something that will require a very fundamental rethinking of the role of OPM in particular along the way New studies shed light on the job security of certain government jobs in an increasingly digital age Automation has already altered several industries and it s only a matter of time before it transforms more of them Given that many governments continue to grapple with tight budgets and suppressed staffing levels it s worth considering whether they might one day rely more on automation and technology to carry out tasks performed by humans Recent studies have shed some light on what this might look like particularly in the public sector Automation has already made some forays into government Kirke Everson a KPMG intelligent automation consultant cited chatbots utilized in call centers as an example He suggested that automation could soon replace personnel who perform repetitive back office tasks such as eligibility checks and other procedures following a defined set of rules Government is ripe for automation Everson says But if it requires a large amount of judgments or human interaction maybe you don t start there In the U K an estimated 861 000 public sector jobs could be automated by 2030 according to an analysis by Deloitte and Oxford University Administrative and operative roles which account for 27 percent of the public workforce were identified as having the highest probability of being automated These types of jobs are already declining and the report projects their numbers in the U K to fall further from 87 000 in 2015 to only 4 000 by 2030 A separate Oxford University study examined U S job occupations deeming about 47 percent of total employment in both government and the private sector to be at risk of computerization Some public sector roles considered most vulnerable included library workers postal service clerks and transportation inspectors all positions with highly repetitive tasks Many of the other occupations researchers identified were especially common in transportation These included bus drivers and subway or streetcar operators as well as highway maintenance workers tablecaption font size 11px margin bottom 30px line height

occupations Source The Future of Employment How Susceptible are Jobs to Computerisation by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A Osborne But does this mean large numbers of public employees will one day be out of work Historically industrialization and improvements in technology haven t caused higher long term unemployment It s unknown whether this time will be any different though with economists offering different predictions for automation s effects Neil Reichenberg who heads the International Public Management Association for Human Resources views it more as a shift It s not so much cutting staff as it is moving people to more strategic higher level work he says While technology has already reshaped countless occupations across just about every segment of the economy it hasn t yet prompted the complete elimination of many types of jobs Consider teachers who employ greater use of educational software programs in classrooms These and other types of public employee positions haven t vanished but they do require greater tech skills than in years past Although some might associate automation with armies of robots it s computers that are most responsible for redefining work these days A recent Brookings Institution report assessed digitization or the degree of computer skills and related knowledge typically required of various occupations Several public sector jobs that required few digital skills in 2002 now mandate at least mid level proficiency of computers or other devices Parking enforcement workers and compliance officers for example might have relied entirely on paper records not long ago Today the Brookings data suggests digital skills for these occupations have jumped considerably over the past decade Source Brookings analysis of O Net OES and Moody s data In some ways automating various aspects of jobs could prove to be more difficult in the public sector than in the private sector Unions Reichenberg says will likely oppose efforts expected to result in job losses Last year the union membership rate for government workers was more than five times that of the private sector Still if automation offers governments ways to cut costs without sacrificing quality of services they ll likely consider it Resources remain limited Revenues aren t expected to grow much and total state and local government employment is still below levels reached a decade ago In some jurisdictions automated processes or technologies could enable governments to provide services that otherwise wouldn t be available It s inevitable Reichenberg says If you look at

work naturally raises a number of questions It is no wonder Argentina put it on the agenda as one of three priorities to be discussed at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires Will its impact be the same across the globe What jobs will be most affected What new skillsets will be required But above all how can governments prepare and what role can Multilateral Development Banks play All four leading regional development banks recently came together in Washington to present some key perspectives regarding the jobs of the future which can be found in the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives Here are a few worth considering On the one hand Emerging Europe Developing Asia Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean are witnessing how robotics automation and artificial intelligence are lowering costs and increasing productivity providing an opportunity for accelerated growth Countries like Estonia have taken the lead in digital technology youth in Nigeria and Ethiopia are harnessing technology to boost yields in agriculture in Vietnam and Bangladesh Information and Communication Technologies ICT is boosting the service industry and across Latin America and the Caribbean smartphone adoption is expected to reach beyond 70 by 2020 On the other hand as a result of this new wave of technological advances known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution a series of myths emerge that it is important to clarify Myth 1 All regions will be impacted in the same way The truth is that technology will be adopted at varying speeds depending on the region s economic development and demographic trends An aging population in Emerging Europe will face different challenges than Africa where 12 to 15 million young people enter the job market each year Myth 2 Mass unemployment is unavoidable The truth is that the jobless rate will be lower than originally expected Mass unemployment is unlikely to become a reality But the shifts in job opportunities will certainly require flexibility and access to new training tools which may in turn be provided by technology itself Myth 3 Automation will replace all human jobs and tasks The truth is that automation only takes place where it is both technically and economically feasible A human workforce will still be required in most sectors particularly those such as health and education At the same time it would be foolish to ignore the genuine threats of unemployment and increased income inequality that the rapid expansion of new technology will generate Above all as Multilateral Development Banks the question we need to be asking is how can governments ease the transition What can governments do to ensure that the largest number of people possible benefit from this transition Policymakers can take four actions to ease the adoption of technology while mitigating potentially adverse effects on jobs and incomes Multilateral Development Banks certainly have their own role to play not only by acting as think tanks for initiatives on how to capitalize on new technologies and mitigate their negative effects but also in coordinating global or regional policy responses strengthening partnerships between policymakers and employers to jointly identify and address challenges Our products and services will need to adapt A recent IDB health project in the Dominican Republic which uses drones to link remote rural clinics with hospital laboratories is a prime example of this Change will also take place within our workforce Outsourcing the IDB s human resources department from Washington to Costa Rica to ensure efficiency and reduce costs was certainly a step in the right direction It is important that we take the time to seriously identify the opportunities and risks the 21st century global job market presents so that together we can help shape the future of work In the meantime we must also remain relevant for our customer base and at the forefront of innovation Whether we

success of UK industry In line with this it has acknowledged that one of its grand challenges is putting the UK at the forefront of the AI and data revolution In fact comments from Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond have suggested that large swathes of government activity will soon be performed by AI and automation to free up time for human civil servants Automating some aspects of government jobs will result in savings and efficiencies However there are concerns that public sector workers will be at risk of losing their jobs to AI and automation in the next decade Think tank Reform estimated early last year that 250 000 of the UK s five million public sector workers risk losing jobs to AI and automation in the next 15 years Speaking to a House of Lords committee in 2017 Hammond said The government is looking at how it can apply artificial intelligence There are very significant areas of government activity which involve relatively low level decision making which will be highly susceptible to AI probably over a relatively short period of time which does present the tantalising possibility of being able to drive some real productivity enhancement in the delivery of government processes The truth is that automation in the public sector is already developing at a rapid pace New initiatives range from implementing AI and automation into day to day bureaucratic tasks such as form filling and applying for patents to using facial recognition technologies to verify the identity of individuals entering the UK But it s time to stop viewing AI and automation as an existential threat to our livelihoods Far from replacing people AI and automation will transform the workplace as menial tasks and some non routine jobs are digitalised through AI and process automation enabling greater efficiency while taking away some of the strain of day to day tasks In its industrial strategy report the UK government rightly realised we are at one of the most important exciting and challenging times in the history of global enterprise Importantly that report highlights that Britain is well placed to benefit from this new Industrial Revolution This digital revolution will be powered by humans increasing reliance on AI and automation Set to impact almost every sector of British industry AI and automation is here to stay Organisations are turning to digital transformation to boost innovation and enhance user experience and AI and automation will play a major role in this change While some jobs may disappear or evolve along the road to automation there is considerable opportunity for innovation and change AI and automation can give government departments both at the national and local level much faster access to sophisticated insights Combining this technology and big data will allow them to make better decisions more quickly for a greater number of citizens This ability to rapidly adapt to and drive new innovations is part of what allowed Britain to prosper and develop so quickly during the first industrial revolution After all as the government goes on to note in the industrial strategy report We are an open enterprising economy built on invention innovation and competition We have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business with high standards respected institutions and the reliable rule of law We have achieved near historic levels of employment We are a crossing point for the world because of our geographic position the English language our strong ties our openness to ideas and our vibrant culture Driving an automated future offers a wide range of benefits Not least is the prospect of boosting productivity across all of Britain s leading industries from high tech post industrial manufacturing through to the creative industries sector The UK s industrial strategy has already identified the four grand challenges in the years ahead as artificial intelligence and big data clean growth the future of mobility and meeting the needs of an ageing society Astute investments in AI and automation can enable huge productivity boosts UK consumers are already beginning to recognise that more organisations are embracing this technology and the advantages it can offer including within the public sector In fact after surveying 2 000 UK consumers on their attitudes towards AI and automation in government last year OpenText found that two thirds of UK citizens 66 per cent believe this technology will be introduced into government services within 20 years with 16 per cent claiming that this could happen in the next two years The same poll revealed less fear and uncertainty about the introduction of AI and automation in government than many headlines suggest The majority of those surveyed were not concerned about the implementation of this technology in government with over a quarter 26 per cent going as far as claiming AI and automated technologies would be able to make better decisions than most elected representatives though they would prefer for final decisions to be made by a human Many respondents recognised the immediate benefits of the technology A fifth 20 per cent felt that updating processes by bringing in AI and automation would lead to less admin and form filling Additionally 24 per cent pinpointed reduced waiting times as a major advantage while 19 per cent thought that there would be fewer errors in government as a result of the effective implementation of AI and automation This research shows increasing acceptance of AI and automation as a method to improve services but Britain still has some way to go to fully embrace its potential The UK ranked lowest 16 per cent across the countries surveyed when asked if AI and automated technology would be working in government in the next five years showing more hesitance around its uptake than countries such as France 24 per cent the Netherlands 28 per cent and the USA 22 per cent AI and automation will transform the workplace and bring a wide range of benefits to all sectors including the public sector With the potential to increase the speed efficiency and effectiveness of a wide range of government services AI and automated technologies cannot be ignored While the technology already exists the key challenge over the next few years will be gaining trust

2019 Watson InstituteApple has integrated 9 000 trees into its futuristic new headquarters campus reflecting research showing that greenery in workplaces increases productivity by 15 percent Several years ago Google s People Analytics division launched Project Aristotle to understand the components of productive teams embracing research that groups are more creative than individuals Private sector businesses are automating tedious tasks augmenting workers with artificial intelligence technologies reskilling and upskilling their workforces focusing on employee wellness and hungrily recruiting talent Government will have to catch up Perhaps nowhere is the gap between the public and private sector greater than in workforce management Most public sector organizations are still locked into decades old employee policies such as rigid job classifications lockstep pay and a reliance on seniority as a substitute for capability The reality is that government agencies are increasingly called upon to address society s most complex challenges while using workforce approaches rooted in the distant past The good news Change is possible and beginning to happen A new Deloitte study explores some of the ways the nature of government work the public workforce itself and the workplace it occupies will all need to continue to evolve Work New technologies can transform the capabilities of a government worker Artificially intelligent chatbots for example can perform triage on citizen questions freeing human attention for less routine queries The Army s recruitment chatbot SGT STAR does the work of 55 recruiters answering 94 percent of questions A Deloitte analysis of AI s potential found that automation could save the federal government as much as 1 2 billion hours of work annually What AI doesn t automate it can enhance Child welfare caseworkers who according to one study spend just 9 percent of their time with children but 37 5 percent of their time on paperwork could use technology to auto populate documentation freeing time for visits AI also can correlate hospital truancy and arrest records to flag children in danger Some restaurant health inspectors already analyze big data to identify likely candidates for inspections In Chicago for instance tests found 24 percent more critical violations and on average isolated dangers from the food system a week earlier For effective work redesign it s helpful to adopt a two pronged strategy of zooming in and zooming out A zooming in approach hones in on individual tasks and processes that have the most potential to be optimized through automation Zooming out entails looking at the bigger picture to define what work redesign means for entire job classifications departments and the organization as a whole Workforce Specialists in fields like cybersecurity agile development and artificial intelligence are not likely to commit decades to one government position and if they did they d still need to swap into the tech sector periodically to sharpen their skills That s why some government technology programs are taking a tour of duty approach letting private sector experts serve in the public sector for a few years on specific projects without locking them into a lifetime of government work At the federal level the General Services Administration s 18F digital services agency the Oak Ridge Institute for Science Education and the Presidential Innovation Fellows program all help government solve problems with temporary outside hires At the state level Michigan s Cyber Civilian Corps a volunteer group of cybersecurity professionals from the private sector and academia as well as government can be called upon if the governor declares a cyber emergency And long term government workers don t need to be stuck in one place A talent cloud can prepare for unexpected staffing needs by identifying in advance workers with special skills and applying them to tasks suited to their expertise Canada is experimenting with letting multiple agencies dip into a talent cloud and hire workers for specific missions Workers keep their union membership rights and benefits but may be called into service by any agency Workplace Empirical science rarely guides hiring But management is becoming more data driven Applying the newest science on team building personal efficiency and employee wellness to government agencies can upgrade the workplace to better attract retain and utilize talent Insights from studies of the composition and functioning of effective teams can inform decisions about using talents more effectively Organizational network analysis for example can use metadata from emails and other sources to map communication patterns in organizations accurately predicting individuals who will be high performers detecting unsatisfied employees six months before they actually quit and identifying leadership behaviors that correlate with success Modern workplace wellness programs are also extremely impactful Improving employee wellness can reduce lost work days increase retention and fuel productivity After the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center provided a physician and nurse case manager for employees it saw an 80 percent decline in lost work days over six years for a cost savings of 1 5 million In short the future of government work will require a level of dynamic workforce management far beyond the current practices of the public sector The potential for government agencies to unlock more human capital potential and make the public sector a magnet for talent is enormous As Buffalo s former mayor demonstrated to bring the right people together you have to know what it takes to make a project succeed Local governments are using internet surveys to better gauge residents needs Some states are finding ways to make rules easier to navigate and less costly for business while continuing to protect the public s interests The amount of missing and unusable public sector data is stunning Every jurisdiction should be comparing itself with its peers to identify problematic practices increase productivity and reduce costs It s all too easy for team members to misunderstand something Effective leaders know the value of the pre brief Our Deputy Chair Karen Chester gave a speech to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia CEDA WA on 17 July 2018 in Perth Jobs matter For almost all of us they are a source of income But they are also a source of self esteem of social interaction a feeling of purpose and even of community And the skills embedded in jobs remain principal drivers of increasing productivity and ultimately wages So when one opines on the future of work people tend to listen But perhaps when one is opining on the future of work today expectations of the listener are more akin to the BBC announcer of Monty Python s Flying Circus and now for something completely different When perhaps it s simply not so different And I guess that may well prove the damp squib hashtag for my talk today We know from history that soothsayers abound when it comes to opining on the future of work Indeed history is littered with the foretelling of a dystopia of jobless woe or a utopia of little need to work at all And the only universal truth seems to be that they were all wrong both happily and unhappily so The 20th century father of the fiscal stimulus John Maynard Keynes foretold in 1930 that In the 21st century a 15 hour work week will suffice as we turn instead to how to use freedom from pressing economic cares And yet despite significant productivity gains since the Keynes 1930 treatise we still all work on average around 40 hours a week In the late 1970s the historian Ian Turner presided over a major symposium on what new technologies would mean for the worker He predicted an imminent period of change as significant as the Neolithic or Industrial Revolutions To quote By 1988 at least a quarter of the Australian workforce would be made redundant by technological change And a similar adage we heard in 1982 from Barry Jones in his book Sleepers Awake technology and the future of work We all know that the late 1980s did see an exponential uptick in the common use of computers in workplaces and even more so in the 90s as the price of the humble computer plummeted But the foretelling of widespread redundancies of the Australian workforce were not seen For throughout the past 100 years it s been more a case of technology remaining the loyal friend not foe of the worker continuing to remove jobs that are often unpleasant physically tiring downright dangerous or just tedious think toll booth operator More recently we ve seen a plethora of papers and reports produced by think tanks academics consultants and platform giants touting analyses of jobs that could be lost as a result of the latest wave of technological change And that latest wave being the digital age and both the resultant automation and artificial intelligence Some of these reports seem to have settled on a nice big round figure of about 40 per cent of today s jobs now being at risk of automation over the next 10 to 20 years Now most of these reports stem from a seminal 2013 paper by Frey and Osborne where US data was used to predict job losses in the future But their approach left out a few things It did not take into account that new technologies can create new jobs Nor did it contemplate that not all tasks within an occupation can be automated or should be automated And we know that the rate of technological adoption will also depend a lot on consumer preferences do you want a robot cutting your hair and the actual cost or put crudely the business case of adoption Others in taking these factors into account suggest 9 of Australian workers are exposed to the risk of automation So a much smaller but not insignificant number And here I ll mention the must read paper by Melbourne University economists Jeff Borland and Michael Coelli Are the Robots Taking Our Jobs Their work lines up with the more considered studies in the US and Europe So let s look at the evidence a common sense thing to do when in the midst of a chorus of now for something completely different To test whether we have strayed into a world of lies lies and damned statistics And in looking at the evidence I ve drawn on some of the Commission s recent endeavour such as our Digital Disruption report 2016 and Shifting the Dial 2017 as well as the work of Jeff Borland and Michael Coelli and that of Bart van Ark of The Conference Board Overall the evidence suggests that labour markets have been pretty well resilient to shocks posed by new technologies of the past century and even the most recent modern bit Occupations skills and jobs come and they go No matter how transformative the technology be it the telephone electricity indoor plumbing refrigeration air transport the personal computer and today s digital No technology has removed people s capacity to work And in productivity terms all have been more transformative than the digital revolution so far with emphasis being on the so far And a bunch of measures suggest that technology is not having as large of an effect as expected at least not in our current modern times The rise of the New Digital Economy which encompasses mobile technology ubiquitous access to the internet and the world of the cloud is unquestionably changing lots of things But to date productivity is not one So much so that this has become known as the Productivity Paradox So whilst our low rate of multi factor productivity growth observed recently is not unique to Australia it has been observed across other countries too it represents something of a puzzle This is because it suggests that at least in aggregate our economies have not become any more efficient in producing things And we know the policy reasons why productivity may have slowed in Australia but this is notwithstanding our purported better ability to exploit information technologies One explanation for this is that there has been a change in the nature of technological progress That recent technologies characterised by some as dramatic have been minor compared to those in the previous century The other explanation one offered by Bart van Ark and perhaps one of intuitive appeal is that whilst we still see rapidly declining ICT prices along with a shift from ICT investment to ICT services perhaps the new digital economy is still in its installation phase And we shouldn t expect to see the productivity dividend until it truly enters the deployment phase This makes sense when you see that in the US the contribution of the most ICT intensive industries to productivity growth has dropped markedly from 46 to 26 in the past decade 2007 16 And for the US and the UK it has even at times registered negative productivity growth in these sectors Which could suggest that the dividend only makes its way into the deployment and hopefully productivity dividend phase once users fully grapple with how to absorb technology effectively So returning to the evidence on the impact on jobs And we do know that there has been automation of many tasks in the workplace But arguably if technology was both disruptive and displacing replacing existing jobs without creating new ones we would expect to see a persistent upward trend in the unemployment rate And we don t Whilst routine manual and routine cognitive jobs have fallen as a proportion of jobs from 50 to 37 non routine manual and non routine cognitive jobs have increased from 42 to 53 Think child care aged care nursing office managers designers and engineers using software Most importantly the aggregate amount of work available to the Australian population on a per capita basis has not seen a decline since the 1980s when computers became common in the workplace The amount of work available has actually increased by about 14 since the early 1980s But that s not to say there hasn t been a lot of change in our workforce and the nature of work since the 1980s Since the 1980s the workforce participation rate for females has increased a lot by some 15 percentage points to now be just over 60 Marriage and even children are placing much less of a brake on economic participation of women Which is both a good thing for the economy and for women There has also been an increase in the incidence of part time jobs by some 25 percentage points since the late 1960s to now account for nearly one third of total employment around 35 in Australia And despite what some have suggested the pace at which workers are changing between jobs in the Australian labour market is not getting quicker Not only is there no evidence that more workers are being forced to work in short duration jobs but what is apparent is that the opposite has happened The proportion of workers in very long duration jobs more than 10 years has increased from just under 20 per cent in 1982 to around 27 per cent in 2016 Which is perhaps unsurprising when you also take into account the participation rate of older Australians 65 in age has risen steeply having nearly doubled in the past 30 years to now represent 12 of our workforce Also a good thing with our ageing population We do know that more workers today have multiple jobs now around 7 of workers And perhaps of much greater significance when workers do change jobs today more are changing occupations some 40 and industries over 50 And it was this modern day workforce reality that informed much of our thinking around the Commission s proposed changes to superannuation default arrangements in our current superannuation Inquiry And our thinking on what is needed from our tertiary education system which I ll return to later And whilst the gig economy is still in its infancy this has not translated yet to any increase in the proportion of the workforce being independent contractors Indeed this has not changed significantly since 2001 it s actually fallen a few percentage points from 20 per cent of employed persons in 2001 to around 18 per cent in 2014 So what does any of this mean or matter for public policy And perhaps here our focus should be two fold First on making sure there are no road blocks to our economy reaching the deployment phase of the digital or any technological age And second making sure we avoid a workforce of have and have nots in the benefits from the changes in the economy and ultimately jobs A sense of equality in the ultimate job productivity and wage dividend So let me pose a few policy questions Are we getting better at assisting transitioning workers We know that structural change whatever its source can result in considerable work and thus life disruption for the workers impacted unless we get the consequential skill adjustment right So have we gotten better in assisting displaced workers get the right skills to transition into new occupations and industries Recent work by the Commission on transitioning regional economies found that effectiveness of government in doing this is at best unclear Some programs found to be not well targeted automotive industry or create conflicting incentives Tasmanian forestry industry And why unclear use of data to simply track the impacted workers and decent evaluation of transitional assistance are largely missing in action Put simply we can and should be doing better Further it s a tad perverse that if the digital economy ultimately disrupts more jobs we do not use the data fuelling that economic activity to assist those disrupted We know of such endeavour in Germany using data to track the worker and the resultant human capital modelling which in turn better informs what requalification programs will deliver a better job transition to a displaced worker Are the right incentives in place to get the workers to the new jobs We know that jobs at least risk of automation jobs that require soft skills such as good old fashioned empathy account for the largest and growing part of our workforce And the latest metrics from the ABS brand new quarterly labour account experimental estimates reveal health care and social assistance as the largest employment sectors accounting for over 1 6 million jobs or 12 2 of all filled jobs This is largely a function of our demographic changes an ageing population women working more along with the NDIS arguably our single biggest social reform since Medicare The Commission s recent review of NDIS costs found that the NDIS workforce was not growing fast enough most regions require between a 50 per cent and 150 per cent increase in the disability services workforce Put simply for the foreseeable future 1 in 5 new jobs in Australia are projected to be for services for the NDIS Thus care is needed to ensure that the demand for these skills and workers is not frustrated by poor incentives The most notable as highlighted in our NDIS review being the need to ensure the pricing of these services allows this massive labour force response to occur Lest we have a program delivering disappointment and not services to the 475 000 Australians with eligible disabilities Is our education and training system fit for purpose for the workers of today and tomorrow Perhaps this is our biggest public policy must have when thinking of ensuring innovation and technology delivers not just more jobs but jobs for most That sense of equality in who shares in the ultimate job productivity and wage dividend And this was a question the Commission sought to ask and answer last year in our inaugural 5 yearly productivity review Shifting the Dial A policy roadmap for Australian Governments on what is needed to deliver on economic participation and productivity two of the three Ps population participation and productivity that matter most for economic growth and ultimately jobs and their real wages And we identified some fundamental fractures in our current education and training system First deteriorating results in subjects that matter for future work think science maths and reading the cognitive trifecta at school Second the VET system is a mess struggling to deliver relevant competency based qualifications Employers today are more satisfied with non accredited training courses 90 than VET 76 Third universities need to improve student employment outcomes delivering qualifications relevant to labour market needs and at a time relevant to the worker s needs Our key educational institutions seem more focused on research than student employment outcomes which is unsurprising given the notable absence of their skin in the game As manifest in 26 of students today not completing their undergraduate studies in less than 9 years Whilst undergraduate underemployment has more than doubled in the last decade to now reach just over 20 Currently the tertiary education system is set up against becoming a chef at age 40 or a dementia care worker at age 50 Retraining is currently inconvenient and expensive and the approach of educational institutions remains outdated and outmoded still emphasising a one career for life approach Which is not the modern day reality for many workers from the metrics cited earlier Taken collectively this unfortunate troika can only put at risk our capacity to deal with future labour market changes in an efficient and equitable way So we ve proposed a few things change for schools evidence and evaluation of what works with teaching for universities incentives be redressed around student employment outcomes and for work skills government to develop two things First tools for proficiency based assessment for skills rather than simply competency based assessment whether they can perform it at all And second a framework to facilitate independent accreditation of skills obtained agnostic of learning method Do current policy settings constrain us getting to and through the installation phase and on to realising benefits in the deployment phase of the digital economy Today s market power arguably resides in data and content The growth of the digital economy automation and artificial intelligence coupled with greater availability of data and algorithm advances will be key drivers of new business activity research endeavour products skills and jobs In short access and use of data and content will be the determining force in realising the economic benefits of the digital economy and artificial intelligence On data the Commission s report last year on Data Use and Availability proposed fundamental and novel changes to data availability and access policy to ensure it generates new economic opportunities and business opportunities driven by consumer needs and preferences A pro consumer and thus pro competition stimulus with the consumer in the drivers seat for their data held with business and government today And the good news is the Government s response to this inquiry has been one of can and will do The Government has committed to support the two most structurally significant recommendations First the passage of national legislation to remove barriers to data sharing and integration across major public interest data sets and create trusted user access And second the complementary legislated concept of a new general Right for Consumers to exercise joint control in the sharing and use of their data So it s now all down to getting the implementation right On content the Commission s Inquiry in 2016 on Intellectual Property Arrangements examined whether those arrangements meet the needs of the Australian economy And the short answer was no for copyright Currently Australia s copyright exceptions are too narrow and prescriptive do not reflect the way people today consume and use content and do not readily accommodate new legitimate uses of copyright material We found ourselves mired in the wrong debate of publishers clamouring for well protected profit for the purported benefit of local authors For access to content be it snippets of images maps pixels words song sounds is needed alongside data to actually do artificial intelligence But our arrangements unlike those in countries like the US South Korea and Israel pose a seemingly impenetrable barrier to AI being alive and well in our economy For in the absence of meaningful reform to copyright Australia will inevitably and demonstrably be a net importer of AI services and products And fair access to content also matters for education Now more than ever workers need flexible access to ongoing learning MOOCs are a key component of providing low cost and flexible access to ongoing learning And in consulting with the states on Shifting the Dial we were implored to think of the transitioning worker in NW Tasmania in our approach to ongoing skills acquisition especially for mature age workers Yet Australia s current system of copyright usage heavily constrain Universities TAFEs and schools from offering MOOCs So on a final note I ve failed dismally to foretell a future of dystopia or utopia and happily so but that doesn t mean that the deployment phase of the digital economy may yet still surprise us And in reflecting on the Inquiries that formed much of the Commission s endeavour over the last five years or so nearly all have dealt in some way shape or form with the now of work and thus the future of work And in doing so tried to view it through the lens of the needs of workers and students And through that lens it affords a sense of what policies new or tweaked will see our economy able to access the installation phase and realise the benefits of the deployment phase of any technological change And perhaps most importantly ensuring those phases see the benefits of jobs productivity and higher wages shared across the workforce Avoiding a world of technology driven haves and have nots Because that s what matters most for the future of work Follow OnSubscribeThe Commission has published an issues paper and one pager

Final report to Government 31 March 2020Our mission is to help leaders in multiple sectors develop a deeper understanding of the global economy Our flagship business publication has been defining and informing the senior management agenda since 1964 Our learning programs help organizations accelerate growth by unlocking their people s potential Higher costs and rising demand have driven rapid increases in spending on core public services such as education healthcare and transport while countries must grapple with complex challenges such as population aging economic inequality and protracted security concerns Government expenditure amounts to more than a third of global GDP budgets are strained and the world public sector deficit is close to 4 trillion a year At the same time governments are struggling to meet citizens rising expectations Satisfaction with key state services such as public transportation schools and healthcare facilities is less than half that of nonstate providers such as banks or utilities Governments need a way to deliver better outcomes and a better experience for citizens at a sustainable cost A new paper by the McKinsey Center for Government MCG Government productivity Unlocking the 3 5 trillion opportunity suggests that goal is within reach It shows that several countries have achieved dramatic productivity improvements in recent years for example by improving health public safety and education outcomes while maintaining or even reducing spending per capita or per student in those sectors If other countries were to match the improvements already demonstrated in these pockets of excellence the world s governments could potentially save as much as 3 5 trillion a year by 2021 equivalent to the entire global fiscal gap Alternatively countries could choose to keep spending constant while boosting the quality of key services For example if all the countries studied had improved the productivity of their healthcare systems at the rate of comparable best performers over the past 5 years they would have added 1 4 years to the healthy life expectancy of their combined populations That translates into 12 billion healthy life years gained without additional per capita spending It s imperative that governments find a way to unlock that productivity opportunity The challenge is that until now there s been limited progress on measuring government productivity even though productivity is a well established and vital measure of the performance of national economies and private sector businesses As a result it is difficult for governments to gauge the true return on spending and debate is often focused on how to increase inputs and not the quality of outputs Governments typically find it challenging to identify improvement opportunities by learning from other countries or from other regions or sectors within the same country To help close this gap MCG built a comprehensive database and benchmarking methodology the Government Productivity Scope to start to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of government expenditure MCG applied the tool across 42 countries that together make up 80 percent of global GDP focusing on seven sectors healthcare primary secondary and tertiary education public safety road transport and tax collection The research was supplemented with insights from more than 50 interviews with government leaders and more than 200 case studies This paper presents the first version of MCG s analysis which we will continue to extend and refine in dialogue with government leaders and academic experts The initial findings point to dramatic differences in countries relative productivity Even among comparable countries with very similar outcomes the least efficient government currently spends more than twice as much per unit of output as its most efficient peer And while most countries have struggled to contain spending growth in every sector MCG found examples of governments that have reduced expenditure per unit while experiencing improved outcomes These differences point to a tremendous opportunity for governments to boost productivity save money and achieve better outcomes for citizens To realize that opportunity though governments need to deepen their functional capabilities in four key areas finance commercial digital technology and data analytics and talent management As MCG shows pioneering countries have reimagined and strengthened these functions so they play a more strategic leadership role in pursuing efficiency and improving outcomes Across these areas those governments have adopted an ambitious structured approach to transform the effectiveness of the state Please sign in to print or download this article Please create a

with our latest insightsCommentFor many people artificial intelligence conjures up images of sci fi movies and the future They see it as a threat to their jobs and sometimes even their safety but AI represents the biggest leap forward in terms of work productivity since the personal computer and few other industries can benefit from AI as much as government With AI we can change the way government works and help employees do their job better AI is already integrated into numerous cloud platforms and can be used to discover new information and deliver outcomes instantly I like to refer to this as practical AI AI has the potential to improve employee experiences by speeding up decision making and automating mundane and repetitive tasks Bringing machine learning to everyday work enables government agencies and departments to make better decisions faster because they do not have to hunt for data and aggregate it into a spreadsheet By building intelligence into platforms AI helps manage complex workflows and allows organizations to One way that AI will be applied in the workplace is automating service requests Most companies have an IT service desk as well as a customer support center These functions ensure that customers and employees receive help in a timely manner whether it is a request for a new computer a password reset or the status of a repair Manually triaging thousands of incidents or cases categorizing tasks and routing work can consume resources introduce human error and slow resolution In fact a new report from Accenture found that customer support functions spend up to 12 percent of their time categorizing prioritizing and assigning tickets Meanwhile AI accurately categorizes requests nearly instantly It eliminates the bottleneck created by agents having to manually assign categorize and route requests A full two days a week is wasted on manual administrative work according to the recent State of Work survey conducted by ServiceNow If an agency with 5 000 people automated those processes they could get 4 million work hours back a year Adding AI frees up employees to do the work they want to do spurring creativity Nearly half of respondents 48 percent said work levels increased by 20 percent or more after they adopted AI solutions Additionally 91 percent of executives say their skilled employees spend too much time on admin tasks and 93 percent believe that reducing mundane tasks unleashes employee creativity To properly implement AI solutions across government agencies we need to define which tasks are best suited for humans and which ones should be performed by AI The government has a term inherently governmental to describe work processes or decisions that must be done by government employees Contractors do much of the work in our government agencies but certain work is inherently governmental in nature As we move into an age defined by AI we need to identify and define the work processes and decisions that are inherently human We are going to increasingly work in a blended workplace with AI systems and humans working together to achieve a mission There are certain activities within any work environment that can only be performed or should only be performed by humans While there may be many more human activities designated as inherently human in the beginning I believe that as humans become more comfortable with the role of AI in the blended workforce less and less work will be designated as inherently human There will always be a need for humans to remain in charge from factual responsibility and liability aspects as well as from emotional and psychological ones We spend a third of our lives at work It shapes who we are how we feel and how we interact with the world so we must create great work experiences and this is what AI does AI creates work experiences that unleash productivity bringing out the best in us Rather than fearing machines stealing jobs we need to understand how AI will change the way government works though small but practical ways and prepare the workforce of the future for this change About the AuthorBob Osborn is CTO Federal of

for our newsletter I agree to this site s Privacy Policy Thank you for inviting me to speak with you here today In particular I want to thank the Productivity Commission and all involved in the Productivity Hub The previous presenters today have touched on a range of ideas for how we can face the challenge of improving our productivity in a changing world From technology and data to public services and the energy transition I m excited to see forward thinking people working on such a broad range of important topics I d like to commend you all and encourage you to keep up the good work My presentation today will focus on an issue that is at the heart of a productive economy how we approach the rapidly changing world of work I want to talk about how this fits with the overall economic strategy of the Government the core policy areas that we have identified to support New Zealanders in this process and the institutional settings required to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of the Future of Work Economic StrategyBy harnessing the potential of new technology and innovation educating and upskilling our workforce and incentivising research and development we can lift productivity and transition to an economy that is sustainable inclusive and productive That is this Government s overarching economic aim The lessons learned from the Future of Work Commission heavily influenced this Government s economic strategy We aim to shape an economy where we work smarter make better use of our resources ensure everyone who wants to work can work and ensure that the benefits of growth are spread across society In an article published this past weekend Rod Oram argued that we can rise to the immense challenge of making this a high value high wage economy over the next decade The global and local conditions for doing so are the most favourable ever I know there is an appetite among businesses and workers to take up this challenge and I couldn t agree more that the time is right to face up to this Boosting productivity across the economy will be one of the key drivers to improving New Zealanders living standards and wellbeing The Government will put this at the heart of what we do Our focus on lifting wellbeing will require a different approach and different measures of success We want to take a broader view of success and move beyond simple measures such as GDP which while an important measure of economic output does not tell the full story of peoples wellbeing We are working with our Confidence and Supply partner the Green Party on new sustainable development indicators to paint a fuller picture of how well off people are and how the Government can focus its resources best I have also instructed the Treasury to accelerate their work on the Living Standards Framework which measures the impact of policies on four capitals Human Social Natural and Financial Physical I intend to use this framework to inform the Budget process for Budget 2019 making it our first ever Wellbeing Budget By placing wellbeing at the heart of what we do we will be able to measure the extent to which our policies and investments are making real improvements to peoples lives Improving productivity is key to improving wellbeing By producing more from every hour worked businesses become more profitable incomes rise and workers wellbeing rises as time is freed up and purchasing power rises The challenge is how we achieve this The Changing World of WorkThis Government has come into office at an interesting time in New Zealand s economic story Technological advances are transforming our world for example through increased processing power and big data sensors remote work or smart devices The full effect of forces such as automation algorithms and globalisation are not yet known but we do know that they already are and will continue to be disruptive to what only 5 or 10 years ago we considered the status quo My thinking on this topic was shaped by the Future of Work Commission which I chaired for the Labour Party when we were in Opposition It was an ambitious undertaking that saw us engage with thousands of New Zealanders and experts from around the world It is hard to distil that work down to a few points but overall my takeaway is that there is an enormous possibility for us to have productive and fulfilling work over the coming decades But it will only happen if we prepare now We are facing a world where the change has been estimated by McKinsey Global Institute to be occurring at ten times the pace of the Industrial Revolution and 300 times the scale or roughly 3 000 times the impact Every aspect of our working lives is changing Whole jobs are disappearing and almost every job is being re shaped The very notion of what a job is has been challenged by the so called gig economy Advances in technology present both challenges and opportunities for this sometimes all at once For example a company which automates production of its products will experience productivity gains but there might be consequences for the company s workers What happens to those who are laid off How well positioned are they to quickly retrain Could their past training help them swiftly move into other work How can we benefit from changes to the nature of work while negating or limiting the disadvantages We cannot say with any certainty exactly what the world of work will look like but there are some core changes we can identify and the responses to them that are needed This represents both challenges and opportunities How we respond will drive the future of New Zealand s economy and shape how productive sustainable and inclusive our growth will be over the next few decades We all know the story of the New Zealand economy Over the past 20 years New Zealand has generally done well in the creating more part of the productivity equation GDP growth has averaged about 2 8 over that time compared to the OECD average of 2 1 But it s the other part of the equation the resources required to create more where we have been weak Of that headline growth about 1 7 can be attributed to growth in the volume of labour input or simply total hours worked In other words we required strong population growth and more people entering the workforce to ensure more hours were worked in order to increase production More people working is not a recipe for long term sustainable and inclusive growth The portion of that growth which can be attributed to getting more from each unit of labour in producing goods and services has been 1 1 of that 2 8 over the past 20 years that is we are one of the weaker performers in the OECD In fact our relatively low labour productivity growth over a long period of time means the level of labour productivity in New Zealand GDP per hour worked is about 20 below the OECD average The Productivity Commission has told us that New Zealand s shallow capital markets have meant low levels of investment of productive capital the stuff we need to invest in to help us create more from our available resources Our investment in non residential capital per person in the labour force in 2016 was 25 lower than the OECD average In order to get ahead in terms of headline growth we relied on more people coming here to work and those who were already here to enter work We are at a point where the level of labour productivity in New Zealand GDP per hour worked is around 30 below Australia We have to do something different In recent years the main growth drivers have been population growth and a run away housing market That is not a sustainable path and as those forces recede we need to move deliberately and with urgency to establish an economy that is based on a thriving productive sector We also have to ensure that the benefits of this growth translate into meaningful improvements to the living standards of many New Zealanders who missed out in recent years I spoke earlier about our Government s emphasis on wellbeing and delivering higher living standards for all New Zealanders We want to ensure the economy is delivering real benefits to peoples lives rather than simply pursuing growth for the sake of growth Our success in achieving this will largely be determined by how we respond to the challenges we face including New Zealand s productivity challenge With this in mind today I want to talk you through this Government s plan to ensure we are prepared to face the changes that are coming due to technological advances and the changing nature of work In responding to this our Future of Work report identified three core values to drive our response We need to be Inclusive offering opportunity and harnessing the talents of all Resilient to deal with the changes and shocks that are coming our way and Adaptable to be leaders of the change and shape it in line with our values There are a huge range of policy approaches and changes to the way we run our economy that are needed to meet these challenges and take the opportunities that will arise Our Tax Working Group and the reforms we are making to the Reserve Bank Act are an important part of setting the path to a more productive economy That focus on improving productivity is at the heart of the terms of reference for both these reviews Beyond these we had more than 63 recommendations in our report and you will be pleased I am not going to go through them all now I want to touch on just a few of the main themes Just TransitionIn the face of this rapid change it is essential that we have a just transition for those most affected We saw in New Zealand in the 1980s and 1990s the damage that can be done when major changes are made without enough thought or support given to those who face the immediate consequences In this instance I am using that phrase to primarily talk about two things one at a system level the other at a practical on the ground level The government has committed itself to the goal of a net zero carbon economy by 2050 This is an essential shift for New Zealand away from an economy that hastens climate change to one that is more sustainable and develops New Zealand s strategic advantages We will need to ensure this is a just transition where affected industries and communities are given the support to find new sustainable growth opportunities We are in the process of establishing an Independent Climate Commission which will have the job of establishing goals and targets Meanwhile under the leadership of Hon James Shaw a Green Investment Fund is being created to leverage private sector investment to support business developments that will support a low carbon economy Innovation science and research will have significant roles to play in this However New Zealand s total investment in Research and Development is only 1 3 of GDP about half the OECD average When the OECD issued its most recent assessment of the New Zealand economy last year this is what it had to say on R D Expenditure on R D is low as a share of GDP most notably in the business sector Collaboration between firms education and research institutions is low And its advice Increase fiscal support for business research and development Maintain or increase long term support for successful collaboration between research institutions and industry In the Coalition Agreement with New Zealand First we have set a target of hitting an R D spend of 2 of GDP in ten years That s more than a 50 increase in R D investment relative to GDP over that time and will make a significant contribution to improving our productivity Officials say that this is an ambitious goal We believe this can be done with the Government incentivising such vital work by the private sector Minister for Research Science and Innovation Megan Woods has already begun work on overhauling New Zealand s R D regime with Ministers set to discuss officials initial findings later this month We are committed in the first instance to restoring R D tax credits to give firms some certainty about their investments One other key investment identified in our Future of Work programme is in direct support of the technology sector and for businesses to make better use of new technology Research by Swedish academic and technologist Goran Roos found that 55 of New Zealand jobs are at risk due to technological advances and that countries likely to be least affected will be those with the highest levels of economic complexity This is just one of the reasons why it is important for us to diversify our skills base and look for more sustainable drivers of growth By putting the right policies and incentives in place the technology sector can be one of those economic drivers While technological advances present challenges to existing jobs we also have the opportunity to create new forms of work According to NZTech chief executive Graeme Muller only 14 percent of large NZ businesses have deployed any enabling technology for the Internet of Things despite 70 percent believing it will be strategically important for their business to do so Their concerns are largely around costs and changes in technology This Government wants to nurture an environment that gives businesses the confidence to take up new technology Minister Clare Curran is in the process of creating the position of Chief Technology Officer CTO who will report directly to the Prime Minister and Cabinet The CTO will be responsible for introducing and managing a National Digital Architecture and Digital Technology Roadmap They will also work with the wider industry to develop ingenuity and creativity in the ICT sector Our aim is for the ICT industry to be our second largest contributor to GDP by 2025 Learning For LifeThe other critical element of a just transition to this new world of work is how we support people to gain the relevant skills and knowledge We need to both support those workers whose jobs are under threat and prepare those who are yet to start working for the kind of labour market they are likely to enter New Zealand currently spends a fraction of what other countries do on active labour market policies Other countries around the world such as Singapore France and Germany have recognised that they need to both plan ahead for the changes but also provide greater support for people who are displaced by technological change The Future of Work was the catalyst for our three years free training and education policy One of this Government s key policies is to provide one year of free post secondary education or training gradually progressing to 3 years by 2025 In 2018 we will see 30 000 students enrolled in tertiary education courses and 50 000 in industry training without paying fees for their first year of education thanks to this policy This is extremely important for those whose jobs or future jobs are affected by automation and other technologies One aspect of this policy has not had a lot of attention which is for adults who have never trained or studied before They will be able to take up the three years free policy as it is rolled out This can be taken in short bursts or as complete re training This policy also covers the costs of those undertaking apprenticeships and aspects of industry training Because of the relative costs from 2018 this means two years free for apprentices right away For the next generation of people entering the workforce it is essential they are given the skills to be resilient and adaptable In the Future of Work Commission s time we heard from employer after employer that they were looking for people with what we once called soft skills the ability to collaborate be creative and solve problems These ideas lie at the heart of New Zealand s education curriculum but there is work to do to ensure they are developed for all our young people We will be embarking on a host of initiatives to see this happen including reform of our careers advice and guidance in schools to give all young people the opportunity to understand and experience the world of work This will be developed in close cooperation with business and training providers to create a more seamless transition from school to whatever comes next In January Employment Minister Willie Jackson announced the first of a series of initiatives to help give a group of young people who have fallen outside of the system sustainable work opportunities Sadly Maori and Pacifika young people are over represented among this group They are the most at risk of being excluded from the future of work and we need practical programmes that provide work experience to get them back into a training journey In the long term I believe we will need to radically alter the way we think about training and learning and work if we are to continue to lift productivity As the pace of technological change picks up we need to see ourselves as genuinely learning for life In many ways jobs will be events on that learning and training journey rather than the other way around This presents a series of challenges and opportunities for our education and training system that we will look at over the coming years There are of course many other areas of policy response that will contribute to our response to the Future of Work but I wanted to finish today on what systemic changes we will need to ensure we are leading the change rather than being passive recipients of it Active and Capable StateA critical element identified in our Future of Work report is that the state needs to be an active participant in how we shape the future of work It is important to note that by active I do not mean that it controls or dictates what happens but rather that we move beyond the tired and dangerous idea that we can simply leave the response to market forces to decide how New Zealand fares in the future world of work This means working alongside businesses to identify opportunities as noted above in the R and D and Tech sectors for example It means developing a new partnership between the Crown and Maori as the settlement of historic Treaty breaches comes to an end and opportunities for economic development emerge It also means being innovative and entrepreneurial when that is appropriate We are wanting public servants to co design with both politicians and the wider community what we can do to stay ahead of the curve A major example of this is the Provincial Growth Fund developed as part of our coalition agreement with New Zealand First This will see significant investments in the regions of New Zealand to grow sustainable and productive job opportunities The details of the Fund are to be released shortly and will provide some of the most significant development of our regions in decades These will be driven from the ground up with the Government as an active partner A New Social PartnershipIt is my strong belief that the most critical element to New Zealand succeeding in the Future of Work is a renewed social partnership between businesses workers and the government In the course of our Commission we saw examples in both large and small businesses of innovative approaches to this idea Air New Zealand s High Performance Engagement model is one useful example By involving workers in the full range of strategic decisions and change processes Air New Zealand has not only seen significant productivity benefits they have created far more harmonious workplace relations In a number of the new smaller technology businesses we have seen flat management structures and workplace democracy in action that is core to the way they run their businesses These companies give a significant voice to their employees and have seen productivity growth and improved workplace relations as a result We are working with MBIE and others to facilitate these approaches across a range of industries We can also see innovations happening in the way we work An example which has grabbed attention recently is Perpetual Guardian s decision to switch to trial a four day working week for five days pay The move was designed to improve workers wellbeing by giving them more time to spend with family and on other aspects of life with the expectation that this will enhance their productivity during the days they do work the same levels of output for fewer hours worked These are the kinds of practices that we need to see more of If we look at Germany as an example union members often sit on company boards as part of the decision making process ensuring that employee wellbeing is considered alongside high level corporate profit and financial targets It is unsurprising then that German workers on average worked the fewest hours annually in 2016 of all OECD countries with New Zealand workers on average doing 400 more hours every year This is possible because Germany s workers are also some of the most productive in the world I want to see New Zealand reach a point where we are able to work 400 fewer hours a year while producing more than we do today For us to get there we need to make the advances in productivity we have been discussing today Technological improvements will play a huge role in this One of my goals as Minister of Finance is to develop this new partnership at a system wide level to promote a combined work stream on how we can apply these lessons to other industries and sectors My parting challenge to the many public servants here today is to think about how we can do this across Government and break down some of the silos we have created to enable businesses and workers and their representatives to easily engage in such a partnership ConclusionI am most certainly not the first New Zealand politician to both highlight the challenge of low productivity nor to say that we will address it So the proof will be in what we actually do But we are in an environment that has change occurring at a pace and scale we have never seen before We have to take the opportunity now to capitalise on that to finally make the leaps that have so far eluded our country We have already made a start with the initiatives I have mentioned today I want us to re write our productivity story so that New Zealand becomes a leading example of a sustainable and productive economy in which everyone gets a share of economic success We have a long way to go but this Government is committed to tackling the long term challenges that this country has faced for many years I look forward to working with you on this journey Thank you Desktop notifications are on Turn offGet breaking news alerts from The Washington PostTurn on desktop notifications Take a look around the typical home or car today and you can see the impact of digital technology on your everyday activities Organizations of all kinds are using new technologies to deliver game changing products and services impacting all levels of society As more parts of our lives take on digital characteristics it s time to take advantage of computing power that can simplify the relationship between humans and technology to make us all more productive That s where artificial intelligence comes in using computing power to automate routine tasks and provide insights that improve productivity for individuals and organizations While AI is being rapidly applied for commercial use it s also being adopted by government agencies making them more efficient and effective in their missions Working side by side the human AI partnership can handle the challenges of our increasingly data driven economy while enabling innovation that enhances and broadens current mission capabilities Simply put AI is a collection of advanced technologies that lets computers sense understand act and learn more like humans When agencies successfully apply AI models to their data and procedures they can improve productivity reduce risk serve citizens better and free up employees to work on more creative and complex jobs AI takes advantage of vast amounts of available data programming languages that mimic human logic advanced math and the use of smaller cheaper and more powerful electronics to mimic and even improve on human judgment and analysis This all happens at blazing speeds How does it work Here s one example Think about how our world is increasingly connected by hundreds of millions of sensors cameras and mobile devices through the internet It s possible to train AI to analyze that fire hose of incoming data model our multilayered human thought process to interpret images see patterns and report aberrations with superhuman speed and great precision It s not just number crunching It s the application of human like logic to understand data and to improve that logical thinking process over time through repetitive learning All around the federal government AI is making an impact One example the U S Department of Health and Human Services has investigated the use of machine learning and natural language processing two important AI components to become more efficient in processing incoming comments from the public about its regulations Its findings potential savings of up to 300 000 employee hours and millions of dollars annually AI lets you do more with less or broaden your mission with the same resources It will be commonplace within a couple of years said Ira Entis managing director of strategic solutions of Accenture Federal Services The U S Citizenship and Immigration Services has deployed EMMA an AI powered conversational interface that acts as a virtual assistant It s a tool that uses perception planning memory and reasoning to answer plain English questions that come into the agency and guide visitors in either English or Spanish to the right spots on the agency s website This is AI as the UI It s a new way to interact with the agency and it extends the agency s capability 24 7 Every citizen facing agency can employ a similar interface and if they do we ll realize a huge improvement in customer service across the government said Dominic Delmolino chief technology officer of Accenture Federal Services So is AI smart enough to make us humans obsolete No but AI models can seamlessly integrate with the experience workers are already having augmenting manual processes as an assistant reading and understanding forms helping with data entry and making guided recommendations that can reduce errors and even remove potential bias As AI enables analysis of dauntingly vast amounts of data it can help employees achieve significant productivity gains of up to 30 or 40 percent according to Accenture research even with tasks that are already automated AI opens up new approaches for delivering services Instead of requiring a workforce to plow through routine work that low hanging fruit is swept away so they can be more creative in applying techniques or mission processes to achieve their goals in new ways said Delmolino I see AI as a productivity booster There may be some lingering concern about AI taking jobs but that s not really the issue AI is going to help agencies accomplish the totality of their missions more efficiently and effectively The reason those people took those jobs in

large data sets to predict trends and deliver new insights It can do so in an unbiased and consistent manner offering transparency and increasing citizens trust that their data is being used

Harnessing the power of AI Source Why Artificial Intelligence is the Future of Growth Accenture 2016 Productivity growth in the United States and other advanced economies has slowed sharply over the past decade If this slowdown persists it will mean more slowly rising living standards and more difficult fiscal challenges What public policies might quicken the pace of productivity growth in the U S We put that question recently to a panel of experts convened by the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy and the Initiative on Business and Public Policy Here are some of their suggestions One solution to the productivity slowdown on which there was broad consensus was the need to enhance competition Competition promotes productivity growth through increased incentives for innovation and through selection If firms have strong incentives to innovate many productivity boosting innovations will come to market Also when only the firms with the highest productivity survive while the least productive firms are forced to exit the market the average productivity will go up Jonathan Baker a lawyer and economist who teaches at American University s Washington College of Law believes that there is room to improve competition in the U S economy Market power is a problem in the U S economy it s plausible that growing market power has contributed to the productivity slowdown he explains Competition can be increased in a number of ways including by strengthening antitrust enforcement and by reforming the patent system so that patents are not used to shut out potential competitors while providing enough incentives for firms to invest in developing innovations Bronwyn Hall emerita professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley suggested that in some industries it s currently too easy to get a patent Most of us who look closely at the patent system think that the requirement for novelty is a little too low And so we do think there s room for reform in the patent area Occupational licensing is another area that might have room for improving competition There s been tremendous growth in this country in occupational licensing requirements And that s got to harm entry barriers and make it hard for people to move in and out of occupations And it s not just doctors it s things like cosmetologists a whole range of jobs says Baker It also is important to avoid policies that might stifle productivity Some of such policies have been popular in this year s political campaign If you think about the ongoing political campaign the policies that have been given a lot of attention include things like restrictions on trade and immigration These are not the kinds of policies you want to think about if you re going to think about enhancing productivity says Robert Barro a Harvard University economist Policies to increase the skills of the workforce are essential to raising productivity as well Isabel Sawhill a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution argued that policies that increase years of schooling might not be enough She stressed the importance of ensuring that those years of schooling actually translate into skills and knowledge She noted that more than two thirds of young adults today would fail to quality for military service because of lack of education drug addiction jail records and other shortcomings which also suggests that they may not have the capabilities to be very productive in the workplace Improving the allocation of funding to research and development is another area that might improve prospects for productivity growth over the long run Hall pointed out that the allocation of federal funding for basic science R D is skewed towards life sciences and argued that this isn t a great strategy We can t tell now what field of science will be useful in the future It s just like the stock market And so all we can do is have a portfolio that is more balanced in the basic science

add to it One example of such a value subtracting industry is healthcare administration he believes Our doctors nurses and pharmacists do wonderful things but as Princeton s Uwe Reinhart likes to say

06 2017Vice Chairman Stanley FischerAt the Washington Transformation Politics Policies Prospects a forum sponsored by the Summer Institute of Martha s Vineyard Hebrew Center Vineyard Haven MassachusettsI want to talk tonight about labor productivity growth Labor productivity is the amount of goods and services produced per hour spent on the job Increases in labor productivity again that s the amount of goods and services produced per hour on the job are a fundamental factor in determining how fast the economy grows and how fast the average standard of living grows And productivity growth can be influenced by government policy about which I also want to say a few words 1Labor productivity growth varies a lot from year to year but it is possible to discern longer historical periods with high or low productivity growth as shown in figure 1 For example labor productivity rose at an average annual rate of 3 1 4 percent from 1948 to 1973 whereas in the period 1974 to 2016 the average growth rate of productivity was about 1 7 percent That is to say that with the important exception of the information technology IT boom beginning in the mid 1990s the U S economy has been in a low productivity growth period since 1974 The record for the past five years has been particularly dismal How much does productivity growth matter A great deal The person who made that clear in an article published in 1957 60 years ago Professor Robert Solow is here tonight That is a pleasure an honor a joy and something of a difficulty for anyone wanting to talk about productivity and its growth in the presence of the master The reason the rate of productivity growth matters so much is that it is a basic determinant of the rate of growth of average income per capita over long periods 2 To understand that one needs to know only the trick of calculating how long it takes for a growing economy to double A good rule of thumb for calculating the time it takes labor productivity or anything else that is growing to double can be calculated by dividing 70 by the growth rate When labor productivity was growing at 3 1 4 percent per year during the 25 years from 1948 to 1973 it took 22 years for labor productivity to double Looking again at Figure 1 in the 42 years from 1974 to 2016 when labor productivity was growing on average at a rate of 1 3 4 percent it would have taken approximately 41 years for labor productivity to double There is a vast difference between the prospects facing the young in an economy where incomes per capita are doubling every 22 years and an economy in which incomes are on average doubling only every 41 years Now productivity statistics are imperfect in many respects for example capturing the value of the seemingly free apps we use on our smartphones is challenging And many of us who live in the modern age cannot believe that the iPhone has not fundamentally changed our lives It has certainly changed our lives to some extent and there is likely some underestimation of productivity growth in the official data But to figure out whether the current degree of data bias has reduced estimated growth we have to ask not whether there is bias but whether the bias has increased To a first approximation one could assume that the rate of bias is constant and does not account for the estimated decline in productivity growth and that we should not dismiss the slowdown as an artifact of measurement difficulties3 That is the conclusion most researchers reach but the data issue is not settled As Bob Solow famously said just before the increase in productivity growth of 1996 2003 the computer is everywhere except in the growth data And there are serious researchers who have made serious arguments that we will soon be seeing more rapid growth in the productivity data Factors determining productivity growth Clearly a key question for economic forecasters and even more so for U S citizens and indeed for the entire global economy is whether we should anticipate a return of the more rapid productivity gains experienced in the IT boom and for the quarter century after the end of World War II or should instead resign ourselves to tepid economic growth in future years And a central policy issue is whether government policies can help push the economy toward a higher productivity regime In this context it is useful to think of labor productivity growth as coming from three sources as shown in figure 2 First greater investment by firms in tangible equipment and structures as well as intangible investments such as software and product designs raise labor productivity Second improvements in labor quality or the capabilities of the workforce contribute as well through education training and experience Finally innovations yield more or better output from the same inputs the same capital and labor such as the introduction of the assembly line and computer aided product design I will consider the role that policy may play through each of these channels It is noteworthy that most of the recent drop in productivity is due to a lower contribution from innovation although weaker investment has played a role as well The contribution to labor productivity from labor quality has changed very little Innovation Our prospects for further significant technological innovations are hotly debated Some observers believe that we have exhausted the low hanging fruit on the productivity tree and in particular that efficiency gains from the use of IT have run their course 4 Other observers argue that we can reach fruit higher on the tree with each passing year These observers believe that innovation yields better tools such as 3 D printers and genetic sequencing equipment which themselves enable further technological advances 5 For what it is worth I believe the early signs of self driving cars the emergence of disease treatments based on genetics and the falling costs for conventional and alternative energy production suggest that we are continuing to innovate both in IT as well as in other parts of the economy One possibility is that we are in a productivity lull while firms reorganize to exploit the latest innovations it took decades before the full benefits of the steam engine electrification and computers were seen 6One way to ensure the vigor of innovation is to support research and development R D and here the recent record is mixed As shown in figure 3 R D spending in the United States softened during the Great Recession R D funded by U S businesses has since recovered However government funded R D as a share of gross domestic product is at the lowest level in recent history A great deal of the R in overall R D is government funded and not tied to a specific commercial goal The applied research built on this basic research ultimately yields productivity gains far into the future 7 Consequently the decline in government funded R D is disturbing To raise productivity and economic well being firms must adopt innovations that emerge from R D as quickly as possible This adjustment may occur as start ups introduce innovation to the market as existing innovative firms expand or as competing firms imitate the innovators Recent research suggests that all three of these channels which reflect the economic dynamism of businesses have been operating sluggishly of late New firms are not created as often as in the past innovative firms are not hiring or investing as aggressively as they once did and the diffusion of innovations is weak from frontier firms to trailing firms 8It is difficult to pinpoint specific policy actions that would address this decline in dynamism Broadly speaking however government policymakers should carefully consider the effects of regulations and tax policy on the free flow of workers capital and ideas Investment In recent years the contribution to labor productivity growth from investment has declined Business fixed investment rose roughly 2 1 2 percent per year on average from 2004 to 2016 compared with about 5 percent from 1996 to 2003 9 Some bright spots do exist Capital expenditure by leading IT companies Google Amazon and the like has soared since 2010 and investment in the energy sector has returned to life Nevertheless firms as a whole seem reluctant to invest This cautious approach to investment may in part reflect uncertainty about the policy environment By one measure U S policy uncertainty was elevated for much of the recovery subsided in 2013 and then rose again late last year underpinned by uncertainty about policies associated with health care regulation taxes and trade 10 Reasonable people can disagree about the right way forward on each of those issues but mitigating the damping effect of uncertainty by providing more clarity on the future direction of government policy is highly desirable particularly if the direction of policy itself is desirable Government investment can be an important source of productivity growth as well For example the interstate highway system is credited with boosting productivity in the 1950s and 1960s 11 That highway system and many other federally supported roadways waterways and structures have been neglected in recent years Indeed real infrastructure spending that is adjusting for inflation has fallen nearly 1 percent per year since 2005 12 This area of government investment deserves more attention Labor Quality Also important to raising labor productivity is investment in human capital workers knowledge and skills Such investment is a particular issue because most forecasts anticipate that the long rise in educational attainment both for college and high school may soon come to an end One area where policy may play a role is promoting educational access and readiness for groups for whom educational attainment is relatively low Recent research has shown a substantial return to public investment in early childhood education for economically disadvantaged groups Such programs increase high school graduation promote income over the life cycle for both participants and their parents and produce other socially beneficial outcomes such as greater health 13At the other end of the education process a college degree has long been considered a worthwhile investment and thus our society should promote access to and readiness for college among a broad range of individuals in particular through federal support for need based financial aid 14Lastly I will note that ultimately the return on the human capital embodied in our workforce is closely tied to public health A rise in morbidity or fall in longevity in the U S population is not a concern only for humanitarian reasons Workers too ill to perform at their potential represent lost productivity and welfare for society as a whole Research has shown just such a trend among prime age non Hispanic Americans without a college degree 15 More study is needed to determine what policies would help reverse this trend and government funding could likely assist the effort More broadly programs to promote clean air and drinking water are examples of public health policies that bolster the health and longevity of the present and future workforce as a whole Concluding remarks To conclude we return to the basic question How much does productivity growth matter The basic answer simple arithmetic says it matters a lot If labor productivity grows an average of 2 percent per year average living standards for our children s generation will be twice what we experienced If labor productivity grows an average of 1 percent per year the difference is dramatic Living standards will take two generations to double 16But fortunately when it comes to productivity we are not simply consigned to luck or to fate Governments can take sensible actions to promote more rapid productivity growth Broadly speaking government policy works best when it can address a need that the private sector neglects including investment in basic research infrastructure early childhood education schooling and public health Reasonable people can disagree about the right way forward but if we as a society are to succeed we need to follow policies that will support and advance productivity growth That is easier said than done But it can be done References

VersionBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System20th Street and Constitution Avenue N W Washington DC 20551The differences in rates of growth are often attributed to two factors government and entrepreneurship The two are not mutually exclusive In the early stages of sustained growth government has often provided the incentives for entrepreneurship to take hold In some economies the development of transportation power and other utilities has been carried out by the government In others the government has offered financial inducements and subsidies The land given U S railroad developers in the second half of the 19th century is a notable example of the latter Another important role governments have played in the early stages is to help establish the sort of capital and money markets in which lenders could have confidence Without financial intermediaries acting as brokers between lenders and business borrowers it is difficult to envisage economic growth taking place on a sustained and rapid basis In the 19th century most liberal thinkers held that the main role for government in a developed capitalist system was that of a policeman to preserve law and order uphold the sanctity of private property and give business as much freedom as possible The Great Depression of the 1930s persuaded many that a laissez faire system did not automatically provide the necessary incentives to the innovation and risk bearing essential for economic growth This led to a good deal of writing on the role that governments might play in stimulating growth Economists have argued that at the very least governments can undertake to prevent serious and prolonged recessions Only in this way can a general business psychology be developed that assumes growth to be the natural course of things so that investment programs will pay off Growth theorists since World War II have gone further arguing that it is not enough simply to achieve full employment periodically Some maintain that it is necessary to maintain full employment over an extended period of time if high growth is to result This argument relates to the earlier point that two economies may experience the same rate of growth of capital but that overall growth and technical progress will proceed at a much more rapid rate in one than in the other because of differences in the quality of new capital goods produced The term enterprise investment has been used to describe the kind of capital formation that involves innovations and that by building ahead of demand generates rapid rates of growth of productivity or technical progress But to get such growth it has been argued an economy must be run flat out at full speed While this has been subject to some dispute there is a fairly general consensus that growth will be faster when unemployment fluctuates within a narrow range and at low levels A variation on this argument is the question of how a government may intervene to determine the distribution of output between those types of expenditure that contribute to growth and those that lead to the immediate satisfaction of consumer demand Here the choice lies between business investment research and education on the one hand and consumption on the other The larger the first three the more rapid will be the rate of growth Governments giving a high priority to growth have various means at their disposal for influencing it Consumption can and has been constrained through increases in income tax rates The same is true of other tax rates such as the property tax the chief revenue source for primary and secondary education in the United States Tax credit for research and development expenditures is a common method for encouraging business outlays that may lead to innovations The same method has been used to stimulate business investment outlays Easy money policies on the part of the central bank whereby the cost of borrowed funds and their availability are indirectly regulated in such a way as to encourage business borrowing may lead to higher levels of real investment The true cost of stimulating growth will always be a temporary cut in current consumption Only in the future can the economic benefits of the higher investment be realized By the same token current consumption can always be enlarged by a neglect of the future It is even possible for current production to be so biased toward the satisfaction of immediate needs that the productive capacity of an economy slowly declines as capital goods are not replaced Between the extremes of total neglect of future generations and the paring down of current consumption to a bare subsistence minimum lie an infinite number of possibilities The belief that governments should have a large say in choosing the right rate of growth has also led some writers to challenge the social and economic value of economic growth in an advanced industrial society They attribute to growth such undesirable side effects of industrialization as traffic congestion the increasing pollution of air and water the despoiling of the landscape and a general decline in man s ability to enjoy the real amenities of life As has been seen growth is really a transformation whereby certain industries experience a rise in importance followed by an eventual decline as the market for their output becomes relatively saturated Demand relatively speaking moves on to other types of industries and products All of this naturally implies a reallocation of resources over time The faster these resources move other things being equal the more rapidly can growth and transformation proceed The argument can be recast in terms of this transformation A slower rate of growth in per capita consumption will slow down the rate of transfer of resources but it may also result in a more livable environment The rate of growth of individual welfare so measured as to take into account non consumable amenities may even be increased Some argue that in a growth oriented society wants are created faster than the industrial machine can satisfy them so that people are more dissatisfied and insecure than they would be if growth were not given such a high value It is held by some critics that in modern industrial society consumption exists for the sake of justifying production rather than production being carried out to satisfy consumer desires These arguments are a powerful challenge to those who see growth as the most important economic goal of a modern society In discussing theories of growth a distinction must be made between theories designed to explain growth or the lack of growth in countries that are already developed and those concerned with countries trapped in circumstances of poverty Most of what follows will be confined to the former As the British economist John Maynard Keynes pointed out in the 1930s saving and investment are not usually done by the same persons The desire to save does not necessarily generate investment If savers attempt to save a larger share of their income than before thereby consuming less and if this is not matched by an equal increase in the desire of others to invest total spending will decline A natural reaction on the part of business will be to cut back on production thereby reducing incomes earned in production The final effect may be a cumulative movement downward as total demand becomes insufficient to employ all of the labour force This break in the circular flow of income and expenditure suggests the possibility of a capitalist economy alternately experiencing periods of prolonged and severe unemployment when desired savings at full employment exceed what the economy wishes to invest at full employment and periods of serious inflation when the inequality is reversed This situation had not been the case historically for developed economies until the early 1970s In the following discussion some attention will be paid to the

quiz Do you have what it takes for the government jobs of the future tested public servants tech savviness global awareness and aptitude for collaboration and innovation Backed by two years of research it s part of an ongoing effort to understand the readiness of the world s civil servants for the coming digital revolution which is expected to eliminate 77 of administration and operations roles by 2030 Even if your result was The Luddite or Old School there s still time to learn about the technologies and disciplines that will be essential to getting things done in the public service of the future We ve isolated the most important trends here this is why they matter how governments can use them and the best online resources to learn them yourself Big data once a tool reserved for statisticians and intelligence personnel is now indispensable to the functioning of government With it public servants can use evidence to drive decision making rather than guesswork In the private sector a strong linkbetween effective data use and better financial performance has been established but much of government data still lives on paper or in old fashioned systems This coupled with a tendency to treat data analysis as an afterthought when crafting policy prevents governments from reaping its benefits Of course every civil servant need not be a data scientist but they should appreciate its potential to improve the lives of citizens help services function more efficiently and cut costs In the future of work all public servants will deal with data in service delivery which means overcoming a misconception of big data as amorphous and overwhelming Public servants should come to see it as a tool to help government do more for their citizens with less which in this era of shrinking budgets and growing technological innovation is crucial At a time when there is an urgent need to improve the efficiency of public services data analytics has huge potential Eddie Copeland NestaHow to use it Estonia saves more than 2 8 million hours of labour every year through a data exchange network that helped it digitise 99 of government services The system lets citizens pay their taxes in five minutes and incorporate companies in under 20 Police forces in the US are using big data to predict where crime is most likely to occur and allocate officers more efficiently Some cities have cut crime by up to 40 London is using data analytics to predict which children are most at risk for neglect and abuse allowing child services to intervene before something happens The system will save municipalities 910 000 a year Ukraine has clamped down on corruption and saved 37 million on drugs for its health service with a data driven app that compares government purchases to prices listed by other suppliers How to learn The School of Data has courses on the fundamentals of data as well as how to extract map and clean it The Open Data Institute offers classes in open data essentials and finding stories in data It also has offline courses like Open data in a day for government and Managing risk with open data Coursera has a John Hopkins University sanctioned Launch your career in data science class Datacamp teaches data science skills like R SQL and python Dataquest offers beginner intermediate and expert level courses in data analysis and prediction General Assembly has a number of courses in data science and analysis In the US just 27 of citizens are happy with government s digital services Constituents want to interact with government more easily and governments leading the charge in bringing services online are using artificial intelligence AI to do so With AI systems learn from experience and keep improving their performance without humans having to explain how to complete tasks A prime example of this is chatbots virtual assistants that field questions from constituents who would normally have to call a public office or help desk Chatbots which learn from the questions they are asked to continually improve performance help governments serve constituents better and free up public servants time for higher value jobs AI has the potential to rid humans of monotonous work administrative tasks like data sorting filing and searching documents translating materials and drafting briefs among others saving federal governments up to 1 2 billion hu man hours and 41 1 billion annually City officials only work during the day 8am to 5pm Chatbots work 24 7 Ryan Johnson City of North CharlestonHow to use it Governments in the US Singapore and Jersey use chatbots to help citizens cut through bureaucracy and find the answers they need quickly and easily Las Vegas is using AI to predict car crashes with up to 70 accuracy It uses it to warn drivers to avoid the area up to two hours in advance The UK is using a machine learning model that can identify billion dollar pension schemes at risk of collapse New York City is preventing fires by using a prediction tool that has improved the accuracy of inspections by 20 allowing the city to divert crews to the most at risk buildings How to learn Udacity has an introductory course to AI Udemy offers a range of AI courses from fundamental to advanced learning Coursera has a deep learning specialisation taught by Stanford University professors It also offers a range of other AI classes EdX has a variety of introduction to AI courses IBM offers a beginner s guide to artificial intelligence machine learning and cognitive computing Policymakers are often accused of losing sight of the challenges everyday people face Design thinking is a way for governments to leverage the philosophy of user centric companies like Apple which puts customer experience at the centre of product design to solve problems and shape policy Design thinking puts end citizens at the centre of policy formulation in the iterative process public servants form theories about what constituents want by observing them prototype a product or service then test it out on real people This form of empathetic hands on policymaking helps government build services in concert with citizens to meet their needs rather than relying on detached experts The collaborative approach encourages public servants to break out of departmental siloes and tap into more risky innovative service design It s quite messy doing design work But the old ways of thinking just aren t working anymore Sarah Hurcombe the Australian Centre for Social InnovationHow to use it Denmark used design thinking to reorganise waste management in Copenahagen reduce tension between inmates and guards in prisons and transform services for mentally disabled adults in Odense Singapore has redesigned its employment centres to make them calm and easily navigable for stressed job seekers West Hollywood used design thinking to bring the first robotic parking garage to the west coast The US Department of Labour used design thinking to come up with a speed dating approach to teaching job seekers about resume building financial literacy and how to find work How to learn Stanford University offers a world renowned virtual crash course in design thinking Coursera has a University of Virginia backed design thinking for innovation class Ideou teaches a number of courses in design thinking and innovation strategy MIT has a class in mastering innovation and design thinking FutureLearn has a course called designing for the future in which students learn to apply design thinking to modern problems The University of Cincinnati offers and introductory design thinking and innovation course The use of human psychology to drive citizen behaviour was pioneered by the UK government to cut costs and help people make better choices It taps into the minutiae of how people act and uses small nudges such as a text message or personalised letter to prompt behavioural changes The discipline has had an outsize effect on human behaviour the UK Nudge Unit has signed up an additional 100 000 organ donors a year doubled the number of army applicants and helped collect an additional 40 million a year from taxpayers Nudge units use empirical evidence to anticipate how people will react to policy options rather than assuming their response will be rational They have spread to governments across the world including Guatemala the US Australia Germany and Singapore but the use of behavioural insights is still nascent In the future it is expected to have a significant impact on solving problems that stem from ingrained or unconscious bias like gender inequality It s hard for government to admit that something it s doing might not work or that it s failed People are often running blind David Halpern UK Nudge UnitHow to use it The UK Australia and Singapore use a behavioural science and machine learning tool to blind managers to gender and ethnicity allowing them to hire solely

whole nature of work And we need to deal with the massive transitions that are happening in the world of work if we re gonna have a healthy society over the coming decades So how we used to farm was a lot of manual labour and the equipment was getting old and we re dealing with breakdown So we were able to build this facility it s a big technology advancement compared to how we used to farm and now we re able to do less time choring and do other work instead so we re more efficient and it s just a more humane way to harvest milk Sensequake is making cities safer and smarter by combining sensors AI and data analysis to perform structural health monitoring and determine the integrity and natural hazard vulnerability of a structure More and more workplaces are going to need the technologies that are emerging now and in the future And having knowledge of these new technologies is going to be crucial in every sector Skills development is vital right now What skills are we embedding inside of our youth today in order to service these applications service these robots Where are we giving that experiential learning Hopefully there s growth in the dairy industry if we were to stay in our old facility we wouldn t be able to grow it would be a lot of labour milking fewer cows and I d be a last generation farmer I think that Canada has some unique opportunities to be successful because of its place in the world because of its skilled workforce the quality of its education system This opportunity with Future Skills Council and the Centre gives us the time and space to collectively think about how we make the best use of our resources so that we don t find ourselves behind NC INNOVATION GD hrsdc rhdcc gc caWe want to hear from you How do you think the new Canada Service Corps

activity rates between 15 and 64 years working or looking for work has increased globally in the past five years Despite this growth employers across the globe report skills shortages across a multitude of industries While skilled migration is at an all time high according to Hays Global Skills Index digitization is raising questions about who will do the work of tomorrow and what it will look like Over the next 10 to 20 years nearly half of jobs are at risk of being automated particularly in areas such as transportation and logistics office and admin support and manufacturing As AI machine learning and IoT becomes commonplace in professional environments it s critical that people have the skills to respond to these changes in a positive and productive way With such significant gaps in the contemporary workforce governments are creating initiatives to tackle this growing skills shortage by linking education and business to cultivate the employees of the future With the tagline Realise Your Aspirations SkillsFuture is 100 committed to giving Singaporeans the best possible professional opportunities imaginable This national movement to works to provide businesses and individuals with choices to maximize their skills on a continuous basis regardless of their existing knowledge base or starting points SkillsFuture understands that the skills passion and contribution of each individual will drive Singapore s next phase of development towards an advanced thriving economy and an inclusive forward thinking society SkillsFuture not only offers a number of tailored programmes for professionals at all stages of their careers as well as employers and training providers but its e services also help encourage individuals to adopt a lifelong learning mindset The SkillsFuture Credit initiative provides Singaporeans aged 25 and over with an opening credit of S 500 This course credit doesn t expire and the government provides periodic top ups to help engaged lifelong learners accumulate more platform funding to continue their education Result In 2016 126 000 Singaporeans used SkillsFuture credit to enhance their digital careers the scheme s inaugural year More than 34 of applicants used the scheme more than once It s clear to see that SkillsFuture learning model is inspiring positive results and as more people use the scheme the stronger a digital nation Singapore will become The primary objective of Tamkeen is to enhance the skill sets of Bahrainis to make them the employees of choice By offering individuals and enterprises a range of professional certifications and flexible training options through an interactive user portal Tamkeen is helping to drive the future prosperity of its nation s workforce There are three core areas of focus Students To guide and support students to help them make informed decisions about their educational or occupational choices through various schemes involving partnerships with key stakeholders including the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Youth Sports Affairs Jobseekers To provide the fundamental skills and give jobseekers the power to acquire professional qualifications that will ultimately enhance their employability These programmes also offer valuable insights about job hunting CV writing and job interview etiquette Employees To support will help upskill professionals to increase their chances of career development or career progression by using grants and advisory services Result With over 200 programmes currently in operation and an international skills collaboration with the U S underway Tamkeen is set to enrich the skillset of digital learners both on home soil and overseas Skills Development Scotland is an initiative that values the power of diversity and inclusion in the modern workplace With over 1 200 colleagues working across the nation in schools careers centers and designated partner locations SDS Fund is dedicated to developing the skills of individuals and businesses in a multitude of sectors working to make a critical contribution to a bright prosperous and healthy Scottish economy SDS works with organizations to offer tailored advice and solutions based on their personal needs giving employees access to a service that will help them gain more knowledge confidence and competency in a challenging digital environment The SDS Fund works with its partner BEMIS to ensure its dedication to inclusion and diversity is maintained throughout its various programmes courses and apprenticeships something that is essential to growth progress and development Result According to an SDS Fund Progress report in 2015 alone the initiative helped 400 people understand more about and access community services and offered training and materials have been made available to around 272 individuals that needed support And as the scheme picks up momentum big outcomes are expected for 2018 Managed by Pembangunan Sumber Manusia Berhad Malaysia s HRDF is at the forefront of upskilling and reskilling the nation In line with the 11th Malaysia Plan the government has initiated a number of programs that focus on accelerating human capital development in 4 core areas Working in conjunction with the government HRDF offers tailored educational solutions to organizations across the nation providing training in e learning industrial training computer based training coaching and mentoring and more Result The HRDF has pledged to contribute 35 skilled Malaysian labor force as well as the generation of 1 5 million jobs by 2020 And with its current initiatives in place success seems likely Ireland s government driven educational initiative provides a choice of around 208 free part time and intensive conversion courses in the realms of higher education from certificate to degree to postgraduate level By giving professionals the opportunity to acquire priceless digital skills in key areas that are linked to their expertise of choice Springboard aims to close Ireland s digital skills gap helping to foster a new breed of professionals those that can continue to thrive in an ever evolving digital landscape Result 96 of graduates would recommend Springboard to other job seekers a testament to the value of its educational offerings and the organization s blog not only offers a content to help its students stay abreast of digital developments but it also offers practical information about using the platform itself With the number of full time undergraduate students in Ireland increasing by 10 in a relatively short period of time there is plenty of scope for Springboard to help accelerate Ireland s digital skills progress even further Dedicated to the growth and development of digital skills the Tech Partnership exists to cultivate the digital professionals of tomorrow and its membership is free to all employers of tech professionals in the UK This innovative partnership is a network of employers working in close collaboration with one common goal to create the skills needed to push the UK digital economy forward Despite the fact that the Tech Partnership is ending this year the scheme s ambition lies in delivering the skills for a million digital jobs by 2025 No one business can achieve this on its own and the partnership s collaborative approach will help upskill workers across a range of sectors in a practical and positive way The Tech Partnership works with a number of innovative companies including BT Speaking on the partnership BT Group Chief Executive Gavin Patterson said We are particularly pleased that industry will have the opportunity to build on its work within the Tech Partnership and our existing degree apprenticeship schemes setting standards and promoting degrees that are aligned to employer needs By offering a range of relevant degrees and apprenticeships as well as access to basic digital skills the Tech Partnership works to set the standards for digital skills in the UK in a bid to nurture the talent of the nation s budding professionals Result With the Prime Minister recently announcing the 20 million Institute of Coding formed by businesses including IBM Cisco and Microsoft it s clear to see that governing bodies in the UK and beyond are starting to stand up and take notice of the world s digital skills gap These six initiatives take slightly different approaches but they all have one thing in common to build tomorrow s digital workforce by offering innovative continuous valuable sustainable and accessible education to today s budding professional And that is the most important thing of all Keep up to date with industry insights and latest news Sitemap Terms Conditions Privacy Policy Digital Marketing Institute 2019In late November 2018 I delivered the opening keynote at the Future of Work 2018 Conference hosted by the University of Melbourne Center for Workplace Leadership 1 where I described how to keep people at the center of the future of work discussion After my talk find a video of the 45 minute keynote here I was interviewed for a short video segment to share the highlights In preparing for the interview I found the questions to explore a thoughtful comprehensive look at the scope of the discussion on the future of work and thus I wanted to share my answers I am interested in your reactions Do you agree with my thoughts Disagree Why What are some examples of human centric approaches to work within areas of high automation I would approach this question differently While there are some jobs that might have a higher likelihood of automation than others especially those contain significant amounts of routine tasks 2 the World Economic Forum has recently predicted that greater than 50 of all jobs will require significant reskilling and upskilling by 2022 3 This means we will need to consider more human centric approaches in most jobs not just those with a higher proportion of tasks that could be automated In the research I ve been conducting in partnership with Bill Eggers and Amrita Datar from Deloitte and Carlos Teixeira from the Harvard Kennedy School through my current part time fellowship with the Harvard Kennedy School digitalHKS initiative we ve envisioned 6 government jobs of the future with a method that puts humans back at the center for both new and changing jobs Putting the worker first we envision future jobs to place human machine coordination at the core in order to improve productivity and decision making while also increasing the well being of the workers themselves The trick is not to think about what can be automated but also what can be augmented If a human s time could be freed up what higher order value could be accomplished with uniquely human skills Might we be able to deliver more value than human machine coordination than through humans alone or machines alone For example Child case workers in Colorado currently spend less than 10 percent of their work time actually interacting with children and families This impacts their ability to most effectively protect vulnerable children and coordinate services for those children Case workers today spend a large percentage of their time on administrative tasks Our research has envisioned a future where administrative burdens are reduced with the application of technologies to increase the time spent on higher valued work for the customer For example some technology applications could include case management systems powered by cognitive computing to ease scheduling and follow up voice based smart assistants that document case notes after an appointment while the future child aid coordinator travels between appointments robotic process automation tools that automatically process a client s eligibility for services on the fly and using predictive analytics and machine learning to prevent abuse neglect and ill treatment Child aid coordinators should be empowered to customize services for vulnerable children based on the child s own unique circumstances Spending more time with children and families is a critical part to increasing the value created by this work and by applying technology to free time from administrative tasks coordinators are able to spend more time problem solving for their customers What frightens you or stirs you the most about the shift from human power to machine power MIT Professor David A Mindell talks about three myths of 21st century robotics and automation in his book Our Robots Ourselves that I think are particularly relevant to shift the focus of this question The myth of linear progress the idea that technology evolves from direct human involvement into remote presence and then to fully autonomous systems The myth of replacement the idea that machines take over human jobs one for one Myth of full autonomy the utopian idea that robots today or in the future can operate entirely on their own 4 So there s a lot of fear mongering about how quickly and how extremely a shift to machine power will happen Also I think what we have to remind ourselves is that human power alone and machine power alone won t be as great as power achieved through human machine coordination To get the most value we need to design machines that have humans in the loop and empower humans to design work processes where machines are in the loop This is where the greatest value lies but is also where the challenge is because most organizations are not good at integrating new technologies into their business processes One reason they struggle with this not far from the only reason is significant workforce resistance when new technologies are forced on them This is where employees seeing WHY the change is important and why there is a benefit to them to re skill is important Another reason is because true user centered design in the technology development and deployment process is not common practice Organizations must embrace a user centered technology adoption mindset if technology initiatives are to succeed in improving the performance of an organization Co creating a visualization for the jobs of the future as occurs in the workshops Bill Amrita and I have developed can be a powerful tool to enable these actions How futuristic or progressive is the research in this area are we finding out the facts and figures too late There is a lot of research being done in this area but often in silos Conversations about future of work are often segmented between communities People building technologies focus on a technology enabled future Human capital and staffing professionals focus on how workforce changes are affecting the future of work Universities and educators focus on future skills and learning mindsets as being key enablers for the future The urgent need is to build bridges across these communities and research areas since I believe solutions will lie at the intersections of the complex topics including but not limited to Technology development robotics computer and data science engineering etc Economics and economic development policy local state and national Education and learning Workforce development policy Technology ethics Labor relations Business and public sector management Human centered design human factors Architecture and build environment design Business strategy Organizational design Performance management Organizational and Individual PsychologyMIT is one university trying to get ahead of this need for interdisciplinary action oriented research through the Task force on Work of the Future announced off earlier this year but significantly more work can be done in convening these communities for active solution development What s critical to do right now in ensuring the human evolves and doesn t disappear from meaningful work In the near term government employers employees and educators all have a role to play to design a future that is better for humans not worse Employees must not wait around for skill development to be presented to them by their employer a mindset of life long learning will be a key attribute for the future employee Learning doesn t necessarily mean traditional university higher education where costs are becoming unsustainable Learning can happen online through local boot camps by doing through micro courses designed to be taken on demand etc Employees must see that change is coming understand the new skills that will be required for them to succeed in a changed work world and feel empowered to take some of that learning on for themselves Now that s not to say that employers won t also have an important role to play in training employees in the skills of the future like AT T s 1B commitment to re train half of its workforce for the jobs of the future But McKinsey estimates that globally some 500M 900M future workers may need to move to new employers and sectors to find meaningful work 5 That transition will require some initiative on the part of the employee Thus we must create means for individuals to feel empowered and encouraged to do this and reduce fear of the future that could be paralyzing Educators act as a bridge between the future workforce and employers Being an effective bridge should involve identifying the salient knowledge skills and abilities required for the future of work and evolving curriculum and learning environments to prepare students for those futures This requires educators to have a keen understanding of the needs of industry Many institutes of higher education are also completely rethinking how they teach and how students learn and are making education to non traditional students more broadly available through online learning certifications and MOOCs Innovating the learning process itself and the funding model for learning is a critical role of educators and a role all educators should be moving to adopt in the near term Employers must step out of their comfort zone and think about a future where their potential workforce could include not only be full time human employees but contract employees the crowd strategic partnerships and machine intelligence How do you think about integrating the machine as part of the team How does this change the role and skills for managers How might humans and machines combined create a more valued product or service that you provide today The challenge is to not think about the application of machines as an efficiency gain to cut overall costs by reducing human labor but to think about how machines augment humans who can provide higher order cognitive value to the organization Employers should also actively engage their workforce in designing the jobs of the future jobs that use technology to augment current work and that add new value Current employees see problems on the front line and opportunities for additional value creation that management and senior leadership often doesn t see That front line intelligence should be incorporated into designing jobs of the future Designing a future organizational model that harnesses an agile way to leverage human machine coordination to add value is a business imperative Further employers have to be obsessed with creating a learning environment in their organizations This environment should teach existing employees how to fail fast and adapt to changing technologies and customer information regularly but also help new employees onboard much more quickly due to the increasing fluidity of the workforce and increasing incidence of telework remote teams Governments must set economic workforce development training education and technology policies that consider the interdisciplinary issues of the future of work But their role is not only limited to policy making through laws and executive orders They could also Leverage convening power to create a cross sector agenda Encourage experimentation at the state and local level as test beds for national policy Fund programs to re skill employees in parts of the economy that might not be able to afford to do it themselves like small to mid size manufacturers Consider government agency roles and responsibilities to see if policy making across different interdisciplinary areas should be better coordinated Encourage policy making that includes a participatory element to ensure the voices and values of the public not just organizational stakeholders are considered when evaluating policy solutions Ensure trade offs between technology ethics and societal values are considered in economic growth policies Initiate diplomatic efforts to address inequality issues in the future of work EtcMcKinsey 6 Bain 7 and others have also made recent recommendations on what these groups can do to prepare for the future of work How do we rein in the growth of inequality as technology shifts the balance of power and opportunity in society New technology throughout history has been accompanied by fear of that technology Malcolm Frank and others in their book What to Do when Machines do Everything note Many seem to forget that throughout history automation has provided a net benefit to society In the process of automating our work and our society through generation after generation three positive things have repeatedly occurred 1 A new abundance has been created sales of products and services produced by automation now vastly more affordable and of higher quality skyrocket2 With the new abundance overall employment rises even when there is less labor input per unit 3 Society gains a net benefit with higher living standards created by newly affordable products and services 8 However this fourth work revolution does have some unique issues to consider with respect to furthering inequality A primary issue involves the coding of biases into future decision making structures and thus significant discussions have emerged on the ethical use of AI This discussion can often be about how to ensure that the algorithm developers aren t coding their own personal biases into technologies But it can also be about the data that we are using to train our AI if training data is biased or not representative of broader society then we could be making incorrect diagnoses faster or forgetting entire populations in the future we re optimizing for For example a 2010 report from the University of British Columbia warned against the danger of assuming that all of humanity s psychology closely matches the behaviors of 20 something college students They cite evidence that between 2003 and 2007 undergrads made up 80 percent of study subjects in six top psychology journals and that 96 percent of all psychology samples come from countries that make up only 12 percent of the world s population 9 The researchers refer to the sample population as mostly coming from Western Educated Industrialized Rich Democratic WEIRD populations So if a future AI therapist were trained off this data set the accuracy of diagnosis and the effectiveness of treatment may likely underperform with underrepresented communities in the dataset We must be vigilant against potential bias both in our training research data as well as the humans coding the rules else we are likely to further encourage inequitable application of technology What can only humans do and how will this change improve be compromised in the future work economy Humans are still vastly better at problem solving communication knowledge sharing collaboration leadership creativity empathy and the ability to cope with ambiguity and uncertainty 10 In some jobs that conduct routine cognitive tasks machines can actually become smarter than humans when powered by vast amounts of data These jobs may include call centers auditing insurance underwriting and basic tax preparation Some creative cognitive jobs may also be replaced For example powered by significant amounts of viewer data Netflix can set the parameters to create new TV series and movies they know will be enjoyed by their population As described by Jessica Brillhart AI is also creating beautiful art This means humans will need to perform more sophisticated cognitive tasks in the future of work Mohanbir Sawhney suggests a few such jobs in Forbes like managing and designing the future human machine teams and jobs that require social intelligence like providing care to humans nurses counselors physical therapists Also he notes as technology improves the quality of life for society humans may have more free time for leisure which could increase employment in the entertainment and leisure industries 11 All previous work revolutions agricultural and industrial have unlocked new industries and thus new opportunities for jobs while improving the overall quality of life of society though there could be much vigorous debate on the nuances of this statement If history is our guide we would expect to see the same net change over time though the times that society undergoes that transition can be very difficult The relatively good news here is that the transition may be quick occurring within one person s lifetime and not over the course of three lifetimes like previous revolutions This will significantly impact a generation but the overall transition time may be shorter Thus we have an urgent need to act now to minimize the negative effects on this generation with overall progress vigorous guard against embedded bias and human quality of life and equity top of mind References 1 Important Note My work on the Future of Work is conducted as an outside activity from my NASA duties My Future of Work research is done in affiliation with

economic trends will reshape labour markets we will have a better understanding of what we should be emphasizing in our educational and training systems to be as well prepared as possible for tomorrow s world Rapid advances in artificial intelligence and robotics have in particular created a new momentum to understand exactly how widespread the impacts of technology will be on jobs But what if this focus is misplaced The inherent unpredictability of technological progress means that even within the literature on automation there are projected ranges for developed countries from 5 percent of jobs to 50 percent of jobs being at risk of automation with figures even higher than this for developing countries The timeframes for these impacts are similarly broad ranging from 10 20 years to 50 years in other estimates Layered onto the direct uncertainty around depth of impacts and timescale are unanswerable questions around the social norms and preferences which may influence how quickly if at all technological solutions replace humans Then there is the question of technologies that are still at nascent stages or that will only emerge in the coming years Will emerging technologies such as blockchain make intermediaries like Airbnb and Uber less relevant in 2 years or 10 years How quickly will autonomous vehicles eliminate the jobs of drivers around the world Uncertainty makes policy responses to specific potential outcomes challenging and makes the need for non path dependent responses critical These challenges are exacerbated by the cross cutting nature of the future of work policy issue touching as it does on economic social regulatory and technological issues A forthcoming report from the Mowat Centre at the University of Toronto argues that policymakers should focus their attention on upgrading the systems that support workers and young people and ensuring those systems are prepared to thrive in a world of increased uncertainty volatility and disruption Whether the primary and secondary education systems unemployment and training schemes or housing health and social supports existing policy and service delivery frameworks in many countries were designed for the industrial age and do not take advantage of nor reflect the digital age in which we live today Policymakers should focus their attention on upgrading the systems that support workers and young people and ensuring those systems are prepared to thrive in a world of increased uncertainty volatility and disruption For instance unemployment schemes in both Canada and America are straining to meet the needs of labour markets characterized by more part time temporary and contract workers Both countries are at record low rates of coverage for income supports for the unemployed Fewer than one in three unemployed Americans now receive benefits and for those who qualify benefits replace a smaller percentage of wages than before 2 Similarly only 39 percent of unemployed Canadians receive regular benefits down from over 80 percent in 1978 3 As more workers are engaged in non standard forms of employment fewer workers are completing enough hours to pass eligibility thresholds Those who do qualify often do not receive payments for very long Developing unemployment programs that provide more targeted outcomes based and personalized supports is only going to become more pressing in a future where we can expect more workers in the contingent on demand workforce Reforms that focus on developing systems that are resilient and responsive are more likely to have relevance than re orienting programs around predictions about what types of occupations are likely to be in demand 10 or 20 years from now A clear example of the risks of future casting skills and occupations presents itself in the area of computer programming Governments from New York to England to Singapore have decided that coding will be a growth area in the economy and that they should begin to train young children to acquire these skills While there may well be value in training more young people to be comfortable with computers and how they work and skills such as problem solving and logic can be enhanced through such efforts there is an open question about whether coding will actually be an area where humans will have much of a role in the future As American software entrepreneur Mark Cuban has observed coding could well be automated within five years and a better focus for skills development could be creative thinking 4 Which brings us back to the original conundrum future casting skills is hugely challenging and future casting skills overlaid against occupations likely to be in demand is even more difficult The significant time and effort involved in re orienting educational systems from the primary to tertiary levels means that policymakers who get their projections wrong could have an entire generation with skills that are not particularly useful For policymakers facing an uncertain future the best course is to redesign the systems that will support workers and young people engaged in the work force or preparing to enter it Many of the changes that are required across policy and service delivery frameworks will have the added benefit of not just laying the groundwork for the future but also addressing the real and pressing needs of those who are ill served today by schemes that were designed for a different time What particular characteristics should inform the design of social and employment supports Successful programs and systems in the future will be Two promising examples of new interventions that align with these criteria are Singapore s SkillsFuture program and France s Personal Activity Accounts Both programs are designed to provide citizens with easier access to services that they need when they need them Singapore s program provides a digital platform for citizens to access lifelong learning resources including information about education and training opportunities integrated training supports and an individualized credit of 500 that is periodically topped up by the government for skills development The French model provides customized training supports and credits for people facing different life situations including the employed education system drop outs and those who engage in voluntary and charitable work The ability of governments to pivot programs towards these types of models delivering targeted programs quickly adjusting them on the fly based on rigorous evaluation and partnering with other societal actors should be the primary focus of reform in the short to medium term Anticipating specific competencies and hard skills which will be in demand in the future and re aligning training and educational systems towards them should be undertaken with extreme caution In the longer term exploring the effectiveness of more transformative approaches such as a guaranteed annual income may be required But adjusting existing supports to better reflect today s world of work will go a significant ways towards addressing concerns about the future of work currently bedeviling policymakers around the world The more those supports are customized digital integrated focused on outcomes and rigorously evaluated the more likely it is they will meet the challenges of an uncertain ever evolving future This piece was originally published in The Future of Work in the Global South edited by Hernan Galperin and Andrea Alarcon International Development Research Centre 2017 Sunil JohalJan

technology fields such as artificial intelligence AI augmented and virtual reality AR VR data science digital biology and biotech medicine nanotech and digital fabrication networks and computing systems robotics and autonomous vehicles The rate of change is enough to make parents and educators heads spin but it is crucial that our employment training and educations systems are able to respond to this rapidly changing landscape Having the right skills at the right time and in the right place within Canada s workforce will support Canada s ability to be competitive and prosperous There are many initiatives trying to address some of these issues at the national provincial and municipal levels Some of the larger government funded initiatives include the Labour Market Information Council LMIC which is working on curation analysis and dissemination of labour market information to enable better career and policy decisions The Forum of Labour Market Ministers FLMM is a collaborative initiative of the federal government and provinces to develop a cohesive strategy across federal and provincial jurisdictions The soon to be announced Future Skills Centre will focus on identifying evaluating replicating and scaling promising practice with a significant focus on supporting initiatives to ensure full participation of ALL Canadians in the labour Market Large employers like RBC through their Future Launch program and Industry Associations like the Business Council of Canada and their Business Higher Education Round Table BHER are also leading the charge for employers There is an urgent need to understand what skills Canadians will need to prosper in the future and how we can better leverage and indeed supercharge our current skills development infrastructure to meet these needs Through its real time Labour Market Intelligence LMI capabilities collaborative approach and global partners Ryerson University s Magnet is well positioned to support these efforts to improve Canada s economic outlook and facilitate job creation Let s look at a few of the many interesting reports that shed some light on the specific skills that may be requiredWhat are these future skills In an effort to create a more cohesive and consistent understanding of what employers really mean by soft skills Burning Glass Technologies analyzed job postings to identify key skills not necessary to any specific job but based on cross sectoral employer requests Here s what Burning Glass Technologies said when identifying the top skills that employers are looking for This list also contains a major lesson for educators training providers and employers all of these skills can be taught These are not skills that have to be learned in childhood or not at all That means that educators can build these into training programs workers can sharpen their skills and employers do not have to wait passively for the right workers to come along As governments non profits and a growing number of businesses integrate workplace innovations they must consider how to train retain and nourish the complexities of a dynamic range of new skills including soft skills for young people entering the workforce Five Future SkillsHere are five soft skills identified through Burning Glass Technologies data indicating what employers are looking for Not just limited to interpersonal skills and establishing harmonious co worker inhabitancy effective communication is involved in writing planning customer service essentially every aspect of running an organization from marketing strategies media releases advertising reports and presentations just to name a few It encompasses many integral parts of both employer and worker success Often an overused term in resumes a highly organized individual in any places of work should not be taken for granted Tracking progress on various projects keeping track of schedules and appointments is necessary for success and overlaps with many of the previous skills mentioned Clear concise and accessible writing is always in demand particularly in STEM fields that often don t merge well with the general public due to convoluting language or cryptic jargon In fact there s now an entire field of science communicators whose job it is to make complex ideas seem more digestible Although this particular skill may seem relatively intuitive after all what company or organization doesn t strive for customer satisfaction most reserve it for retail or hospitality However regardless of the sector be it accounting IT bioinformatics you name it building strong customer relations should always be a priority Research is about work that integrates creative and systematic means of knowledge discovery the ability to efficiently source track and modify information accordingly to maximize efficiency and potential Whether you re working in retail or industrial engineering research is at the core of employer baseline skills The World Economic Forum compiled a list of future skills expected to be in demand by 2020 compared with what was in demand in 2015 It s especially important to note that many of these skills are not the exclusive domain of Science Technology Engineering and Math STEM disciplines This list clearly indicates the importance of the social sciences and humanities We need Science Technology Engineering Arts and Math STEAM Soft Skills Through a Diversity LensThe concept of soft skills itself can be ambiguous for employers and job seekers and may rely on subjective interpretation though generally they encompass interpersonal skills emotional intelligence and an entrepreneurial mindset As research from the Diversity Institute at Ryerson University points out in its report Soft Skills Are Hard employer assessments of soft skills amongst potential employees can become somewhat problematic when benchmarks are inconsistent within the same professional academic and industry groups Assessing such a skill set can also pose problems According to the report a diversity lens is critical Because of the way in which soft skills are learned many segments of the population are disadvantaged in access to the coaching training and role models needed to develop these skills and cultural biases may play a role in the definition and assessment of soft skills the report states More research is needed to develop methods and approaches to assess empirically the ways in which soft skills can be defined developed and evaluated In Conclusion The future of work is rapidly changing and we need to ensure Canadians are equipped with the skills to succeed I believe Canada is moving in the right direction and we have a lot of committed organizations and people working on these challenges We also need to remember that soft skills are critical We need to focus on STEAM not just STEM we need collective action for systemic change It is not the sole responsibility of any one stakeholder group

the skills and capabilities of the workforce are vital to economic sustainability and growth Workplace skills include the ability to These skills are at the heart of how organisations function in the digital age Other attributes such as the ability to work well with customers and clients and being caring and creative are also highly valued in some jobs although these are harder to pin down as specific skills and are often referred to as soft skills or employability skills Skills are not the same as qualifications although they are often treated interchangeably However the process of gaining a qualification undoubtedly builds on and improves skills Qualifications also provide specialist knowledge and they signal to employers a wide range of desirable attributes These complement the generic skills we use in the workplace but are distinct from them Both qualifications and skills matter as a workforce with a low level of qualifications is also one likely to have low levels of skills Skills are important for economic growth and prosperity The economic prosperity of a country depends on how many people are in work and how productive they are in the workplace Better use of skills available in the workforce alongside increased investment in skills and training has been shown to improve productivity Growth in productivity and prosperity build the conditions for improvements in real earnings creating a virtuous cycle individuals and organisations For the individual skills determine their employment and earning potential For organisations skills are vital to meeting both current and future business demands To be successful and competitive businesses must ensure their talent management and succession planning take into consideration what skills need to be sourced nurtured developed and retained now in order to create successful and productive workforces of the future To tackle the UK s underlying skills deficit it s not enough to focus on initial education and training The vast majority of the 2030 workforce are already in work Employers understand the importance of investing in and improving the skill levels of employees including on the job training in house development programmes and coaching At a national level too many UK businesses are built around low skilled low value jobs Employers design and structure work in a way that limit their staff s use of skills resulting in skills to job mismatches and stagnant productivity The UK also suffers from poor basic skills weakness in the vocational education system and low investment in workplace training Research for our report Making the UK s skills system world class shows that whilst the UK performs well internationally on the provision of high level qualifications with a large proportion of the workforce is educated to degree level we record only mediocre to poor scores on most other measures A high proportion of our workforce has poor literacy numeracy and computer skills and evidence suggests that employers are training less and investing less in their workforces than they were two decades ago At the heart of addressing the UK s low productivity level and the associated high proportion of low skilled and low paid jobs in the economy is the improvement of how skills are both developed and used This requires better leadership and management capabilities and improved people management practices Our recent report Over skilled and underused investigating the untapped potential of UK skills found that more than a third of workers have the skills to cope with more demanding duties than they currently have At the opposite end of the scale one in ten employees said they lacked all the skills needed to carry out their job effectively Reducing this skills mismatch would help improve UK productivity with analysis by the OECD suggesting that average labour productivity could be increased by as much as 5 if the degree of skills mismatch in the UK was brought into line with OECD best practice levels Organisations in particular SMEs need support to invest and develop their HR and people management capability to enable them to invest in the skills of their workforce and make best use of existing workforce capabilities We have been working to support small firms improve their leadership and management capabilities through our People Skills pilots our report Building HR capability in UK small firms sets out the key lessons for policy makers and practitioners It could be argued that successive governments have prioritised the expansion of the high education system at the expense of further and vocational education Indeed the OECD has identified a gap in the UK in terms of the provision of intermediate and technical level skills Whilst the UK government has prioritised increasing the number of apprentices the overall budget for post 16 provision has experienced significant funding cuts Our Over qualification and skills mismatch research has highlighted the issue of graduate over qualification with government estimating that 75 will not earn enough to fully repay their student loans while too few young people consider vocational routes into work such as apprenticeships While the current Government is pushing for a bigger focus on apprenticeships they are still often seen as a poor relation to higher education Our research Over skilled and underused Investigating the untapped potential of UK skills gives an up to date picture of the state of the UK s skills base and how well workers skills are being used and developed at work The UK s skills policy needs to address the following challenges Skills policy in the UK is devolved which means that any policy initiatives are entirely the remit of the devolved administrations in Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland and only of the UK government when it comes to England The approach to skills policy in each of the four nations within the UK is different However there are some common core themes and approaches including The main development in skills policy in the UK recently has been the focus on apprenticeships and technical education Apprenticeship reforms date back to 2012 and the Richards Review which put forward recommendations to simplify the system and put employers in the driving seat These included the development of new employer led apprenticeship standards and reforms to apprenticeship funding A key aspect of this policy has been the introduction of the apprenticeship levy in April 2017 which sees employers with a wage bill of over 3 million pay 0 5 of their total pay bill In 2016 the CIPD surveyed 275 employers on their reactions to the levy We found that nearly one third of organisations believed the levy would encourage them to develop an apprenticeship programme that would help them to build key skills A similar proportion thought the levy would help them to increase the quantity of apprenticeships they offered However concerns were raised that the levy may have negative unintended consequences squeezing out training opportunities for other sections of the workforce Our survey found that almost a third of organisations thought the levy would cause them to reduce their investment in other areas of workforce training and development A further 22 believed it could also encourage employers to accredit training they would otherwise be running anyway as apprenticeship schemes Interestingly only one in five respondents thought the levy would drive up the quality of apprenticeship schemes The Government is also reforming technical education as result of the Sainsbury Review of Post 16 skills The broad objectives of the reforms are to create a system that supports learners to achieve sustained skilled employment and that meets the skills needs of a changing economy In particular the reforms aim to streamline a complex system of overlapping qualifications into a common framework of 15 routes or T Levels which group occupations together in a two year college based programme with a high quality work experience placement aligned to apprenticeships Our latest research Reforming technical education uncovered a concerning lack of awareness amongst employers about the new qualifications highlighting the need for greater employer engagement and consultation if the reforms are to be successful Education Skills Funding AgencyOECD Learning for jobsDEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION 2016 Report of the independent panel on technical education London The Stationery Office DROMEY J and MCNEIL

big day for all of us who are committed to the future of vocational education in New Zealand Today I am going to talk to you about the need for fundamental reform But before I get into details some important context is needed When the Coalition Government started reviewing our education system in late 2017 I said we wanted to build the world s best education system for people of all ages from top to bottom I also said that to do that we needed to collaborate across the system with providers and educators learners employers and industry M ori iwi and communities We need to collaborate to deliver on our government s clear vision for education We believe that every New Zealander wherever they live and whatever their background deserves access to quality education and training throughout their lives so they can realise their potential and participate fully in our economy and society The world around us is changing rapidly and will continue to do so Our education system needs to keep up Our vocational education system the reason we are here today is a case in point At a time when we re facing critical skill shortages too many of our polytechnics and institutes of technology are going broke The strong labour market is encouraging young people to move directly into the workforce rather than continue in formal education and our system isn t geared up for the future economy where re training and up skilling will be a regular feature of everyone s working life It s time to reset the whole system and fundamentally rethink the way we view vocational education and training and how it s delivered We need to move from a system where educational institutions and on the job training compete with one another to a system where on the job and provider based learning is seamlessly integrated We need to move away from the cycle that sees course delivery at institutes boom when the economic cycle turns down and then dive when the economy improves while on the job training providers face the opposite cycle Instead of our regional institutes of technology retrenching cutting programmes and closing campuses we need them to expand access to consistently high quality vocational education throughout the country We need a model where businesses industry iwi and local government in every region play an active role in driving skills development We need to shift from the current approach where they ask their local education providers what can you do for us to one where they say this is what we want from you We need a system of training and skills development that responds faster to global and national trends so we can get people with the right skills into the right jobs much faster Our thinking needs to shift from the idea that the ultimate goal of senior secondary schooling is to prepare young people for university to add a much greater focus on the career pathways of the two thirds of school leavers who do not go on to study degrees Our Government is committed to delivering a step change Last year I instructed the TEC and the Ministry of Education to begin working with our polytechs institutes of technology and the wider community to identify options for structural change and to undertake a system review of vocational education The Government has reflected deeply on the problems as well as the opportunities with the current system and we have come up with proposals that we think would tackle them decisively The proposals go further than the early advice we received We weren t convinced they were sufficient to drive the change the sector needs We want a system where learners get good educational and employment outcomes from vocational education and training that responds to their needs We know we need to do a better job serving the needs of M ori and Pacific people who are too often under represented and aren t getting the opportunity to gain the skills they need We want a system that allows employers to recruit and develop the skilled productive people their businesses need to thrive We want those working in vocational education to collaborate to support people communities and regions to flourish And we want the system to adapt quickly to changes and to new educational models In the future more people will change jobs and careers frequently over their working lives Access to high quality responsive and flexible vocational education throughout their lives will improve their resilience and wellbeing their employment security and life outcomes and will help to reduce social inequities Right now our vocational education system falls well short of the Government s vision for the future I acknowledge the hard work and smart thinking being done by people in the sector But we all know the system works against innovation responsiveness and collaboration and its current structure stops it from realising anywhere near its full potential That means learners industry and employers across New Zealand are not being properly served The change we are proposing has three main components Our first proposal creates clearer roles for industry and providersIn engagement during 2018 we heard from you that the vocational education system is too fragmented It is difficult for organisations to collaborate and for learners to move between or combine on the job and off the job education and training The role of business is unclear and its ability to influence is inadequate Despite the best efforts of many vocational education professionals and organisations structural features of the current system drive them to compete over funding New Zealand needs clear and complementary roles for all organisations in the vocational education system We need a system in which industry and providers have strong distinct roles Each need to be positioned to act collaboratively to develop the skills that people and industries need to flourish The system needs to draw more strongly both on industry expertise in setting expectations providing leadership and setting standards and on provider expertise in delivering education and pastoral care To achieve this the Government s first proposal is to give industry an increased leadership role in vocational education and reshape ITOs into industry skills bodies that will focus in four key areas ITOs would have the opportunity to apply to be recognised as Industry Skills Bodies ITOs role of supporting workplace learning and assessment for work based vocational education would transfer to vocational education providers and ITOs current role purchasing provider based courses for work based trainees would transfer to the TEC ITOs existing advisory and brokerage functions could be located in a number of places in the reformed vocational education system and the Government will gather feedback on this during public consultation The Government acknowledges that the proposed changes would have an impact on ITOs However the risks of not making changes are also significant disruption now will strengthen the vocational education system for the long term We will work closely with ITOs to seek their input on designing the new system and manage the transition from ITOs to industry skills bodies The second proposal is the establishment of a New Zealand Institute of Skills Technology The Government wants a vocational education system that delivers more for our regions so that every learner has more and better choices in accessing quality vocational programmes and teaching where they live and work We need a system that listens to what learners businesses industry and the wider community want and need and delivers it for them partnering with schools employers iwi local Government and community groups The Government s proposals would improve and extend regional access and responsiveness Making the system more efficient faster and more flexible as well as more embedded in regional labour markets will mean better service for the regions Our proposals would also create a system that makes the public vocational sector sustainable long term and makes it much easier to grow course delivery at more locations Under the status quo most ITPs will increasingly come under considerable financial stress due to declining enrolments high fixed costs and funding that does not reflect their cost structures At present four of our 16 ITPs have commissioners in place and five others face a serious financial risk This cannot continue Without significant educational reform to first stabilise and then position the ITP sector for growth the range of vocational education options in some regions will continue to decline Some existing ITP campuses would not be sustainable The Government s proposal is to create a single New Zealand Institute of Skills Technology that is distributed across a network to offer high quality vocational education throughout New Zealand It would transform the current regional network of 16 ITPs into regional campuses of the new nationwide institute This new Institute will offer work based as well as off job learning with the expectation over time that more delivery would resemble apprenticeships where the learner provider and employer collaborate to support a learner to combine training with work Resources would be freed up to expand front line with programme and course design and back office functions distributed across the network The size and scale of the new Institute would allow greater and faster improvements to provision nationwide Instead of each campus being limited by what it can afford to deliver it could leverage the resources of the whole Institute with a mix of face to face online and blended learning This will mean local communities and regions have more choice and thanks to the Industry Skills Bodies more confidence that the skills vocational learners develop are the skills that the workforce needs Many existing ITPs have special arrangements in the current network and consideration would need to be given as to how these would be translated into the new system One example is the Southern Institute of Technology s offer to learners of zero fees or accommodation funding support Many ITPs also have contracts agreements and understandings with communities and stakeholders that need to be honoured throughout any transition I want to be clear here there will continue to be room for regional differentiation and for a strong degree of regional influence Each region of the New Zealand Institute would have a Regional Leadership Group to map out local skill requirements link with local and regional development strategies and to advise on what mix of courses should be offered in that region The groups would include representatives from local communities iwi hap schools industry and local government By providing a mechanism for local connected leadership we intend to give local communities more say in the education and training that s on offer in their area There could be more Regional Leadership Groups than there are current ITPs putting the local back into the system The Government envisages that the New Zealand Institute of Skills Technology and perhaps also w nanga would host Centres of Vocational Excellence focused on areas of particular importance e g agriculture The proposed New Zealand Institute of Skills Technology will also be a major of provider of international education with the visibility and scale to have a bigger impact in the international market And it will continue to deliver foundation and degree level education as do the current ITPs but as a much stronger and more efficiently designed nationwide institution This is a big change and I know it will take time to process All change comes with challenges but the opportunities here are enormous and I encourage you to share our sense of urgency and vision for what the new Institute could be and do for New Zealand Proposal three is for a unified funding systemA single funding system is needed to replace two different funding systems that are drawing providers and industry apart We need a funding system that draws them together Creating one funding system for vocational education would ensure learners get the skills experience and support they need to be successful providers have the funding they need to be sustainable and to support our regions and Industry Skills Bodies can fulfil their roles The Government will work through the details of the new vocational education funding regime after consultation We want to hear your ideas about how it could work and what kind of incentives different arrangements might create It s important to address what the proposed changes mean for learners There would be a whole lot of improvements in their learning experience If the proposals are adopted learners will be able to move easily between education providers and between on and off job training all while gaining skills they can be confident will help them to succeed in work and life But for now nothing will change for learners due to the proposals For 2019 and 2020 students are encouraged to enrol in ITPs as they normally wouldI want to assure all students that you can continue with confidence to enrol and study in quality assured programmes across New Zealand Any changes post consultation will be carefully managed to minimise the impact on current learners They will be able to proceed with your study through any future change process Course fees for 2019 won t change due to the proposed reforms Local scholarships and fee support programmes that vocational education providers have committed to with their communities will remain The Government s policy of a Fees Free first year of tertiary education and training will continue For international students in 2019 and 2020 they are encouraged to enrol in ITPs as they normally would Existing courses and qualifications will continue International students visa status will not change and all New Zealand qualifications will continue to be recognised internationally I would encourage prospective students overseas to continue to apply to study at New Zealand vocational education providers with an assurance that the high quality of provision and range of courses currently on offer will continue Agencies will be updating overseas stakeholders so they are aware that it s business as usual here The Government sees a strong future for international education in New Zealand and remains committed to attracting and supporting international students seeking a quality education and developing the skills that New Zealand needs I want to acknowledge the uncertainty staff in the sector have lived with over a number of years We ve seen major upheavals at TPP Unitec Northtec and at institutes around Wellington and staff elsewhere are feeling the pinch It is time to give them more certainty with a clear vision of the future and a detailed plan of how to get there The package of changes being proposed is significant But the risks of not acting are also significant We need to accept that disruption now will strengthen the vocational education system for the long term We ll be working closely with education providers and ITOs to seek their input on designing the new system and managing the transition And we ll ensure that change processes include robust and proactive support for employees whose jobs may be impacted by change As part of the consultation process agencies will be visiting ITPs and ITOs and discuss the proposed changes with them including with staff unions management and learners Contrary to some irresponsible claims that have been made in recent days the government has no target for job losses or redundancies We want to work with those who may be affected to help them transition We want to provide retraining and redeployment opportunities where someone s role has been changed or has disappeared In fact that s one of the reasons we re doing these changes in the first place Increasing numbers of New Zealanders across the economy are going to find their jobs changing or disappearing and we need to gear the system up to provide them with much more support to retrain and redeploy elsewhere I d like to say a few words about what our proposals mean for tangata whenua A significant weakness in our current vocational system is that not all learners are getting the educational and employment outcomes they want and deserve The system is overly complex making it hard for first time learners particularly M ori to achieve good outcomes Our proposals seek to strengthen the influence M ori have over vocational education for their communities through the proposed Regional Leadership Groups of the New Zealand Institute of Skills Technology These would aim to complement with a strong local voice the direct partnership between iwi M ori and the Crown The Government would expect the proposed changes to be focused on delivering high quality and relevant services to M ori as individuals wh nau and iwi The proposed new system also presents significant opportunities for w nanga We will work through those changes carefully with wananga recognising their unique role in our education system The proposed changes to vocational education will be supported by a range of other work the Government is doing to create positive outcomes for learners and employers We have already taken steps to make post school education and training more accessible with our fees free programme which provides 2 years of free industry training and apprenticeships or one year of free tertiary education We also announced changes to allow greater use of micro credentials to ensure our system is more accessible and responsive to business needs We are also well down the track of developing a careers system that will be much more active and hands on that the passive fragmented and piecemeal system we have now And we re busy modernising the schooling system through the reviews of Tomorrow s Schools and the NCEA So what can you expect to happen next I acknowledge that the fundamental change being proposed may be stressful and disruptive For this reason the Government will consider all feedback received during consultation and then make decisions quickly on how to proceed likely in May or June this year Public announcements will follow shortly afterwards We would aim to pass any new legislation during 2019 to enable a new institution to be technically in place from 1 January 2020 This would occur through a technical merger of existing institutions with the details depending on the final option adopted Final changes will be phased to ensure that disruption is minimised time is given for new capabilities to be put in place and that the continuing education of learners and trainees is not compromised To close the debate about the vocational education system has been simmering for some years Over the past year and in particular the last six months the calls for change have grown steadily louder and we know the time to act is now We cannot afford to let the skills gap continue to widen Governments can t continue tinkering at the edges or adding more layers of complexity and band aid solutions to an already complex system We need decisive action to safeguard New Zealand s skills pipeline and economic development for the future The Government s proposals are both far reaching and necessary If adopted as proposed they would fundamentally change the nature of the New Zealand vocational education system This is a once in a generation chance to help design the world class vocational education system that New Zealanders need and deserve a system that will work for everyone with strong industry leadership sustainable ITP campuses strengthened provision of education in the regions and flexible funding that can adjust to the changing needs of employers the economy and learners I encourage every New Zealander to participate in this consultation process and share your views about how New Zealand can build a vocational education system that we as a country can be proud of T n koutou t n koutou t n koutou katoa text: Our mission is to help leaders in multiple sectors develop a deeper understanding of the

will contribute to economic growth via contributions to productivity They will also help address moonshot societal challenges in areas from health to climate change At the same time these technologies will transform the nature of work and the workplace itself Machines will be able to carry out more of the tasks done by humans complement the work that humans do and even perform some tasks that go beyond what humans can do As a result some occupations will decline others will grow and many more will change While we believe there will be enough work to go around barring extreme scenarios society will need to grapple with significant workforce transitions and dislocation Workers will need to acquire new skills and adapt to the increasingly capable machines alongside them in the workplace They may have to move from declining occupations to growing and in some cases new occupations This executive briefing which draws on the latest research from the McKinsey Global Institute examines both the promise and the challenge of automation and AI in the workplace and outlines some of the critical issues that policy makers companies and individuals will need to solve for Automation and AI are not new but recent technological progress is pushing the frontier of what machines can do Our research suggests that society needs these improvements to provide value for businesses contribute to economic growth and make once unimaginable progress on some of our most difficult societal challenges In summary Beyond traditional industrial automation and advanced robots new generations of more capable autonomous systems are appearing in environments ranging from autonomous vehicles on roads to automated check outs in grocery stores Much of this progress has been driven by improvements in systems and components including mechanics sensors and software AI has made especially large strides in recent years as machine learning algorithms have become more sophisticated and made use of huge increases in computing power and of the exponential growth in data available to train them Spectacular breakthroughs are making headlines many involving beyond human capabilities in computer vision natural language processing and complex games such as Go These technologies are already generating value in various products and services and companies across sectors use them in an array of processes to personalize product recommendations find anomalies in production identify fraudulent transactions and more The latest generation of AI advances including techniques that address classification estimation and clustering problems promises significantly more value still An analysis we conducted of several hundred AI use cases found that the most advanced deep learning techniques deploying artificial neural networks could account for as much as 3 5 trillion to 5 8 trillion in annual value or 40 percent of the value created by all analytics techniques Exhibit 1 Deployment of AI and automation technologies can do much to lift the global economy and increase global prosperity at a time when aging and falling birth rates are acting as a drag on growth Labor productivity growth a key driver of economic growth has slowed in many economies dropping to an average of 0 5 percent in 2010 2014 from 2 4 percent a decade earlier in the United States and major European economies in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis after a previous productivity boom had waned AI and automation have the potential to reverse that decline productivity growth could potentially reach 2 percent annually over the next decade with 60 percent of this increase from digital opportunities AI is also being used in areas ranging from material science to medical research and climate science Application of the technologies in these and other disciplines could help tackle societal moonshot challenges For example researchers at Geisinger have developed an algorithm that could reduce diagnostic times for intracranial hemorrhaging by up to 96 percent Researchers at George Washington University meanwhile are using machine learning to more accurately weight the climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AI and automation still face challenges The limitations are partly technical such as the need for massive training data and difficulties generalizing algorithms across use cases Recent innovations are just starting to address these issues Other challenges are in the use of AI techniques For example explaining decisions made by machine learning algorithms is technically challenging which particularly matters for use cases involving financial lending or legal applications Potential bias in the training data and algorithms as well as data privacy malicious use and security are all issues that must be addressed Europe is leading with the new General Data Protection Regulation which codifies more rights for users over data collection and usage A different sort of challenge concerns the ability of organizations to adopt these technologies where people data availability technology and process readiness often make it difficult Adoption is already uneven across sectors and countries The finance automotive and telecommunications sectors lead AI adoption Among countries US investment in AI ranked first at 15 billion to 23 billion in 2016 followed by Asia s investments of 8 billion to 12 billion with Europe lagging behind at 3 billion to 4 billion Even as AI and automation bring benefits to business and society we will need to prepare for major disruptions to work Our analysis of more than 2000 work activities across more than 800 occupations shows that certain categories of activities are more easily automatable than others They include physical activities in highly predictable and structured environments as well as data collection and data processing These account for roughly half of the activities that people do across all sectors The least susceptible categories include managing others providing expertise and interfacing with stakeholders Nearly all occupations will be affected by automation but only about 5 percent of occupations could be fully automated by currently demonstrated technologies Many more occupations have portions of their constituent activities that are automatable we find that about 30 percent of the activities in 60 percent of all occupations could be automated This means that most workers from welders to mortgage brokers to CEOs will work alongside rapidly evolving machines The nature of these occupations will likely change as a result Automation will displace some workers We have found that around 15 percent of the global workforce or about 400 million workers could be displaced by automation in the period 2016 2030 This reflects our midpoint scenario in projecting the pace and scope of adoption Under the fastest scenario we have modeled that figure rises to 30 percent or 800 million workers In our slowest adoption scenario only about 10 million people would be displaced close to zero percent of the global workforce Exhibit 2 The wide range underscores the multiple factors that will impact the pace and scope of AI and automation adoption Technical feasibility of automation is only the first influencing factor Other factors include the cost of deployment labor market dynamics including labor supply quantity quality and the associated wages the benefits beyond labor substitution that contribute to business cases for adoption and finally social norms and acceptance Adoption will continue to vary significantly across countries and sectors because of differences in the above factors especially labor market dynamics in advanced economies with relatively high wage levels such as France Japan and the United States automation could displace 20 to 25 percent of the workforce by 2030 in a midpoint adoption scenario more than double the rate in India Even as workers are displaced there will be growth in demand for work and consequently jobs We developed scenarios for labor demand to 2030 from several catalysts of demand for work including rising incomes increased spending on healthcare and continuing or stepped up investment in infrastructure energy and technology development and deployment These scenarios showed a range of additional labor demand of between 21 percent to 33 percent of the global workforce 555 million and 890 million jobs to 2030 more than offsetting the numbers of jobs lost Some of the largest gains will be in emerging economies such as India where the working age population is already growing rapidly Additional economic growth including from business dynamism and rising productivity growth will also continue to create jobs Many other new occupations that we cannot currently imagine will also emerge and may account for as much as 10 percent of jobs created by 2030 if history is a guide Moreover technology itself has historically been a net job creator For example the introduction of the personal computer in the 1970s and 1980s created millions of jobs not just for semiconductor makers but also for software and app developers of all types customer service representatives and information analysts Partial automation will become more prevalent as machines complement human labor For example AI algorithms that can read diagnostic scans with a high degree of accuracy will help doctors diagnose patient cases and identify suitable treatment In other fields jobs with repetitive tasks could shift toward a model of managing and troubleshooting automated systems At retailer Amazon employees who previously lifted and stacked objects are becoming robot operators monitoring the automated arms and resolving issues such as an interruption in the flow of objects While we expect there will be enough work to ensure full employment in 2030 based on most of our scenarios the transitions that will accompany automation and AI adoption will be significant The mix of occupations will change as will skill and educational requirements Work will need to be redesigned to ensure that humans work alongside machines most effectively Automation will accelerate the shift in required workforce skills we have seen over the past 15 years Demand for advanced technological skills such as programming will grow rapidly Social emotional and higher cognitive skills such as creativity critical thinking and complex information processing will also see growing demand Basic digital skills demand has been increasing and that trend will continue and accelerate Demand for physical and manual skills will decline but will remain the single largest category of workforce skills in 2030 in many countries Exhibit 3 This will put additional pressure on the already existing workforce skills challenge as well as the need for new credentialing systems While some innovative solutions are emerging solutions that can match the scale of the challenge will be needed Our research suggests that in a midpoint scenario around 3 percent of the global workforce will need to change occupational categories by 2030 though scenarios range from about 0 to 14 percent Some of these shifts will happen within companies and sectors but many will occur across sectors and even geographies Occupations made up of physical activities in highly structured environments or in data processing or collection will see declines Growing occupations will include those with difficult to automate activities such as managers and those in unpredictable physical environments such as plumbers Other occupations that will see increasing demand for work include teachers nursing aides and tech and other professionals As intelligent machines and software are integrated more deeply into the workplace workflows and workspaces will continue to evolve to enable humans and machines to work together As self checkout machines are introduced in stores for example cashiers can become checkout assistance helpers who can help answer questions or troubleshoot the machines More system level solutions will prompt rethinking of the entire workflow and workspace Warehouse design may change significantly as some portions are designed to accommodate primarily robots and others to facilitate safe human machine interaction The occupational mix shifts will likely put pressure on wages Many of the current middle wage jobs in advanced economies are dominated by highly automatable activities such as in manufacturing or in accounting which are likely to decline High wage jobs will grow significantly especially for high skill medical and tech or other professionals but a large portion of jobs expected to be created including teachers and nursing aides typically have lower wage structures The risk is that automation could exacerbate wage polarization income inequality and the lack of income advancement that has characterized the past decade across advanced economies stoking social and political tensions Most countries already face the challenge of adequately educating and training their workforces to meet the current requirements of employers Across the OECD spending on worker education and training has been declining over the last two decades Spending on worker transition and dislocation assistance has also continued to shrink as a percentage of GDP One lesson of the past decade is that while globalization may have benefited economic growth and people as consumers the wage and dislocation effects on workers were not adequately addressed Most analyses including our own suggest that the scale of these issues is likely to grow in the coming decades We have also seen in the past that large scale workforce transitions can have a lasting effect on wages during the 19th century Industrial Revolution wages in the United Kingdom remained stagnant for about half a century despite rising productivity a phenomenon known as Engels Pause PDF 690KB after the German philosopher who identified it In the search for appropriate measures and policies to address these challenges we should not seek to roll back or slow diffusion of the technologies Companies and governments should harness automation and AI to benefit from the enhanced performance and productivity contributions as well as the societal benefits These technologies will create the economic surpluses that will help societies manage workforce transitions Rather the focus should be on ways to ensure that the workforce transitions are as smooth as possible This is likely to require actionable and scalable solutions in several key areas There is work for everyone today and there will be work for everyone tomorrow even in a future with automation Yet that work will be different requiring new skills and a far greater adaptability of the workforce than we have seen Training and retraining both midcareer workers and new generations for the coming challenges will be an imperative Government private sector leaders and innovators all need to work together to better coordinate public and private initiatives including creating the right incentives to invest more in human capital The future with automation and AI will be challenging but a much richer one if we harness the technologies with aplomb and

to be first across the threshold before the two of them make their dash for freedom Such is the content of a short video by Boston Dynamics that has gone viral since it was released in February Reactions to it on social media have ranged from amusement soon they ll be opening our fridges and stealing our beer to alarm this is how we die It is the latest evidence of recent remarkable advances in robotics and artificial intelligence robots can now perform backflips and ride bicycles and machines empowered by AI are able to analyze X ray images better than expert radiologists and to teach themselves to play the ancient game of Go better than world champions Yet the dog clip is also powerful because it conjures up a more worrisome vision of robots on the loose beyond the control of us humans Thus it plays into a powerful angst laden contemporary narrative about technology and the future of work and maybe even of mankind itself What really are the risks from this new wave of technology And will the opportunities these advances bring with them outweigh those risks To address such questions about the future it is useful indeed necessary to look to the past Technology has for centuries both excited the human imagination and prompted fears about the effects Back in 1589 Queen Elizabeth I of England refused to grant a patent to a stocking frame invented by one William Lee because Her Majesty was concerned about the effect of the contraption on the livelihoods of those who knitted stockings by hand The Luddite weavers in Britain and silk workers in Lyons France famously staged revolts in the early 19th century against new automated looms that threatened their skilled and well paid jobs And in the realm of fiction imagination has run riot since the Czech writer Karel Capek coined the word robot from a Slavic word for work in his 1920 play Rossum s Universal Robots a k a RUR which ends with the destruction of mankind As one of Capek s characters explains Robots are not people Mechanically they are more perfect than we are they have an enormously developed intelligence but they have no soul For 100 percent of continuous 10 year periods in the United States technologically driven productivity gains have gone hand in hand with rising employment Almost a century later that same concern about soulless hyper intelligence infuses not just movies like The Matrix and mind bending video series like Philip K Dick s Electric Dreams but also warnings about AI and its potential consequences expressed by Elon Musk and the late Stephen Hawking among others Back in the 1950s the German philosopher Martin Heidegger fretted about the risk that humans would become enslaved by the technologies we rely on With the rise of machines able to mimic many human traits from speech albeit still falteringly to facial recognition already significantly more accurately than humans that time appears to be much closer Yet when we switch from philosophy to economics we find a very different story a long historical record of innovation that shows technological change has been overwhelmingly positive for productivity and surprisingly benign when it comes to employment Job displacement has occurred in waves first with the structural shift from agriculture to manufacturing and then with the move from manufacturing to services Throughout productivity gains generated by new technology have been reinvested and the GDP bounce from that productivity eventually raises consumption and on balance increases the demand for labor In McKinsey s research we have sought to quantify this trend and its net impact in several ways For example we looked at the very big picture what happened to employment as productivity grew over the past 50 years We found no tradeoff between the two for 100 percent of continuous 10 year periods in the United States technologically driven productivity gains have gone hand in hand with rising employment Even when measured in one year snapshots productivity and employment have risen together four years in five The personal computer provides an iconic case to support the compatibility of technological progress with job growth We measured how many jobs were lost and how many gained in the United States between 1980 and 2015 as a result of the diffusion of computer technology Several hundred thousand bookkeepers and auditing clerks secretaries and typists did lose their jobs But the overall balance was strongly positive the desktop laptop computer created more than 19 million jobs in industries ranging from computer hardware to enterprise software to online retail sales against the loss of about 3 5 million jobs a net gain of 15 7 million That figure amounts to 18 percent of all the net U S employment created in the period almost one in five jobs Something similar happened with the invention of the automobile which destroyed the horse and buggy business but gave rise to a wealth of new sometimes unimagined products from petroleum based synthetic rubber to motels That said we ignore those left along the way at our peril For the many workers who are displaced painful transitions are a reality In Britain during the industrial revolution starting in about 1800 wages of the masses stagnated for almost a half century despite a strong surge in productivity that enriched the owners of capital a phenomenon often referred to as Engels pause because it was first noted by the German philosopher who co authored with Karl Marx The Communist Manifesto Wages picked up again as the fruits of productivity gains eventually trickled down to workers But eventually can be a long time the Luddites fears were not entirely unfounded And once again today the link between productivity gains and wage growth seems bent if not broken U S median hourly compensation rose only 11 percent from 1973 to 2016 even as hourly labor productivity grew by 75 percent While it is natural to focus on labor displacement through technology one element often overlooked in the discussion of the future of work is the number of jobs that are neither lost nor gained but fundamentally changed for reasons that are hard to predict History again provides some examples When ATMs became as common as vending machines in the 1970s the number of bank tellers actually increased That s because the new technology reduced the costs of processing individual transactions giving the banks incentives to open more branches to meet local demand for other financial services The tellers primary tasks changed from cashing checks and taking deposits to providing advice and selling securities mortgages and the like To be sure this tale is not yet complete with the rise of online banking the demand for tellers has again waned and so their numbers have thinned especially after the 2008 financial crisis But modern economies are nothing if not dynamic and the only certainty is change There s a similar story to be told about jobs and information technology Thanks to the internet and some ingenious software anyone can now dig up information at the blink of a cursor Yet the need for data analysis has exploded even as the need for data gathering clerks and the like has plummeted And so the number of information analysts of the genus homo sapiens has quintupled since 1980 to about two million today This largely comforting history isn t much help in determining whether this time will be different To the point the rise of ever more sophisticated technologies especially artificial intelligence that can be brought to bear on any number of tasks is likely to usher in a new age of rapid workforce transitions The McKinsey Global Institute recently estimated that in our fastest automation adoption scenario as many as 375 million workers worldwide or about 14 percent of the global workforce will need to switch occupational categories by 2030 in order to avoid obsolescence Even if the pace of adoption is slower as in our midpoint scenario some 75 million workers will need to switch occupational categories in the next 10 to 15 years Among the work most vulnerable to automation jobs that require routinized physical activity in a predictable setting and collecting and processing data Some aspects of the current technological transformation seem in line with that of previous eras the rise of computers for example and earlier epochs of technical change such as the diffusion of the steam engine that transformed work across multiple sectors of the economy simultaneously Every new wave of automation seems remarkable at the time and AI is not the first technology to chip away at cognitive tasks Since the birth of computerized spreadsheets in the 1980s machines have tackled ever more sophisticated problems that previously required human brainpower Still other aspects of the new technologies do seem qualitatively different from previous waves of innovation The rate of technological change today is strikingly rapid and while hard to measure appears to be accelerating Consider in this regard the development of deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques based on neural networks the exponential increase in computing capacity made available through the cloud and the sheer volume of data that can be generated These advances are driving AI for example enabling the development of autonomous vehicles but also heralding breakthrough applications such as a heightened ability to diagnose disease with non invasive techniques Accordingly the share of jobs that could be automated could also be larger than historical precedents suggest The future of work looks set to be not a tale of machines replacing humans but of machines complementing humans in the workplace That said we see no evidence to date suggesting that the time it takes for new technologies to be diffused throughout the economy is shrinking Looking at a range of high value technologies over the past 60 years from airbags to MRI machines to smartphones we find that the pace of adoption hasn t changed It still takes between 5 and 16 years to reach 50 percent adoption and 5 to 28 years to reach 80 percent adoption Even highly popular social media applications do not beat this clock Facebook for example was begun in 2004 and had attracted more than 2 2 billion followers 13 years later but the untapped market remains vast Consider too that new technology is rarely applied to a blank canvas a variety of economic and social factors play a big role in determining the pace of adoption They include the cost of developing and deploying the hardware and software labor market dynamics the regulatory environment and social acceptance Computer algorithms in state of the art technology aircraft can do just about anything asked of them without a helping hand but we still insist on humans in the cockpit for peace of mind And who wants to be cared for in a hospital solely by a robot We remain disconcerted by the uncanny valley the term coined by the Japanese robotics guru Masahiro Mori to characterize that unsettling feeling people may experience when facing humanoid robots Indeed for tech luminaries ranging from the MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson to the former Google chairman Eric Schmidt the future of work looks set to be not a tale of machines replacing humans but of machines complementing humans in the workplace The rise of AI and the ascendance of self learned algorithms whose logic can be hard to explain pose some arguably unique problems A recent report from a who s who of experts on the malicious use of AI lists a number of the darkest scenarios from political manipulation through hyper personalized disinformation campaigns to a major increase in sophisticated computer hacking attacks For now AI pioneers including Google DeepMind s chief executive Demis Hassabis are clear that while machines are proving formidable in specific areas such as games we remain a long way away from the time when they will have mastered a general artificial intelligence enabling them to think and act like humans And a number of groups including Stanford University s AI100 with which I am associated are trying to look ahead to study and anticipate how AI will affect the way people live work and play long into the future The challenges here for policymakers and business leaders worldwide are significant We will need to institute retraining of workers on a scale we have not seen for generations We will need to rethink and adapt our social systems to help hundreds of millions of workers affected by the new technologies hopefully handling it better than we have handled globalization in providing both new forms of income and job transition support We will need to find ways to tame the wilder unpredictable side of AI For their part CEOs will need to rethink their organizational structures and processes to take advantage of the technologies and the performance enhancing effects they can have or risk ending up in the recycle bin of business history While all of this may seem intimidating it is still the best way forward We should embrace automation technologies for the productivity benefits they bring even as we deal proactively with the workforce transitions that will accompany adoption Given that demographic trends increased longevity low birth rates are rapidly increasing the dependent population our societies really need that productivity boost Beyond the prosperity and employment these technologies will create there will be other societal benefits new moonshots as we use the power of AI to tackle daunting problems from cancer to climate change We can already see one of the key challenges that of worker retraining or reskilling as some like to call it advancing to the top of the corporate agenda and in some countries also receiving renewed political attention In our recent work on the skills that will be needed by the workforce we found that demand will rise sharply not just for technological skills of all kinds but also for social and emotional skills that is leadership and empathy with customers as well as for higher cognitive skills linked to creativity and complex information processing Business leaders tell us that they believe finding the right talent to help implement automation is critical to their future financial performance and they expect companies to take the lead in the skills upgrade that is required Some firms are already putting in place large scale retraining initiatives AT T is using external education providers including for example Udacity At SAP the German enterprise software company the focus is on in house efforts to create learning journeys for thousands of employees including engineers who need to acquire softer skills as their roles change to service customers directly Walmart has set up more than 100 academies in the United States that provide hands on training for positions that include customer service managers and online grocery pickup While welcome these disparate retraining efforts are barely a start Given the scale of the occupational and skill shifts that we see coming in the next decade much more will need to be done and not just by business Governments and educational establishments working together with philanthropic foundations will of necessity be part of the mix Foundations have the advantage of being able to test innovative programs as pilots and will not face the disadvantage of concern that workers with new skills will subsequently jump ship for a new employer As a starter governments will need to reverse the 20 plus year decline in spending on labor related services no small task in light of tight government budgets and in the United States reflexive opposition to government intervention They will also need to be more flexible in order to adapt to the rapidly changing workplace Mobility is one key yet labor markets have become markedly less dynamic in recent years In the United States for example job reallocation rates have declined by 25 percent since 1990 This is the time to test ideas such as portable benefits that are owned by workers and not tied to particular jobs or companies Technology itself can help facilitate greater mobility especially digital platforms turbocharged by AI that enable matching of people to jobs But we also need to rethink some basic assumptions In order for changing jobs across sectors to become a common practice companies will need to agree on definitions and qualifications for specific skills And a major debate is overdue about credentialing Today higher education encourages the world to judge graduates by their subject knowledge rather than by their skills in problem solving and creative thinking skills that will be especially valuable in an AI enhanced workplace More than anything we need to prepare for this new era in which humans must work alongside smart machines far more intensively President Lyndon Johnson was prescient in this regard writing a half a century ago Automation is not our enemy Our enemies are ignorance indifference and inertia Automation can be the ally of our prosperity if we will just look ahead if we will understand what is to come and if we will set our course wisely after proper planning Back then nobody other than science fiction writers could have imagined robot dogs opening doors and escaping to wherever those androids from Blade Runner found refuge But LBJ s words

Loading Loading Loading Working Loading playlists Image attribution When technology advances too quickly for education to keep up inequality generally rises Erik Brynjolfsson Director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital EconomyThe rapid pace of technical advances and the increasing feasibility of automation has created questions about the future of work and its potential for displacing workers Estimates of the scale of threatened jobs over the next decade or two range from 9 to 47 according to a 2016 White House research report This is defined as those working in jobs where more than 70 of their activities can be automated On average nearly one half 46 of work activities in the country are currently automatable Share of Jobs with Highly Automatable Skills by EducationMost of this risk is concentrated among lower paid lower skilled and less educated workers Workers earning below 20 per hour face a greater than 80 chance of displacement More than two out of five workers without a high school degree have job skills that are considered highly automatable These projections should raise concerns about the ability of communities to tackle existing issues of social equity and affordable housing that could be exacerbated by automation Share of Jobs with High Probability of Automation by Occupation s Median Hourly WageJob tasks that are most susceptible include predictable physical tasks which make up 8 of all work tasks data processing 16 processing and data collection 17 On the other end of the spectrum work that either involves managing others 7 or applying expertise 14 proves the least susceptible However even these jobs aren t immune to some degree of automation This magnitude of shifts in work activities over multiple decades is not unprecedented The share of U S farm employment fell from 40 in 1900 to 2 in 2000 while the share of manufacturing employment fell from approximately 25 in 1950 to less than 10 in 2010 In both cases new activities and jobs were created that offset those that disappeared What may be unprecedented is the pace of the change and scale of people affected That said a decline in immigration to the United States and the aging population decline in the share of the working age population will open economic growth gaps at the same time that we re seeing job disruption due to automation We will see large scale shifts in workplace activities over the next century and these trends are already underway These shifts are inherent in automation technologies and also a consequence of a shifting labor demographic Millennials who already constitute the largest workforce population in the U S are demanding greater flexibility and autonomy than previous generations Building an educated workforce and rethinking our educational and training programs is the most critical task in preparing for the future of an automated world says Erik Brynjolfsson director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy and co author of The Second Machine Age Work Progress and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies Individuals will be required to have not only coding skills he says but also more diverse math reading interpersonal and creative skill sets According to the National League of Cities The Future of Work in Cities report nearly all 95 of the 11 6 million jobs that have been created since the last recession required some postsecondary education While science technology engineering and math STEM skills are emphasized many employers are also looking for primary and secondary educational systems to address gaps in workplace competencies like teamwork problem solving and communication STEM skills may power new technologies but the soft skills of collaboration critical thinking and interpersonal skills are vital components of the jobs likely to endure automation The balance of these skills will remain essential to prepare students with the human digital capabilities they will need As more restaurant orders are automated and shopping moves further online humans who work in these retail sectors will be expected to provide the customer with something extra something social to shift toward selling more personalized or unique experiences what the experts call the commodification of experience New technology and peer to peer platforms as well as a greater emphasis on personal craftsmanship and human ability have fueled the growth of a creative class of individuals capable of marketing their work from home This emphasis will likely continue to spread across the lower skilled labor market where individuality and a personal touch are valued and where services cannot be outsourced or easily automated Cities should encourage entrepreneurship and reduce barriers to innovation For example they can limit the number of occupational licenses necessary or streamline the process to get new licenses The 21st century worker will need a lifelong learning mindset to be successful and use digital resources to enable digital skills development The nation will need to reverse its declining investment in our workforce if we are going to sufficiently prepare people for future jobs in an era of automated work Scholarship Sacramento Valley Vision based in Sacramento created a comprehensive online platform of local scholarships for students who live in the Sacramento

robots coming for government jobs According to Bill Eggers the answer is yes sort of Eggers who runs Deloitte s Center for Government Insights said at a Nov 29 FCW event on government modernization that 20 to 30 percent of all work activities will soon be automatable thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence He pointed to a Deloitte study of the federal workforce that found 4 3 billion hours are spent each year on a wide range of task and activities A huge share of those hours is devoted to essentially moving paper he said while relatively little time goes to coaching and other sorts of human activities But the study also found that four out of five of the most labor intensive activities have either a medium or high automation potential Eggers said That could allow for reductions in certain parts of the workforce he noted but it also frees up time for critical higher value work and the chance to deliver better service by giving the human workforce AI powered support Studies have repeatedly shown Eggers said that it s the human machine pairing that gives the best results he said The full video of Eggers half hour talk which explores the larger implications for

AI and Automation In Edward Bellamy s classic Looking Backward the protagonist Julian West wakes up from a 113 year slumber and finds the United States in 2000 has changed dramatically from 1887 People stop working at age forty five and devote their lives to mentoring other people and engaging in volunteer work that benefits the overall community There are short work weeks for employees and everyone receives full benefits food and housing 1 The reason is that new technologies of the period have enabled people to be very productive while working part time Businesses do not need large numbers of employees so individuals can devote most of their waking hours to hobbies volunteering and community service In conjunction with periodic work stints they have time to pursue new skills and personal identities that are independent of their jobs In the current era developed countries may be on the verge of a similar transition Robotics and machine learning have improved productivity and enhanced the economies of many nations Artificial intelligence AI has advanced into finance transportation defense and energy management The internet of things IoT is facilitated by high speed networks and remote sensors to connect people and businesses In all of this there is a possibility of a new era that could improve the lives of many people 2 Yet amid these possible benefits there is widespread fear that robots and AI will take jobs and throw millions of people into poverty A Pew Research Center study asked 1 896 experts about the impact of emerging technologies and found half of these experts 48 percent envision a future in which robots and digital agents will have displaced significant numbers of both blue and white collar workers with many expressing concern that this will lead to vast increases in income inequality masses of people who are effectively unemployable and breakdowns in the social order 3 These fears have been echoed by detailed analyses showing anywhere from a 14 to 54 percent automation impact on jobs For example a Bruegel analysis found that 54 of EU jobs are at risk of computerization 4 Using European data they argue that job losses are likely to be significant and people should prepare for large scale disruption Related Technology Innovation How artificial intelligence is transforming the world Darrell M West and John R Allen Tuesday April 24

Thursday October 4 2018Meanwhile Oxford University researchers Carl Frey and Michael Osborne claim that technology will transform many sectors of life They studied 702 occupational groupings and found that 47 percent of U S workers have a high probability of seeing their jobs automated over the next 20 years 5 A McKinsey Global Institute analysis of 750 jobs concluded that 45 of paid activities could be automated using currently demonstrated technologies and 60 of occupations could have 30 or more of their processes automated 6 A more recent McKinsey report Jobs Lost Jobs Gained found that 30 percent of work activities could be automated by 2030 and up to 375 million workers worldwide could be affected by emerging technologies 7 Researchers at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD focused on tasks as opposed to jobs and found fewer job losses Using task related data from 32 OECD countries they estimated that 14 percent of jobs are highly automatable and another 32 have a significant risk of automation Although their job loss estimates are below those of other experts they concluded that low qualified workers are likely to bear the brunt of the adjustment costs as the automatibility of their jobs is higher compared to highly qualified workers 8 Related Books Going Mobile By Darrell M West 2014 Behavioral Science Policy Volume 1 Number 2 Edited by Craig Fox and Sim B Sitkin 2016 Behavioral Science Policy Volume 1 Number 1 Edited by Craig Fox and Sim B Sitkin 2015While some dispute the dire predictions on grounds new positions will be created to offset the job losses the fact that all these major studies report significant workforce disruptions should be taken seriously If the employment impact falls at the 38 percent mean of these forecasts Western democracies likely could resort to authoritarianism as happened in some countries during the Great Depression of the 1930s in order to keep their restive populations in check If that happened wealthy elites would require armed guards security details and gated communities to protect themselves as is the case in poor countries today with high income inequality The United States would look like Syria or Iraq with armed bands of young men with few employment prospects other than war violence or theft Yet even if the job ramifications lie more at the low end of disruption the political consequences still will be severe Relatively small increases in unemployment or underemployment have an outsized political impact We saw that a decade ago when 10 percent unemployment during the Great Recession spawned the Tea party and eventually helped to make Donald Trump president With some workforce disruption virtually guaranteed by trends already underway it is safe to predict American politics will be chaotic and turbulent during the coming decades As innovation accelerates and public anxiety intensifies right wing and left wing populists will jockey for voter support Government control could gyrate between very conservative and very liberal leaders as each side blames a different set of scapegoats for economic outcomes voters don t like The calm and predictable politics of the post World War II era likely will become a distant memory as the American system moves toward Trumpism on steroids 1 Edward Bellamy Looking Backward 2000 1887 Houghton Mifflin 1888 2

Gregory and Ulrich Zierahn The Risk of Automation for Jobs in OECD Countries Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Working Paper 189 2016 Donald Trump entered office on a promise to bring back jobs and lift up the white working class While 53 percent of Americans earning less than 30 000 a year voted for Hillary Clinton the counties she won made up 64 percent of America s GDP in 2015 Trump won over five times as many counties as Clinton but these counties constituted only 36 percent of America s GDP in 2015 Trump also surpassed Clinton in places where voters are most at risk of losing their jobs due to automation and won support among those who had already lost out as a result of technological changes in the workplace A National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that the more robots introduced in a commuting zone between 1993 and 2007 the more likely the area went to Trump However Trump s economic message and governance so far has focused almost entirely on job loss due to trade and he has said little on how automation challenges his constituency On the other hand Barack Obama warned in his final speech as president that the next wave of economic dislocation won t come from overseas It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes many good middle class jobs obsolete In the fall of 2016 the White House released a report on automation that outlined its likely impacts on lower wage earners and the prospects for deepened wage inequality Research from Oxford University predicts 47 percent of jobs are likely to be automated within a decade or two and a study by the McKinsey Global Institute finds that 46 percent of time spent on existing work activities will become automated However when asked about the threat of losing jobs to automation Secretary Treasury Steve Mnuchin said the issue is not even on our radar screen I m not worried at all Not everyone agrees Larry Summers who originally argued that automation would help the economy by creating new jobs has since stepped back from this position warning This isn t some future possibility This is something that s emerging before us right now MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson concurs This is the biggest challenge for our society for the next decade While much has been written on the policy challenges automation poses little has been written on the political dynamics it is likely to produce Unsurprisingly political leaders tend to shy away from discussing the issue It is difficult to antagonize technological advancement automation is often the result of corporate investment it yields growth and achieves efficiency and average Americans save on products and services as a result And some make the case that automation is not happening fast enough citing dismal productivity gains The competing theses on the likely effects of automation differ in their understanding of how today s technological shifts compare to past radical changes in the economy Nonetheless policy recommendations that confront technological unemployment can insure against the worst case scenario And as similar disruptions originate from trade and technological improvement similar policies can ameliorate the consequences of dislocation produced by trade and tech shocks Pursuing such policies could also present a political opportunity to restore some sober analysis and much needed non partisan problem solving This would require a response somewhat antithetical to our politics one that is forward thinking and anticipates voters concerns While 65 percent of Americans believe that within 50 years robots and computers will likely complete work performed by humans today 80 percent of Americans do not expect their jobs will disappear While poorer and less educated Americans demonstrate greater concern for the prospect American workers overall worry more about displacement by other workers industry trends and mismanagement Given that few voters are preoccupied with disruptive changes to work stability through technological advancements there exists little incentive for politicians to tackle it But doing so provides two important opportunities at a time ripe for political renewal First addressing automation upends a politics that relies heavily on antagonism Unlike trade few voters reject the benefits of technological change and automation offers no foreign scapegoats like cheap labor abroad or multilateral trade to accuse of stealing jobs Subsequently it is difficult to claim political victories and publically take on opponents Second while workers are concerned about more immediate threats tackling automation would require modernizing the social safety net to not only improve the working lives of Americans today but also to respond to the changing nature of work itself As Brookings Mark Muro writes programs should be anticipatory and offer support when disruption is forecast but not yet hitting home This might require openness to challenging some of the premises that have long guided partisan economic platforms Because automation is predicted to yield greater economic growth while at the same time displacing many workers traditional conservatives will have to embrace some degree of government intervention An inability to adapt conservative economic governance to confront the features of radical shifts in the labor market could prove electorally costly Americans likely to be the most affected by automation live in Republican districts but in areas that have experienced the greatest shocks from automation the 2016 presidential vote was closer This presents an opportunity for Democrats to contend for the support of these voters If Democrats fail to address these voters needs the party might miss an opportunity to reassert a strong economic message and reconnect with a working class base Joseph Parilla and Mark Muro have suggested the creation of a Universal Basic Adjustment Benefit to tackle the dislocation likely to become an increasingly routine feature of the labor market Inspired by calls for a Universal Basic Income UBI the adjustment would include job search counseling worker training funding relocation grants and wage insurance Given that UBI has attracted support from a group of odd bedfellows that includes American Enterprise Institute s Charles Murray and Andy Stern the former president of the Service Employees International Union a Basic Adjustment Benefit might be able to generate similar cross ideological interest In fact it might even prove more palatable than UBI proposals as the benefit would target moving workers back into the labor market and would combine many welfare programs that could be administered flexibly at the local level The consequences of failing to incorporate automation into our political dialogue are potentially high In the Midwest manufacturing job loss bred feelings of economic frustration that led many to favor a populist candidate who gave them something to blame which exemplifies the frustrations likely to take hold as the threat of technological unemployment mounts Additionally many of the jobs expected to disappear as a result of automation are held by white males without college educations a group Trump won handily Without efforts to ensure workers without a college degree can participate in the economy of the automated era the growing education divide producing the kind of populist backlash here and across the west is likely to deepen Ian Bremmer warns the audience about the dangers of automation at an Intelligence Squared U S debate Can we all agree that Google Duplex demo was eerie A robot posing as a human being scheduled a reservation over the phone We all knew artificial intelligence was coming but it was breathtaking to hear software come to life Before we go any further let s get our terms straight Automation and artificial intelligence are not the same thing According to Dave Evans Automation is software that follows pre programmed rules Artificial intelligence is designed to simulate human thinking Automation in this context refers to the impact of artificial intelligence on tasks that only humans can perform today Even if you re skeptical of Google Duplex in light of the current backlash Alexa has made her way into millions of homes Amazon and Google are proving the value of artificial intelligence to consumers Apple still has a ways to go with Siri While Alexa won t take down the government there was a recent debate about the impact of automation on democracy that s worth watching Intelligence Squared U S features debates about current events Each episode puts forward a provocative motion like Automation Will Crash Democracy Two teams of two debate the motion There are polls conducted at the beginning and at the end of the debate A team wins by persuading audience members to change their opinion Ian Bremmer and Yascha Mounk argued for the motion insisting automation will crash democracy Andrew Keen and Alina Polyakova argued against the motion It s unclear whether the middle class can survive an AI revolution It could leave very few jobs for the masses In this scenario the rich would end up with even more power And without a middle class it s hard to sustain a healthy democracy Not scary enough for you Tech pioneers like Elon Musk and Bill Gates have spoken out about the dangers of artificial intelligence Although Gates thinks Musk should take it down a notch Musk is so concerned that he co founded OpenAI The nonprofit which he also chairs researches artificial intelligence to make the technology safer and more accessible Ian Bremmer one of the debate s participants recently published a bestselling book titled Us vs Them The Failure of Globalism Even though the motion didn t reference China Bremmer invoked the country for good reason Bremmer insists the US could be at a disadvantage Right now it s either Silicon Valley or it s China Those are the drivers of automation Since the actual government drives innovation in China they can leverage the technology and advance it The United States government doesn t have that level of control over its technology sector Moreover based on the recent Facebook hearings it s hard to imagine the US government confronting the threat of automation in a meaningful way Mounk fears a consolidation of power So I think that there s two different ways in which democracy might come under pressure The first is that there s going to be enclaves of very rich people who actually own all of the productive material in society which is the machines and robots and so on being asked to give up more and more money in order to finance that nice universal basic income scheme Throughout the debate he derides universal basic income as a program that can easily be abused Mounk thinks democracy is far fetched in this new world We ve only ever had democracy in the time period from the French Revolution until today when political leaders needed citizen armies when we could rely on average citizens to stand up to defend the country against enemies abroad and to keep the peace at home He believes the rich will protect themselves with their own robot armies and no longer need the middle class The counterarguments from Andrew Keen and Alina Polyakova were more optimistic Keen is an entrepreneur and author Polyakova is a fellow at the Brookings Institute They believe regulation will provide the proper guard rails for innovation That s why they reject all the doomsday scenarios that could result from automation Polyakova also has faith in new industries if we look at every technological revolution we see far more jobs created or people transitioning into a different industry versus just mass unemployment It s easy to hold the AI revolution up to the industrial revolution but it s different While I believe automation will create new jobs the current rate of change is so unprecedented it s hard to compare it to the past Both sides of the debate agree regulation can thwart many of the potential threats of automation It s unclear where the United States will find the political will to respond given its current legislative gridlock The artificial intelligence revolution will challenge America s system of government but it s still worth wondering can democracy

effects of automation in the coming decades These jobs are not necessarily disappearing but they are transforming as artificial intelligence machine learning and advanced robotics tackle more roles in the workplace Policymakers should act now to help New Yorkers prepare for the changes that are coming to the world of work by Matt A V ChabanTags automation new york state economic opportunity workforce opportunity innovation economy tech middle class jobs projectIt has taken decades for New York State s economy to rebound from the effects of offshoring and globalization From Buffalo and Rochester to Binghamton and Riverhead the state has shed hundreds of thousands of jobs particularly in manufacturing and related industrial sectors and upstate job growth has been comparatively slow Yet in the years ahead New York State will need to contend with an even more powerful and fast moving economic force automation Machine learning robotics and artificial intelligence are poised to bring about massive changes to a much larger swath of the economy in the years ahead sweeping not just through factory floors but office towers hospital wards and main streets Automation has the potential to displace workers in a growing range of occupations as varied as bookkeepers and x ray technicians paralegals and food prep workers The result is that both traditional and emerging industries will be transformed with significant effects on New York s workforce This research provides the first comprehensive look at the automation potential of every occupation statewide and in each of New York s ten regions Our study finds that New York State is less susceptible to automation than the nation as a whole But it also reveals that more than 1 2 million jobs in the state about 12 percent of the state s workforce could be largely automated using technology that exists today These are jobs in which 80 percent or more of their associated tasks could be done by machines To be clear automation is not expected to eliminate all or even most of these jobs Indeed this analysis shows that there are only about 24 740 jobs in the state that are 100 percent automatable As with other major economic transformations such as the Industrial Revolution the dawn of electricity and the Internet age some jobs will disappear many will be created and in the end most will simply change There is immense potential for jobs across New York to be transformed Statewide the equivalent of 41 2 percent of all job tasks could be performed by machines in the coming decade On this score New York is actually better off than the nation where 51 percent of all job tasks could be done by machines according to an analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute on which this report is based This is not to suggest that 41 percent of jobs in the state will be eliminated that is simply the scope of job responsibilities that could change as more of today s work whether taking orders entering data or even driving is done by machines The potential for automation is spread fairly evenly across the state Of all regions the automation potential is highest in Western New York where 44 5 percent of all job tasks could be done using existing technology Other regions with high automation potential include Central New York 44 4 percent the North Country 44 3 percent the Mohawk Valley 43 8 percent and Long Island 43 7 New York City has the lowest potential for automation as detailed by the Center in a January report just 39 percent of jobs in the five boroughs stand a high likelihood of being automated But other regions also have a comparatively lower potential for automation such as the Capital Region 42 percent and the Hudson Valley 42 2 percent 1 This research part of our Middle Class Jobs Project a research initiative funded by Fisher Brothers and Winston C Fisher also finds that the jobs that offer New Yorkers a foothold in the economy and a gateway to the middle class are the ones most threatened by automation Such is the case with the state s roughly 155 000 food preparers and servers including fast food workers the largest group whose tasks are highly susceptible to automation 87 percent of their job tasks could be automated It s also the case for the state s 124 000 accounting and bookkeeping clerks 86 percent automation potential and the 181 000 who drive tractor trailers delivery trucks and buses 78 to 85 percent automation potential Additionally there are 112 000 stock clerks and 34 000 dishwashers whose jobs are all roughly 86 percent automatable Even among the state s 20 000 chief executives computers will be able to perform 25 percent of their work in the coming decades That s a notch more vulnerable than the state s 211 000 janitors since machines are predicted to do only 22 percent of all custodial tasks although smart mops could well become part of the job We also conclude that the strongest effects are on lower and middle income jobs the first rungs of the state s economic ladder where the impact of automation is likely to be significant Among the 100 most automatable occupations in the state with at least 1 000 workers 68 percent make less than 40 000 per year while 31 percent make between 40 000 and 80 000 annually and only one of those positions crane operators makes more In total the equivalent of 186 billion wages could be impacted by automation Precisely because it will be difficult to predict exactly which jobs will be impacted by automation and where policymakers business leaders and educators across New York have all the more reason to start preparing now In many parts of the state the same communities that have struggled with the loss of industrial and manufacturing jobs are likely to confront even greater challenges in the years ahead Meanwhile areas that have benefited from new jobs in industries like restaurants and retail will not be immune to the forces of automation Preparing New York State for the future of work is a job that starts today Automation and the Empire StateThe effects of automation will be felt in every corner of the state although some regions rely more heavily on highly automatable jobs In evaluating the likelihood that a machine could perform each job s component tasks this analysis reveals which occupations are most likely to be augmented and supplanted in the decades to come One key factor in determining automatability is the prevalence of work that is highly routine whether physically or cognitively Where job tasks are more variable relying on interpersonal relationships and quick judgement calls humans continue to have the edge The effects of automation may no longer be confined to the factory floor but production occupations remain the most susceptible to displacement That s a major reason why Western New York where manufacturing still accounts for almost 1 in 10 jobs is the state s most vulnerable region The average job in the nine regions excluding New York City is about 10 percent more likely to be automated than it is in the five boroughs although rates for every region remain below the national average New York City with a large number of workers in high touch healthcare jobs managerial positions customer service and the creative economy is the region of the state least vulnerable to the effects of automation That said more than one third of the state s most highly automatable jobs are in New York City more than 454 000 in total However four regions across the state are home to more than 100 000 highly automatable jobs and all ten regions have at least 20 000 jobs that are highly automatable This includes 182 650 in Long Island 116 330 in the Hudson Valley 105 200 in Western New York 80 470 in the Finger Lakes 72 770 in the Capital Region 57 800 in Central New York 40 990 in the Southern Tier and 22 080 in the North Country The most automatable jobs in each region are relatively consistent statewide as the breakdown below reveals Close to 2 percent of the state s workforce is employed in food preparation and serving jobs including fast food and those jobs are spread across the entire state The same goes for jobs filling orders or driving delivery trucks As a result automation is likely to transform not only those regions with a traditional reliance on manufacturing but other parts of the state that have seen the service sector expand significantly over the past two decades Automation in New York State Region by Region All statewide data is for 2017 regional data 2016 the most recent years available Capital RegionCentral New YorkFinger LakesHudson ValleyLong IslandMohawk ValleyNew York CityNorth CountrySouthern TierWestern New York Additional details about automatable jobs can be found here Statewide Capital Region Central New York Finger Lakes Hudson Valley Long Island Mohawk Valley New York City North Country Southern Tier Western New York While some regions are more dependent on certain fields for employment every region of the state has large numbers of workers in similar occupations In addition to food preparation and serving jobs including fast food which are prevalent statewide and highly automatable there are thousands of New Yorkers in every region employed in personal care which is quite resilient to automation retail which is only somewhat durable and bookkeeping which is rather vulnerable All of these jobs may change significantly as new technology is developed and adopted but most workplaces will still need help with this work and someone will have to perform it The result is that the skills required to access even entry level opportunities may increase even as humans continue to hold most of the jobs that exist today Many of the state s most automatable occupations are also expected to add jobs over the next decade although an increased pace of technology adoption could change this Such trends may appear to counter the headlines of kiosk filled McDonald s restaurants and Shake Shacks and autonomous Tesla built tractor trailers although some of these changes are already underway The tipping point for many jobs may well be more than a decade out however the growth of jobs in highly vulnerable industries only underscores the urgent need to prepare the state s workforce for the changes to come There are some regional variations The persistence of manufacturing jobs which account for 9 percent of all jobs in Western New York and 6 percent in Central New York could help explain why both are relatively more vulnerable than New York City 2 percent the Capital Region 4 percent and the Hudson Valley 3 4 percent Long Island s large share of jobs that are at least 50 percent automatable may have some correlation with a higher number of office administrative positions which are almost one in five jobs in Nassau and Suffolk counties That compares to one in six on average in the state and in New York City The five boroughs also employ a lower number of workers in transportation fields 4 9 percent than is typical in the rest of the state 5 3 percent Indeed all manner of factors not just economic or technical could determine whether a business decides to replace some or all of its workers with machines It is not just a matter of how soon fully autonomous dishwashers can be developed but if it would be worth paying to buy and maintain such a machine when most human dishwashers make minimum wage In other cases the complexity of job tasks is a key determinant while accounting clerks whose job tasks consist largely of routine data entry are highly vulnerable to automation accountants are the second largest highly resilient occupation in the state There are also political factors powerful unions have kept subway and train conductors employed despite automatability rates approaching 95 percent and social ones There are some 151 380 waiters in the state the 11th largest profession and just over three quarters of their work 76 9 percent is automatable Yet many people go out to eat as a special treat and value the human connection that a server provides and restaurants may find that humans are more effective at upselling a second round of drinks than any robot However some venues and businesses like airport terminals and fast food outlets have demonstrated a willingness to make this shift leading to the even higher automatability of fast food workers and the heightened risks for the entry level positions with the lowest barriers to entry Although relatively few of the fastest growing occupations in New York State are highly automatable the vast majority of growing fields will experience major changes The average automation potential of the 50 fastest growing occupations is nearly 39 percent This approaches the statewide average and is a reminder of just how much most jobs will change with two in five job tasks able to be done by machines instead of people in the near future Jobs in Major Occupational Categories That Are at Least Half Automatable All statewide data is for 2017 regional data 2016 the most recent years available As a result New Yorkers will require a new level of tech fluency to be prepared for the jobs of tomorrow many of which will become augmented by computers robots artificial intelligence and machine learning For example retail workers may need to manage Internet connected point of sale and inventory management systems and build advanced customer profiles while personal care workers may need to update client records using their smartphones or set up remote doctor visits via FaceTime Critical thinking adaptability and the ability to learn new tools will be crucial for most workers in the future as it should be now for the policymakers educators and business leaders responsible for preparing for the coming world of work The promise of automation is as great as any perceived peril but only if New Yorkers are ready to tackle these new and evolving occupations Photo Credit Franck V Unsplash 1 All statewide calculations are based on the Center for an Urban Future s analysis of 2017 data from the New York State

All Rights Reserved Search1 2 3 Last The President s Management Agenda intertwines agencies and initiatives governmentwide in a strategy to overhaul federal IT data management and workforce infrastructures But few agencies have the potential to feel that impact like the Office of Personnel Management Tasked with bringing more IT and cybersecurity talent into the government at a time when both are in high demand globally the agency must also navigate the fundamental reshaping of the government s civilian workforce which is increasingly being fueled by the emergence of technologies like artificial intelligence and automation In its Federal Workforce Priorities Report released last week OPM estimates that 45 percent of work activities could be automated today based on technology available in 2016 and five percent of all federal jobs could be done completely by machines That leaves the agency at a crossroads in how it shapes the future of the federal workforce and the services it will provide said Don Kettl a professor at the University of Maryland s School of Public Policy and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution This will not be your mother and father s OPM by the time we are done for sure he said The idea of managing an OPM purely on the basis of trying to create rules to make the existing system work will be a pretty bad fit for the system we know we are going to need To capitalize on a seismic change in the nature of work combined with a shrinking federal workforce the Trump administration and OPM have proposed an initiative to reskill some existing federal workers to into higher value work activities jobs while leveraging automation technology to streamline administrative functions As part of the PMA the Office of Management and Budget and its Office of Federal Procurement Policy will identify three areas suited for automation and develop pilots for them by the first quarter of 2019 By the second quarter of 2019 OMB will develop a plan to reskill federal workers impacted by automation efforts while an OPM pilot will assess the skills those employees will need The results of those pilots could be pivotal for agencies looking to stretch their budget said Mallory Barg Bulman vice president of research and evaluation at the Partnership for Public Service Bulman said a January 2018 report conducted by the Partnership and the IBM Center for The Business of Government found federal entities like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Air Force were already leveraging AI to gain efficiencies in how they collect data and navigate acquisition rules and regulations Federal agencies are looking for ways to do more with less she said The places where we ve seen it be successful are places where agencies have taken routine and tedious tasks and really found ways to automate it But even with the capabilities and resources gained by automation the emphasis placed on employee skills and the ability to recruit and retain those employees becomes greater and that s where OPM s role in reskilling and training becomes even more pronounced The truth is providing opportunities for training can really be a profound retention tool Bulman said When we looked at the Best Places to Work in the Federal Government scores for the Senior Executive Service members particularly those who were new to the SES and on the younger end training was the most powerful predictor of their intent to stay But because the PMA tries to tackle government s most difficult challenges in order to modernize it Kettl said OPM s role will be paramount We try to think broadly about the strategic role of government and the strategic transformation of its workforce to make that happen This is a very big deal he said It s something that s very important very fundamental and something that will require a very fundamental rethinking of the role of OPM in particular along the way New studies shed light on the job security of certain government jobs in an increasingly digital age Automation has already altered several industries and it s only a matter of time before it transforms more of them Given that many governments continue to grapple with tight budgets and suppressed staffing levels it s worth considering whether they might one day rely more on automation and technology to carry out tasks performed by humans Recent studies have shed some light on what this might look like particularly in the public sector Automation has already made some forays into government Kirke Everson a KPMG intelligent automation consultant cited chatbots utilized in call centers as an example He suggested that automation could soon replace personnel who perform repetitive back office tasks such as eligibility checks and other procedures following a defined set of rules Government is ripe for automation Everson says But if it requires a large amount of judgments or human interaction maybe you don t start there In the U K an estimated 861 000 public sector jobs could be automated by 2030 according to an analysis by Deloitte and Oxford University Administrative and operative roles which account for 27 percent of the public workforce were identified as having the highest probability of being automated These types of jobs are already declining and the report projects their numbers in the U K to fall further from 87 000 in 2015 to only 4 000 by 2030 A separate Oxford University study examined U S job occupations deeming about 47 percent of total employment in both government and the private sector to be at risk of computerization Some public sector roles considered most vulnerable included library workers postal service clerks and transportation inspectors all positions with highly repetitive tasks Many of the other occupations researchers identified were especially common in transportation These included bus drivers and subway or streetcar operators as well as highway maintenance workers tablecaption font

shown for predominately public sector occupations Source The Future of Employment How Susceptible are Jobs to Computerisation by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A Osborne But does this mean large numbers of public employees will one day be out of work Historically industrialization and improvements in technology haven t caused higher long term unemployment It s unknown whether this time will be any different though with economists offering different predictions for automation s effects Neil Reichenberg who heads the International Public Management Association for Human Resources views it more as a shift It s not so much cutting staff as it is moving people to more strategic higher level work he says While technology has already reshaped countless occupations across just about every segment of the economy it hasn t yet prompted the complete elimination of many types of jobs Consider teachers who employ greater use of educational software programs in classrooms These and other types of public employee positions haven t vanished but they do require greater tech skills than in years past Although some might associate automation with armies of robots it s computers that are most responsible for redefining work these days A recent Brookings Institution report assessed digitization or the degree of computer skills and related knowledge typically required of various occupations Several public sector jobs that required few digital skills in 2002 now mandate at least mid level proficiency of computers or other devices Parking enforcement workers and compliance officers for example might have relied entirely on paper records not long ago Today the Brookings data suggests digital skills for these occupations have jumped considerably over the past decade Source Brookings analysis of O Net OES and Moody s data In some ways automating various aspects of jobs could prove to be more difficult in the public sector than in the private sector Unions Reichenberg says will likely oppose efforts expected to result in job losses Last year the union membership rate for government workers was more than five times that of the private sector Still if automation offers governments ways to cut costs without sacrificing quality of services they ll likely consider it Resources remain limited Revenues aren t expected to grow much and total state and local government employment is still below levels reached a decade ago In some jurisdictions automated processes or technologies could enable governments to provide services that otherwise wouldn t be

Miguel Castilla Leave a CommentThe uncertainty of the future of work naturally raises a number of questions It is no wonder Argentina put it on the agenda as one of three priorities to be discussed at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires Will its impact be the same across the globe What jobs will be most affected What new skillsets will be required But above all how can governments prepare and what role can Multilateral Development Banks play All four leading regional development banks recently came together in Washington to present some key perspectives regarding the jobs of the future which can be found in the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives Here are a few worth considering On the one hand Emerging Europe Developing Asia Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean are witnessing how robotics automation and artificial intelligence are lowering costs and increasing productivity providing an opportunity for accelerated growth Countries like Estonia have taken the lead in digital technology youth in Nigeria and Ethiopia are harnessing technology to boost yields in agriculture in Vietnam and Bangladesh Information and Communication Technologies ICT is boosting the service industry and across Latin America and the Caribbean smartphone adoption is expected to reach beyond 70 by 2020 On the other hand as a result of this new wave of technological advances known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution a series of myths emerge that it is important to clarify Myth 1 All regions will be impacted in the same way The truth is that technology will be adopted at varying speeds depending on the region s economic development and demographic trends An aging population in Emerging Europe will face different challenges than Africa where 12 to 15 million young people enter the job market each year Myth 2 Mass unemployment is unavoidable The truth is that the jobless rate will be lower than originally expected Mass unemployment is unlikely to become a reality But the shifts in job opportunities will certainly require flexibility and access to new training tools which may in turn be provided by technology itself Myth 3 Automation will replace all human jobs and tasks The truth is that automation only takes place where it is both technically and economically feasible A human workforce will still be required in most sectors particularly those such as health and education At the same time it would be foolish to ignore the genuine threats of unemployment and increased income inequality that the rapid expansion of new technology will generate Above all as Multilateral Development Banks the question we need to be asking is how can governments ease the transition What can governments do to ensure that the largest number of people possible benefit from this transition Policymakers can take four actions to ease the adoption of technology while mitigating potentially adverse effects on jobs and incomes Multilateral Development Banks certainly have their own role to play not only by acting as think tanks for initiatives on how to capitalize on new technologies and mitigate their negative effects but also in coordinating global or regional policy responses strengthening partnerships between policymakers and employers to jointly identify and address challenges Our products and services will need to adapt A recent IDB health project in the Dominican Republic which uses drones to link remote rural clinics with hospital laboratories is a prime example of this Change will also take place within our workforce Outsourcing the IDB s human resources department from Washington to Costa Rica to ensure efficiency and reduce costs was certainly a step in the right direction It is important that we take the time to seriously identify the opportunities and risks the 21st century global job market presents so that together we can help shape the future of work In the meantime we must also remain relevant for our customer base and at the forefront of innovation Whether we succeed or not is up to all of us Downlaod the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives hereFiled Under Beyond development effectiveness Tagged With labor

in ensuring the long term future success of UK industry In line with this it has acknowledged that one of its grand challenges is putting the UK at the forefront of the AI and data revolution In fact comments from Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond have suggested that large swathes of government activity will soon be performed by AI and automation to free up time for human civil servants Automating some aspects of government jobs will result in savings and efficiencies However there are concerns that public sector workers will be at risk of losing their jobs to AI and automation in the next decade Think tank Reform estimated early last year that 250 000 of the UK s five million public sector workers risk losing jobs to AI and automation in the next 15 years Speaking to a House of Lords committee in 2017 Hammond said The government is looking at how it can apply artificial intelligence There are very significant areas of government activity which involve relatively low level decision making which will be highly susceptible to AI probably over a relatively short period of time which does present the tantalising possibility of being able to drive some real productivity enhancement in the delivery of government processes The truth is that automation in the public sector is already developing at a rapid pace New initiatives range from implementing AI and automation into day to day bureaucratic tasks such as form filling and applying for patents to using facial recognition technologies to verify the identity of individuals entering the UK But it s time to stop viewing AI and automation as an existential threat to our livelihoods Far from replacing people AI and automation will transform the workplace as menial tasks and some non routine jobs are digitalised through AI and process automation enabling greater efficiency while taking away some of the strain of day to day tasks In its industrial strategy report the UK government rightly realised we are at one of the most important exciting and challenging times in the history of global enterprise Importantly that report highlights that Britain is well placed to benefit from this new Industrial Revolution This digital revolution will be powered by humans increasing reliance on AI and automation Set to impact almost every sector of British industry AI and automation is here to stay Organisations are turning to digital transformation to boost innovation and enhance user experience and AI and automation will play a major role in this change While some jobs may disappear or evolve along the road to automation there is considerable opportunity for innovation and change AI and automation can give government departments both at the national and local level much faster access to sophisticated insights Combining this technology and big data will allow them to make better decisions more quickly for a greater number of citizens This ability to rapidly adapt to and drive new innovations is part of what allowed Britain to prosper and develop so quickly during the first industrial revolution After all as the government goes on to note in the industrial strategy report We are an open enterprising economy built on invention innovation and competition We have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business with high standards respected institutions and the reliable rule of law We have achieved near historic levels of employment We are a crossing point for the world because of our geographic position the English language our strong ties our openness to ideas and our vibrant culture Driving an automated future offers a wide range of benefits Not least is the prospect of boosting productivity across all of Britain s leading industries from high tech post industrial manufacturing through to the creative industries sector The UK s industrial strategy has already identified the four grand challenges in the years ahead as artificial intelligence and big data clean growth the future of mobility and meeting the needs of an ageing society Astute investments in AI and automation can enable huge productivity boosts UK consumers are already beginning to recognise that more organisations are embracing this technology and the advantages it can offer including within the public sector In fact after surveying 2 000 UK consumers on their attitudes towards AI and automation in government last year OpenText found that two thirds of UK citizens 66 per cent believe this technology will be introduced into government services within 20 years with 16 per cent claiming that this could happen in the next two years The same poll revealed less fear and uncertainty about the introduction of AI and automation in government than many headlines suggest The majority of those surveyed were not concerned about the implementation of this technology in government with over a quarter 26 per cent going as far as claiming AI and automated technologies would be able to make better decisions than most elected representatives though they would prefer for final decisions to be made by a human Many respondents recognised the immediate benefits of the technology A fifth 20 per cent felt that updating processes by bringing in AI and automation would lead to less admin and form filling Additionally 24 per cent pinpointed reduced waiting times as a major advantage while 19 per cent thought that there would be fewer errors in government as a result of the effective implementation of AI and automation This research shows increasing acceptance of AI and automation as a method to improve services but Britain still has some way to go to fully embrace its potential The UK ranked lowest 16 per cent across the countries surveyed when asked if AI and automated technology would be working in government in the next five years showing more hesitance around its uptake than countries such as France 24 per cent the Netherlands 28 per cent and the USA 22 per cent AI and automation will transform the workplace and bring a wide range of benefits to all sectors including the public sector With the potential to increase the speed efficiency and effectiveness of a wide range of government services AI and automated technologies cannot be ignored While the technology already exists the key challenge over the next few years will be gaining trust amongst both public sector employees and British citizens Mark Baillie director public sector UK Ireland OpenText Image Credit Razum ShutterstockSign up below to

text: Apple has integrated 9 000 trees into its futuristic new headquarters campus reflecting research showing that greenery in workplaces increases productivity by 15 percent Several years ago Google s People Analytics division launched Project Aristotle to understand the components of productive teams embracing research that groups are more creative than individuals Private sector businesses are automating tedious tasks augmenting workers with artificial intelligence technologies reskilling and upskilling their workforces focusing on employee wellness and hungrily recruiting talent Government will have to catch up Perhaps nowhere is the gap between the public and private sector greater than in workforce management Most public sector organizations are still locked into decades old employee policies such as rigid job classifications lockstep pay and a reliance on seniority as a substitute for capability The reality is that government agencies are increasingly called upon to address society s most complex challenges while using workforce approaches rooted in the distant past The good news Change is possible and beginning to happen A new Deloitte study explores some of the ways the nature of government work the public workforce itself and the workplace it occupies will all need to continue to evolve Work New technologies can transform the capabilities of a government worker Artificially intelligent chatbots for example can perform triage on citizen questions freeing human attention for less routine queries The Army s recruitment chatbot SGT STAR does the work of 55 recruiters answering 94 percent of questions A Deloitte analysis of AI s potential found that automation could save the federal government as much as 1 2 billion hours of work annually What AI doesn t automate it can enhance Child welfare caseworkers who according to one study spend just 9 percent of their time with children but 37 5 percent of their time on paperwork could use technology to auto populate documentation freeing time for visits AI also can correlate hospital truancy and arrest records to flag children in danger Some restaurant health inspectors already analyze big data to identify likely candidates for inspections In Chicago for instance tests found 24 percent more critical violations and on average isolated dangers from the food system a week earlier For effective work redesign it s helpful to adopt a two pronged strategy of zooming in and zooming out A zooming in approach hones in on individual tasks and processes that have the most potential to be optimized through automation Zooming out entails looking at the bigger picture to define what work redesign means for entire job classifications departments and the organization as a whole Workforce Specialists in fields like cybersecurity agile development and artificial intelligence are not likely to commit decades to one government position and if they did they d still need to swap into the tech sector periodically to sharpen their skills That s why some government technology programs are taking a tour of duty approach letting private sector experts serve in the public sector for a few years on specific projects without locking them into a lifetime of government work At the federal level the General Services Administration s 18F digital services agency the Oak Ridge Institute for Science Education and the Presidential Innovation Fellows program all help government solve problems with temporary outside hires At the state level Michigan s Cyber Civilian Corps a volunteer group of cybersecurity professionals from the private sector and academia as well as government can be called upon if the governor declares a cyber emergency And long term government workers don t need to be stuck in one place A talent cloud can prepare for unexpected staffing needs by identifying in advance workers with special skills and applying them to tasks suited to their expertise Canada is experimenting with letting multiple agencies dip into a talent cloud and hire workers for specific missions Workers keep their union membership rights and benefits but may be called into service by any agency Workplace Empirical science rarely guides hiring But management is becoming more data driven Applying the newest science on team building personal efficiency and employee wellness to government agencies can upgrade the workplace to better attract retain and utilize talent Insights from studies of the composition and functioning of effective teams can inform decisions about using talents more effectively Organizational network analysis for example can use metadata from emails and other sources to map communication patterns in organizations accurately predicting individuals who will be high performers detecting unsatisfied employees six months before they actually quit and identifying leadership behaviors that correlate with success Modern workplace wellness programs are also extremely impactful Improving employee wellness can reduce lost work days increase retention and fuel productivity After the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center provided a physician and nurse case manager for employees it saw an 80 percent decline in lost work days over six years for a cost savings of 1 5 million In short the future of government work will require a level of dynamic workforce management far beyond the current practices of the public sector The potential for government agencies to unlock more human capital potential and make the public sector a magnet for talent is enormous As Buffalo s former mayor demonstrated to bring the right people together you have to know what it takes to make a project succeed Local governments are using internet surveys to better gauge residents needs Some states are finding ways to make rules easier to navigate and less costly for business while continuing to protect the public s interests The amount of missing and unusable public sector data is stunning Every jurisdiction should be comparing itself with its peers to identify problematic practices increase productivity and reduce costs It s all too easy for team members to misunderstand something Effective leaders know the value of the pre brief Our Deputy Chair Karen Chester gave a speech to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia CEDA WA on 17 July 2018 in Perth Jobs matter For almost all of us they are a source of income But they are also a source of self esteem of social interaction a feeling of purpose and even of community And the skills embedded in jobs remain principal drivers of increasing productivity and ultimately wages So when one opines on the future of work people tend to listen But perhaps when one is opining on the future of work today expectations of the listener are more akin to the BBC announcer of Monty Python s Flying Circus and now for something completely different When perhaps it s simply not so different And I guess that may well prove the damp squib hashtag for my talk today We know from history that soothsayers abound when it comes to opining on the future of work Indeed history is littered with the foretelling of a dystopia of jobless woe or a utopia of little need to work at all And the only universal truth seems to be that they were all wrong both happily and unhappily so The 20th century father of the fiscal stimulus John Maynard Keynes foretold in 1930 that In the 21st century a 15 hour work week will suffice as we turn instead to how to use freedom from pressing economic cares And yet despite significant productivity gains since the Keynes 1930 treatise we still all work on average around 40 hours a week In the late 1970s the historian Ian Turner presided over a major symposium on what new technologies would mean for the worker He predicted an imminent period of change as significant as the Neolithic or Industrial Revolutions To quote By 1988 at least a quarter of the Australian workforce would be made redundant by technological change And a similar adage we heard in 1982 from Barry Jones in his book Sleepers Awake technology and the future of work We all know that the late 1980s did see an exponential uptick in the common use of computers in workplaces and even more so in the 90s as the price of the humble computer plummeted But the foretelling of widespread redundancies of the Australian workforce were not seen For throughout the past 100 years it s been more a case of technology remaining the loyal friend not foe of the worker continuing to remove jobs that are often unpleasant physically tiring downright dangerous or just tedious think toll booth operator More recently we ve seen a plethora of papers and reports produced by think tanks academics consultants and platform giants touting analyses of jobs that could be lost as a result of the latest wave of technological change And that latest wave being the digital age and both the resultant automation and artificial intelligence Some of these reports seem to have settled on a nice big round figure of about 40 per cent of today s jobs now being at risk of automation over the next 10 to 20 years Now most of these reports stem from a seminal 2013 paper by Frey and Osborne where US data was used to predict job losses in the future But their approach left out a few things It did not take into account that new technologies can create new jobs Nor did it contemplate that not all tasks within an occupation can be automated or should be automated And we know that the rate of technological adoption will also depend a lot on consumer preferences do you want a robot cutting your hair and the actual cost or put crudely the business case of adoption Others in taking these factors into account suggest 9 of Australian workers are exposed to the risk of automation So a much smaller but not insignificant number And here I ll mention the must read paper by Melbourne University economists Jeff Borland and Michael Coelli Are the Robots Taking Our Jobs Their work lines up with the more considered studies in the US and Europe So let s look at the evidence a common sense thing to do when in the midst of a chorus of now for something completely different To test whether we have strayed into a world of lies lies and damned statistics And in looking at the evidence I ve drawn on some of the Commission s recent endeavour such as our Digital Disruption report 2016 and Shifting the Dial 2017 as well as the work of Jeff Borland and Michael Coelli and that of Bart van Ark of The Conference Board Overall the evidence suggests that labour markets have been pretty well resilient to shocks posed by new technologies of the past century and even the most recent modern bit Occupations skills and jobs come and they go No matter how transformative the technology be it the telephone electricity indoor plumbing refrigeration air transport the personal computer and today s digital No technology has removed people s capacity to work And in productivity terms all have been more transformative than the digital revolution so far with emphasis being on the so far And a bunch of measures suggest that technology is not having as large of an effect as expected at least not in our current modern times The rise of the New Digital Economy which encompasses mobile technology ubiquitous access to the internet and the world of the cloud is unquestionably changing lots of things But to date productivity is not one So much so that this has become known as the Productivity Paradox So whilst our low rate of multi factor productivity growth observed recently is not unique to Australia it has been observed across other countries too it represents something of a puzzle This is because it suggests that at least in aggregate our economies have not become any more efficient in producing things And we know the policy reasons why productivity may have slowed in Australia but this is notwithstanding our purported better ability to exploit information technologies One explanation for this is that there has been a change in the nature of technological progress That recent technologies characterised by some as dramatic have been minor compared to those in the previous century The other explanation one offered by Bart van Ark and perhaps one of intuitive appeal is that whilst we still see rapidly declining ICT prices along with a shift from ICT investment to ICT services perhaps the new digital economy is still in its installation phase And we shouldn t expect to see the productivity dividend until it truly enters the deployment phase This makes sense when you see that in the US the contribution of the most ICT intensive industries to productivity growth has dropped markedly from 46 to 26 in the past decade 2007 16 And for the US and the UK it has even at times registered negative productivity growth in these sectors Which could suggest that the dividend only makes its way into the deployment and hopefully productivity dividend phase once users fully grapple with how to absorb technology effectively So returning to the evidence on the impact on jobs And we do know that there has been automation of many tasks in the workplace But arguably if technology was both disruptive and displacing replacing existing jobs without creating new ones we would expect to see a persistent upward trend in the unemployment rate And we don t Whilst routine manual and routine cognitive jobs have fallen as a proportion of jobs from 50 to 37 non routine manual and non routine cognitive jobs have increased from 42 to 53 Think child care aged care nursing office managers designers and engineers using software Most importantly the aggregate amount of work available to the Australian population on a per capita basis has not seen a decline since the 1980s when computers became common in the workplace The amount of work available has actually increased by about 14 since the early 1980s But that s not to say there hasn t been a lot of change in our workforce and the nature of work since the 1980s Since the 1980s the workforce participation rate for females has increased a lot by some 15 percentage points to now be just over 60 Marriage and even children are placing much less of a brake on economic participation of women Which is both a good thing for the economy and for women There has also been an increase in the incidence of part time jobs by some 25 percentage points since the late 1960s to now account for nearly one third of total employment around 35 in Australia And despite what some have suggested the pace at which workers are changing between jobs in the Australian labour market is not getting quicker Not only is there no evidence that more workers are being forced to work in short duration jobs but what is apparent is that the opposite has happened The proportion of workers in very long duration jobs more than 10 years has increased from just under 20 per cent in 1982 to around 27 per cent in 2016 Which is perhaps unsurprising when you also take into account the participation rate of older Australians 65 in age has risen steeply having nearly doubled in the past 30 years to now represent 12 of our workforce Also a good thing with our ageing population We do know that more workers today have multiple jobs now around 7 of workers And perhaps of much greater significance when workers do change jobs today more are changing occupations some 40 and industries over 50 And it was this modern day workforce reality that informed much of our thinking around the Commission s proposed changes to superannuation default arrangements in our current superannuation Inquiry And our thinking on what is needed from our tertiary education system which I ll return to later And whilst the gig economy is still in its infancy this has not translated yet to any increase in the proportion of the workforce being independent contractors Indeed this has not changed significantly since 2001 it s actually fallen a few percentage points from 20 per cent of employed persons in 2001 to around 18 per cent in 2014 So what does any of this mean or matter for public policy And perhaps here our focus should be two fold First on making sure there are no road blocks to our economy reaching the deployment phase of the digital or any technological age And second making sure we avoid a workforce of have and have nots in the benefits from the changes in the economy and ultimately jobs A sense of equality in the ultimate job productivity and wage dividend So let me pose a few policy questions Are we getting better at assisting transitioning workers We know that structural change whatever its source can result in considerable work and thus life disruption for the workers impacted unless we get the consequential skill adjustment right So have we gotten better in assisting displaced workers get the right skills to transition into new occupations and industries Recent work by the Commission on transitioning regional economies found that effectiveness of government in doing this is at best unclear Some programs found to be not well targeted automotive industry or create conflicting incentives Tasmanian forestry industry And why unclear use of data to simply track the impacted workers and decent evaluation of transitional assistance are largely missing in action Put simply we can and should be doing better Further it s a tad perverse that if the digital economy ultimately disrupts more jobs we do not use the data fuelling that economic activity to assist those disrupted We know of such endeavour in Germany using data to track the worker and the resultant human capital modelling which in turn better informs what requalification programs will deliver a better job transition to a displaced worker Are the right incentives in place to get the workers to the new jobs We know that jobs at least risk of automation jobs that require soft skills such as good old fashioned empathy account for the largest and growing part of our workforce And the latest metrics from the ABS brand new quarterly labour account experimental estimates reveal health care and social assistance as the largest employment sectors accounting for over 1 6 million jobs or 12 2 of all filled jobs This is largely a function of our demographic changes an ageing population women working more along with the NDIS arguably our single biggest social reform since Medicare The Commission s recent review of NDIS costs found that the NDIS workforce was not growing fast enough most regions require between a 50 per cent and 150 per cent increase in the disability services workforce Put simply for the foreseeable future 1 in 5 new jobs in Australia are projected to be for services for the NDIS Thus care is needed to ensure that the demand for these skills and workers is not frustrated by poor incentives The most notable as highlighted in our NDIS review being the need to ensure the pricing of these services allows this massive labour force response to occur Lest we have a program delivering disappointment and not services to the 475 000 Australians with eligible disabilities Is our education and training system fit for purpose for the workers of today and tomorrow Perhaps this is our biggest public policy must have when thinking of ensuring innovation and technology delivers not just more jobs but jobs for most That sense of equality in who shares in the ultimate job productivity and wage dividend And this was a question the Commission sought to ask and answer last year in our inaugural 5 yearly productivity review Shifting the Dial A policy roadmap for Australian Governments on what is needed to deliver on economic participation and productivity two of the three Ps population participation and productivity that matter most for economic growth and ultimately jobs and their real wages And we identified some fundamental fractures in our current education and training system First deteriorating results in subjects that matter for future work think science maths and reading the cognitive trifecta at school Second the VET system is a mess struggling to deliver relevant competency based qualifications Employers today are more satisfied with non accredited training courses 90 than VET 76 Third universities need to improve student employment outcomes delivering qualifications relevant to labour market needs and at a time relevant to the worker s needs Our key educational institutions seem more focused on research than student employment outcomes which is unsurprising given the notable absence of their skin in the game As manifest in 26 of students today not completing their undergraduate studies in less than 9 years Whilst undergraduate underemployment has more than doubled in the last decade to now reach just over 20 Currently the tertiary education system is set up against becoming a chef at age 40 or a dementia care worker at age 50 Retraining is currently inconvenient and expensive and the approach of educational institutions remains outdated and outmoded still emphasising a one career for life approach Which is not the modern day reality for many workers from the metrics cited earlier Taken collectively this unfortunate troika can only put at risk our capacity to deal with future labour market changes in an efficient and equitable way So we ve proposed a few things change for schools evidence and evaluation of what works with teaching for universities incentives be redressed around student employment outcomes and for work skills government to develop two things First tools for proficiency based assessment for skills rather than simply competency based assessment whether they can perform it at all And second a framework to facilitate independent accreditation of skills obtained agnostic of learning method Do current policy settings constrain us getting to and through the installation phase and on to realising benefits in the deployment phase of the digital economy Today s market power arguably resides in data and content The growth of the digital economy automation and artificial intelligence coupled with greater availability of data and algorithm advances will be key drivers of new business activity research endeavour products skills and jobs In short access and use of data and content will be the determining force in realising the economic benefits of the digital economy and artificial intelligence On data the Commission s report last year on Data Use and Availability proposed fundamental and novel changes to data availability and access policy to ensure it generates new economic opportunities and business opportunities driven by consumer needs and preferences A pro consumer and thus pro competition stimulus with the consumer in the drivers seat for their data held with business and government today And the good news is the Government s response to this inquiry has been one of can and will do The Government has committed to support the two most structurally significant recommendations First the passage of national legislation to remove barriers to data sharing and integration across major public interest data sets and create trusted user access And second the complementary legislated concept of a new general Right for Consumers to exercise joint control in the sharing and use of their data So it s now all down to getting the implementation right On content the Commission s Inquiry in 2016 on Intellectual Property Arrangements examined whether those arrangements meet the needs of the Australian economy And the short answer was no for copyright Currently Australia s copyright exceptions are too narrow and prescriptive do not reflect the way people today consume and use content and do not readily accommodate new legitimate uses of copyright material We found ourselves mired in the wrong debate of publishers clamouring for well protected profit for the purported benefit of local authors For access to content be it snippets of images maps pixels words song sounds is needed alongside data to actually do artificial intelligence But our arrangements unlike those in countries like the US South Korea and Israel pose a seemingly impenetrable barrier to AI being alive and well in our economy For in the absence of meaningful reform to copyright Australia will inevitably and demonstrably be a net importer of AI services and products And fair access to content also matters for education Now more than ever workers need flexible access to ongoing learning MOOCs are a key component of providing low cost and flexible access to ongoing learning And in consulting with the states on Shifting the Dial we were implored to think of the transitioning worker in NW Tasmania in our approach to ongoing skills acquisition especially for mature age workers Yet Australia s current system of copyright usage heavily constrain Universities TAFEs and schools from offering MOOCs So on a final note I ve failed dismally to foretell a future of dystopia or utopia and happily so but that doesn t mean that the deployment phase of the digital economy may yet still surprise us And in reflecting on the Inquiries that formed much of the Commission s endeavour over the last five years or so nearly all have dealt in some way shape or form with the now of work and thus the future of work And in doing so tried to view it through the lens of the needs of workers and students And through that lens it affords a sense of what policies new or tweaked will see our economy able to access the installation phase and realise the benefits of the deployment phase of any technological change And perhaps most importantly ensuring those phases see the benefits of jobs productivity and higher wages shared across the workforce Avoiding a world of technology driven haves and have nots Because that s what matters most for the future of work Follow OnSubscribeThe Commission has published an issues paper and one pager for our inquiry into technological

agenda since 1964 Our learning programs help organizations accelerate growth by unlocking their people s potential Higher costs and rising demand have driven rapid increases in spending on core public services such as education healthcare and transport while countries must grapple with complex challenges such as population aging economic inequality and protracted security concerns Government expenditure amounts to more than a third of global GDP budgets are strained and the world public sector deficit is close to 4 trillion a year At the same time governments are struggling to meet citizens rising expectations Satisfaction with key state services such as public transportation schools and healthcare facilities is less than half that of nonstate providers such as banks or utilities Governments need a way to deliver better outcomes and a better experience for citizens at a sustainable cost A new paper by the McKinsey Center for Government MCG Government productivity Unlocking the 3 5 trillion opportunity suggests that goal is within reach It shows that several countries have achieved dramatic productivity improvements in recent years for example by improving health public safety and education outcomes while maintaining or even reducing spending per capita or per student in those sectors If other countries were to match the improvements already demonstrated in these pockets of excellence the world s governments could potentially save as much as 3 5 trillion a year by 2021 equivalent to the entire global fiscal gap Alternatively countries could choose to keep spending constant while boosting the quality of key services For example if all the countries studied had improved the productivity of their healthcare systems at the rate of comparable best performers over the past 5 years they would have added 1 4 years to the healthy life expectancy of their combined populations That translates into 12 billion healthy life years gained without additional per capita spending It s imperative that governments find a way to unlock that productivity opportunity The challenge is that until now there s been limited progress on measuring government productivity even though productivity is a well established and vital measure of the performance of national economies and private sector businesses As a result it is difficult for governments to gauge the true return on spending and debate is often focused on how to increase inputs and not the quality of outputs Governments typically find it challenging to identify improvement opportunities by learning from other countries or from other regions or sectors within the same country To help close this gap MCG built a comprehensive database and benchmarking methodology the Government Productivity Scope to start to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of government expenditure MCG applied the tool across 42 countries that together make up 80 percent of global GDP focusing on seven sectors healthcare primary secondary and tertiary education public safety road transport and tax collection The research was supplemented with insights from more than 50 interviews with government leaders and more than 200 case studies This paper presents the first version of MCG s analysis which we will continue to extend and refine in dialogue with government leaders and academic experts The initial findings point to dramatic differences in countries relative productivity Even among comparable countries with very similar outcomes the least efficient government currently spends more than twice as much per unit of output as its most efficient peer And while most countries have struggled to contain spending growth in every sector MCG found examples of governments that have reduced expenditure per unit while experiencing improved outcomes These differences point to a tremendous opportunity for governments to boost productivity save money and achieve better outcomes for citizens To realize that opportunity though governments need to deepen their functional capabilities in four key areas finance commercial digital technology and data analytics and talent management As MCG shows pioneering countries have reimagined and strengthened these functions so they play a more strategic leadership role in pursuing efficiency and improving outcomes Across these areas those governments have adopted an ambitious structured approach to transform the effectiveness of the state Please sign in to print or download this article Please create a profile to

represents the biggest leap forward in terms of work productivity since the personal computer and few other industries can benefit from AI as much as government With AI we can change the way government works and help employees do their job better AI is already integrated into numerous cloud platforms and can be used to discover new information and deliver outcomes instantly I like to refer to this as practical AI AI has the potential to improve employee experiences by speeding up decision making and automating mundane and repetitive tasks Bringing machine learning to everyday work enables government agencies and departments to make better decisions faster because they do not have to hunt for data and aggregate it into a spreadsheet By building intelligence into platforms AI helps manage complex workflows and allows organizations to One way that AI will be applied in the workplace is automating service requests Most companies have an IT service desk as well as a customer support center These functions ensure that customers and employees receive help in a timely manner whether it is a request for a new computer a password reset or the status of a repair Manually triaging thousands of incidents or cases categorizing tasks and routing work can consume resources introduce human error and slow resolution In fact a new report from Accenture found that customer support functions spend up to 12 percent of their time categorizing prioritizing and assigning tickets Meanwhile AI accurately categorizes requests nearly instantly It eliminates the bottleneck created by agents having to manually assign categorize and route requests A full two days a week is wasted on manual administrative work according to the recent State of Work survey conducted by ServiceNow If an agency with 5 000 people automated those processes they could get 4 million work hours back a year Adding AI frees up employees to do the work they want to do spurring creativity Nearly half of respondents 48 percent said work levels increased by 20 percent or more after they adopted AI solutions Additionally 91 percent of executives say their skilled employees spend too much time on admin tasks and 93 percent believe that reducing mundane tasks unleashes employee creativity To properly implement AI solutions across government agencies we need to define which tasks are best suited for humans and which ones should be performed by AI The government has a term inherently governmental to describe work processes or decisions that must be done by government employees Contractors do much of the work in our government agencies but certain work is inherently governmental in nature As we move into an age defined by AI we need to identify and define the work processes and decisions that are inherently human We are going to increasingly work in a blended workplace with AI systems and humans working together to achieve a mission There are certain activities within any work environment that can only be performed or should only be performed by humans While there may be many more human activities designated as inherently human in the beginning I believe that as humans become more comfortable with the role of AI in the blended workforce less and less work will be designated as inherently human There will always be a need for humans to remain in charge from factual responsibility and liability aspects as well as from emotional and psychological ones We spend a third of our lives at work It shapes who we are how we feel and how we interact with the world so we must create great work experiences and this is what AI does AI creates work experiences that unleash productivity bringing out the best in us Rather than fearing machines stealing jobs we need to understand how AI will change the way government works though small but practical ways and prepare the workforce of the future for this change About the AuthorBob Osborn is CTO Federal of

for our newsletter I agree to this site s Privacy Policy Thank you for inviting me to speak with you here today In particular I want to thank the Productivity Commission and all involved in the Productivity Hub The previous presenters today have touched on a range of ideas for how we can face the challenge of improving our productivity in a changing world From technology and data to public services and the energy transition I m excited to see forward thinking people working on such a broad range of important topics I d like to commend you all and encourage you to keep up the good work My presentation today will focus on an issue that is at the heart of a productive economy how we approach the rapidly changing world of work I want to talk about how this fits with the overall economic strategy of the Government the core policy areas that we have identified to support New Zealanders in this process and the institutional settings required to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of the Future of Work Economic StrategyBy harnessing the potential of new technology and innovation educating and upskilling our workforce and incentivising research and development we can lift productivity and transition to an economy that is sustainable inclusive and productive That is this Government s overarching economic aim The lessons learned from the Future of Work Commission heavily influenced this Government s economic strategy We aim to shape an economy where we work smarter make better use of our resources ensure everyone who wants to work can work and ensure that the benefits of growth are spread across society In an article published this past weekend Rod Oram argued that we can rise to the immense challenge of making this a high value high wage economy over the next decade The global and local conditions for doing so are the most favourable ever I know there is an appetite among businesses and workers to take up this challenge and I couldn t agree more that the time is right to face up to this Boosting productivity across the economy will be one of the key drivers to improving New Zealanders living standards and wellbeing The Government will put this at the heart of what we do Our focus on lifting wellbeing will require a different approach and different measures of success We want to take a broader view of success and move beyond simple measures such as GDP which while an important measure of economic output does not tell the full story of peoples wellbeing We are working with our Confidence and Supply partner the Green Party on new sustainable development indicators to paint a fuller picture of how well off people are and how the Government can focus its resources best I have also instructed the Treasury to accelerate their work on the Living Standards Framework which measures the impact of policies on four capitals Human Social Natural and Financial Physical I intend to use this framework to inform the Budget process for Budget 2019 making it our first ever Wellbeing Budget By placing wellbeing at the heart of what we do we will be able to measure the extent to which our policies and investments are making real improvements to peoples lives Improving productivity is key to improving wellbeing By producing more from every hour worked businesses become more profitable incomes rise and workers wellbeing rises as time is freed up and purchasing power rises The challenge is how we achieve this The Changing World of WorkThis Government has come into office at an interesting time in New Zealand s economic story Technological advances are transforming our world for example through increased processing power and big data sensors remote work or smart devices The full effect of forces such as automation algorithms and globalisation are not yet known but we do know that they already are and will continue to be disruptive to what only 5 or 10 years ago we considered the status quo My thinking on this topic was shaped by the Future of Work Commission which I chaired for the Labour Party when we were in Opposition It was an ambitious undertaking that saw us engage with thousands of New Zealanders and experts from around the world It is hard to distil that work down to a few points but overall my takeaway is that there is an enormous possibility for us to have productive and fulfilling work over the coming decades But it will only happen if we prepare now We are facing a world where the change has been estimated by McKinsey Global Institute to be occurring at ten times the pace of the Industrial Revolution and 300 times the scale or roughly 3 000 times the impact Every aspect of our working lives is changing Whole jobs are disappearing and almost every job is being re shaped The very notion of what a job is has been challenged by the so called gig economy Advances in technology present both challenges and opportunities for this sometimes all at once For example a company which automates production of its products will experience productivity gains but there might be consequences for the company s workers What happens to those who are laid off How well positioned are they to quickly retrain Could their past training help them swiftly move into other work How can we benefit from changes to the nature of work while negating or limiting the disadvantages We cannot say with any certainty exactly what the world of work will look like but there are some core changes we can identify and the responses to them that are needed This represents both challenges and opportunities How we respond will drive the future of New Zealand s economy and shape how productive sustainable and inclusive our growth will be over the next few decades We all know the story of the New Zealand economy Over the past 20 years New Zealand has generally done well in the creating more part of the productivity equation GDP growth has averaged about 2 8 over that time compared to the OECD average of 2 1 But it s the other part of the equation the resources required to create more where we have been weak Of that headline growth about 1 7 can be attributed to growth in the volume of labour input or simply total hours worked In other words we required strong population growth and more people entering the workforce to ensure more hours were worked in order to increase production More people working is not a recipe for long term sustainable and inclusive growth The portion of that growth which can be attributed to getting more from each unit of labour in producing goods and services has been 1 1 of that 2 8 over the past 20 years that is we are one of the weaker performers in the OECD In fact our relatively low labour productivity growth over a long period of time means the level of labour productivity in New Zealand GDP per hour worked is about 20 below the OECD average The Productivity Commission has told us that New Zealand s shallow capital markets have meant low levels of investment of productive capital the stuff we need to invest in to help us create more from our available resources Our investment in non residential capital per person in the labour force in 2016 was 25 lower than the OECD average In order to get ahead in terms of headline growth we relied on more people coming here to work and those who were already here to enter work We are at a point where the level of labour productivity in New Zealand GDP per hour worked is around 30 below Australia We have to do something different In recent years the main growth drivers have been population growth and a run away housing market That is not a sustainable path and as those forces recede we need to move deliberately and with urgency to establish an economy that is based on a thriving productive sector We also have to ensure that the benefits of this growth translate into meaningful improvements to the living standards of many New Zealanders who missed out in recent years I spoke earlier about our Government s emphasis on wellbeing and delivering higher living standards for all New Zealanders We want to ensure the economy is delivering real benefits to peoples lives rather than simply pursuing growth for the sake of growth Our success in achieving this will largely be determined by how we respond to the challenges we face including New Zealand s productivity challenge With this in mind today I want to talk you through this Government s plan to ensure we are prepared to face the changes that are coming due to technological advances and the changing nature of work In responding to this our Future of Work report identified three core values to drive our response We need to be Inclusive offering opportunity and harnessing the talents of all Resilient to deal with the changes and shocks that are coming our way and Adaptable to be leaders of the change and shape it in line with our values There are a huge range of policy approaches and changes to the way we run our economy that are needed to meet these challenges and take the opportunities that will arise Our Tax Working Group and the reforms we are making to the Reserve Bank Act are an important part of setting the path to a more productive economy That focus on improving productivity is at the heart of the terms of reference for both these reviews Beyond these we had more than 63 recommendations in our report and you will be pleased I am not going to go through them all now I want to touch on just a few of the main themes Just TransitionIn the face of this rapid change it is essential that we have a just transition for those most affected We saw in New Zealand in the 1980s and 1990s the damage that can be done when major changes are made without enough thought or support given to those who face the immediate consequences In this instance I am using that phrase to primarily talk about two things one at a system level the other at a practical on the ground level The government has committed itself to the goal of a net zero carbon economy by 2050 This is an essential shift for New Zealand away from an economy that hastens climate change to one that is more sustainable and develops New Zealand s strategic advantages We will need to ensure this is a just transition where affected industries and communities are given the support to find new sustainable growth opportunities We are in the process of establishing an Independent Climate Commission which will have the job of establishing goals and targets Meanwhile under the leadership of Hon James Shaw a Green Investment Fund is being created to leverage private sector investment to support business developments that will support a low carbon economy Innovation science and research will have significant roles to play in this However New Zealand s total investment in Research and Development is only 1 3 of GDP about half the OECD average When the OECD issued its most recent assessment of the New Zealand economy last year this is what it had to say on R D Expenditure on R D is low as a share of GDP most notably in the business sector Collaboration between firms education and research institutions is low And its advice Increase fiscal support for business research and development Maintain or increase long term support for successful collaboration between research institutions and industry In the Coalition Agreement with New Zealand First we have set a target of hitting an R D spend of 2 of GDP in ten years That s more than a 50 increase in R D investment relative to GDP over that time and will make a significant contribution to improving our productivity Officials say that this is an ambitious goal We believe this can be done with the Government incentivising such vital work by the private sector Minister for Research Science and Innovation Megan Woods has already begun work on overhauling New Zealand s R D regime with Ministers set to discuss officials initial findings later this month We are committed in the first instance to restoring R D tax credits to give firms some certainty about their investments One other key investment identified in our Future of Work programme is in direct support of the technology sector and for businesses to make better use of new technology Research by Swedish academic and technologist Goran Roos found that 55 of New Zealand jobs are at risk due to technological advances and that countries likely to be least affected will be those with the highest levels of economic complexity This is just one of the reasons why it is important for us to diversify our skills base and look for more sustainable drivers of growth By putting the right policies and incentives in place the technology sector can be one of those economic drivers While technological advances present challenges to existing jobs we also have the opportunity to create new forms of work According to NZTech chief executive Graeme Muller only 14 percent of large NZ businesses have deployed any enabling technology for the Internet of Things despite 70 percent believing it will be strategically important for their business to do so Their concerns are largely around costs and changes in technology This Government wants to nurture an environment that gives businesses the confidence to take up new technology Minister Clare Curran is in the process of creating the position of Chief Technology Officer CTO who will report directly to the Prime Minister and Cabinet The CTO will be responsible for introducing and managing a National Digital Architecture and Digital Technology Roadmap They will also work with the wider industry to develop ingenuity and creativity in the ICT sector Our aim is for the ICT industry to be our second largest contributor to GDP by 2025 Learning For LifeThe other critical element of a just transition to this new world of work is how we support people to gain the relevant skills and knowledge We need to both support those workers whose jobs are under threat and prepare those who are yet to start working for the kind of labour market they are likely to enter New Zealand currently spends a fraction of what other countries do on active labour market policies Other countries around the world such as Singapore France and Germany have recognised that they need to both plan ahead for the changes but also provide greater support for people who are displaced by technological change The Future of Work was the catalyst for our three years free training and education policy One of this Government s key policies is to provide one year of free post secondary education or training gradually progressing to 3 years by 2025 In 2018 we will see 30 000 students enrolled in tertiary education courses and 50 000 in industry training without paying fees for their first year of education thanks to this policy This is extremely important for those whose jobs or future jobs are affected by automation and other technologies One aspect of this policy has not had a lot of attention which is for adults who have never trained or studied before They will be able to take up the three years free policy as it is rolled out This can be taken in short bursts or as complete re training This policy also covers the costs of those undertaking apprenticeships and aspects of industry training Because of the relative costs from 2018 this means two years free for apprentices right away For the next generation of people entering the workforce it is essential they are given the skills to be resilient and adaptable In the Future of Work Commission s time we heard from employer after employer that they were looking for people with what we once called soft skills the ability to collaborate be creative and solve problems These ideas lie at the heart of New Zealand s education curriculum but there is work to do to ensure they are developed for all our young people We will be embarking on a host of initiatives to see this happen including reform of our careers advice and guidance in schools to give all young people the opportunity to understand and experience the world of work This will be developed in close cooperation with business and training providers to create a more seamless transition from school to whatever comes next In January Employment Minister Willie Jackson announced the first of a series of initiatives to help give a group of young people who have fallen outside of the system sustainable work opportunities Sadly Maori and Pacifika young people are over represented among this group They are the most at risk of being excluded from the future of work and we need practical programmes that provide work experience to get them back into a training journey In the long term I believe we will need to radically alter the way we think about training and learning and work if we are to continue to lift productivity As the pace of technological change picks up we need to see ourselves as genuinely learning for life In many ways jobs will be events on that learning and training journey rather than the other way around This presents a series of challenges and opportunities for our education and training system that we will look at over the coming years There are of course many other areas of policy response that will contribute to our response to the Future of Work but I wanted to finish today on what systemic changes we will need to ensure we are leading the change rather than being passive recipients of it Active and Capable StateA critical element identified in our Future of Work report is that the state needs to be an active participant in how we shape the future of work It is important to note that by active I do not mean that it controls or dictates what happens but rather that we move beyond the tired and dangerous idea that we can simply leave the response to market forces to decide how New Zealand fares in the future world of work This means working alongside businesses to identify opportunities as noted above in the R and D and Tech sectors for example It means developing a new partnership between the Crown and Maori as the settlement of historic Treaty breaches comes to an end and opportunities for economic development emerge It also means being innovative and entrepreneurial when that is appropriate We are wanting public servants to co design with both politicians and the wider community what we can do to stay ahead of the curve A major example of this is the Provincial Growth Fund developed as part of our coalition agreement with New Zealand First This will see significant investments in the regions of New Zealand to grow sustainable and productive job opportunities The details of the Fund are to be released shortly and will provide some of the most significant development of our regions in decades These will be driven from the ground up with the Government as an active partner A New Social PartnershipIt is my strong belief that the most critical element to New Zealand succeeding in the Future of Work is a renewed social partnership between businesses workers and the government In the course of our Commission we saw examples in both large and small businesses of innovative approaches to this idea Air New Zealand s High Performance Engagement model is one useful example By involving workers in the full range of strategic decisions and change processes Air New Zealand has not only seen significant productivity benefits they have created far more harmonious workplace relations In a number of the new smaller technology businesses we have seen flat management structures and workplace democracy in action that is core to the way they run their businesses These companies give a significant voice to their employees and have seen productivity growth and improved workplace relations as a result We are working with MBIE and others to facilitate these approaches across a range of industries We can also see innovations happening in the way we work An example which has grabbed attention recently is Perpetual Guardian s decision to switch to trial a four day working week for five days pay The move was designed to improve workers wellbeing by giving them more time to spend with family and on other aspects of life with the expectation that this will enhance their productivity during the days they do work the same levels of output for fewer hours worked These are the kinds of practices that we need to see more of If we look at Germany as an example union members often sit on company boards as part of the decision making process ensuring that employee wellbeing is considered alongside high level corporate profit and financial targets It is unsurprising then that German workers on average worked the fewest hours annually in 2016 of all OECD countries with New Zealand workers on average doing 400 more hours every year This is possible because Germany s workers are also some of the most productive in the world I want to see New Zealand reach a point where we are able to work 400 fewer hours a year while producing more than we do today For us to get there we need to make the advances in productivity we have been discussing today Technological improvements will play a huge role in this One of my goals as Minister of Finance is to develop this new partnership at a system wide level to promote a combined work stream on how we can apply these lessons to other industries and sectors My parting challenge to the many public servants here today is to think about how we can do this across Government and break down some of the silos we have created to enable businesses and workers and their representatives to easily engage in such a partnership ConclusionI am most certainly not the first New Zealand politician to both highlight the challenge of low productivity nor to say that we will address it So the proof will be in what we actually do But we are in an environment that has change occurring at a pace and scale we have never seen before We have to take the opportunity now to capitalise on that to finally make the leaps that have so far eluded our country We have already made a start with the initiatives I have mentioned today I want us to re write our productivity story so that New Zealand becomes a leading example of a sustainable and productive economy in which everyone gets a share of economic success We have a long way to go but this Government is committed to tackling the long term challenges that this country has faced for many years I look forward to working with you on this journey Thank you Productivity growth in the United States and other advanced economies has slowed sharply over the past decade If this slowdown persists it will mean more slowly rising living standards and more difficult fiscal challenges What public policies might quicken the pace of productivity growth in the U S We put that question recently to a panel of experts convened by the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy and the Initiative on Business and Public Policy Here are some of their suggestions One solution to the productivity slowdown on which there was broad consensus was the need to enhance competition Competition promotes productivity growth through increased incentives for innovation and through selection If firms have strong incentives to innovate many productivity boosting innovations will come to market Also when only the firms with the highest productivity survive while the least productive firms are forced to exit the market the average productivity will go up Jonathan Baker a lawyer and economist who teaches at American University s Washington College of Law believes that there is room to improve competition in the U S economy Market power is a problem in the U S economy it s plausible that growing market power has contributed to the productivity slowdown he explains Competition can be increased in a number of ways including by strengthening antitrust enforcement and by reforming the patent system so that patents are not used to shut out potential competitors while providing enough incentives for firms to invest in developing innovations Bronwyn Hall emerita professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley suggested that in some industries it s currently too easy to get a patent Most of us who look closely at the patent system think that the requirement for novelty is a little too low And so we do think there s room for reform in the patent area Occupational licensing is another area that might have room for improving competition There s been tremendous growth in this country in occupational licensing requirements And that s got to harm entry barriers and make it hard for people to move in and out of occupations And it s not just doctors it s things like cosmetologists a whole range of jobs says Baker It also is important to avoid policies that might stifle productivity Some of such policies have been popular in this year s political campaign If you think about the ongoing political campaign the policies that have been given a lot of attention include things like restrictions on trade and immigration These are not the kinds of policies you want to think about if you re going to think about enhancing productivity says Robert Barro a Harvard University economist Policies to increase the skills of the workforce are essential to raising productivity as well Isabel Sawhill a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution argued that policies that increase years of schooling might not be enough She stressed the importance of ensuring that those years of schooling actually translate into skills and knowledge She noted that more than two thirds of young adults today would fail to quality for military service because of lack of education drug addiction jail records and other shortcomings which also suggests that they may not have the capabilities to be very productive in the workplace Improving the allocation of funding to research and development is another area that might improve prospects for productivity growth over the long run Hall pointed out that the allocation of federal funding for basic science R D is skewed towards life sciences and argued that this isn t a great strategy We can t tell now what field of science will be useful in the future It s just like the stock market And so all we can do is have a portfolio that is more balanced in the basic science spending Related Books Kuznets beyond Kuznets

University of California at Berkeley suggested that policy focus on low hanging fruit those industries that subtract value from our economy rather than add to it One example of such a value subtracting industry is healthcare administration he believes Our doctors nurses and pharmacists do wonderful things but as Princeton s Uwe Reinhart likes to say you do the national income accounting and our healthcare administrators are about one eight as productive as German health care professionals because they re all working against each other either trying to get things covered or trying not

Washington Transformation Politics Policies Prospects a forum sponsored by the Summer Institute of Martha s Vineyard Hebrew Center Vineyard Haven MassachusettsI want to talk tonight about labor productivity growth Labor productivity is the amount of goods and services produced per hour spent on the job Increases in labor productivity again that s the amount of goods and services produced per hour on the job are a fundamental factor in determining how fast the economy grows and how fast the average standard of living grows And productivity growth can be influenced by government policy about which I also want to say a few words 1Labor productivity growth varies a lot from year to year but it is possible to discern longer historical periods with high or low productivity growth as shown in figure 1 For example labor productivity rose at an average annual rate of 3 1 4 percent from 1948 to 1973 whereas in the period 1974 to 2016 the average growth rate of productivity was about 1 7 percent That is to say that with the important exception of the information technology IT boom beginning in the mid 1990s the U S economy has been in a low productivity growth period since 1974 The record for the past five years has been particularly dismal How much does productivity growth matter A great deal The person who made that clear in an article published in 1957 60 years ago Professor Robert Solow is here tonight That is a pleasure an honor a joy and something of a difficulty for anyone wanting to talk about productivity and its growth in the presence of the master The reason the rate of productivity growth matters so much is that it is a basic determinant of the rate of growth of average income per capita over long periods 2 To understand that one needs to know only the trick of calculating how long it takes for a growing economy to double A good rule of thumb for calculating the time it takes labor productivity or anything else that is growing to double can be calculated by dividing 70 by the growth rate When labor productivity was growing at 3 1 4 percent per year during the 25 years from 1948 to 1973 it took 22 years for labor productivity to double Looking again at Figure 1 in the 42 years from 1974 to 2016 when labor productivity was growing on average at a rate of 1 3 4 percent it would have taken approximately 41 years for labor productivity to double There is a vast difference between the prospects facing the young in an economy where incomes per capita are doubling every 22 years and an economy in which incomes are on average doubling only every 41 years Now productivity statistics are imperfect in many respects for example capturing the value of the seemingly free apps we use on our smartphones is challenging And many of us who live in the modern age cannot believe that the iPhone has not fundamentally changed our lives It has certainly changed our lives to some extent and there is likely some underestimation of productivity growth in the official data But to figure out whether the current degree of data bias has reduced estimated growth we have to ask not whether there is bias but whether the bias has increased To a first approximation one could assume that the rate of bias is constant and does not account for the estimated decline in productivity growth and that we should not dismiss the slowdown as an artifact of measurement difficulties3 That is the conclusion most researchers reach but the data issue is not settled As Bob Solow famously said just before the increase in productivity growth of 1996 2003 the computer is everywhere except in the growth data And there are serious researchers who have made serious arguments that we will soon be seeing more rapid growth in the productivity data Factors determining productivity growth Clearly a key question for economic forecasters and even more so for U S citizens and indeed for the entire global economy is whether we should anticipate a return of the more rapid productivity gains experienced in the IT boom and for the quarter century after the end of World War II or should instead resign ourselves to tepid economic growth in future years And a central policy issue is whether government policies can help push the economy toward a higher productivity regime In this context it is useful to think of labor productivity growth as coming from three sources as shown in figure 2 First greater investment by firms in tangible equipment and structures as well as intangible investments such as software and product designs raise labor productivity Second improvements in labor quality or the capabilities of the workforce contribute as well through education training and experience Finally innovations yield more or better output from the same inputs the same capital and labor such as the introduction of the assembly line and computer aided product design I will consider the role that policy may play through each of these channels It is noteworthy that most of the recent drop in productivity is due to a lower contribution from innovation although weaker investment has played a role as well The contribution to labor productivity from labor quality has changed very little Innovation Our prospects for further significant technological innovations are hotly debated Some observers believe that we have exhausted the low hanging fruit on the productivity tree and in particular that efficiency gains from the use of IT have run their course 4 Other observers argue that we can reach fruit higher on the tree with each passing year These observers believe that innovation yields better tools such as 3 D printers and genetic sequencing equipment which themselves enable further technological advances 5 For what it is worth I believe the early signs of self driving cars the emergence of disease treatments based on genetics and the falling costs for conventional and alternative energy production suggest that we are continuing to innovate both in IT as well as in other parts of the economy One possibility is that we are in a productivity lull while firms reorganize to exploit the latest innovations it took decades before the full benefits of the steam engine electrification and computers were seen 6One way to ensure the vigor of innovation is to support research and development R D and here the recent record is mixed As shown in figure 3 R D spending in the United States softened during the Great Recession R D funded by U S businesses has since recovered However government funded R D as a share of gross domestic product is at the lowest level in recent history A great deal of the R in overall R D is government funded and not tied to a specific commercial goal The applied research built on this basic research ultimately yields productivity gains far into the future 7 Consequently the decline in government funded R D is disturbing To raise productivity and economic well being firms must adopt innovations that emerge from R D as quickly as possible This adjustment may occur as start ups introduce innovation to the market as existing innovative firms expand or as competing firms imitate the innovators Recent research suggests that all three of these channels which reflect the economic dynamism of businesses have been operating sluggishly of late New firms are not created as often as in the past innovative firms are not hiring or investing as aggressively as they once did and the diffusion of innovations is weak from frontier firms to trailing firms 8It is difficult to pinpoint specific policy actions that would address this decline in dynamism Broadly speaking however government policymakers should carefully consider the effects of regulations and tax policy on the free flow of workers capital and ideas Investment In recent years the contribution to labor productivity growth from investment has declined Business fixed investment rose roughly 2 1 2 percent per year on average from 2004 to 2016 compared with about 5 percent from 1996 to 2003 9 Some bright spots do exist Capital expenditure by leading IT companies Google Amazon and the like has soared since 2010 and investment in the energy sector has returned to life Nevertheless firms as a whole seem reluctant to invest This cautious approach to investment may in part reflect uncertainty about the policy environment By one measure U S policy uncertainty was elevated for much of the recovery subsided in 2013 and then rose again late last year underpinned by uncertainty about policies associated with health care regulation taxes and trade 10 Reasonable people can disagree about the right way forward on each of those issues but mitigating the damping effect of uncertainty by providing more clarity on the future direction of government policy is highly desirable particularly if the direction of policy itself is desirable Government investment can be an important source of productivity growth as well For example the interstate highway system is credited with boosting productivity in the 1950s and 1960s 11 That highway system and many other federally supported roadways waterways and structures have been neglected in recent years Indeed real infrastructure spending that is adjusting for inflation has fallen nearly 1 percent per year since 2005 12 This area of government investment deserves more attention Labor Quality Also important to raising labor productivity is investment in human capital workers knowledge and skills Such investment is a particular issue because most forecasts anticipate that the long rise in educational attainment both for college and high school may soon come to an end One area where policy may play a role is promoting educational access and readiness for groups for whom educational attainment is relatively low Recent research has shown a substantial return to public investment in early childhood education for economically disadvantaged groups Such programs increase high school graduation promote income over the life cycle for both participants and their parents and produce other socially beneficial outcomes such as greater health 13At the other end of the education process a college degree has long been considered a worthwhile investment and thus our society should promote access to and readiness for college among a broad range of individuals in particular through federal support for need based financial aid 14Lastly I will note that ultimately the return on the human capital embodied in our workforce is closely tied to public health A rise in morbidity or fall in longevity in the U S population is not a concern only for humanitarian reasons Workers too ill to perform at their potential represent lost productivity and welfare for society as a whole Research has shown just such a trend among prime age non Hispanic Americans without a college degree 15 More study is needed to determine what policies would help reverse this trend and government funding could likely assist the effort More broadly programs to promote clean air and drinking water are examples of public health policies that bolster the health and longevity of the present and future workforce as a whole Concluding remarks To conclude we return to the basic question How much does productivity growth matter The basic answer simple arithmetic says it matters a lot If labor productivity grows an average of 2 percent per year average living standards for our children s generation will be twice what we experienced If labor productivity grows an average of 1 percent per year the difference is dramatic Living standards will take two generations to double 16But fortunately when it comes to productivity we are not simply consigned to luck or to fate Governments can take sensible actions to promote more rapid productivity growth Broadly speaking government policy works best when it can address a need that the private sector neglects including investment in basic research infrastructure early childhood education schooling and public health Reasonable people can disagree about the right way forward but if we as a society are to succeed we need to follow policies that will support and advance productivity growth That is easier said than done But it can be done References Andrews Dan Chiara Criscuolo and Peter Gal 2015

Street and Constitution Avenue N W Washington DC 20551The differences in rates of growth are often attributed to two factors government and entrepreneurship The two are not mutually exclusive In the early stages of sustained growth government has often provided the incentives for entrepreneurship to take hold In some economies the development of transportation power and other utilities has been carried out by the government In others the government has offered financial inducements and subsidies The land given U S railroad developers in the second half of the 19th century is a notable example of the latter Another important role governments have played in the early stages is to help establish the sort of capital and money markets in which lenders could have confidence Without financial intermediaries acting as brokers between lenders and business borrowers it is difficult to envisage economic growth taking place on a sustained and rapid basis In the 19th century most liberal thinkers held that the main role for government in a developed capitalist system was that of a policeman to preserve law and order uphold the sanctity of private property and give business as much freedom as possible The Great Depression of the 1930s persuaded many that a laissez faire system did not automatically provide the necessary incentives to the innovation and risk bearing essential for economic growth This led to a good deal of writing on the role that governments might play in stimulating growth Economists have argued that at the very least governments can undertake to prevent serious and prolonged recessions Only in this way can a general business psychology be developed that assumes growth to be the natural course of things so that investment programs will pay off Growth theorists since World War II have gone further arguing that it is not enough simply to achieve full employment periodically Some maintain that it is necessary to maintain full employment over an extended period of time if high growth is to result This argument relates to the earlier point that two economies may experience the same rate of growth of capital but that overall growth and technical progress will proceed at a much more rapid rate in one than in the other because of differences in the quality of new capital goods produced The term enterprise investment has been used to describe the kind of capital formation that involves innovations and that by building ahead of demand generates rapid rates of growth of productivity or technical progress But to get such growth it has been argued an economy must be run flat out at full speed While this has been subject to some dispute there is a fairly general consensus that growth will be faster when unemployment fluctuates within a narrow range and at low levels A variation on this argument is the question of how a government may intervene to determine the distribution of output between those types of expenditure that contribute to growth and those that lead to the immediate satisfaction of consumer demand Here the choice lies between business investment research and education on the one hand and consumption on the other The larger the first three the more rapid will be the rate of growth Governments giving a high priority to growth have various means at their disposal for influencing it Consumption can and has been constrained through increases in income tax rates The same is true of other tax rates such as the property tax the chief revenue source for primary and secondary education in the United States Tax credit for research and development expenditures is a common method for encouraging business outlays that may lead to innovations The same method has been used to stimulate business investment outlays Easy money policies on the part of the central bank whereby the cost of borrowed funds and their availability are indirectly regulated in such a way as to encourage business borrowing may lead to higher levels of real investment The true cost of stimulating growth will always be a temporary cut in current consumption Only in the future can the economic benefits of the higher investment be realized By the same token current consumption can always be enlarged by a neglect of the future It is even possible for current production to be so biased toward the satisfaction of immediate needs that the productive capacity of an economy slowly declines as capital goods are not replaced Between the extremes of total neglect of future generations and the paring down of current consumption to a bare subsistence minimum lie an infinite number of possibilities The belief that governments should have a large say in choosing the right rate of growth has also led some writers to challenge the social and economic value of economic growth in an advanced industrial society They attribute to growth such undesirable side effects of industrialization as traffic congestion the increasing pollution of air and water the despoiling of the landscape and a general decline in man s ability to enjoy the real amenities of life As has been seen growth is really a transformation whereby certain industries experience a rise in importance followed by an eventual decline as the market for their output becomes relatively saturated Demand relatively speaking moves on to other types of industries and products All of this naturally implies a reallocation of resources over time The faster these resources move other things being equal the more rapidly can growth and transformation proceed The argument can be recast in terms of this transformation A slower rate of growth in per capita consumption will slow down the rate of transfer of resources but it may also result in a more livable environment The rate of growth of individual welfare so measured as to take into account non consumable amenities may even be increased Some argue that in a growth oriented society wants are created faster than the industrial machine can satisfy them so that people are more dissatisfied and insecure than they would be if growth were not given such a high value It is held by some critics that in modern industrial society consumption exists for the sake of justifying production rather than production being carried out to satisfy consumer desires These arguments are a powerful challenge to those who see growth as the most important economic goal of a modern society In discussing theories of growth a distinction must be made between theories designed to explain growth or the lack of growth in countries that are already developed and those concerned with countries trapped in circumstances of poverty Most of what follows will be confined to the former As the British economist John Maynard Keynes pointed out in the 1930s saving and investment are not usually done by the same persons The desire to save does not necessarily generate investment If savers attempt to save a larger share of their income than before thereby consuming less and if this is not matched by an equal increase in the desire of others to invest total spending will decline A natural reaction on the part of business will be to cut back on production thereby reducing incomes earned in production The final effect may be a cumulative movement downward as total demand becomes insufficient to employ all of the labour force This break in the circular flow of income and expenditure suggests the possibility of a capitalist economy alternately experiencing periods of prolonged and severe unemployment when desired savings at full employment exceed what the economy wishes to invest at full employment and periods of serious inflation when the inequality is reversed This situation had not been the case historically for developed economies until the early 1970s In the following discussion some attention will be paid to the ways in which the various theories of growth account for this important

Economic GrowthSustained long term economic growth comes from increases in worker productivity which essentially means how well we do things In other words how efficient is your nation with its time and workers Labor productivity is the value that each employed person creates per unit of his or her input The easiest way to comprehend labor productivity is to imagine a Canadian worker who can make 10 loaves of bread in an hour versus a U S worker who in the same hour can make only two loaves of bread In this fictional example the Canadians are more productive Being more productive essentially means you can do more in the same amount of time This in turn frees up resources to be used elsewhere What determines how productive workers are The answer is pretty intuitive The first determinant of labor productivity is human capital Human capital is the accumulated knowledge from education and experience skills and expertise that the average worker in an economy possesses Typically the higher the average level of education in an economy the higher the accumulated human capital and the higher the labor productivity The second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change Technological change is a combination of invention advances in knowledge and innovation which is putting that advance to use in a new product or service For example the transistor was invented in 1947 It allowed us to miniaturize the footprint of electronic devices and use less power than the tube technology that came before it Innovations since then have produced smaller and better transistors that that are ubiquitous in products as varied as smart phones computers and escalators The development of the transistor has allowed workers to be anywhere with smaller devices These devices can be used to communicate with other workers measure product quality or do any other task in less time improving worker productivity The third factor that determines labor productivity is economies of scale Recall that economies of scale are the cost advantages that industries obtain due to size Read more about economies of scale in Cost and Industry Structure Consider again the case of the fictional Canadian worker who could produce 10 loaves of bread in an hour If this difference in productivity was due only to economies of scale it could be that Canadian workers had access to a large industrial size oven while the U S worker was using a standard residential size oven Now that we have explored the determinants of worker productivity let s turn to how economists measure economic growth and productivity To analyze the sources of economic growth it is useful to think about a production function which is the process of turning economic inputs like labor machinery and raw materials into outputs like goods and services used by consumers A microeconomic production function describes the inputs and outputs of a firm or perhaps an industry In macroeconomics the connection from inputs to outputs for the entire economy is called an aggregate production function Economists construct different production functions depending on the focus of their studies Figure 1 presents two examples of aggregate production functions In the first production function shown in Figure 1 a the output is GDP The inputs in this example are workforce human capital physical capital and technology We discuss these inputs further in the module Components of Economic Growth An economy s rate of productivity growth is closely linked to the growth rate of its GDP per capita although the two are not identical For example if the percentage of the population who holds jobs in an economy increases GDP per capita will increase but the productivity of individual workers may not be affected Over the long term the only way that GDP per capita can grow continually is if the productivity of the average worker rises or if there are complementary increases in capital A common measure of U S productivity per worker is dollar value per hour the worker contributes to the employer s output This measure excludes government workers because their output is not sold in the market and so their productivity is hard to measure It also excludes farming which accounts for only a relatively small share of the U S economy Figure 2 shows an index of output per hour with 2009 as the base year when the index equals 100 The index equaled about 106 in 2014 In 1972 the index equaled 50 which shows that workers have more than doubled their productivity since then According to the Department of Labor U S productivity growth was fairly strong in the 1950s but then declined in the 1970s and 1980s before rising again in the second half of the 1990s and the first half of the 2000s In fact the rate of productivity measured by the change in output per hour worked averaged 3 2 per year from 1950 to 1970 dropped to 1 9 per year from 1970 to 1990 and then climbed back to over 2 3 from 1991 to the present with another modest slowdown after 2001 Figure 3 shows average annual rates of productivity growth averaged over time since 1950 In recent years a controversy has been brewing among economists about the resurgence of U S productivity in the second half of the 1990s One school of thought argues that the United States had developed a new economy based on the extraordinary advances in communications and information technology of the 1990s The most optimistic proponents argue that it would generate higher average productivity growth for decades to come The pessimists on the other hand argue that even five or ten years of stronger productivity growth does not prove that higher productivity will last for the long term It is hard to infer anything about long term productivity trends during the later part of the 2000s because the steep recession of 2008 2009 with its sharp but not completely synchronized declines in output and employment complicates any interpretation While productivity growth was high in 2009 and 2010 around 3 it has slowed down since then Productivity growth is also closely linked to the average level of wages Over time the amount that firms are willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce If a few employers tried to pay their workers less than what those workers produced then those workers would receive offers of higher wages from other profit seeking employers If a few employers mistakenly paid their workers more than what those workers produced those employers would soon end up with losses In the long run productivity per hour is the most important determinant of the average wage level in any economy To learn how to compare economies in this regard follow the steps in the following Work It Out feature The Organization for Economic Co operation and Development OECD tracks data on the annual growth rate of real GDP per hour worked You can find these data on the OECD data webpage Labour productivity growth in the total economy at this website Step 1 Visit the OECD website given above and select two countries to compare Step 2 On the drop down menu Variable select Real GDP Annual Growth in percent and record the data for the countries you have chosen for the five most recent years Step 3 Go back to the drop down menu and select Real GDP per Hour Worked Annual Growth Rate in percent and select data for the same years for which you selected GDP data Step 4 Compare real GDP growth for both countries Table 2 provides an example of a comparison between Australia and Belgium Step 5 Consider the many factors can affect growth For example one factor that may have affected Australia is its isolation from Europe which may have insulated the country from the effects of the global recession In Belgium s case the global recession seems to have had an impact on both GDP and real GDP per hours worked between 2009 and 2013 though productivity does seem to be recovering Nothing is more important for people s standard of living than sustained economic growth Even small changes in the rate of growth when sustained and compounded over long periods of time make an enormous difference in the standard of living Consider Table 3 in which the rows of the table show several different rates of growth in GDP per capita and the columns show different periods of time Assume for simplicity that an economy starts with a GDP per capita of 100 The table then applies the following formula to calculate what GDP will be at the given growth rate in the future For example an economy that starts with a GDP of 100 and grows at 3 per year will reach a GDP of 209 after 25 years that is 100 1 03 25 209 The slowest rate of GDP per capita growth in the table just 1 per year is similar to what the United States experienced during its weakest years of productivity growth The second highest rate 3 per year is close to what the U S economy experienced during the strong economy of the late 1990s and into the 2000s Higher rates of per capita growth such as 5 or 8 per year represent the experience of rapid growth in economies like Japan Korea and China Table 3 shows that even a few percentage points of difference in economic growth rates will have a profound effect if sustained and compounded over time For example an economy growing at a 1 annual rate over 50 years will see its GDP per capita rise by a total of 64 from 100 to 164 in this example However a country growing at a 5 annual rate will see almost the same amount of growth from 100 to 163 over just 10 years Rapid rates of economic growth can bring profound transformation See the following Clear It Up feature on the relationship between compound growth rates and compound interest rates If the rate of growth is 8 young adults starting at age 20 will see the average standard of living in their country more than double by the time they reach age 30 and grow nearly sevenfold by the time they reach age 45 The formula for growth rates of GDP over different periods of time as shown in Figure 2 is exactly the same as the formula for how a given amount of financial savings grows at a certain interest rate over time as presented in Choice in a World of Scarcity Both formulas have the same ingredients Recall that compound interest is interest that is earned on past interest It causes the total amount of financial savings to grow dramatically over time Similarly compound rates of economic growth or the compound growth rate means that the rate of growth is being multiplied by a base that includes past GDP growth with dramatic effects over time For example in 2013 the World Fact Book produced by the Central Intelligence Agency reported that South Korea had a GDP of 1 67 trillion with a growth rate of 2 8 We can estimate that at that growth rate South Korea s GDP will be 1 92 trillion in five years If we apply the growth rate to each year s ending GDP for the next five years we will calculate that at the end of year one GDP is 1 72 trillion In year two we start with the end of year one value of 1 67 and increase it by 2 Year three starts with the end of year two GDP and we increase it by 2 and so on as depicted in the Table 4 Another way to calculate the growth rate is to apply the following formula Where future value is the value of GDP five years hence present value is the starting GDP amount of 1 64 trillion g is the growth rate of 2 and n is the number of periods for which we are calculating growth Productivity the value of what is produced per worker or per hour worked can be measured as the level of GDP per worker or GDP per hour The United States experienced a productivity slowdown between 1973 and 1989 Since then U S productivity has rebounded the current global recession notwithstanding It is not clear whether the current growth in productivity will be sustained The rate of productivity growth is the primary determinant of an economy s rate of long term economic growth and higher wages Over decades and generations seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita An aggregate production function specifies how certain inputs in the economy like human capital physical capital and technology lead to the output measured as GDP per capita Compound interest and compound growth rates behave in the same way as productivity rates Seemingly small changes in percentage points can have big impacts on income over time Answers to Self Check Questions20 2 Labor

aptitude for collaboration and innovation Backed by two years of research it s part of an ongoing effort to understand the readiness of the world s civil servants for the coming digital revolution which is expected to eliminate 77 of administration and operations roles by 2030 Even if your result was The Luddite or Old School there s still time to learn about the technologies and disciplines that will be essential to getting things done in the public service of the future We ve isolated the most important trends here this is why they matter how governments can use them and the best online resources to learn them yourself Big data once a tool reserved for statisticians and intelligence personnel is now indispensable to the functioning of government With it public servants can use evidence to drive decision making rather than guesswork In the private sector a strong linkbetween effective data use and better financial performance has been established but much of government data still lives on paper or in old fashioned systems This coupled with a tendency to treat data analysis as an afterthought when crafting policy prevents governments from reaping its benefits Of course every civil servant need not be a data scientist but they should appreciate its potential to improve the lives of citizens help services function more efficiently and cut costs In the future of work all public servants will deal with data in service delivery which means overcoming a misconception of big data as amorphous and overwhelming Public servants should come to see it as a tool to help government do more for their citizens with less which in this era of shrinking budgets and growing technological innovation is crucial At a time when there is an urgent need to improve the efficiency of public services data analytics has huge potential Eddie Copeland NestaHow to use it Estonia saves more than 2 8 million hours of labour every year through a data exchange network that helped it digitise 99 of government services The system lets citizens pay their taxes in five minutes and incorporate companies in under 20 Police forces in the US are using big data to predict where crime is most likely to occur and allocate officers more efficiently Some cities have cut crime by up to 40 London is using data analytics to predict which children are most at risk for neglect and abuse allowing child services to intervene before something happens The system will save municipalities 910 000 a year Ukraine has clamped down on corruption and saved 37 million on drugs for its health service with a data driven app that compares government purchases to prices listed by other suppliers How to learn The School of Data has courses on the fundamentals of data as well as how to extract map and clean it The Open Data Institute offers classes in open data essentials and finding stories in data It also has offline courses like Open data in a day for government and Managing risk with open data Coursera has a John Hopkins University sanctioned Launch your career in data science class Datacamp teaches data science skills like R SQL and python Dataquest offers beginner intermediate and expert level courses in data analysis and prediction General Assembly has a number of courses in data science and analysis In the US just 27 of citizens are happy with government s digital services Constituents want to interact with government more easily and governments leading the charge in bringing services online are using artificial intelligence AI to do so With AI systems learn from experience and keep improving their performance without humans having to explain how to complete tasks A prime example of this is chatbots virtual assistants that field questions from constituents who would normally have to call a public office or help desk Chatbots which learn from the questions they are asked to continually improve performance help governments serve constituents better and free up public servants time for higher value jobs AI has the potential to rid humans of monotonous work administrative tasks like data sorting filing and searching documents translating materials and drafting briefs among others saving federal governments up to 1 2 billion hu man hours and 41 1 billion annually City officials only work during the day 8am to 5pm Chatbots work 24 7 Ryan Johnson City of North CharlestonHow to use it Governments in the US Singapore and Jersey use chatbots to help citizens cut through bureaucracy and find the answers they need quickly and easily

taught by Stanford University professors It also offers a range of other AI classes EdX has a variety of introduction to AI courses IBM offers a beginner s guide to artificial intelligence machine learning and cognitive computing Policymakers are often accused of losing sight of the challenges everyday people face Design thinking is a way for governments to leverage the philosophy of user centric companies like Apple which puts customer experience at the centre of product design to solve problems and shape policy Design thinking puts end citizens at the centre of policy formulation in the iterative process public servants form theories about what constituents want by observing them prototype a product or service then test it out on real people This form of empathetic hands on policymaking helps government build services in concert with citizens to meet their needs rather than relying on detached experts The collaborative approach encourages public servants to break out of departmental siloes and tap into more risky innovative service design It s quite messy doing design work But the old ways of thinking just aren t working anymore Sarah Hurcombe the Australian Centre

applicants and helped collect an additional 40 million a year from taxpayers Nudge units use empirical evidence to anticipate how people will react to policy options rather than assuming their response will be rational They have spread to governments across the world including Guatemala the US Australia Germany and Singapore but the use of behavioural insights is still nascent In the future it is expected to have a significant impact on solving problems that stem from ingrained or unconscious bias like gender inequality It s hard for government to admit that something it s doing might not work or that it s failed People are often running blind David Halpern UK Nudge UnitHow to use it The UK Australia and Singapore use a behavioural science and machine learning tool to blind

growing In fact the number of women a cohort with low employment and activity rates between 15 and 64 years working or looking for work has increased globally in the past five years Despite this growth employers across the globe report skills shortages across a multitude of industries While skilled migration is at an all time high according to Hays Global Skills Index digitization is raising questions about who will do the work of tomorrow and what it will look like Over the next 10 to 20 years nearly half of jobs are at risk of being automated particularly in areas such as transportation and logistics office and admin support and manufacturing As AI machine learning and IoT becomes commonplace in professional environments it s critical that people have the skills to respond to these changes in a positive and productive way With such significant gaps in the contemporary workforce governments are creating initiatives to tackle this growing skills shortage by linking education and business to cultivate the employees of the future With the tagline Realise Your Aspirations SkillsFuture is 100 committed to giving Singaporeans the best possible professional opportunities imaginable

recently announcing the 20 million Institute of Coding formed by businesses including IBM Cisco and Microsoft it s clear to see that governing bodies in the UK and beyond are starting to stand up and take notice of the world s digital skills gap These six initiatives take slightly different approaches but they all have one thing in common to build tomorrow s digital workforce by offering innovative continuous valuable sustainable and accessible education to today s budding professional And that is the most important thing of all Keep up to date with industry insights and latest news Sitemap Terms Conditions Privacy Policy Digital Marketing Institute 2019In late November 2018 I delivered the opening keynote at the Future of Work 2018 Conference hosted by the University of Melbourne Center for Workplace Leadership 1 where I described how to keep people at the center of the future of work discussion After my talk find a video of the 45 minute keynote here I was interviewed for a short video segment to share the highlights In preparing for the interview I found the questions to explore a thoughtful comprehensive look at the scope of the discussion on the future of work and thus I wanted to share my answers I am interested in your reactions Do you agree with my thoughts Disagree Why What are some examples of human centric approaches to work within areas of high automation I would approach this question differently While there are some jobs that might have a higher likelihood of automation than others especially those contain significant amounts of routine tasks 2 the World Economic Forum has recently predicted that greater than 50 of all jobs will require significant reskilling and upskilling by 2022 3 This means we will need to consider more human centric approaches in most jobs not just those with a higher proportion of tasks that could be automated In the research I ve been conducting in partnership with Bill Eggers and Amrita Datar from Deloitte and Carlos Teixeira from the Harvard Kennedy School through my current part time fellowship with the Harvard Kennedy School digitalHKS initiative we ve envisioned 6 government jobs of the future with a method that puts humans back at the center for both new and changing jobs Putting the worker first we envision future jobs to place human machine coordination at the core in order to improve productivity and decision making while also increasing the well being of the workers themselves The trick is not to think about what can be automated but also what can be augmented If a human s time could be freed up what higher order value could be accomplished with uniquely human skills Might we be able to deliver more value than human machine coordination than through humans alone or machines alone For example Child case workers in Colorado currently spend less than 10 percent of their work time actually interacting with children and families This impacts their ability to most effectively protect vulnerable children and coordinate services for those children Case workers today spend a large percentage of their time on administrative tasks Our research has envisioned a future where administrative burdens are reduced with the application of technologies to increase the time spent on higher valued work for the customer For example some technology applications could include case management systems powered by cognitive computing to ease scheduling and follow up voice based smart assistants that document case notes after an appointment while the future child aid coordinator travels between appointments robotic process automation tools that automatically process a client s eligibility for services on the fly and using predictive analytics and machine learning to prevent abuse neglect and ill treatment Child aid coordinators should be empowered to customize services for vulnerable children based on the child s own unique circumstances Spending more time with children and families is a critical part to increasing the value created by this work and by applying technology to free time from administrative tasks coordinators are able to spend more time problem solving for their customers What frightens you or stirs you the most about the shift from human power to machine power MIT Professor David A Mindell talks about three myths of 21st century robotics and automation in his book Our Robots Ourselves that I think are particularly relevant to shift the focus of this question The myth of linear progress the idea that technology evolves from direct human involvement into remote presence and then to fully autonomous systems The myth of replacement the idea that machines take over human jobs one for one Myth of full autonomy the utopian idea that robots today or in the future can operate entirely on their own 4 So there s a lot of fear mongering about how quickly and how extremely a shift to machine power will happen Also I think what we have to remind ourselves is that human power alone and machine power alone won t be as great as power achieved through human machine coordination To get the most value we need to design machines that have humans in the loop and empower humans to design work processes where machines are in the loop This is where the greatest value lies but is also where the challenge is because most organizations are not good at integrating new technologies into their business processes One reason they struggle with this not far from the only reason is significant workforce resistance when new technologies are forced on them This is where employees seeing WHY the change is important and why there is a benefit to them to re skill is important Another reason is because true user centered design in the technology development and deployment process is not common practice Organizations must embrace a user centered technology adoption mindset if technology initiatives are to succeed in improving the performance of an organization Co creating a visualization for the jobs of the future as occurs in the workshops Bill Amrita and I have developed can be a powerful tool to enable these actions How futuristic or progressive is the research in this area are we finding out the facts and figures too late There is a lot of research being done in this area but often in silos Conversations about future of work are often segmented between communities People building technologies focus on a technology enabled future Human capital and staffing professionals focus on how workforce changes are affecting the future of work Universities and educators focus on future skills and learning mindsets as being key enablers for the future The urgent need is to build bridges across these communities and research areas since I believe solutions will lie at the intersections of the complex topics including but not limited to Technology development robotics computer and data science engineering etc Economics and economic development policy local state and national Education and learning Workforce development policy Technology ethics Labor relations Business and public sector management Human centered design human factors Architecture and build environment design Business strategy Organizational design Performance management Organizational and Individual PsychologyMIT is one university trying to get ahead of this need for interdisciplinary action oriented research through the Task force on Work of the Future announced off earlier this year but significantly more work can be done in convening these communities for active solution development What s critical to do right now in ensuring the human evolves and doesn t disappear from meaningful work In the near term government employers employees and educators all have a role to play to design a future that is better for humans not worse Employees must not wait around for skill development to be presented to them by their employer a mindset of life long learning will be a key attribute for the future employee Learning doesn t necessarily mean traditional university higher education where costs are becoming unsustainable Learning can happen online through local boot camps by doing through micro courses designed to be taken on demand etc Employees must see that change is coming understand the new skills that will be required for them to succeed in a changed work world and feel empowered to take some of that learning on for themselves Now that s not to say that employers won t also have an important role to play in training employees in the skills of the future like AT T s 1B commitment to re train half of its workforce for the jobs of the future But McKinsey estimates that globally some 500M 900M future workers may need to move to new employers and sectors to find meaningful work 5 That transition will require some initiative on the part of the employee Thus we must create means for individuals to feel empowered and encouraged to do this and reduce fear of the future that could be paralyzing Educators act as a bridge between the future workforce and employers Being an effective bridge should involve identifying the salient knowledge skills and abilities required for the future of work and evolving curriculum and learning environments to prepare students for those futures This requires educators to have a keen understanding of the needs of industry Many institutes of higher education are also completely rethinking how they teach and how students learn and are making education to non traditional students more broadly available through online learning certifications and MOOCs Innovating the learning process itself and the funding model for learning is a critical role of educators and a role all educators should be moving to adopt in the near term Employers must step out of their comfort zone and think about a future where their potential workforce could include not only be full time human employees but contract employees the crowd strategic partnerships and machine intelligence How do you think about integrating the machine as part of the team How does this change the role and skills for managers How might humans and machines combined create a more valued product or service that you provide today The challenge is to not think about the application of machines as an efficiency gain to cut overall costs by reducing human labor but to think about how machines augment humans who can provide higher order cognitive value to the organization Employers should also actively engage their workforce in designing the jobs of the future jobs that use technology to augment current work and that add new value Current employees see problems on the front line and opportunities for additional value creation that management and senior leadership often doesn t see That front line intelligence should be incorporated into designing jobs of the future Designing a future organizational model that harnesses an agile way to leverage human machine coordination to add value is a business imperative Further employers have to be obsessed with creating a learning environment in their organizations This environment should teach existing employees how to fail fast and adapt to changing technologies and customer information regularly but also help new employees onboard much more quickly due to the increasing fluidity of the workforce and increasing incidence of telework remote teams Governments must set economic workforce development training education and technology policies that consider the interdisciplinary issues of the future of work But their role is not only limited to policy making through laws and executive orders They could also Leverage convening power to create a cross sector agenda Encourage experimentation at the state and local level as test beds for national policy Fund programs to re skill employees in parts of the economy that might not be able to afford to do it themselves like small to mid size manufacturers Consider government agency roles and responsibilities to see if policy making across different interdisciplinary areas should be better coordinated Encourage policy making that includes a participatory element to ensure the voices and values of the public not just organizational stakeholders are considered when evaluating policy solutions Ensure trade offs between technology ethics and societal values are considered in economic growth policies Initiate diplomatic efforts to address inequality issues in the future of work EtcMcKinsey 6 Bain 7 and others have also made recent recommendations on what these groups can do to prepare for the future of work How do we rein in the growth of inequality as technology shifts the balance of power and opportunity in society New technology throughout history has been accompanied by fear of that technology Malcolm Frank and others in their book What to Do when Machines do Everything note Many seem to forget that throughout history automation has provided a net benefit to society In the process of automating our work and our society through generation after generation three positive things have repeatedly occurred 1 A new abundance has been created sales of products and services produced by automation now vastly more affordable and of higher quality skyrocket2 With the new abundance overall employment rises even when there is less labor input per unit 3 Society gains a net benefit with higher living standards created by newly affordable products and services 8 However this fourth work revolution does have some unique issues to consider with respect to furthering inequality A primary issue involves the coding of biases into future decision making structures and thus significant discussions have emerged on the ethical use of AI This discussion can often be about how to ensure that the algorithm developers aren t coding their own personal biases into technologies But it can also be about the data that we are using to train our AI if training data is biased or not representative of broader society then we could be making incorrect diagnoses faster or forgetting entire populations in the future we re optimizing for For example a 2010 report from the University of British Columbia warned against the danger of assuming that all of humanity s psychology closely matches the behaviors of 20 something college students They cite evidence that between 2003 and 2007 undergrads made up 80 percent of study subjects in six top psychology journals and that 96 percent of all psychology samples come from countries that make up only 12 percent of the world s population 9 The researchers refer to the sample population as mostly coming from Western Educated Industrialized Rich Democratic WEIRD populations So if a future AI therapist were trained off this data set the accuracy of diagnosis and the effectiveness of treatment may likely underperform with underrepresented communities in the dataset We must be vigilant against potential bias both in our training research data as well as the humans coding the rules else we are likely to further encourage inequitable application of technology What can only humans do and how will this change improve be compromised in the future work economy Humans are still vastly better at problem solving communication knowledge sharing collaboration leadership creativity empathy and the ability to cope with ambiguity and uncertainty 10 In some jobs that conduct routine cognitive tasks machines can actually become smarter than humans when powered by vast amounts of data These jobs may include call centers auditing insurance underwriting and basic tax preparation Some creative cognitive jobs may also be replaced For example powered by significant amounts of viewer data Netflix can set the parameters to create new TV series and movies they know will be enjoyed by their population As described by Jessica Brillhart AI is also creating beautiful art This means humans will need to perform more sophisticated cognitive tasks in the future of work Mohanbir Sawhney suggests a few such jobs in Forbes like managing and designing the future human machine teams and jobs that require social intelligence like providing care to humans nurses counselors physical therapists Also he notes as technology improves the quality of life for society humans may have more free time for leisure which could increase employment in the entertainment and leisure industries 11 All previous work revolutions agricultural and industrial have unlocked new industries and thus new opportunities for jobs while improving the overall quality of life of society though there could be much vigorous debate on the nuances of this statement If history is our guide we would expect to see the same net change over time though the times that society undergoes that transition can be very difficult The relatively good news here is that the transition may be quick occurring within one person s lifetime and not over the course of three lifetimes like previous revolutions This will significantly impact a generation but the overall transition time may be shorter Thus we have an urgent need to act now to minimize the negative effects on this generation with overall progress vigorous guard against embedded bias and human quality of life and equity top of mind References 1 Important Note My work on the

will the future of work look like If we can understand the ways in which technology demographic and economic trends will reshape labour markets we will have a better understanding of what we should be emphasizing in our educational and training systems to be as well prepared as possible for tomorrow s world Rapid advances in artificial intelligence and robotics have in particular created a new momentum to understand exactly how widespread the impacts of technology will be on jobs But what if this focus is misplaced The inherent unpredictability of technological progress means that even within the literature on automation there are projected ranges for developed countries from 5 percent of jobs to 50 percent of jobs being at risk of automation with figures even higher than this for developing countries The timeframes for these impacts are similarly broad ranging from 10 20 years to 50 years in other estimates Layered onto the direct uncertainty around depth of impacts and timescale are unanswerable questions around the social norms and preferences which may influence how quickly if at all technological solutions replace humans Then there is the question of technologies that are still at nascent stages or that will only emerge in the coming years Will emerging technologies such as blockchain make intermediaries like Airbnb and Uber less relevant in 2 years or 10 years How quickly will autonomous vehicles eliminate the jobs of drivers around the world Uncertainty makes policy responses to specific potential outcomes challenging and makes the need for non path dependent responses critical These challenges are exacerbated by the cross cutting nature of the future of work policy issue touching as it does on economic social regulatory and technological issues A forthcoming report from the Mowat Centre at the University of Toronto argues that policymakers should focus their attention on upgrading the systems that support workers and young people and ensuring those systems are prepared to thrive in a world of increased uncertainty volatility and disruption Whether the primary and secondary education systems unemployment and training schemes or housing health and social supports existing policy and service delivery frameworks in many countries were designed for the industrial age and do not take advantage of nor reflect the digital age in which we live today Policymakers should focus their attention on upgrading the systems that support workers and young people and ensuring those systems are prepared to thrive in a world of increased uncertainty volatility and disruption For instance unemployment schemes in both Canada and America are straining to meet the needs of labour markets characterized by more part time temporary and contract workers Both countries are at record low rates of coverage for income supports for the unemployed Fewer than one in three unemployed Americans now receive benefits and for those who qualify benefits replace a smaller percentage of wages than before 2 Similarly only 39 percent of unemployed Canadians receive regular benefits down from over 80 percent in 1978 3 As more workers are engaged in non standard forms of employment fewer workers are completing enough hours to pass eligibility thresholds Those who do qualify often do not receive payments for very long Developing unemployment programs that provide more targeted outcomes based and personalized supports is only going to become more pressing in a future where we can expect more workers in the contingent on demand workforce Reforms that focus on developing systems that are resilient and responsive are more likely to have relevance than re orienting programs around predictions about what types of occupations are likely to be in demand 10 or 20 years from now A clear example of the risks of future casting skills and occupations presents itself in the area of computer programming Governments from New York to England to Singapore have decided that coding will be a growth area in the economy and that they should begin to train young children to acquire these skills While there may well be value in training more young people to be comfortable with computers and how they work and skills such as problem solving and logic can be enhanced through such efforts there is an open question about whether coding will actually be an area where humans will have much of a role in the future As American software entrepreneur Mark Cuban has observed coding could well be automated within five years and a better focus for skills development could be creative thinking 4 Which brings us back to the original conundrum future casting skills is hugely challenging and future casting skills overlaid against occupations likely to be in demand is even more difficult The significant time and effort involved in re orienting educational systems from the primary to tertiary levels means that policymakers who get their projections wrong could have an entire generation with skills that are not particularly useful For policymakers facing an uncertain future the best course is to redesign the systems that will support workers and young people engaged in the work force or preparing to enter it Many of the changes that are required across policy and service delivery frameworks will have the added benefit of not just laying the groundwork for the future but also addressing the real and pressing needs of those who are ill served today by schemes that were designed for a different time What particular characteristics should inform the design of social and employment supports Successful programs and systems in the future will be Two promising examples of new interventions that align with these criteria are Singapore s SkillsFuture program and France s Personal Activity Accounts Both programs are designed to provide citizens with easier access to services that they need when they need them Singapore s program provides a digital platform for citizens to access lifelong learning resources including information about education and training opportunities integrated training supports and an individualized credit of 500 that is periodically topped up by the government for skills development The French model provides customized training supports and credits for people facing different life situations including the employed education system drop outs and those who engage in voluntary and charitable work The ability of governments to pivot programs towards these types of models delivering targeted programs quickly adjusting them on the fly based on rigorous evaluation and partnering with other societal actors should be the primary focus of reform in the short to medium term Anticipating specific competencies and hard skills which will be in demand in the future and re aligning training and educational systems towards them should be undertaken with extreme caution In the longer term exploring the effectiveness of more transformative approaches such as a guaranteed annual income may be required But adjusting existing supports to better reflect today s world of work will go a significant ways towards addressing concerns about the future of work currently bedeviling policymakers around the world The more those supports are customized digital integrated focused on outcomes and rigorously evaluated the more likely it is they will meet the challenges of an uncertain ever evolving future This piece was originally published in The Future of Work in the Global South edited

virtual reality AR VR data science digital biology and biotech medicine nanotech and digital fabrication networks and computing systems robotics and autonomous vehicles The rate of change is enough to make parents and educators heads spin but it is crucial that our employment training and educations systems are able to respond to this rapidly changing landscape Having the right skills at the right time and in the right place within Canada s workforce will support Canada s ability to be competitive and prosperous There are many initiatives trying to address some of these issues at the national provincial and municipal levels Some of the larger government funded initiatives include the Labour Market Information Council LMIC which is working on curation analysis and dissemination of labour market information to enable better career and policy decisions The Forum of Labour Market Ministers FLMM is a collaborative initiative of the federal government and provinces to develop a cohesive strategy across federal and provincial jurisdictions The soon to be announced Future Skills Centre will focus on identifying evaluating replicating and scaling promising practice with a significant focus on supporting initiatives to ensure full participation of ALL Canadians in the labour Market Large employers like RBC through their Future Launch program and Industry Associations like the Business Council of Canada and their Business Higher Education Round Table BHER are also leading the charge for employers There is an urgent need to understand what skills Canadians will need to prosper in the future and how we can better leverage and indeed supercharge our current skills development infrastructure to meet these needs Through its real time Labour Market Intelligence LMI capabilities collaborative approach and global partners Ryerson University s Magnet is well positioned to support these efforts to improve Canada s economic outlook and facilitate job creation Let s look at a few of the many interesting reports that shed some light on the specific skills that may be requiredWhat are these future skills In an effort to create a more cohesive and consistent understanding of what employers really mean by soft skills Burning Glass Technologies analyzed job postings to identify key skills not necessary to any specific job but based on cross sectoral employer requests Here s what Burning Glass Technologies said when identifying the top skills that employers are looking for This list also contains a major lesson for educators training providers and employers all of these skills can be taught These are not skills that have to be learned in childhood or not at all That means that educators can build these into training programs workers can sharpen their skills and employers do not have to wait passively for the right workers to come along As governments non profits and a growing number of businesses integrate workplace innovations they must consider how to train retain and nourish the complexities of a dynamic range of new skills including soft skills for young people entering the workforce Five Future SkillsHere are five soft skills identified through Burning Glass Technologies data indicating what employers are looking for Not just limited to interpersonal skills and establishing harmonious co worker inhabitancy effective communication is involved in writing planning customer service essentially every aspect of running an organization from marketing strategies media releases advertising reports and presentations just to name a few It encompasses many integral parts of both employer and worker success Often an overused term in resumes a highly organized individual in any places of work should not be taken for granted Tracking progress on various projects keeping track of schedules and appointments is necessary for success and overlaps with many of the previous skills mentioned Clear concise and accessible writing is always in demand particularly in STEM fields that often don t merge well with the general public due to convoluting language or cryptic jargon In fact there s now an entire field of science communicators whose job it is to make complex ideas seem more digestible Although this particular skill may seem relatively intuitive after all what company or organization doesn t strive for customer satisfaction most reserve it for retail or hospitality However regardless of the sector be it accounting IT bioinformatics you name it building strong customer relations should always be a priority Research is about work that integrates creative and systematic means of knowledge discovery the ability to efficiently source track and modify information accordingly to maximize efficiency and potential Whether you re working in retail or industrial engineering research is at the core of employer baseline skills The World Economic Forum compiled a list of future skills expected to be in demand by 2020 compared with what was in demand in 2015 It s especially important to note that many of these skills are not the exclusive domain of Science Technology Engineering and Math STEM disciplines This list clearly indicates the importance of the social sciences and humanities We need Science Technology Engineering Arts and Math STEAM Soft Skills Through a Diversity LensThe concept of soft skills itself can be ambiguous for employers and job seekers and may rely on subjective interpretation though generally they encompass interpersonal skills emotional intelligence and an entrepreneurial mindset As research from the Diversity Institute at Ryerson University points out in its report Soft Skills Are Hard employer assessments of soft skills amongst potential employees can become somewhat problematic when benchmarks are inconsistent within the same professional academic and industry groups Assessing such a skill set can also pose problems According to the report a diversity lens is critical Because of the way in which soft skills are learned many segments of the population are disadvantaged in access to the coaching training and role models needed to develop these skills and cultural biases may play a role in the definition and assessment of soft skills the report states More research is needed to develop methods and approaches to assess empirically the ways in which soft skills can be defined developed and evaluated In Conclusion The future of work is rapidly changing and we need to ensure Canadians are equipped with the skills to succeed I believe Canada is moving in the right direction and we have a lot of committed organizations and people working on these challenges We also need to remember that soft skills are critical We need to focus on STEAM not just STEM we need collective action for systemic change It is not the sole responsibility of any one stakeholder group Governments our education system our employment and training systems

Please note that some of our resources are for members only In today s competitive and fast changing world the skills and capabilities of the workforce are vital to economic sustainability and growth Workplace skills include the ability to These skills are at the heart of how organisations function in the digital age Other attributes such as the ability to work well with customers and clients and being caring and creative are also highly valued in some jobs although these are harder to pin down as specific skills and are often referred to as soft skills or employability skills Skills are not the same as qualifications although they are often treated interchangeably However the process of gaining a qualification undoubtedly builds on and improves skills Qualifications also provide specialist knowledge and they signal to employers a wide range of desirable attributes These complement the generic skills we use in the workplace but are distinct from them Both qualifications and skills matter as a workforce with a low level of qualifications is also one likely to have low levels of skills Skills are important for economic growth and prosperity The economic prosperity of a country depends on how many people are in work and how productive they are in the workplace Better use of skills available in the workforce alongside increased investment in skills and training has been shown to improve productivity Growth in productivity and prosperity build the conditions for improvements in real earnings creating a virtuous cycle individuals and organisations For the individual skills determine their employment and earning potential For organisations skills are vital to meeting both current and future business demands To be successful and competitive businesses must ensure their talent management and succession planning take into consideration what skills need to be sourced nurtured developed and retained now in order to create successful and productive workforces of the future To tackle the UK s underlying skills deficit it s not enough to focus on initial education and training The vast majority of the 2030 workforce are already in work Employers understand the importance of investing in and improving the skill levels of employees including on the job training in house development programmes and coaching At a national level too many UK businesses are built around low skilled low value jobs Employers design and structure work in a way that limit their staff s use of skills resulting in skills to job mismatches and stagnant productivity The UK also suffers from poor basic skills weakness in the vocational education system and low investment in workplace training Research for our report Making the UK s skills system world class shows that whilst the UK performs well internationally on the provision of high level qualifications with a large proportion of the workforce is educated to degree level we record only mediocre to poor scores on most other measures A high proportion of our workforce has poor literacy numeracy and computer skills and evidence suggests that employers are training less and investing less in their workforces than they were two decades ago At the heart of addressing the UK s low productivity level and the associated high proportion of low skilled and low paid jobs in the economy is the improvement of how skills are both developed and used This requires better leadership and management capabilities and improved people management practices Our recent report Over skilled and underused investigating the untapped potential of UK skills found that more than a third of workers have the skills to cope with more demanding duties than they currently have At the opposite end of the scale one in ten employees said they lacked all the skills needed to carry out their job effectively Reducing this skills mismatch would help improve UK productivity with analysis by the OECD suggesting that average labour productivity could be increased by as much as 5 if the degree of skills mismatch in the UK was brought into line with OECD best practice levels Organisations in particular SMEs need support to invest and develop their HR and people management capability to enable them to invest in the skills of their workforce and make best use of existing workforce capabilities We have been working to support small firms improve their leadership and management capabilities through our People Skills pilots our report Building HR capability in UK small firms sets out the key lessons for policy makers and practitioners It could be argued that successive governments have prioritised the expansion of the high education system at the expense of further and vocational education Indeed the OECD has identified a gap in the UK in terms of the provision of intermediate and technical level skills Whilst the UK government has prioritised increasing the number of apprentices the overall budget for post 16 provision has experienced significant funding cuts Our Over qualification and skills mismatch research has highlighted the issue of graduate over qualification with government estimating that 75 will not earn enough to fully repay their student loans while too few young people consider vocational routes into work such as apprenticeships While the current Government is pushing for a bigger focus on apprenticeships they are still often seen as a poor relation to higher education Our research Over skilled and underused Investigating the untapped potential of UK skills gives an up to date picture of the state of the UK s skills base and how well workers skills are being used and developed at work The UK s skills policy needs to address the following challenges Skills policy in the UK is devolved which means that any policy initiatives are entirely the remit of the devolved administrations in Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland and only of the UK government when it comes to England The approach to skills policy in each of the four nations within the UK is different However there are some common core themes and approaches including The main development in skills policy in the UK recently has been the focus on apprenticeships and technical education Apprenticeship reforms date back to 2012 and the Richards Review which put forward recommendations to simplify the system and put employers in the driving seat These included the development of new employer led apprenticeship standards and reforms to apprenticeship funding A key aspect of this policy has been the introduction of the apprenticeship levy in April 2017 which sees employers with a wage bill of over 3 million pay 0 5 of their total pay bill In 2016 the CIPD surveyed 275 employers on their reactions to the levy We found that nearly one third of organisations believed the levy would encourage them to develop an apprenticeship programme that would help them to build key skills A similar proportion thought the levy would help them to increase the quantity of apprenticeships they offered However concerns were raised that the levy may have negative unintended consequences squeezing out training opportunities for other sections of the workforce Our survey found that almost a third of organisations thought the levy would cause them to reduce their investment in other areas of workforce training and development A further 22 believed it could also encourage employers to accredit training they would otherwise be running anyway as apprenticeship schemes Interestingly only one in five respondents thought the levy would drive up the quality of apprenticeship schemes The Government is also reforming technical education as result of the Sainsbury Review of Post 16 skills The broad objectives of the reforms are to create a system that supports learners to achieve sustained skilled employment and that meets the skills needs of a changing economy In particular the reforms aim to streamline a complex system of overlapping qualifications into a common framework of 15 routes or T Levels which group occupations together in a two year college based programme with a high quality work experience placement aligned to apprenticeships Our latest research Reforming technical education uncovered a concerning lack of awareness amongst employers about the new qualifications highlighting the need for greater employer engagement and consultation if the reforms are to be successful Education Skills Funding AgencyOECD Learning for jobsDEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION

within their industry Nau mai Haere mai T n koutou katoa Warm greetings and welcome to you all It s a big day for all of us who are committed to the future of vocational education in New Zealand Today I am going to talk to you about the need for fundamental reform But before I get into details some important context is needed When the Coalition Government started reviewing our education system in late 2017 I said we wanted to build the world s best education system for people of all ages from top to bottom I also said that to do that we needed to collaborate across the system with providers and educators learners employers and industry M ori iwi and communities We need to collaborate to deliver on our government s clear vision for education We believe that every New Zealander wherever they live and whatever their background deserves access to quality education and training throughout their lives so they can realise their potential and participate fully in our economy and society The world around us is changing rapidly and will continue to do so Our education system needs to keep up Our vocational education system the reason we are here today is a case in point At a time when we re facing critical skill shortages too many of our polytechnics and institutes of technology are going broke The strong labour market is encouraging young people to move directly into the workforce rather than continue in formal education and our system isn t geared up for the future economy where re training and up skilling will be a regular feature of everyone s working life It s time to reset the whole system and fundamentally rethink the way we view vocational education and training and how it s delivered We need to move from a system where educational institutions and on the job training compete with one another to a system where on the job and provider based learning is seamlessly integrated We need to move away from the cycle that sees course delivery at institutes boom when the economic cycle turns down and then dive when the economy improves while on the job training providers face the opposite cycle Instead of our regional institutes of technology retrenching cutting programmes and closing campuses we need them to expand access to consistently high quality vocational education throughout the country We need a model where businesses industry iwi and local government in every region play an active role in driving skills development We need to shift from the current approach where they ask their local education providers what can you do for us to one where they say this is what we want from you We need a system of training and skills development that responds faster to global and national trends so we can get people with the right skills into the right jobs much faster Our thinking needs to shift from the idea that the ultimate goal of senior secondary schooling is to prepare young people for university to add a much greater focus on the career pathways of the two thirds of school leavers who do not go on to study degrees Our Government is committed to delivering a step change Last year I instructed the TEC and the Ministry of Education to begin working with our polytechs institutes of technology and the wider community to identify options for structural change and to undertake a system review of vocational education The Government has reflected deeply on the problems as well as the opportunities with the current system and we have come up with proposals that we think would tackle them decisively The proposals go further than the early advice we received We weren t convinced they were sufficient to drive the change the sector needs We want a system where learners get good educational and employment outcomes from vocational education and training that responds to their needs We know we need to do a better job serving the needs of M ori and Pacific people who are too often under represented and aren t getting the opportunity to gain the skills they need We want a system that allows employers to recruit and develop the skilled productive people their businesses need to thrive We want those working in vocational education to collaborate to support people communities and regions to flourish And we want the system to adapt quickly to changes and to new educational models In the future more people will change jobs and careers frequently over their working lives Access to high quality responsive and flexible vocational education throughout their lives will improve their resilience and wellbeing their employment security and life outcomes and will help to reduce social inequities Right now our vocational education system falls well short of the Government s vision for the future I acknowledge the hard work and smart thinking being done by people in the sector But we all know the system works against innovation responsiveness and collaboration and its current structure stops it from realising anywhere near its full potential That means learners industry and employers across New Zealand are not being properly served The change we are proposing has three main components Our first proposal creates clearer roles for industry and providersIn engagement during 2018 we heard from you that the vocational education system is too fragmented It is difficult for organisations to collaborate and for learners to move between or combine on the job and off the job education and training The role of business is unclear and its ability to influence is inadequate Despite the best efforts of many vocational education professionals and organisations structural features of the current system drive them to compete over funding New Zealand needs clear and complementary roles for all organisations in the vocational education system We need a system in which industry and providers have strong distinct roles Each need to be positioned to act collaboratively to develop the skills that people and industries need to flourish The system needs to draw more strongly both on industry expertise in setting expectations providing leadership and setting standards and on provider expertise in delivering education and pastoral care To achieve this the Government s first proposal is to give industry an increased leadership role in vocational education and reshape ITOs into industry skills bodies that will focus in four key areas ITOs would have the opportunity to apply to be recognised as Industry Skills Bodies ITOs role of supporting workplace learning and assessment for work based vocational education would transfer to vocational education providers and ITOs current role purchasing provider based courses for work based trainees would transfer to the TEC ITOs existing advisory and brokerage functions could be located in a number of places in the reformed vocational education system and the Government will gather feedback on this during public consultation The Government acknowledges that the proposed changes would have an impact on ITOs However the risks of not making changes are also significant disruption now will strengthen the vocational education system for the long term We will work closely with ITOs to seek their input on designing the new system and manage the transition from ITOs to industry skills bodies The second proposal is the establishment of a New Zealand Institute of Skills Technology The Government wants a vocational education system that delivers more for our regions so that every learner has more and better choices in accessing quality vocational programmes and teaching where they live and work We need a system that listens to what learners businesses industry and the wider community want and need and delivers it for them partnering with schools employers iwi local Government and community groups The Government s proposals would improve and extend regional access and responsiveness Making the system more efficient faster and more flexible as well as more embedded in regional labour markets will mean better service for the regions Our proposals would also create a system that makes the public vocational sector sustainable long term and makes it much easier to grow course delivery at more locations Under the status quo most ITPs will increasingly come under considerable financial stress due to declining enrolments high fixed costs and funding that does not reflect their cost structures At present four of our 16 ITPs have commissioners in place and five others face a serious financial risk This cannot continue Without significant educational reform to first stabilise and then position the ITP sector for growth the range of vocational education options in some regions will continue to decline Some existing ITP campuses would not be sustainable The Government s proposal is to create a single New Zealand Institute of Skills Technology that is distributed across a network to offer high quality vocational education throughout New Zealand It would transform the current regional network of 16 ITPs into regional campuses of the new nationwide institute This new Institute will offer work based as well as off job learning with the expectation over time that more delivery would resemble apprenticeships where the learner provider and employer collaborate to support a learner to combine training with work Resources would be freed up to expand front line with programme and course design and back office functions distributed across the network The size and scale of the new Institute would allow greater and faster improvements to provision nationwide Instead of each campus being limited by what it can afford to deliver it could leverage the resources of the whole Institute with a mix of face to face online and blended learning This will mean local communities and regions have more choice and thanks to the Industry Skills Bodies more confidence that the skills vocational learners develop are the skills that the workforce needs Many existing ITPs have special arrangements in the current network and consideration would need to be given as to how these would be translated into the new system One example is the Southern Institute of Technology s offer to learners of zero fees or accommodation funding support Many ITPs also have contracts agreements and understandings with communities and stakeholders that need to be honoured throughout any transition I want to be clear here there will continue to be room for regional differentiation and for a strong degree of regional influence Each region of the New Zealand Institute would have a Regional Leadership Group to map out local skill requirements link with local and regional development strategies and to advise on what mix of courses should be offered in that region The groups would include representatives from local communities iwi hap schools industry and local government By providing a mechanism for local connected leadership we intend to give local communities more say in the education and training that s on offer in their area There could be more Regional Leadership Groups than there are current ITPs putting the local back into the system The Government envisages that the New Zealand Institute of Skills Technology and perhaps also w nanga would host Centres of Vocational Excellence focused on areas of particular importance e g agriculture The proposed New Zealand Institute of Skills Technology will also be a major of provider of international education with the visibility and scale to have a bigger impact in the international market And it will continue to deliver foundation and degree level education as do the current ITPs but as a much stronger and more efficiently designed nationwide institution This is a big change and I know it will take time to process All change comes with challenges but the opportunities here are enormous and I encourage you to share our sense of urgency and vision for what the new Institute could be and do for New Zealand Proposal three is for a unified funding systemA single funding system is needed to replace two different funding systems that are drawing providers and industry apart We need a funding system that draws them together Creating one funding system for vocational education would ensure learners get the skills experience and support they need to be successful providers have the funding they need to be sustainable and to support our regions and Industry Skills Bodies can fulfil their roles The Government will work through the details of the new vocational education funding regime after consultation We want to hear your ideas about how it could work and what kind of incentives different arrangements might create It s important to address what the proposed changes mean for learners There would be a whole lot of improvements in their learning experience If the proposals are adopted learners will be able to move easily between education providers and between on and off job training all while gaining skills they can be confident will help them to succeed in work and life But for now nothing will change for learners due to the proposals For 2019 and 2020 students are encouraged to enrol in ITPs as they normally wouldI want to assure all students that you can continue with confidence to enrol and study in quality assured programmes across New Zealand Any changes post consultation will be carefully managed to minimise the impact on current learners They will be able to proceed with your study through any future change process Course fees for 2019 won t change due to the proposed reforms Local scholarships and fee support programmes that vocational education providers have committed to with their communities will remain The Government s policy of a Fees Free first year of tertiary education and training will continue For international students in 2019 and 2020 they are encouraged to enrol in ITPs as they normally would Existing courses and qualifications will continue International students visa status will not change and all New Zealand qualifications will continue to be recognised internationally I would encourage prospective students overseas to continue to apply to study at New Zealand vocational education providers with an assurance that the high quality of provision and range of courses currently on offer will continue Agencies will be updating overseas stakeholders so they are aware that it s business as usual here The Government sees a strong future for international education in New Zealand and remains committed to attracting and supporting international students seeking a quality education and developing the skills that New Zealand needs I want to acknowledge the uncertainty staff in the sector have lived with over a number of years We ve seen major upheavals at TPP Unitec Northtec and at institutes around Wellington and staff elsewhere are feeling the pinch It is time to give them more certainty with a clear vision of the future and a detailed plan of how to get there The package of changes being proposed is significant But the risks of not acting are also significant We need to accept that disruption now will strengthen the vocational education system for the long term We ll be working closely with education providers and ITOs to seek their input on designing the new system and managing the transition And we ll ensure that change processes include robust and proactive support for employees whose jobs may be impacted by change As part of the consultation process agencies will be visiting ITPs and ITOs and discuss the proposed changes with them including with staff unions management and learners Contrary to some irresponsible claims that have been made in recent days the government has no target for job losses or redundancies We want to work with those who may be affected to help them transition We want to provide retraining and redeployment opportunities where someone s role has been changed or has disappeared In fact that s one of the reasons we re doing these changes in the first place Increasing numbers of New Zealanders across the economy are going to find their jobs changing or disappearing and we need to gear the system up to provide them with much more support to retrain and redeploy elsewhere I d like to say a few words about what our proposals mean for tangata whenua A significant weakness in our current vocational system is that not all learners are getting the educational and employment outcomes they want and deserve The system is overly complex making it hard for first time learners particularly M ori to achieve good outcomes Our proposals seek to strengthen the influence M ori have over vocational education for their communities through the proposed Regional Leadership Groups of the New Zealand Institute of Skills Technology These would aim to complement with a strong local voice the direct partnership between iwi M ori and the Crown The Government would expect the proposed changes to be focused on delivering high quality and relevant services to M ori as individuals wh nau and iwi The proposed new system also presents significant opportunities for w nanga We will work through those changes carefully with wananga recognising their unique role in our education system The proposed changes to vocational education will be supported by a range of other work the Government is doing to create positive outcomes for learners and employers We have already taken steps to make post school education and training more accessible with our fees free programme which provides 2 years of free industry training and apprenticeships or one year of free tertiary education We also announced changes to allow greater use of micro credentials to ensure our system is more accessible and responsive to business needs We are also well down the track of developing a careers system that will be much more active and hands on that the passive fragmented and piecemeal system we have now And we re busy modernising the schooling system through the reviews of Tomorrow s Schools and the NCEA So what can you expect to happen next I acknowledge that the fundamental change being proposed may be stressful and disruptive For this reason the Government will consider all feedback received during consultation and then make decisions quickly on how to proceed likely in May or June this year Public announcements will follow shortly afterwards We would aim to pass any new legislation during 2019 to enable a new institution to be technically in place from 1 January 2020 This would occur through a technical merger of existing institutions with the details depending on the final option adopted Final changes will be phased to ensure that disruption is minimised time is given for new capabilities to be put in place and that the continuing education of learners and trainees is not compromised To close the debate about the vocational education system has been simmering for some years Over the past year and in particular the last six months the calls for change have grown steadily louder and we know the time to act is now We cannot afford to let the skills gap continue to widen Governments can t continue tinkering at the edges or adding more layers of complexity and band aid solutions to an already complex system We need decisive action to safeguard New Zealand s skills pipeline and economic development for the future The Government s proposals are both far reaching and necessary If adopted as proposed they would fundamentally change the nature of the New Zealand vocational education system This is a once in a generation chance to help design the world class vocational education system that New Zealanders need and deserve a system that will work for everyone with strong industry leadership sustainable ITP campuses strengthened provision of education in the regions and flexible funding that can adjust to the changing needs of employers the economy and learners I encourage every New Zealander to participate in this consultation process and share your views about how New Zealand can build a vocational education system that we as a country can be proud of T n koutou t n koutou t n koutou katoa
