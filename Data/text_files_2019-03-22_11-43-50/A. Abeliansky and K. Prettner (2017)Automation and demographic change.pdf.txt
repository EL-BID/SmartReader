Abstract

We analyze the effects of declining population growth on automation. A simple the-

oretical model of capital accumulation predicts that countries with lower population

growth introduce automation technologies earlier. We test the theoretical prediction

on panel data for 60 countries over the time span 1993-2013. Regression estimates sup-

port the theoretical prediction, suggesting that a 1% increase in population growth is

associated with an approximately 2% reduction in the growth rate of robot density.

Our results are robust to the inclusion of standard control variables, different estima-

tion methods, dynamic specifications, and changes to the measurement of the stock

of robots.

1 Introduction

Industrialized countries have experienced substantial declines in fertility and in birth rates

over the last few decades. For example, in the United States, the total fertility rate (TFR)

fell from 3.33 children per woman in the period 1950-1955 to 1.89 children per woman in

the period 2010-2015. Over the same time span, the crude birth rate (CBR) decreased

from 24.4 children per 1000 inhabitants to 12.6 children per 1000 inhabitants (see The

United Nations, 2015, and Table 1 in which we depict the situation in the G7 countries).

While these demographic changes have already had a pronounced effect on the evolution

of the labor force, the relatively larger cohorts that entered the labor markets of these

countries in the 1960s and 1970s are now starting to reach the retirement age such that

a substantial decline in the working-age population is most likely to occur in the coming

decades.

There are many concerns among economists regarding the long-run consequences of

the mentioned demographic developments. For example, it is often argued that social se-

curity systems and retirement schemes would need to be reformed to ensure that they are

accurately financed in the future when fewer and fewer workers will have to support ever

more retirees (see Gruber and Wise, 1998; Bloom et al., 2010; The Economist, 2011), there

are concerns that investment rates will decline when the retiring cohorts run down their

assets (Mankiw and Weil, 1989; Schich, 2008), and some are afraid that the innovative

capacity of aging societies will decline (see, for example, Canton et al., 2002; Borghans

and ter Weel, 2002; Irmen and Litina, 2016; Gehringer and Prettner, 2017). Some com-

mentators have even gone so far as to argue that aging is a “threat more grave and certain

than those posed by chemical weapons, nuclear proliferation, or ethnic strife” (Peterson,

1999).

As far as the expected labor shortages due to population aging are concerned, there is

a silver lining on the horizon. In recent years, robots have started to take over many tasks

that have previously been regarded as non-automatable and it is expected that this trend

will continue in the future (see Frey and Osborne, 2013; Arntz et al., 2016; Acemoglu and

Restrepo, 2017b, for different views on the extent of this development and for a discussion

2



on how automation could alleviate the burden of population aging). Very prominent

examples that have received an extensive media coverage in recent years are autonomous

cars and lorries that could soon transport passengers and goods without the need to rely

on the (usually highly imperfect) driving skills of humans; fully automated food deliveries

are already present in some cities; 3D printers are starting to produce highly specialized

products – that could not be mass-manufactured before and which therefore required a lot

of specialized human labor input – at a large scale; software based on machine learning is

already more reliable in diagnosing diseases than doctors; and even the skills of authors

become more and more obsolete as algorithms are able to write newsflashes, reports, and

even novels on their own.1 Admittedly, it is still a much bigger pleasure to read “Anna

Karenina” than “True Love” (a novel written by an algorithm programmed to rewrite

Anna Karenina in the style of the Japanese author Haruki Murakami; see Barrie, 2014).

However, things might change quite fast and maybe we will some day find out how “The

Castle” or “The Man Without Qualities” could have come to an end – hopefully in the

style of Franz Kafka and Robert Musil, respectively.

The effects of automation on employment, wages, and productivity have only recently

started to catch the attention of economists. Acemoglu and Restrepo (2015), Hémous

and Olsen (2016), and Prettner and Strulik (2017) set up endogenous growth models

in which robots can easily perform the tasks of low-skilled workers, Steigum (2011) and

Prettner (2017) introduce automation capital as a substitute for labor into the otherwise

standard neoclassical growth models of Cass (1965) and Solow (1956), and Graetz and

Michaels (2015) and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017a) investigate the empirical effects

of automation on productivity and wages. In general, the finding that automation has

the potential to increase productivity and thereby economic growth is common in these

studies.2 The effects of robots on the functional income distribution also seem to be

clear and unambiguous: since robots compete with labor more closely than other types of

machines but their income flows to the capital owners that invested in robots, automation

has the potential to explain part of the reduction in the labor income share that has been

observed over the past few decades (see, for example, Elsby et al., 2013; Karabarbounis

and Neiman, 2014). However, the theoretical predictions differ slightly with respect to

the effects of automation on inequality in terms of the wage distribution. Acemoglu and

Restrepo (2015) and Hémous and Olsen (2016) argue that new tasks (which are initially

1See, for example, The Economist (2014), Abeliansky et al. (2015), Lanchester (2015), Graetz and
Michaels (2015), Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2016), El Pais (2016), Prettner (2017), and Prettner and
Strulik (2017) on different aspects of automation and on new developments.

2In the frameworks used by Sachs and Kotlikoff (2012), Benzell et al. (2015), and Sachs et al. (2015),
automation potentially reduces economic prosperity. This however, crucially hinges on the structure of
the overlapping generations model that they use as a basis of their analysis (Diamond, 1965). In such a
model, young workers save for retirement by investing in capital (and robots if this type of investment is
available). The only source of savings for the young are their wages. Since wages decline with automation,
investment also declines, which leads to a vicious cycle of declining wages and declining per capita income.
However, if households can save also out of their capital income – as in Solow (1956) or in the neoclassical
growth model due to Ramsey (1928), Cass (1965), and Koopmans (1965), this downward spiral need not
occur (see Gasteiger and Prettner, 2017).

non-automatable) are constantly developed for workers who are displaced by automation,

which mitigates the negative effects of automation to the extent that low-skilled wages

could even grow in the long run. By contrast, the conclusions of Steigum (2011), Prettner

(2017), and Prettner and Strulik (2017) are less optimistic. They show that automation

might imply stagnating (and even decreasing) wages of low-skilled workers as it has been

observed since 1970s in the United States (Mishel et al., 2015; Murray, 2016). These

potential negative effects of automation have stoked debates among politicians and the

general public on taxing robots and on introducing a universal basic income to support

workers who loose their jobs due to automation. For example, at the beginning of 2017,

Bill Gates proposed a tax on robots to raise revenues for redistribution.3

While all of the mentioned works are related to our paper because they are dealing

with some of the causes and consequences of automation, none of them analyzes the extent

to which demographic changes impact on the adoption to robots. In our contribution we

aim to close this gap by setting up a simple economic growth model that takes automation

capital as a separate new production factor into account. We show that countries with

lower population growth have lower incentives to invest in automation. In the second

part of the paper we investigate empirically whether the implications of the theoretical

model are borne out by the data. Regression estimates support the theoretical prediction,

suggesting that a 1% increase in population growth is associated with an approximately

2% reduction in the growth rate of the automation density as measured by the number of

robots per thousand inhabitants.

Our paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we provide some theoretical consid-

erations on the potential effects of automation in the face of the demographic changes

outlined in the introduction. Furthermore, we assess which countries – with their given

demographic structure – will be likely to adopt robots earlier and faster. In Section 3

we test the theoretical predictions empirically and in Section 4 we discuss our results and

draw some policy conclusions.

2 Declining population growth and automation: theoretical

considerations

2.1 Basic assumptions

Consider an economy with three production factors, human labor, traditional capital (ma-

chines, assembly lines, production halls, office buildings, etc.), and automation capital

(robots, 3D printers, driverless cars, devices based on machine learning, etc). Time t

evolves discretely such that one time step corresponds to approximately 25 years and

the population grows at rate n between time t and time t + 1. Traditional capital and

automation capital can be accumulated and they fully depreciate over the course of one

generation. Human labor and traditional physical capital are imperfect substitutes, while

automation capital is – by its definition – a perfect substitute for labor (Merriam-Webster,

2017). Note the special and non-standard role that automation capital plays in such a

setting: on the one hand, it performs the tasks of human labor and therefore constitutes

a perfect substitute for this production factor; on the other hand, its accumulation resem-

bles the process of standard physical capital accumulation such that the income stream

that automation capital generates flows to investors, i.e., the capital owners/savers in an

economy. Overall, we follow the simplified exposition of Solow (1956) and assume that

households save a constant fraction s ∈ (0, 1) of their total income. The savings rate could

be endogenized along the lines of Ramsey (1928), Cass (1965), and Koopmans (1965) but

this would mainly complicate the exposition without adding substantially new insights

regarding the effect of demographic change on automation.

2.2 Households and population growth

The population size is given by Nt and its evolution is governed by the difference equation

Nt+1 = (1 + n)Nt,

where n is the population growth rate. Because of the demographic changes outlined in

the introduction, this rate is expected to fall in the future – in some countries even to

negative values. We assume that there is inelastic labor supply of households and full

employment such that the labor force at time t is given by Lt ≡ Nt. Consequently, a

reduction in the population growth rate translates into a reduction in the growth rate

of the workforce, which is realistic in the long run. Since we are primarily interested in

structural long-run effects, we abstract from modeling the delayed translation between the

decline of the population growth rate and the decline in the workforce.

Aggregate savings are given by St+1 = sNt and there are two savings vehicles, tradi-

tional physical capital and automation capital. As a consequence, there is a no-arbitrage

condition that has to hold in any equilibrium in which individuals are investing in both

types of assets. This condition states that the rates of return on traditional physical

capital and on automation capital have to be equal.

2.3 Production and automation

We follow Prettner (2017) and assume that the production function has a Cobb-Douglas

structure with respect to human labor and traditional physical capital. However, the

additional non-standard production factor “automation capital” is a perfect substitute for

labor such that aggregate output is given by

Yt = K
α
t (Lt + Pt)

1−α,

5



where Kt refers to traditional physical capital, Pt denotes automation capital, and α ∈

(0, 1) is the elasticity of output with respect to traditional physical capital. We abstract

from factor-augmenting technological progress that would only act as an additional source

of economic growth but it would not alter the crucial mechanisms in our framework.4

Perfect competition on factor markets implies that the production factors are paid their

marginal value products. Normalizing the price of final output to 1, the wage rate and

the rates of return on the two types of capital are given by

wt = (1− α)

Rtradt+1 = α

, (3)

where Rautomt+1 is the gross interest rate paid on automation capital, which is equal to the

wage rate, and Rtradt+1 is the gross interest rate paid on traditional physical capital. While

the effects of Kt and Lt on wages and on the rate of return on traditional physical capi-

tal are straightforward, we have a non-standard effect of the accumulation of automation

capital: As Pt increases, the wage rate decreases because workers compete with automa-

tion capital, whereas the rate of return on traditional physical capital increases because

automation capital substitutes for workers and therefore raises the marginal product of

traditional physical capital. Together with the fact that the income stream earned by au-

tomation capital flows to the capital owners, this mechanism has the potential to explain

part of the decrease in the labor income share that we have observed over the last few

decades (see also Steigum, 2011; Prettner, 2017). It is important to note at this point

that, while automation reduces the marginal product of labor and thereby the wage rate,

labor productivity as measured by output per worker increases with automation.

The no-arbitrage condition states that investments in both types of physical capital

have to yield the same rate of return, i.e., it holds that Rautomt+1 = R
trad
t+1 . Setting Equations

(2) and (3) equal to each other and solving for Kt and Pt, respectively, yields

Pt =
1− α

α
Kt − Lt ⇔ Kt =

α

1− α
(Pt + Lt). (4)

Plugging the expression for traditional physical capital from Equation (4) into the

aggregate production function provides

Yt =

)

(Lt + Pt), (5)

4For an R&D-based endogenous growth model along the lines of Romer (1990) in which firms can
invest in robot technology, see Hémous and Olsen (2016), Acemoglu and Restrepo (2015), and Prettner
and Strulik (2017). However, these papers focus on a different aspect of the rise of machines than the
implications of demographic change for investments in (and the adoption of) automation technology.

where it is immediately clear that the standard convergence process to a stationary equi-

librium with no long-run growth that we know from the Solow (1956) model without

technological progress does not hold anymore. Instead, the production function has the

potential to lead to long-run growth if the savings rate is large enough so as to sustain a

positive accumulation rate of automation capital (cf. Steigum, 2011; Prettner, 2017). Note

that Equation (5) resembles the properties of an AK type of production structure. How-

ever, in contrast to standard AK type of growth models, this is not due to an assumption

that removes the diminishing marginal product of physical capital but due to the structure

of the production process in the presence of automation capital.5 Allowing for a different

rate of depreciation for traditional physical capital and for automation capital would leave

our central results unchanged. The only difference would be that an additional constant

term (the difference between the rates of depreciation between the two forms of capital)

appeared in Equation (4) and in the derivations that are based on this equation.

From Equation (5) it follows that per capita GDP is given by

yt =

(

α

1− α

)

(pt + 1), (6)

where pt is the automation density in terms of automation capital per capita. We imme-

diately see that the prosperity of a country is positively linked to its automation density.

The intuitive explanation for this relation is clear. For a given population size, automation

overcomes the diminishing marginal product of traditional physical capital that acts as a

boundary for long-run economic growth in the standard Solow (1956) model (see Prettner,

2017, for the analysis of the implications of automation for long-run economic growth in

such a setting). Once the tasks that could previously only be carried out by human labor

are automated, the stock of labor becomes, essentially, a reproducible production factor.

At the aggregate level, this implies that there are constant returns to scale with respect

to all reproducible production factors. Consequently, automation creates the potential for

long-run growth without factor-augmenting technological progress.

Next, we analyze how the automation density itself depends on the demographic set-

ting, which is our main question of interest that we analyze empirically in Section 3.

2.4 The effect of demographic change on automation density

Since households save a constant fraction s ∈ (0, 1) of their total income Yt and the

economy is closed, aggregate investment is It = sYt such that

Kt+1 + Pt+1 = sYt.

5Peretto and Saeter (2013) construct a long-run economic growth model in which firms can invest in
technological progress that raises the productivity of physical capital by increasing the elasticity of final
output with respect to physical capital. In the long-run limit, their aggregate production function converges
to an AK type of production function and economic growth is perpetual.

Substituting for Kt+1 by the no-arbitrage relationship (4), for Yt by Equation (5), and

dividing by the population size Nt+1 provides the following expression

α(pt+1 + 1)

1− α
+ pt+1 = s

(

α

1− α

)α 1 + pt
1 + n

.

Solving this equation for the automation density in period t + 1 as a function of the

automation density in period t and the parameter values of the model yields the dynamic

evolution of the automation density

pt+1 = s(1− α)

(

α

1− α

)α 1 + pt
1 + n

− α. (7)

From this equation it follows immediately that a country with a lower population growth

rate will have a higher automation density. We summarize this in the following proposition.

Proposition 1. Consider a country in which the production structure is described by an

aggregate production function of the form of Equation (5). Households save a constant

fraction s ∈ (0, 1) of their total income (labor income and capital income in the form of

traditional physical capital and automation capital), and the no-arbitrage condition (4)

holds for both types of investments. In this case a country will have a higher automation

density (p) if it has a lower population growth rate (n).

Proof. Taking the derivative of Equation (7) with respect to n we get

∂pt+1

∂n
= −s(1− α)

(

α

1− α

)α 1 + pt
(1 + n)2

< 0.

Note that this expression is, in general, not equal to -1 such that our result is not just

due to the fact that automation density is defined as the aggregate stock of automation

capital divided by the population size.

The intuition for this finding is the following: A country in which the population –

and with it the labor force – grows fast, exhibits a comparably high rate of return on

traditional physical capital and there is no need to invest in automation capital. In fact,

in such a country, the rate of return on investment in automation capital tends to be

rather low. Examples are African countries with a very fast population growth rate such

as Mali and Niger: investing in automation would not be an attractive business strategy in

these countries because of the abundance of labor. By contrast, in a country in which the

population – and with it the labor force – stagnates or even decreases, the rate of return

on investment in automation is high and the rate of return on investment in traditional

physical capital is rather low. Examples are aging European countries such as Germany

and Italy and aging East Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea in which labor

is rather scarce. Consequently, our theory predicts that the automation density is high in

countries in which the growth rate of the population is low or even negative.

Note: The population growth rate is calculated as the average population growth rate from 2010 to
2015. The data sources are (International Federation of Robotics, 2015; United Nations, 2015).

A first glimpse on whether this is true is provided by Table 2 that depicts the number

of industrial robots per 10,000 employees as of 2015 together with the average population

growth rate in the preceding 5-year interval from 2010 to 2015 for the ten countries with

the highest robot usage. In general, we observe that the population growth rate in these

countries is rather low and in some of them even negative. However, this could just be

due to the fact that these countries are richer, implying that they have a lower fertility

rate and that they are, at the same time, able to invest more in automation. In the next

section we therefore test whether our theoretical implication is borne out by the data in

a more thorough way.

3 Declining population growth and automation: empirical

results

In this section we introduce the data, then we test Proposition 1 empirically, and finally

we provide a number of robustness checks.

3.1 Data description

The only available dataset so far to study the adoption of robots is the one collected by

the International Federation of Robotics (IFR). The IFR reports the yearly delivery of

“multipurpose manipulating industrial robots” as defined by the International Organiza-

tion for Standardization6 for several countries, starting in 1993. We use the data until

2013 because the data for the year 2014 are unreliable: there are several zeroes that seem

6This refers to “Manipulating industrial robot as defined by ISO 8373: An automatically controlled,
reprogrammable, multipurpose manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which may be either fixed
in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications” (Graetz and Michaels, 2015; International
Federation of Robotics, 2012).

to be reporting errors in comparison to previous values in the data series. In the baseline

specification we use 3 year averages of the data which provides us with 7 time periods

for estimation. The sample includes 60 countries for which the data are available (for the

list of countries see Table 9 in the Appendix). We had to combine the NAFTA countries

(Canada, the United States, and Mexico) into one country because they report the values

jointly until 2011.

The IFR also reports the deliveries and the stock of robots at the industry level. They

consider that robots have a life-time horizon of 12 years, after which they are deployed

(International Federation of Robotics, 2016). Following Graetz and Michaels (2015), we

use an alternative way to calculate the stock of robots (for all robots and for robots in the

manufacturing industry separately) that relies on the perpetual inventory method under

the assumption of a depreciation rate of 10%. In robustness checks we also use alternative

depreciation rates of 5% and 15%. Similar to Graetz and Michaels (2015), we prefer

this method over the one used by the IFR because it is more in line with the standard

economics literature. Since the IFR reports the stock of robots in 1993, this is our first

value for the constructed series. Although all countries report the total stock of robots,

not all of them report the stock nor the deliveries disaggregated at the industry level on a

yearly basis. Given that we are mainly interested in the robots used in the manufacturing

sector, we follow Graetz and Michaels (2015) and take the average share of deliveries of

manufacturing robots over the total deliveries of robots (when the data were available),

construct an average share, and impute the values for deliveries of manufacturing robots,

as well as for the initial stock of robots (when the corresponding data were not available).

In Table 8 in the Appendix we show the first reported year of robots’ data disaggregated

by the industry level for the countries for which there were gaps in the reported data.

In the following figures we show how the robot density has evolved between the first

period of the sample (1993-1995) and the last period (2011-2013). We discriminate between

percentiles with Figure 1 (covering the period 1993-1995) reporting in the lightest shade

of blue the 75th percentile, proceeding with the 90th percentile, the 95th percentile, and

finally the last 5% of the distribution (there are many countries with zeroes in this period

which is why we use the 75th percentile as the first cutoff). For comparison, we show the

same data for the period 2011-2013 in Figure 2 and use the same cutoffs as in the previous

figure. We observe a strong increase in robot density, especially in Europe and South Asia.

Similar figures but only for robots used in the manufacturing sector are displayed in the

Appendix (Figures 3 and 4).

We also collected information from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the

investment share of GDP. We constructed our investment variable summing the reported

values of private investment, public investment, and joint ventures between the state and

the private sector. As for other control variables, we included GDP per capita measured in

constant US$ with a base year of 2010 from the World Development Indicators, openness

measured as exports and imports over GDP, and the gross enrollment ratio in secondary

3.2 Empirical specification

Based on Proposition 1, we estimate the relationship between robots adoption and popu-

lation growth by means of the following equation:

ln(p̂i,t) = c+ α ln(ni,t−1) + β ln(si,t−1) + γ ln(xi,t−1) + dt + ǫi,t, (8)

where p̂i,t is the growth rate of the robot density (either manufacturing robots, or the

total amount of robots per 1000 inhabitants), ni,t−1 is the population growth rate between

period t-1 and t-2, si,t−1 is the investment rate in period t− 1, xi,t−1 is a vector of further

control variables that will be used in the robustness analysis (e.g., GDP per capita and

openness), and dt are time-specific effects to control for events and trends that affect

all countries in the same manner, for example, the global economic and financial crisis

that started in 2007. Since we have zeroes and negative values in the dependent variable

and in the population growth rate, we employed the Box-Cox transformation (Box and

Cox, 1964).8 We apply the logarithmic transformation because this alleviates concerns

regarding heteroscedasticity and non-linearities in the non-transformed variables. We

relied on 3-year averages to alleviate problems regarding measurement errors and business-

cycle effects. While the economic growth literature usually relies on 5 year averages, we

would only have 2 consecutive time periods left for estimation in this case.

We first estimate Equation (8) using pooled OLS (POLS) and then proceed with a

random-effects (RE) and a fixed-effects (FE) specification. Finally, we take the potential

dynamics into account by including the lagged dependent variable in the regressions and

applying various corrected fixed effects estimators (CorrFE) following Bruno (2005a,b),

and the system GMM estimator [GMM (sys)] of Blundell and Bond (1998). Note that both

of these types of estimators are seen as remedies for the Nickell (1981) bias in a dynamic

panel data setting. We report the results for the total amount of robots and then also

separately for the subset of manufacturing robots. Moreover, we assess the robustness of

our results by adding a proxy for education, a proxy for GDP per capita, and a proxy for

openness. In other robustness checks reported in the Appendix, we also consider different

depreciation rates in the construction of the robot data series (5% and 15% instead of

10%), and a different transformation of the robot adoption and population growth rates

[a neglog transformation as used by Whittaker et al. (2005)].

Based on the theoretical considerations we expect to find a negative coefficient for the

7The natural choice of a proxy variable for education would have been the mean years of schooling as
reported by (Barro and Lee, 2013). However, this variable is only available in 5 year intervals. Another
alternative would have been to use the literacy rate but this is close to one in most countries of the sample
and there are also a lot of missing values for this variable, so we decided to stick with the gross enrollment
ratio (Busse and Spielmann, 2006).

8We created a new variable in the following manner: z = ln(growth rate − k), choosing k such that
the skewness of z is zero. The correlation between the non-transformed variables and the variables in
logarithms (naturally omitting the zeroes and the negative values) is 0.89.

population growth rate that is smaller than -1 and a positive sign for the investment rate.

When we include the controls, we expect a positive coefficient for GDP per capita because

higher income implies a lower return to traditional capital accumulation and therefore a

stronger incentive to employ robots. Furthermore, a better educated population might

be more inclined to invest in (or adapt to) robots such that the coefficient of education

should also be positive. However, we have no a priori expectation regarding the sign of

the coefficient for openness – on the one hand, as countries become more open, they might

need fewer robots because domestic production could easier be substituted by imports;

on the other hand, open economies are also subject to stronger international competition

such that there is an incentive to automate the production in search of efficiency gains.

3.3 Main Results

Table 3 contains the regression outputs from a baseline specification of Equation (8). As

regressors we include the two crucial variables that are suggested by our theoretical consid-

erations in Equation (7), the population growth rate and the investment rate. We observe

that there is a negative relationship between population growth and the growth rate of the

robot density in all specifications and it is statistically significant in the majority of the

columns. Only in column (1), which reports the POLS regression, we find the coefficient

not to be statistically significant which is most likely due to the lack of accounting for

country-level heterogeneity. Our results are robust to the dynamic specifications using

the corrected fixed effects estimators, as well as the system GMM estimator which also

controls for endogeneity of the regressorss using internal instruments. As far as the choice

between corrected fixed effects and system GMM is concerned, we prefer the corrected

fixed effects specifications because Judson and Owen (1999) report that this estimator

performs better when the amount of time periods is smaller than 10, which is the case in

our sample. Although the lagged dependent variable is statistically significant, the size of

the coefficient does not suggest strong evidence for the use of a dynamic specification. Our

preferred specification is therefore the fixed effects regression because the Hausman test

indicates that the results from the random effects specification are inconsistent such that

we need to control for unobserved heterogeneity. The coefficient estimate for the popu-

lation growth rate in case of the fixed-effects specification suggests that when population

growth increases by 1%, growth of the robot density will decrease by 2%. As far as the

main control variable (the investment share) is concerned, we find the expected positive

relationship, although it is not statistically significant.

Table 4 shows the results for the growth rate of the manufacturing robot density (in-

stead of all robots). We again find the negative association between population growth

and growth of the robot density as suggested by Proposition 1 with the size of the coeffi-

cients being similar to the those reported in Table 3. As in the previous case, we document

an insignificant positive correlation between the investment rate and the growth rate of

the manufacturing robots density. In this case, there is even less evidence than before for

13



the need of a dynamic specification because the coefficients of the lagged dependent vari-

able are smaller in size and not even statistically significant in case of the system GMM

estimator.

3.4 Robustness Analysis

As a first robustness check, we control for three potential omitted variables: GDP per

capita, openness of the economy, and secondary school enrollment. Omitting these vari-

ables could be a source of bias because richer countries are more able to invest in new

technologies and they are also the ones that are disproportionally affected by declining

fertility as outlined in Section 1; an open economy might be under more pressure to stay

competitive, and, at the same time, smaller economies by means of the population size

tend to be more open; and education is highly correlated with GDP per capita, while, at

the same time, a better educated population might be more inclined to invest in (or adapt

to) robots.

Table 5, which includes the mentioned control variables, shows again a negative cor-

relation between robot density growth and population growth. The magnitude of the

coefficients in the different specifications are marginally smaller than in the previous ta-

bles. However, except for the pooled OLS specification, they are statistically significant

at the 5% or at the 10% level. One reason for this could be that we have to accept a

reduction in the sample size because of several missing observations for the openness and

the secondary enrollment variables. The coefficient estimate of the investment rate is still

not statistically significant across the specifications, as in the previous case. In columns

(1) and (2), GDP per capita has a negative sign, which is surprising given that we ex-

pect that richer countries would be able to invest more in new technologies. However,

GDP per capita reverts its sign from column (3) onwards. Again, we believe that the

reason for this is the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and therefore the estimation of

a misspecified regression, as also suggested by the Hausman test. Secondary enrollment

has the predicted sign, although it is not statistically significant. Finally, openness has a

negative sign in most of the specifications, although none of the coefficients is statistically

significant. Finally, the coefficient size of the lagged dependent variable shows that there

is no pressing need to take the dynamics into account in the regression.

Turning to the results regarding manufacturing robots as displayed in Table 6, we

observe a similar pattern as for the case of the total amount of robots. All specifications

show a negative correlation between manufacturing robot density growth and population

growth. In contrast to the previous results, we find no statistical significance in case of

the system GMM estimator reported in column (7). However, this could be related to the

fact that the system GMM estimator is known to be very inefficient in case of a small time

dimension. As in the previous tables, we find no evidence of the importance of investment

or secondary schooling for robots adoption. Similar to the case of total robots, we find a

positive relationship between GDP per capita and the growth rate of the manufacturing

robots density. A puzzling result is the change in the sign of per capita GDP in case of

the system GMM estimator. However, the estimations performed with the corrected fixed

16



effects estimators still exhibit the significantly positive coefficient estimate. In Tables 10

and 11 in the Appendix we report the same specification but omitting the controls that

were not statistically significant (i.e., secondary school enrollment and openness). The

results do not change dramatically but the significance of the puzzling negative sign of per

capita GDP in case of the system GMM estimator vanishes.

As further robustness checks, we used 2-year averages instead of averaging the data over

3 years. Tables 12 and 13 in the Appendix show the corresponding results. As before, we

observe a statistically significant negative correlation of the population growth rate with

the growth of robot density (either of the total stock of robots or the ones employed in the

manufacturing sector). However, the magnitude of the correlation is smaller in absolute

value. The investment rate coefficient continues to be statistically insignificant in both

tables, having a positive sign in most of the cases. Only in column (7) of Table 13 the

coefficient of the investment rate is negative, although this estimate should be considered

with caution because the AR(2) test cannot rule out remaining autocorrelation of the

residuals at the 10% significance level. Moreover, we also constructed two alternative

robot stocks using 5% and 15% as alternative depreciation rates. The estimates for the

baseline model can be seen in Tables 14 and 16 (for total robots) and Tables 15 and 17

(for manufacturing robots) in the Appendix. We find no substantial differences with our

previous estimates.

In another sensitivity analysis we exclude Germany, South Korea, the NAFTA coun-

tries, Japan, and China because these are the countries with the highest (manufacturing)

robot density and also very low fertility rates. Irrespective of this substantial reduction in

the sample, the results are very stable, as can be seen is Tables 18 and 19 in the Appendix.

A concern could arise that our results are dependent on the Box-cox transformation.

A further robustness check therefore relies on using the neglog transformation for both

the population growth rate and the robot density growth rate. The neglog transformation

involves making the following adjustments to a variable (which we call x for simplicity).

If x <= 0, then we use − ln(−x + 1) instead of x and if x > 0, then we use ln(x + 1)

instead of x. The results are shown in Tables 20 and 21 of the Appendix. Again, the

results remain similar in terms of the sign and the statistical significance, although the

size of the coefficients is much larger.

For the last robustness check we follow Graetz and Michaels (2015) and convert the

dependent variable into percentiles. Consequently, we include the population growth rate

without the logarithmic transformation as regressor. We estimate, as before, a pooled

OLS and a random effects specification. To the latter we also add continent dummies

to further control for differences related to the geographical location. Finally, we also

include several cross-sectional regressions for different time periods. Tables 22 and 23

show the results. Naturally, the coefficient estimates are not anymore elasticities. We can

see that the qualitative relationships between the variables remains the same and that the

coefficients are statistically significant in most of the specifications (sometimes also the

investment rate is significant as can be seen in Table 22). We refrain from using the fixed

17



effects estimator given the nature of the dependent variable. In this scenario the preferred

specification is the one obtained with the random effects estimator. Both tables show

that a one percent increase of the population growth rate is associated with a decrease

of approximately two percentiles in the growth of the robot density. The addition of the

continent dummies does not add much additional explanatory power and the magnitude

of the coefficient of interest barely changes. With regards to the cross-sections, we rank

the robot density growth rates because we cannot divide them into percentiles with only

60 observations. The coefficient of interest is still significant in most specifications and

has the predicted negative sign. In columns (5) and (7) of both tables, however, the

coefficient looses statistical significance. This could be due to the dot-com crisis and the

financial crisis because these columns correspond to the periods including 2001 and 2008,

respectively.

4 Conclusions

We propose a theoretical framework of production in the age of automation for countries

that are subject to declining population growth and population aging. In so doing we

introduce a new production factor that resembles the properties of labor in the produc-

tion process, i.e., it is a perfect substitute for labor, while it resembles the properties of

traditional physical capital in the accumulation process, i.e., it is accumulated in the same

manner as physical capital due to the savings and investment decisions of households.

We show that countries with a lower population growth rate have a stronger incentive

to invest in the adoption of automation. Our empirical estimates and several robustness

checks support this theoretical prediction.

As far as policy implications are concerned, our theoretical and empirical findings sug-

gest that countries which are subject to larger demographic challenges will be the first

to adopt and/or invent new automation technologies. This in turn might help them to

overcome some of the negative effects that declining population growth and population

aging imply for long-run economic prosperity, issues that also the media is heavily con-

cerned with (see, for example, The Washington Post, 2016). Of course, the transition to

automation technologies might not be all that smooth because automation capital com-

petes with labor and therefore could act so as to depress wages. If this concern is valid and

widespread, it might lead to resistance against automation from labor unions and the pop-

ulation at large. Altogether, it might therefore be in everybody’s interest if governments

enact policies that alleviate the burden of those who suffer because of automation. Poten-

tial policies along these lines could include education subsidies and re-training programs,

making unemployment insurance widely available, and to provide access to the health-care

system for those who become unemployed. Furthermore, it would at some point be neces-

sary to rethink how social security systems are financed because the main contribution is

now made by the production factor labor. If labor income becomes a smaller and smaller

share of total income, alternatives need to be found. One remedy that is often suggested

18



could be to make sure that everybody owns some part of the automation capital of an

economy, for example, a driverless car that earns an income stream for him or her (Pratt,

2015; The Economist, 2017).

We admit that our framework stayed deliberately simple and the results that we present

are meant as a first step in the direction of analyzing the interrelations between demog-

raphy and automation. In reality, there are different skill groups in the population and

the tasks that are performed by the different skill groups might be more or less suited to

automation and they might even change over time (cf. Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2015). A

more detailed framework should be able to take this into account and to empirically distin-

guish between the education level of different types of workers, and also the heterogeneity

of tasks that workers perform. However, this crucially hinges on the data for automation

in general, and robots, in particular, to become more widely available. In addition, a more

detailed modeling of demographic change is called for that takes survival to old age and

changing life expectancy into account. First steps in this direction have been undertaken

by Gasteiger and Prettner (2017).
