DEBUG:root:VideoAre the robots coming for government jobs According to Bill Eggers the answer is yes sort of Eggers who runs Deloitte s Center for Government Insights said at a Nov 29 FCW event on government modernization that 20 to 30 percent of all work activities will soon be automatable thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence He pointed to a Deloitte study of the federal workforce that found 4 3 billion hours are spent each year on a wide range of task and activities A huge share of those hours is devoted to essentially moving paper he said while relatively little time goes to coaching and other sorts of human activities But the study also found that four out of five of the most labor intensive activities have either a medium or high automation potential Eggers said That could allow for reductions in certain parts of the workforce he noted but it also frees up time for critical higher value work and the chance to deliver better service by giving the human workforce AI powered support Studies have repeatedly shown Eggers said that it s the human machine pairing that gives the best results he said The full video of Eggers half hour talk which explores the larger implications for government as AI becomes the new electricity is available below Note This dual screen video recording is best viewed when expanded to the full browser window For more

publication has been defining and informing the senior management agenda since 1964 Our learning programs help organizations accelerate growth by unlocking their people s potential Automation and artificial intelligence AI are transforming businesses and will contribute to economic growth via contributions to productivity They will also help address moonshot societal challenges in areas from health to climate change At the same time these technologies will transform the nature of work and the workplace itself Machines will be able to carry out more of the tasks done by humans complement the work that humans do and even perform some tasks that go beyond what humans can do As a result some occupations will decline others will grow and many more will change While we believe there will be enough work to go around barring extreme scenarios society will need to grapple with significant workforce transitions and dislocation Workers will need to acquire new skills and adapt to the increasingly capable machines alongside them in the workplace They may have to move from declining occupations to growing and in some cases new occupations This executive briefing which draws on the latest research from the McKinsey Global Institute examines both the promise and the challenge of automation and AI in the workplace and outlines some of the critical issues that policy makers companies and individuals will need to solve for Automation and AI are not new but recent technological progress is pushing the frontier of what machines can do Our research suggests that society needs these improvements to provide value for businesses contribute to economic growth and make once unimaginable progress on some of our most difficult societal challenges In summary Beyond traditional industrial automation and advanced robots new generations of more capable autonomous systems are appearing in environments ranging from autonomous vehicles on roads to automated check outs in grocery stores Much of this progress has been driven by improvements in systems and components including mechanics sensors and software AI has made especially large strides in recent years as machine learning algorithms have become more sophisticated and made use of huge increases in computing power and of the exponential growth in data available to train them Spectacular breakthroughs are making headlines many involving beyond human capabilities in computer vision natural language processing and complex games such as Go These technologies are already generating value in various products and services and companies across sectors use them in an array of processes to personalize product recommendations find anomalies in production identify fraudulent transactions and more The latest generation of AI advances including techniques that address classification estimation and clustering problems promises significantly more value still An analysis we conducted of several hundred AI use cases found that the most advanced deep learning techniques deploying artificial neural networks could account for as much as 3 5 trillion to 5 8 trillion in annual value or 40 percent of the value created by all analytics techniques Exhibit 1 Deployment of AI and automation technologies can do much to lift the global economy and increase global prosperity at a time when aging and falling birth rates are acting as a drag on growth Labor productivity growth a key driver of economic growth has slowed in many economies dropping to an average of 0 5 percent in 2010 2014 from 2 4 percent a decade earlier in the United States and major European economies in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis after a previous productivity boom had waned AI and automation have the potential to reverse that decline productivity growth could potentially reach 2 percent annually over the next decade with 60 percent of this increase from digital opportunities AI is also being used in areas ranging from material science to medical research and climate science Application of the technologies in these and other disciplines could help tackle societal moonshot challenges For example researchers at Geisinger have developed an algorithm that could reduce diagnostic times for intracranial hemorrhaging by up to 96 percent Researchers at George Washington University meanwhile are using machine learning to more accurately weight the climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AI and automation still face challenges The limitations are partly technical such as the need for massive training data and difficulties generalizing algorithms across use cases Recent innovations are just starting to address these issues Other challenges are in the use of AI techniques For example explaining decisions made by machine learning algorithms is technically challenging which particularly matters for use cases involving financial lending or legal applications Potential bias in the training data and algorithms as well as data privacy malicious use and security are all issues that must be addressed Europe is leading with the new General Data Protection Regulation which codifies more rights for users over data collection and usage A different sort of challenge concerns the ability of organizations to adopt these technologies where people data availability technology and process readiness often make it difficult Adoption is already uneven across sectors and countries The finance automotive and telecommunications sectors lead AI adoption Among countries US investment in AI ranked first at 15 billion to 23 billion in 2016 followed by Asia s investments of 8 billion to 12 billion with Europe lagging behind at 3 billion to 4 billion Even as AI and automation bring benefits to business and society we will need to prepare for major disruptions to work Our analysis of more than 2000 work activities across more than 800 occupations shows that certain categories of activities are more easily automatable than others They include physical activities in highly predictable and structured environments as well as data collection and data processing These account for roughly half of the activities that people do across all sectors The least susceptible categories include managing others providing expertise and interfacing with stakeholders Nearly all occupations will be affected by automation but only about 5 percent of occupations could be fully automated by currently demonstrated technologies Many more occupations have portions of their constituent activities that are automatable we find that about 30 percent of the activities in 60 percent of all occupations could be automated This means that most workers from welders to mortgage brokers to CEOs will work alongside rapidly evolving machines The nature of these occupations will likely change as a result Automation will displace some workers We have found that around 15 percent of the global workforce or about 400 million workers could be displaced by automation in the period 2016 2030 This reflects our midpoint scenario in projecting the pace and scope of adoption Under the fastest scenario we have modeled that figure rises to 30 percent or 800 million workers In our slowest adoption scenario only about 10 million people would be displaced close to zero percent of the global workforce Exhibit 2 The wide range underscores the multiple factors that will impact the pace and scope of AI and automation adoption Technical feasibility of automation is only the first influencing factor Other factors include the cost of deployment labor market dynamics including labor supply quantity quality and the associated wages the benefits beyond labor substitution that contribute to business cases for adoption and finally social norms and acceptance Adoption will continue to vary significantly across countries and sectors because of differences in the above factors especially labor market dynamics in advanced economies with relatively high wage levels such as France Japan and the United States automation could displace 20 to 25 percent of the workforce by 2030 in a midpoint adoption scenario more than double the rate in India Even as workers are displaced there will be growth in demand for work and consequently jobs We developed scenarios for labor demand to 2030 from several catalysts of demand for work including rising incomes increased spending on healthcare and continuing or stepped up investment in infrastructure energy and technology development and deployment These scenarios showed a range of additional labor demand of between 21 percent to 33 percent of the global workforce 555 million and 890 million jobs to 2030 more than offsetting the numbers of jobs lost Some of the largest gains will be in emerging economies such as India where the working age population is already growing rapidly Additional economic growth including from business dynamism and rising productivity growth will also continue to create jobs Many other new occupations that we cannot currently imagine will also emerge and may account for as much as 10 percent of jobs created by 2030 if history is a guide Moreover technology itself has historically been a net job creator For example the introduction of the personal computer in the 1970s and 1980s created millions of jobs not just for semiconductor makers but also for software and app developers of all types customer service representatives and information analysts Partial automation will become more prevalent as machines complement human labor For example AI algorithms that can read diagnostic scans with a high degree of accuracy will help doctors diagnose patient cases and identify suitable treatment In other fields jobs with repetitive tasks could shift toward a model of managing and troubleshooting automated systems At retailer Amazon employees who previously lifted and stacked objects are becoming robot operators monitoring the automated arms and resolving issues such as an interruption in the flow of objects While we expect there will be enough work to ensure full employment in 2030 based on most of our scenarios the transitions that will accompany automation and AI adoption will be significant The mix of occupations will change as will skill and educational requirements Work will need to be redesigned to ensure that humans work alongside machines most effectively Automation will accelerate the shift in required workforce skills we have seen over the past 15 years Demand for advanced technological skills such as programming will grow rapidly Social emotional and higher cognitive skills such as creativity critical thinking and complex information processing will also see growing demand Basic digital skills demand has been increasing and that trend will continue and accelerate Demand for physical and manual skills will decline but will remain the single largest category of workforce skills in 2030 in many countries Exhibit 3 This will put additional pressure on the already existing workforce skills challenge as well as the need for new credentialing systems While some innovative solutions are emerging solutions that can match the scale of the challenge will be needed Our research suggests that in a midpoint scenario around 3 percent of the global workforce will need to change occupational categories by 2030 though scenarios range from about 0 to 14 percent Some of these shifts will happen within companies and sectors but many will occur across sectors and even geographies Occupations made up of physical activities in highly structured environments or in data processing or collection will see declines Growing occupations will include those with difficult to automate activities such as managers and those in unpredictable physical environments such as plumbers Other occupations that will see increasing demand for work include teachers nursing aides and tech and other professionals As intelligent machines and software are integrated more deeply into the workplace workflows and workspaces will continue to evolve to enable humans and machines to work together As self checkout machines are introduced in stores for example cashiers can become checkout assistance helpers who can help answer questions or troubleshoot the machines More system level solutions will prompt rethinking of the entire workflow and workspace Warehouse design may change significantly as some portions are designed to accommodate primarily robots and others to facilitate safe human machine interaction The occupational mix shifts will likely put pressure on wages Many of the current middle wage jobs in advanced economies are dominated by highly automatable activities such as in manufacturing or in accounting which are likely to decline High wage jobs will grow significantly especially for high skill medical and tech or other professionals but a large portion of jobs expected to be created including teachers and nursing aides typically have lower wage structures The risk is that automation could exacerbate wage polarization income inequality and the lack of income advancement that has characterized the past decade across advanced economies stoking social and political tensions Most countries already face the challenge of adequately educating and training their workforces to meet the current requirements of employers Across the OECD spending on worker education and training has been declining over the last two decades Spending on worker transition and dislocation assistance has also continued to shrink as a percentage of GDP One lesson of the past decade is that while globalization may have benefited economic growth and people as consumers the wage and dislocation effects on workers were not adequately addressed Most analyses including our own suggest that the scale of these issues is likely to grow in the coming decades We have also seen in the past that large scale workforce transitions can have a lasting effect on wages during the 19th century Industrial Revolution wages in the United Kingdom remained stagnant for about half a century despite rising productivity a phenomenon known as Engels Pause PDF 690KB after the German philosopher who identified it In the search for appropriate measures and policies to address these challenges we should not seek to roll back or slow diffusion of the technologies Companies and governments should harness automation and AI to benefit from the enhanced performance and productivity contributions as well as the societal benefits These technologies will create the economic surpluses that will help societies manage workforce transitions Rather the focus should be on ways to ensure that the workforce transitions are as smooth as possible This is likely to require actionable and scalable solutions in several key areas There is work for everyone today and there will be work for everyone tomorrow even in a future with automation Yet that work will be different requiring new skills and a far greater adaptability of the workforce than we have seen Training and retraining both midcareer workers and new generations for the coming challenges will be an imperative Government private sector leaders and innovators all need to work together to better coordinate public and private initiatives including creating the right incentives to invest more in human capital The future with automation and AI will be challenging but a much richer one if we harness the technologies with aplomb and mitigate the negative effects James Manyika is chairman and

by 2025 and beyond and examined how technology will help not hinder their effectiveness Discussions of how technology is changing the job of government sometimes view the challenge reactively but a recent report from Deloitte lands ahead of the issue probing how the work will change and predicting positions based on advances in tech and the rising influence of the consumer and talent markets In Government Jobs of the Future authors Amrita Datar William D Eggers and Jenn Gustetic consider what will government work look like in 2025 and beyond The aim is to educate readers on how public sector staff and machines can work together to optimize our collective impact A central goal Eggers told Government Technology was to deconstruct how that work takes place then reimagine it enabled by machine learning and digital technologies and new business tools The idea of human to machine pairing permeates the study which Eggers said aims to change the dystopian narrative that s often heard about automation leading to disappearing jobs In fact he noted human to machine pairings date back to the mechanization of farming The current shift is already creating new jobs he said highlighting recent additions to teams like the user experience coordinator and positions in search engine optimization What s new Eggers said is the rise of artificial intelligence and tools and techniques around virtual reality augmented reality and in other areas which should dramatically augment staffers capabilities The report s prediction of future jobs suggests a heavy lean on the use of technology to power flexible remote and connected work Additionally the authors found that future jobs will center on employees focusing on their wellness and personal development and enabling broader on the job mobility and personal opportunities such as passion projects This was really about saying we have an opportunity to shape this future of government work It can be incredibly empowering for employees and we wanted to start that process by developing these future government jobs said Eggers The report released Oct 4 envisions six new public sector job profiles of the future built on areas of government service that regardless of their eventual evolution aren t going anywhere Child aid coordinator would investigate abuse neglect or harm against children offer counseling court testimony and coordinate services and interventions The person profiled in this report has a bachelor s in social work along with certifications in analytics and as a social worker they would have previously worked in analytics and as a child welfare specialist Criminal redirection officer would assist low risk nonviolent offenders in virtual incarceration skill building and employment monitored by digital tools This person would have earned a bachelor s in social work and started their career as a correctional case manager after interning at a county probation department Mobility platform manager oversees the city s multimodal transportation system via AI to minimize accidents and disruption while helping optimize prices and routes This individual would hold a bachelor s in mechanical engineering and a master s in urban and regional planning and would be certified in the use of AI for transportation systems Public health and safety guardian inspects public spaces including restaurants schools and day cares and nursing homes investigates incidences of illness analyzes health data and advises public and private officials This person would have a bachelor s in public health and national environmental certifications Smart base commander would command a garrison managing infrastructure and daily operations and connecting with mission commanders and officials A graduate of military schools this individual would hold dual master s degrees in international relations and strategic studies Talent cloud coordinator is grounded in human resources and helps an agency identify and deploy its workforce enterprisewide based on need and skill sets This person would have a bachelor s in business administration and HR certification Technology underpins each future job classification augmenting as the report s authors wrote the existing abilities of these human workers Powered by tech the child aid coordinator and smart base commander were able to pivot their time away from administrative tasks toward client interactions and strategy sessions In the former case Eggers said the time shift could be particularly welcome He cited an analysis done recently in Colorado indicating case workers there spent less than 10 percent of their work time interacting with children and families In the Deloitte report the child aid coordinator s client interaction time rose from 25 percent to 40 percent The criminal redirection officer whose toolbox includes machine learning to enable virtual check ins with clients and a virtual reality training environment epitomizes the ongoing shift that has seen law enforcement deploy predictive policing body worn cameras AI and analytics The emphasis here on virtual incarceration could be a valuable change for the public sector Eggers said calling it a really big opportunity that could save a lot of money In a recent interview around his company s release of Reimagining the Police Workforce A Vision for the Future Jody Weis Accenture s public safety lead for North America and a federal and local member of law enforcement agreed agencies are embracing technology to varying degrees and praised its potential for expanding their grasp Just sifting through that huge haystack to find that proverbial needle having the tool to help you a little bit is incredibly helpful Weis said But hiring and retention will be ongoing challenges for agencies seeking to modernize or redefine job classifications around technology In the area of cybersecurity and creating a hardened posture Eggers recommended agencies engage with the private and educational sectors to facilitate reskilling and training but also consider imbedding AI into their cyberdefense to expand its reach The issue of outdated job classifications and work rules remains a big one for the public sector the author said As part of early steps toward meeting the challenge of technology he recommended being more strategic with HR and moving away from systems that focus on classifications and rules I think at the very basic level governments need to understand where the world is moving and show a destination and that s a little bit of what these jobs of the future are doing and kind of reimagining how to get there and doing some of that basic analysis Eggers said He suggested agencies consider new jobs they ll need to add future skills employees will need and which activities can be automated Theo Douglas is a staff writer for Government Technology His reporting experience includes covering municipal county and state governments business and

Management Agenda and it s a topic that has continued to resurface during this year s three previous GovExec LIVE events Since the management agenda was released the Office of Management and Budget has outlined key strategies for reskilling the workforce including identifying opportunities to incorporate automation focusing on emerging and mission critical skills reskilling and redeploying employees to high value work activities and creating career paths in the government that will best fit workforce planning needs In the fourth installment of the GovExec LIVE series we sat down with leaders from across the government to discuss strategies for reskilling the workforce the risk and rewards associated with changing agency culture automation and the technology behind the future

ThorntonSession VideosWRITTEN BY Charlie Tierney Steve Cottle Katie JorgensenWind back the clock to 1971 Jane a freshly minted college graduate joins the government as a clerk Jane s work consists largely of entering information into databases and creating reports which requires her to spend the better part of her work day seated at a terminal near a mainframe computer that fills an entire room Jane and her colleagues are expected to be at their desks from 9 a m to 5 p m five days a week Jane is grateful to have a steady 9 to 5 job and plans to spend her entire career with her agency Flash forward 40 years and meet Jane s grandson Ian He carries a slim tablet wherever he goes which has more computing power than the mainframe with which Jane worked Ian is constantly tethered to the Internet and works 24 7 from wherever he is Ian expects to switch from project to project and office to office as his career develops and his interests evolve If he feels he has reached the limit of his ability to learn or grow in one role he will look elsewhere for a new opportunity What if the government could give Ian the opportunities and experiences he seeks The GovCloud concept proposed in this paper would restructure government workforces in a way that takes advantage of the talents and preferences of workers like Ian who are entering the workforce today The model is based on a large body of research from interviews with public and private sector experts to best practices from innovative organizations both public and private This is the first generation of people that work play think and learn differently than their parents They are the first generation to not be afraid of technology It s like the air to them Don Tapscott author of Grown Up DigitalThis report details trends in work and technology that offer significant opportunities for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the government workforce It lays out the GovCloud model explaining how governments could be organized to take advantage of its flexibility It examines how work would be performed in the new model and discusses potential changes to government HR programs to support GovCloud Other sections provide resources for executives including a tool to help determine cloud eligibility steps they can take to pilot the cloud concept and future scenarios illustrating the cloud in action The GovCloud model represents a dramatic departure from the status quo It is bound to be greeted with some skepticism Without such innovation however governments will be left to confront the challenges of tomorrow with the workforce structure of yesterday The details of the GovCloud model are open for debate The purpose of this paper is to jumpstart that debate Forty years ago more than half of employed American adults worked in either blue collar or clerical jobs Today less than 40 percent work in these same categories and the share continues to shrink 1 Jobs requiring routine or manual tasks are disappearing while those requiring complex communication skills and expert thinking are becoming the norm 2 Increasingly employers seek workers capable of creative and knowledge based work We should ask ourselves whether we re truly satisfied with the status quo Are our workday lives so fulfilling and our organizations so boundlessly capable that it s now pointless to long for something better Gary Hamel author of The Future of ManagementThe next generation of creative knowledge workers has already entered the job market These Millennials came of age in a rapidly and radically changing world They are the first true digital natives They have grown up with instant access to information through technology As such Millennials have considerably different expectations for the kind of work they do and the information they use The pursuit for variety in work has led Millennials to cite simply needing a change as their top reason for switching jobs 3Advances in technology have also changed the actual ways in which people perform work The ability to crowdsource tasks is one example of this change Since its founding in 2001 volunteers have produced and contributed to over 19 million articles in 281 languages on Wikipedia 4 Built around this concept a burgeoning industry is developing around microtasking dividing work up into small tasks that can be farmed out to workers Amazon s Mechanical Turk rolled out in 2005 allows users to post tasks to a platform where registered workers can accept and complete them for a small fee When this paper was written more than 195 000 tasks were available on Mechanical Turk 5Such technologies may offer suitable possibilities for the public sector Microtask a Finnish cloud labor company maintains Digitalkoot a program that helps the Finnish National Library convert its image archives into digital text and correct existing errors It does so with volunteered labor participants simply play a game in which they are shown the image of a word and then must type it out to help a cartoon character cross a bridge In doing so they are turning scanned images into searchable text greatly improving the search accuracy of old manuscripts 6 At present more than 100 000 people have completed over 6 million microtasks associated with this project 7As the pace of computing power and machine learning increases professors Frank Levy and Richard Murnane contend that more tasks will move from human to computer processing 8 Skeptics need look no further than IBM s Watson a computer that can answer questions posed in natural language In February 2011 Watson defeated two all time champions of the quiz show Jeopardy This was not solely a publicity stunt IBM hopes to sell Watson to hospitals and call centers to help them answer questions from the public 9Around the globe more and more governments are looking to increase telework among employees In 2010 the U S government passed legislation calling for more telework opportunities for government employees Likewise the Australian government in order to attract and retain information and communications technology workers instituted a teleworking policy in 2009 requiring agencies to implement flexible work plans 10 Other countries including Norway and Germany are also focusing on flexible work arrangements to improve public sector recruiting 11 In Canada the government has an official telework policy that recognizes changes are occurring in the public service workforce with a shift towards more knowledge workers and encourages departments to implement telework arrangements 12Cloud definitionsCloud computing Internet based computing whereby shared resources software and information are provided to computers and other devices on demand like

be surged to provide services to government agencies on demand GovLabSource Frank Levy and Richard J Murnane The New Division of Labor How Computers are Creating the Next Job Market Princeton Princeton University Press 2004 p 50 Figure 1 Trends in routine and non routine tasks in the U S 1960 200213These are all powerful steps in the right direction for employees whose natural work rhythms are not locked into 9 to 5 Some companies have taken telework one step further British Telecom is pushing the concept of agile working through its Workstyle Project where employees decide what work arrangements best suit them rather than a rigid definition by location and hours BT Workstyle is one of the largest flexible working projects in Europe with over 11 000 home based workers BT has found that its home enabled employees are on average 20 percent more productive than their office based colleagues 14Similarly U S electronics retailer Best Buy experimented with a Results Only Work Environment ROWE In a ROWE what matters is not whether employees are in their office but rather that they complete their work and achieve measurable outcomes In a ROWE salaried employees must put in as much time as is actually needed to do their work no more no less The decline in routine and manual tasks and the rise of new ways of working is not isolated to the private sector In 1950 the U S federal workforce largely comprised clerks performing repetitive tasks About 62 percent performed these tasks while only 11 percent performed more white collar work By 2000 those relationships were reversed Fifteen percent performed repetitive tasks compared to 56 percent in the white collar categories 16 Similarly in 1944 the number of workers in the UK civil service considered industrial totaled 505 000 By 2003 this number fell to 18 200 with non industrial workers reaching 538 000 in 2004 17 And in Canada in 2006 knowledge based workers represented 58 percent of federal workers in the Core Public Administration up from 41 percent 11 years earlier 18The swelling ranks of non industrial government workers indicate a shift in public sector jobs toward creative collaborative and complex work The workforce structure however designed for clerks of the last century remains largely the same With limited flexibility to distribute resources governments often address change by creating new agencies and programs This can be seen following major events like the outbreaks of the Avian flu and SARs in the past decade 9 11 and the financial crisis of 2008 Source United States Office of Personnel Management A Fresh Start for Federal Pay A Case for Modernization April 2002 p 5 http www opm gov strategiccomp whtpaper pdfFigure 2 The changing U S federal workforce 1950 200015Given increasing budgetary pressures and burgeoning national debts the conventional model of creating new agencies or permanent structures in response to new challenges is unsustainable This is exacerbated by our inability to accurately predict future needs and trends Consider a 1968 Business Week article proclaiming that the Japanese auto industry isn t likely to carve out a big share of the market for itself or the president of Digital Equipment Corporation who in 1977 said t here is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home 19The world is full of experts who attempt to predict the future and fail 20Instead of endeavoring to predict the future governments can choose to create a flexible workforce that can quickly adapt to future work requirements To accomplish this the government can learn from a game changing concept in the technology world cloud computing Major organizations and small startups alike increase their flexibility by sharing storage space information and resources in a cloud allowing them to quickly scale resources up and down as needed Why not apply the cloud model to people The creation of a government wide human cloud could provide significant benefits including A cloud based government workforce or GovCloud could include workers who perform a range of creative problem focused work Rather than being slotted into any single government agency cloud workers would be true government wide employees This section outlines the organizational structure of the GovCloud model which rests on three main pillars a cloud of government workers thin executive agencies and shared services Most government workforce models tend to constrain workers by isolating them in separate agencies Consider the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom and the subsequent slaughter of more than 6 million pigs sheep and cattle The problem of an impacted food supply is complicated In most countries multiple agencies focus on agriculture food production and public health In the United Kingdom the army and even tourism ministries were impacted by the outbreak as agencies became overwhelmed by the number of animals in need of disposal and by the cordoning off of tourist areas to prevent the spread of the disease Yet the structure of government agencies often confines employees to work in information silos creating inherent operational inefficiencies In a cloud workforce model experts in each area could be pulled together to support remedies and propose coordinated corrective measures I want someone saying Did you know that the Ministry of Justice is doing that or could you piggy back on what the communities department is doing or had you thought about doing it in this way You ve got to get away from thinking about centralized command and control Dame Helen Ghosh Permanent Secretary UK Home Office 21The FedCloud modelThe GovCloud model could become a new pillar of government comprising permanent employees who undertake a wide variety of creative problem focused work As needed the GovCloud model could also take advantage of those outside government including citizens looking for extra part time work full time contractors and individual consultants Cloud workers would vary in background and expertise but would exhibit traits of free agent workers self sufficient self motivated employees who exhibit a strong loyalty to teams colleagues and clients Daniel Pink author of Drive The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us argues that 33 million Americans one quarter of the workforce already operate as free agents 22According to the white paper Lessons of the Great Recession from Swiss staffing company Adecco contingent workers those who chose non traditional employment arrangements23 are expected to eventually make up about 25 percent of the global workforce 24These more autonomous workers according to Pink are better suited to 21st century work and are more productive even without traditional monetary incentives 25The fluid nature of the cloud can provide significant benefits The nature of the cloud teams forming and dissolving as their tasks require encourages workers to focus on specific project outcomes rather than ongoing operations Thin agency structures could lead to Greater use of shared services could allow the federal government to The need to support some ongoing missions will remain of course These missions will be carried out by thin agencies Under the cloud concept federal agencies would remain focused on specific missions and ongoing oversight These agencies however would become thinner as many of their knowledge workers transfer into the cloud Thin agencies could also create opportunities to streamline organizations with overlapping missions Employees working in thin agencies could fall into two main categories GovCloud could change the highest levels of public sector workers as we know them today The Senior Executive Service in the United States Permanent Secretaries and Directors General in the United Kingdom and Australia all such senior officials could rotate between agencies shared services and the cloud which would reflect the original intent behind many of these high level offices giving executives a breadth of experience in roles across government to help develop shared values and a broad perspective An important benefit of rotation would be the ability to tap into cloud networks to assemble high performing teams To further focus agencies on specific missions many of their back office support functions could be pulled into government wide shared service arrangements The use of shared services in government has come and gone in waves usually dictated by fiscal necessity Most countries in Europe as part of their e government strategies have placed increased focus of late on developing shared services whether through an executive agency or a CIO as well as working with EU coordination activities And while the decentralized governments of some EU countries such as Germany make shared services more difficult these countries are using states and agencies to pilot innovative approaches 27Other efforts around the world include the U S e Government Act of 2002 which examined how technology could be used to cut costs and improve services More recently the New Zealand government appointed an advisory group in May 2011 to explore public sector reform to improve services and provide better value In their report Better Public Services the advisory group recommended the use of shared services to improve effectiveness in a variety of government settings including policy advice and real estate 29 Following up on this three New Zealand agencies the Department of the Prime Minister the State Services Commission and the Treasury announced in December 2011 that they would share such corporate functions as human resources and information technology 30 And though shared services in Western Australia were shut down other projects in South Australia are moving ahead and already showing savings 31In August 2011 the government of Canada announced the launch of Shared Services Canada a program that seeks to streamline and identify savings in information technology Among its first targets is something as mundane as email But with more than 100 different email systems being used by government employees the potential savings and boost to efficiency could be significant Not only do these incompatible systems cost money by requiring individual departments to negotiate and maintain separate licenses and technical support it also makes it difficult for government employees to communicate with one another and with the public And with no single standard ensuring the security of information transmitted over email becomes more challenging Shared Services Canada will move the government to one email system as well as consolidate data centers and networks ultimately looking for anticipated savings of between CA 100 million and CA 200 million annually 28While the idea of using shared services is not a novel one it is central to the GovCloud model The GovCloud model envisions building upon effective practices and those shared services already in operation to deliver services like human resources information technology finance and acquisitions government wide Workers in these shared services would include subject matter experts in areas like human resources and information technology as well as generalists who support routine business functions The potential for shared services continues to grow As seen with IBM s Watson and Microtask s Digitalkoot new technologies provide an opportunity to accelerate the automated delivery of basic services Some agencies already have begun capitalizing on these trends For example NASA has moved its shared service center website to a secure government cloud facilitating greater employee self service and helping to reduce demand on finite call center resources 32This decision tool is designed to help leaders determine which employees are appropriate for each of the three structures in the GovCloud model the cloud thin agencies and shared services To the cloud GovCloud Project LifecycleManaging employees in the cloud will require governments to reinvent human resource management Individual and team performance evaluations career development pay structures and benefits and pensions would need to change to support GovCloud This section examines possibilities for HR reinvention including performance management career development workplace flexibility and benefits Employees working in the cloud would require an alternative to determine pay and career advancement The government could take its cues from the gaming world and evaluate cloud workers with a point system The manager as we know it will disappear to be replaced by a new sort of business operative whose expertise is assembling the right people for particular projects Daniel Pink author of Free Agent Nation 33An HR management system that incorporates the accumulation of experience points XP through effective work on cloud projects training education and professional certifications could replace the tenure centric models for cloud employees As employees accumulate XP they could level up and take on additional responsibilities in future projects Workers in the cloud could earn XP in four ways After some high profile incidents slow responses to outbreaks of foot and mouth disease flooding that may have been preventable and a farming subsidy system that seemed to result in more chaos than aid the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs DEFRA was looking to reinvent itself In 2006 the department launched DEFRA Renew One of its key goals was to bring the department s policymaking closer to actual delivery to create more responsive processes Organized mainly by policy with fixed teams DEFRA had been unable to redeploy resources as needed in response to a crisis As part of DEFRA Renew a new operating model was implemented that used flexible resourcing where staff were assigned to specific projects for fixed periods This allowed management to measure and build the required capabilities and competencies needed and to allocate resources efficiently to improve overall service quality New roles were also created to support sustainable staff development and resource management in the new model To create buy in for such a fundamental culture shift within the department a facilitative approach to decision making was employed Change management programs and mentoring were extended to all levels of the department including leadership New mechanisms such as approval panels for resources and the use of business cases also worked to push changes among staff and promote collaborative behavior DEFRA Renew was widely recognized as a key enabler in the department meeting required efficiency improvement targets set by the UK government DEFRA moved to a more project based approach with fewer staff in core teams According to Dame Helen Ghosh former Permanent Secretary of DEFRA they could be more responsive now that the management board won t be made up of director generals with individual policy silos 34Just as XP could be gained through learning new skills it could be lost in the following three ways Any serious discussion about creating a new class of government employees requires a fresh look at employee benefits and compensation For example XP could be used to help determine workers salaries but additional research into alternative pension and benefit programs is needed While any discussion on compensation could be contentious a healthy debate among stakeholders from across the government should be welcomed As new roles emerge in the cloud so too could new career paths Career emphasis could move away from time served in a particular pay grade and toward milestones that are meaningful for employee development Each worker may have different career aspirations For instance not all workers aspire to management some may seek to master a particular subject area instead Career advancement in the cloud would not equate to moving up a ladder but rather moving along a lattice Lattice GovCloud ModelHere s how the lattice could work for Ian who we met in the introduction Think of the lattice as a jungle gym The best opportunities to broaden your experience may be lateral or even down Look every which way and swing to opportunities Pattie Sellers Fortune editor at largeCathleen Benko and Molly Anderson the authors of The Corporate Lattice argue that the corporate ladder is giving way to a lattice that accommodates flatter more networked organizations improves the integration of career and life focuses on competencies rather than tenure and helps increase workforce loyalty 35 The lattice metaphor allows employees to choose many ways to get ahead It is unlikely that all workers will thrive in the new GovCloud environment right out of the gate As such it would be important to assess a worker s readiness before placing her in GovCloud and providing training on core competencies critical to cloud success There could also be opportunities to start workers especially those at earlier stages of a career within an agency or shared service to build up expertise in some area before graduating to the cloud Once in the cloud new workers could be paired with mentors who are more experienced to help navigate the cloud experience itself There should be an emphasis on continuous learning in the cloud It would be important for cloud workers to continue to refine their skills develop additional expertise and adapt to new ways of working Not only could continuous learning affect workers career mobility by increasing the depth and breadth of their skills but it could also impact their salary and level by increasing their XP Learning and development in the cloud could take on many themes of next learning Next learning focuses on creating personalized learning experiences that leverage the latest technologies and collaborative communities to deliver education and learning programs that build knowledge bases and promote learning as a focus and passion not just a checkbox in a career 36To broaden cloud worker skills and the ability to handle multiple tasks and work on a variety of projects cloud learning could include the following principles 37In the cloud careers and expertise will be built in new ways and work will be something we do rather than a place we go to As such the cloud will give workers more control over their schedules and workloads By creating a flexible workplace governments could shed a significant amount of physical infrastructure and create shared workspaces Many buildings could be converted into co located spaces teams could use collaboration spaces or videoconferencing centers Some workers might rarely set foot in a government building instead conducting cloud tasks at home and interacting with project teams virtually With advancing communications and mobile technology distance no longer hinders collaboration It no longer matters whether all workers are at an office between 9 a m and 5 p m what matters is whether project teams produce results and whether everyone contributes A more flexible workplace could also take advantage of resources governments might not otherwise have access to Some retiring workers may not want to quit working altogether and a flexible model could be an enticing way to keep their expertise on retainer Alternatively the model could take advantage of would be government employees unwilling to relocate or unable to work a regular schedule By increasing flexibility governments could increase their available resource pool allowing agencies to access the skills and knowledge they need when they need it For an example of how a retiree could interact with the cloud see Appendix C National Security Case Study Don t think governments will ever take to the cloud At the U S Department of State the idea could soon be a reality The Office of eDiplomacy is preparing to pilot a cloud component to its e internship model for American students as part of the Virtual Student Foreign Service VSFS beginning this year The VSFS currently offers e internships to U S university students of multiple month duration By using a new micro volunteering platform State Department offices and embassies around the world will be able to create non classified tasks that take anywhere from a couple of minutes to a couple of days to complete Each task will be tagged by region and or issue and will automatically populate the profiles of students who have indicated those interests Students can then select the tasks that interest them the most or that fit into their schedule To see that the most pressing work is performed first offices and embassies will be able to prioritize their tasks so critical items appear at the top of the queue Imagine a small embassy preparing for a high profile multilateral meeting The preparations for such an event could be daunting for a small staff The power of the cloud could augment an individual embassy s capacity to prepare for a major event and ensure that related items are performed ahead of those that are less critical While there are plenty of incentives for participating in the VSFS micro volunteering platform from an impressive line on a student s resume to the chance to make a difference by working on topics of interest thought is being put into how to creatively incent high performance One idea is to simply invoke students competitive spirit Competition could be encouraged by a monthly leader board which results in bragging rights and potentially even a low cost but high impact reward Transparency is also key to competition with ratings available to State Department staff and other cloud interns and the ability to make short thank you notes from embassies publicly available interns would be keen to make a good impression The potential applications of this type of program are significant Imagine if offices throughout the State Department could tap into the language and cultural expertise of the thousands of foreign national staff members around the globe Providing a platform for those employees to contribute even a small amount of time to discreet tasks that require their expertise could unlock a world of knowledge 38Creating the GovCloud model will require bold leadership and the ideas and initiatives of entrepreneurial executives While a GovCloud model may be years in the making agencies can begin adopting cloud concepts today The GovCloud concept is designed to be versatile as well as applicable to a wide range of entities Depending on your organization government executives wishing to employ GovCloud may choose to apply the concept first to a unit before expanding to other branches or divisions entire agencies or the whole of government Often GovCloud principles are most effectively implemented as part of a larger reform program within a particular agency as with the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs Renew program as described earlier in this report On a smaller scale the UK Cabinet Office used flexible resourcing FR in its Economic Reform Group ERG with a staff of about 400 as part of its cost reduction plans Using a simple database that it had developed and a strong program of communications FR is now used and embraced by all core ERG employees with strong clear ownership from the top another key implementation factor Says Ian Watmore the UK Cabinet Office s former permanent secretary FR means we are able to deploy people much more quickly to priority projects 40Figure 3 outlines how GovCloud can apply to a variety of organizations Most government workforces haven t undergone a broad restructuring in decades In that time the world has been transformed by computers the Internet and mobile communications To respond to a variety of challenges governments have created scores of new organizations However in today s world of budget cuts and increased fiscal scrutiny the constant creation of new permanent structures is not sustainable The GovCloud model could offer a new way to use government resources A cloud of government wide workers could coalesce into project based teams to solve problems and separate when their work is done This could allow governments to concentrate resources when and where they are needed By using this model in conjunction with thinner agencies and shared services governments can reduce back office redundancies and let agencies focus on their core missions This model capitalizes on the work preferences of Millennials the future government workforce who value career growth over job security or compensation 41 The GovCloud model allows employees to gain a variety of experiences in a shorter amount of time and to self select their career direction To support GovCloud governments could establish the processes by which cloud teams would form work and dissolve New ways to evaluate performance and help workers gain skills and build careers should be considered Today s employee classification system stresses job descriptions and time in service this could be transformed with an XP model that emphasizes the individual s ownership of his or her career The GovCloud model will undoubtedly be controversial Many stakeholders from governing bodies to public employee unions must weigh in to shape the future government workforce The transition to a cloud model will not happen overnight or maybe even in the next five years but the conversation starts today Charlie Tierney is a Manager in Deloitte Consulting LLP s Federal Human Capital Practice and a former GovLab Fellow He

be discussed at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires Will its impact be the same across the globe What jobs will be most affected What new skillsets will be required But above all how can governments prepare and what role can Multilateral Development Banks play All four leading regional development banks recently came together in Washington to present some key perspectives regarding the jobs of the future which can be found in the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives Here are a few worth considering On the one hand Emerging Europe Developing Asia Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean are witnessing how robotics automation and artificial intelligence are lowering costs and increasing productivity providing an opportunity for accelerated growth Countries like Estonia have taken the lead in digital technology youth in Nigeria and Ethiopia are harnessing technology to boost yields in agriculture in Vietnam and Bangladesh Information and Communication Technologies ICT is boosting the service industry and across Latin America and the Caribbean smartphone adoption is expected to reach beyond 70 by 2020 On the other hand as a result of this new wave of technological advances known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution a series of myths emerge that it is important to clarify Myth 1 All regions will be impacted in the same way The truth is that technology will be adopted at varying speeds depending on the region s economic development and demographic trends An aging population in Emerging Europe will face different challenges than Africa where 12 to 15 million young people enter the job market each year Myth 2 Mass unemployment is unavoidable The truth is that the jobless rate will be lower than originally expected Mass unemployment is unlikely to become a reality But the shifts in job opportunities will certainly require flexibility and access to new training tools which may in turn be provided by technology itself Myth 3 Automation will replace all human jobs and tasks The truth is that automation only takes place where it is both technically and economically feasible A human workforce will still be required in most sectors particularly those such as health and education At the same time it would be foolish to ignore the genuine threats of unemployment and increased income inequality that the rapid expansion of new technology will generate Above all as Multilateral Development Banks the question we need to be asking is how can governments ease the transition What can governments do to ensure that the largest number of people possible benefit from this transition Policymakers can take four actions to ease the adoption of technology while mitigating potentially adverse effects on jobs and incomes Multilateral Development Banks certainly have their own role to play not only by acting as think tanks for initiatives on how to capitalize on new technologies and mitigate their negative effects but also in coordinating global or regional policy responses strengthening partnerships between policymakers and employers to jointly identify and address challenges Our products and services will need to adapt A recent IDB health project in the Dominican Republic which uses drones to link remote rural clinics with hospital laboratories is a prime example of this Change will also take place within our workforce Outsourcing the IDB s human resources department from Washington to Costa Rica to ensure efficiency and reduce costs was certainly a step in the right direction It is important that we take the time to seriously identify the opportunities and risks the 21st century global job market presents so that together we can help shape the future of work In the meantime we must also remain relevant for our customer base and at the forefront of innovation Whether we succeed or not is up to all of us Downlaod the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives hereFiled Under Beyond development effectiveness Tagged

Asamblea de Gobernadores o sus pa ses miembros By Mark Baillie 2018 05 24T09 00 34 143Z BusinessThe British government is keen to recognise the importance of artificial intelligence AI and automation in ensuring the long term future success of UK industry In line with this it has acknowledged that one of its grand challenges is putting the UK at the forefront of the AI and data revolution In fact comments from Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond have suggested that large swathes of government activity will soon be performed by AI and automation to free up time for human civil servants Automating some aspects of government jobs will result in savings and efficiencies However there are concerns that public sector workers will be at risk of losing their jobs to AI and automation in the next decade Think tank Reform estimated early last year that 250 000 of the UK s five million public sector workers risk losing jobs to AI and automation in the next 15 years Speaking to a House of Lords committee in 2017 Hammond said The government is looking at how it can apply artificial intelligence There are very significant areas of government activity which involve relatively low level decision making which will be highly susceptible to AI probably over a relatively short period of time which does present the tantalising possibility of being able to drive some real productivity enhancement in the delivery of government processes The truth is that automation in the public sector is already developing at a rapid pace New initiatives range from implementing AI and automation into day to day bureaucratic tasks such as form filling and applying for patents to using facial recognition technologies to verify the identity of individuals entering the UK But it s time to stop viewing AI and automation as an existential threat to our livelihoods Far from replacing people AI and automation will transform the workplace as menial tasks and some non routine jobs are digitalised through AI and process automation enabling greater efficiency while taking away some of the strain of day to day tasks In its industrial strategy report the UK government rightly realised we are at one of the most important exciting and challenging times in the history of global enterprise Importantly that report highlights that Britain is well placed to benefit from this new Industrial Revolution This digital revolution will be powered by humans increasing reliance on AI and automation Set to impact almost every sector of British industry AI and automation is here to stay Organisations are turning to digital transformation to boost innovation and enhance user experience and AI and automation will play a major role in this change While some jobs may disappear or evolve along the road to automation there is considerable opportunity for innovation and change AI and automation can give government departments both at the national and local level much faster access to sophisticated insights Combining this technology and big data will allow them to make better decisions more quickly for a greater number of citizens This ability to rapidly adapt to and drive new innovations is part of what allowed Britain to prosper and develop so quickly during the first industrial revolution After all as the government goes on to note in the industrial strategy report We are an open enterprising economy built on invention innovation and competition We have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business with high standards respected institutions and the reliable rule of law We have achieved near historic levels of employment We are a crossing point for the world because of our geographic position the English language our strong ties our openness to ideas and our vibrant culture Driving an automated future offers a wide range of benefits Not least is the prospect of boosting productivity across all of Britain s leading industries from high tech post industrial manufacturing through to the creative industries sector The UK s industrial strategy has already identified the four grand challenges in the years ahead as artificial intelligence and big data clean growth the future of mobility and meeting the needs of an ageing society Astute investments in AI and automation can enable huge productivity boosts UK consumers are already beginning to recognise that more organisations are embracing this technology and the advantages it can offer including within the public sector In fact after surveying 2 000 UK consumers on their attitudes towards AI and automation in government last year OpenText found that two thirds of UK citizens 66 per cent believe this technology will be introduced into government services within 20 years with 16 per cent claiming that this could happen in the next two years The same poll revealed less fear and uncertainty about the introduction of AI and automation in government than many headlines suggest The majority of those surveyed were not concerned about the implementation of this technology in government with over a quarter 26 per cent going as far as claiming AI and automated technologies would be able to make better decisions than most elected representatives though they would prefer for final decisions to be made by a human Many respondents recognised the immediate benefits of the technology A fifth 20 per cent felt that updating processes by bringing in AI and automation would lead to less admin and form filling Additionally 24 per cent pinpointed reduced waiting times as a major advantage while 19 per cent thought that there would be fewer errors in government as a result of the effective implementation of AI and automation This research shows increasing acceptance of AI and automation as a method to improve services but Britain still has some way to go to fully embrace its potential The UK ranked lowest 16 per cent across the countries surveyed when asked if AI and automated technology would be working in government in the next five years showing more hesitance around its uptake than countries such as France 24 per cent the Netherlands 28 per cent and the USA 22 per cent AI and automation will transform the workplace and bring a wide range of benefits to all sectors including the public sector With the potential to increase the speed efficiency and effectiveness of a wide range of government services AI and automated technologies cannot be ignored While the technology already exists the key challenge over the next few years will be gaining trust amongst both public sector employees and British citizens Mark Baillie director public sector UK Ireland OpenText Image Credit Razum ShutterstockSign up below to

surrounding the future of work In public political movements throughout the western world have seen populist campaigners railing against the threat to jobs from low wage migrants entering a country and outsourcing to low cost regions by multinationals What hasn t really been touched on is the impact automation might have on jobs in the future What began with the famous study from Oxford University academics Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne back in 2013 which highlighted the huge number of white and blue collar jobs that could be disrupted by automation has progressed to growing interest from governments around the world For instance a report by the British government s Science Technology Select Committee into AI examined the issue from a range of aspects from ethics to employment Watch on Forbes This was followed by a second report from the Chief Scientific Advisor to the British government which looked at the possible benefits to the state of an AI driven world in areas such as tax collection Further afield you have a recent report from the United Nations that looked at the disruptive possibilities of automation in the labor market It suggested that for now at least most of the disruption from automation will be in routine tasks and therefore the biggest impact will be in the developing world rather than the developed world Automation In AmericaDespite the rhetoric from the President elect it s perhaps no surprise that the White House has a view on this topic too and a recent report from the President s Council of Economic Advisors highlights the significant impact on professions such as driving What each of these reports have in common is their advocated response to the threat of automation All highlight the growing importance of education and the ability of people to adapt quickly to changes in the labor market We should not advance a policy that is premised on giving up on the possibility of workers remaining employed the White House paper says Our goal should be first and foremost to foster the skills training job search assistance and other labor market institutions to make sure people can get into jobs This is important because history tells us that technology and automation tend to create more jobs than they destroy but we don t tend to know what those jobs are yet Indeed the U S Department of Labor predicted a few years ago that around 65 of school children today will be employed in jobs that don t yet exist A Glass Half FullIt s also important because there is a backlash against globalization at the moment that is easy to imagine transferring its ire towards technology in the coming years The merits of globalization were quite aptly described by British economist Henry Martyn back in the 1700s He used the analogy of technological innovation to make his point and suggested that by using a tool a sawmill in his case we could perform the work of 30 men with the labor of two men Now of course we could employ those 30 men instead but that would be a waste of human resources The same is true for most technologies and whilst most would surely agree that technology is a force for good it s not an assumption that can be guaranteed Martyn went on to compare this with globalization and suggested that if another country can produce textiles for instance more efficiently than we can then it is akin to having a new technology to do likewise and we should jump at such an opportunity and instead deploy our resources to trade with that nation in areas that we can excel A Measured ResponseWhilst the White House report makes a number of measured responses including greater funding for adult education and an expanded welfare safety net the response of the new Trump administration is much less certain Whilst he currently blames immigration and free trade for the loss of jobs in America it s easy to imagine him flip flopping his attention onto automation if machines represent a more attractive target for him In reality the answers are largely the same in both instances whether it s providing greater support for lifelong learning supporting people to move where the jobs are and so on These responses do necessitate some action on behalf of those that are disrupted by technology however It s not enough to blame an external actor and hope to roll back change it requires one to take control and strive to learn the skills that give you a chance in the labor market This is a topic I ve covered a few times and whilst there is a growing appreciation for the urgency of such measures I can t help but feel that governments around the world are asleep at the wheel For more visit adigaskell org I am a free range human who believes that the future already exists if we know where to look From the bustling Knowledge Quarter in London it is my mission in life t From TV shows like Black Mirror to McKinsey Oxford OECD and Brookfield Institute studies many views of the impact of technology particularly automation on the future of jobs and society is bleak We are told stories of automation that will eliminate broad swaths of jobs opening up opportunity for some and having catastrophic effects for others like non college educated workers Brookfield Institute s The Talented Mr Robot 2016 estimates that nearly 42 of the employed Canadian labour force is at a high risk 70 or higher probability of being affected by automation over the next 10 to 20 years Some speculate like futurist Thomas Frey 2014 that hundreds of new types of jobs resulting from emerging technologies capabilities and needs will emerge to employ those people NESTA predicts that around one tenth of the workforce are in occupations that are likely to grow as a percentage of the workforce Around one fifth are in occupations that will likely shrink This latter figure is much lower than recent studies of automation have suggested This means that roughly seven in ten people are currently in jobs where we simply cannot know for certain what will happen It is clear there is not a consensus on what the overall job loss or creation impact of emerging technologies could be with wide ranging estimates of across sectors Further while predictions for job loss like these abound there are far fewer organizations working on envisioning the future of work and the jobs of the future that will employ the workforce of the future as current jobs are changed by automation and other emerging technologies This is where I ve focused my research with my digitalHKS research fellowship Since January 2018 I ve been collaborating with Bill Eggers and Amrita Datar from the Deloitte Center for Government insights to humanize the future of work and visualize the impact of technology on jobs to empower organizations employees and individuals to create a more positive future This week at MIT s EmTech NEXT Conference Bill and I debuted some of the early products and methods we ve developed together including a Future of Government Work Gallery Walk This gallery walk featured four government jobs of the future depicted through futuristic art text and storytelling including Child Aid Coordinators of the future are smart connected and always prepared the deliver on their mission protecting vulnerable children They safeguard the rights of children and intervene in cases of abuse neglect or ill treatment Garrison Commander of the future uses analytical software virtual reality training tools and secure communications to ensure a smoothly functional military installation that service members family members and civilian employees are proud to call home Mobility Platform Managers of their future and their teams are responsible for managing the city s integrated multimodal transportation network and ensuring the seamless movement of people and vehicles They supervise advanced AI systems that power the mobility platform Public Health and Safety Guardians of the future use the power of data cognitive technologies and their public health expertise to protect the health and safety of citizens The Gallery Walk exhibition seeks to invite observers to consider how emerging technologies will enable government work to become more impactful and productive increase decision making capability and better support the overall wellbeing of the employee while focusing on the core building block of the future of work the individual person doing the job The exhibition seeks to humanize the work transformation we might expect to see by 2025 This work demonstrates that not only new jobs will be created but some existing jobs will change in very real ways that we also need to be prepared for It also provides a story that both employees and employers can relate to in order to help encourage real discussion about these futures and enable people to visualize how they might start to approach those possible destinations Our work reverses the current tendency to go from generalizations about changing technology to assumptions about broad job classifications and instead starts with specifics about particular jobs for a more concrete understanding of what could happen in the workplace The Gallery Walk is just a taste of what we re working on We ve been busy developing content examples of jobs of the future and a method for developing jobs of the future and engagement approaches such as workshops and the gallery walk to encourage engagement and discussion around that content Developing proactive and productive tools for designing the future of work is both timely and important According to McKinsey 375 million workers or roughly 14 percent of the global workforce may need to switch occupational categories as digitization automation and advances in artificial intelligence disrupt the world of work In terms of magnitude it s akin to coping with the large scale shift from agricultural work to manufacturing that occurred in the early 20th century in North America and Europe and more recently in China The task confronting every economy particularly advanced economies will likely be to retrain and redeploy tens of millions of mid career middle age workers As the MGI report notes there are few precedents in which societies have successfully re trained such large numbers of people Both employers and employees will need to own their continued education and skill development in order to fill the jobs of the future Thus employers and employees will need to be given tools to envision the jobs of the future in a more visceral way so we can move towards them as a realistic destination Today society has an opportunity to design a better future given the transformation in jobs and way of working that is coming a future where workers aren t just more productive but where their individual well being is better cared for in a job Emerging technologies will change existing jobs as well as create brand new ones It will affect almost everyone you me our family our neighbors Its time humanize the discussion to one beyond an economic discussion about workforce and labour The individual people that will be affected by this change should also be engaged in this discussion The content and engagement approaches that I ve been developing through my digitalHKS fellowship in partnership with Deloitte are a few ways I believe we can start increasing the diversity of voices in the discussion about the future of work You can hear more about our call to put people back at the center of the future of work discussion in the talk I delivered at EmTech NEXT here https events technologyreview com video watch jenn gustetic harvard people future work Powered by SquarespaceEditor s Note Facing the Future of Work Facing the Future of Work In the last few years it has felt like every big election has focused on jobs and the threats they supposedly face from trade from immigrants and most accurately from technology No wonder Until recently the forecasts were almost unanimously grim The robots were coming we were told and they d soon make us humans redundant In the summer of 2015 the Atlantic captured the panic with a cover story titled A World Without Work which warned that the moment when machines make workers obsolete may finally be arriving Then on March 18 of this year a self driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Tempe Arizona and the conversation began to shift Suddenly the fear that humans would soon be superfluous started to seem a little less likely Around the same time the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released a new study that gave intellectual and statistical heft to this idea Yes automation will supplant some workers the report found But not nearly as many as we once thought and not nearly as soon As a result what exactly we should expect work to look like in the future has now become a lot more complicated and the discussions about it much more nuanced Which is why Foreign Policy has devoted this special issue to making sense of the emerging reality While the questions still outnumber the answers a few themes have started to surface As Molly Kinder argues in Learning to Work With Robots new technologies will create both winners and losers Artificial intelligence won t eliminate human labor in some cases it will even produce new jobs But automation is rapidly changing the nature of work and governments must help workers adapt Ryan Avent explores this idea further In Then They Came for the Lawyers he shows how manual laborers won t be the only ones forced to contend with a shifting workplace AI will also change the lives of doctors teachers and other professionals Adaptation is key but it s not the only task ahead of us In Protect Yourself Before You Wreck Yourself Michael Lind warns that retraining workers won t be enough governments must also reshape their trade policies to reflect the new era Of course despite the new developments and the strategies meant to deal with them automation still poses plenty of risks In Closing the Factory Doors Christina Larson shows how automated factories by replacing human textile and other light manufacturing workers may deprive poor nations of a traditional route out of poverty But the key point is that the news is far from uniformly bad FP s Ravi Agrawal shows how the much criticized gig economy is proving a boon for the developing world see Why India Gives Uber 5 Stars And as FP s Rhys Dubin reminds us in There s No Such Thing as a Stable Career constant change has been a fact of life for as long as there has been work to do just ask lectors and longshoremen Indeed just about the only factor that has remained the same is humans ability to adjust to new circumstances and generally make their lives better in the process Big changes are coming and plenty of them But there s no reason to think we won t weather them in typical fashion by working smart and working hard Jonathan Tepperman

business and economics research arm of McKinsey Company Published October 29 2018The SpotMini robot trapped in a room with its mate looks uncannily like a dog well maybe a mutant dog with a canary yellow body and a proboscis sticking out where its head should be The robot confidently scurries to the door raises itself to the perfect height and then uses its appendage to press down the handle Pulling open the door the robot allows its mate to be first across the threshold before the two of them make their dash for freedom Such is the content of a short video by Boston Dynamics that has gone viral since it was released in February Reactions to it on social media have ranged from amusement soon they ll be opening our fridges and stealing our beer to alarm this is how we die It is the latest evidence of recent remarkable advances in robotics and artificial intelligence robots can now perform backflips and ride bicycles and machines empowered by AI are able to analyze X ray images better than expert radiologists and to teach themselves to play the ancient game of Go better than world champions Yet the dog clip is also powerful because it conjures up a more worrisome vision of robots on the loose beyond the control of us humans Thus it plays into a powerful angst laden contemporary narrative about technology and the future of work and maybe even of mankind itself What really are the risks from this new wave of technology And will the opportunities these advances bring with them outweigh those risks To address such questions about the future it is useful indeed necessary to look to the past Technology has for centuries both excited the human imagination and prompted fears about the effects Back in 1589 Queen Elizabeth I of England refused to grant a patent to a stocking frame invented by one William Lee because Her Majesty was concerned about the effect of the contraption on the livelihoods of those who knitted stockings by hand The Luddite weavers in Britain and silk workers in Lyons France famously staged revolts in the early 19th century against new automated looms that threatened their skilled and well paid jobs And in the realm of fiction imagination has run riot since the Czech writer Karel Capek coined the word robot from a Slavic word for work in his 1920 play Rossum s Universal Robots a k a RUR which ends with the destruction of mankind As one of Capek s characters explains Robots are not people Mechanically they are more perfect than we are they have an enormously developed intelligence but they have no soul Almost a century later that same concern about soulless hyper intelligence infuses not just movies like The Matrix and mind bending video series like Philip K Dick s Electric Dreams but also warnings about AI and its potential consequences expressed by Elon Musk and the late Stephen Hawking among others Back in the 1950s the German philosopher Martin Heidegger fretted about the risk that humans would become enslaved by the technologies we rely on With the rise of machines able to mimic many human traits from speech albeit still falteringly to facial recognition already significantly more accurately than humans that time appears to be much closer Yet when we switch from philosophy to economics we find a very different story a long historical record of innovation that shows technological change has been overwhelmingly positive for productivity and surprisingly benign when it comes to employment Job displacement has occurred in waves first with the structural shift from agriculture to manufacturing and then with the move from manufacturing to services Throughout productivity gains generated by new technology have been reinvested and the GDP bounce from that productivity eventually raises consumption and on balance increases the demand for labor In McKinsey s research we have sought to quantify this trend and its net impact in several ways For example we looked at the very big picture what happened to employment as productivity grew over the past 50 years We found no tradeoff between the two for 100 percent of continuous 10 year periods in the United States technologically driven productivity gains have gone hand in hand with rising employment Even when measured in one year snapshots productivity and employment have risen together four years in five The personal computer provides an iconic case to support the compatibility of technological progress with job growth We measured how many jobs were lost and how many gained in the United States between 1980 and 2015 as a result of the diffusion of computer technology Several hundred thousand bookkeepers and auditing clerks secretaries and typists did lose their jobs But the overall balance was strongly positive the desktop laptop computer created more than 19 million jobs in industries ranging from computer hardware to enterprise software to online retail sales against the loss of about 3 5 million jobs a net gain of 15 7 million That figure amounts to 18 percent of all the net U S employment created in the period almost one in five jobs Something similar happened with the invention of the automobile which destroyed the horse and buggy business but gave rise to a wealth of new sometimes unimagined products from petroleum based synthetic rubber to motels That said we ignore those left along the way at our peril For the many workers who are displaced painful transitions are a reality In Britain during the industrial revolution starting in about 1800 wages of the masses stagnated for almost a half century despite a strong surge in productivity that enriched the owners of capital a phenomenon often referred to as Engels pause because it was first noted by the German philosopher who co authored with Karl Marx The Communist Manifesto Wages picked up again as the fruits of productivity gains eventually trickled down to workers But eventually can be a long time the Luddites fears were not entirely unfounded And once again today the link between productivity gains and wage growth seems bent if not broken U S median hourly compensation rose only 11 percent from 1973 to 2016 even as hourly labor productivity grew by 75 percent While it is natural to focus on labor displacement through technology one element often overlooked in the discussion of the future of work is the number of jobs that are neither lost nor gained but fundamentally changed for reasons that are hard to predict History again provides some examples When ATMs became as common as vending machines in the 1970s the number of bank tellers actually increased That s because the new technology reduced the costs of processing individual transactions giving the banks incentives to open more branches to meet local demand for other financial services The tellers primary tasks changed from cashing checks and taking deposits to providing advice and selling securities mortgages and the like To be sure this tale is not yet complete with the rise of online banking the demand for tellers has again waned and so their numbers have thinned especially after the 2008 financial crisis But modern economies are nothing if not dynamic and the only certainty is change There s a similar story to be told about jobs and information technology Thanks to the internet and some ingenious software anyone can now dig up information at the blink of a cursor Yet the need for data analysis has exploded even as the need for data gathering clerks and the like has plummeted And so the number of information analysts of the genus homo sapiens has quintupled since 1980 to about two million today This largely comforting history isn t much help in determining whether this time will be different To the point the rise of ever more sophisticated technologies especially artificial intelligence that can be brought to bear on any number of tasks is likely to usher in a new age of rapid workforce transitions The McKinsey Global Institute recently estimated that in our fastest automation adoption scenario as many as 375 million workers worldwide or about 14 percent of the global workforce will need to switch occupational categories by 2030 in order to avoid obsolescence Even if the pace of adoption is slower as in our midpoint scenario some 75 million workers will need to switch occupational categories in the next 10 to 15 years Among the work most vulnerable to automation jobs that require routinized physical activity in a predictable setting and collecting and processing data Some aspects of the current technological transformation seem in line with that of previous eras the rise of computers for example and earlier epochs of technical change such as the diffusion of the steam engine that transformed work across multiple sectors of the economy simultaneously Every new wave of automation seems remarkable at the time and AI is not the first technology to chip away at cognitive tasks Since the birth of computerized spreadsheets in the 1980s machines have tackled ever more sophisticated problems that previously required human brainpower Still other aspects of the new technologies do seem qualitatively different from previous waves of innovation The rate of technological change today is strikingly rapid and while hard to measure appears to be accelerating Consider in this regard the development of deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques based on neural networks the exponential increase in computing capacity made available through the cloud and the sheer volume of data that can be generated These advances are driving AI for example enabling the development of autonomous vehicles but also heralding breakthrough applications such as a heightened ability to diagnose disease with non invasive techniques Accordingly the share of jobs that could be automated could also be larger than historical precedents suggest That said we see no evidence to date suggesting that the time it takes for new technologies to be diffused throughout the economy is shrinking Looking at a range of high value technologies over the past 60 years from airbags to MRI machines to smartphones we find that the pace of adoption hasn t changed It still takes between 5 and 16 years to reach 50 percent adoption and 5 to 28 years to reach 80 percent adoption Even highly popular social media applications do not beat this clock Facebook for example was begun in 2004 and had attracted more than 2 2 billion followers 13 years later but the untapped market remains vast Consider too that new technology is rarely applied to a blank canvas a variety of economic and social factors play a big role in determining the pace of adoption They include the cost of developing and deploying the hardware and software labor market dynamics the regulatory environment and social acceptance Computer algorithms in state of the art technology aircraft can do just about anything asked of them without a helping hand but we still insist on humans in the cockpit for peace of mind And who wants to be cared for in a hospital solely by a robot We remain disconcerted by the uncanny valley the term coined by the Japanese robotics guru Masahiro Mori to characterize that unsettling feeling people may experience when facing humanoid robots Indeed for tech luminaries ranging from the MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson to the former Google chairman Eric Schmidt the future of work looks set to be not a tale of machines replacing humans but of machines complementing humans in the workplace The rise of AI and the ascendance of self learned algorithms whose logic can be hard to explain pose some arguably unique problems A recent report from a who s who of experts on the malicious use of AI lists a number of the darkest scenarios from political manipulation through hyper personalized disinformation campaigns to a major increase in sophisticated computer hacking attacks For now AI pioneers including Google DeepMind s chief executive Demis Hassabis are clear that while machines are proving formidable in specific areas such as games we remain a long way away from the time when they will have mastered a general artificial intelligence enabling them to think and act like humans And a number of groups including Stanford University s AI100 with which I am associated are trying to look ahead to study and anticipate how AI will affect the way people live work and play long into the future The challenges here for policymakers and business leaders worldwide are significant We will need to institute retraining of workers on a scale we have not seen for generations We will need to rethink and adapt our social systems to help hundreds of millions of workers affected by the new technologies hopefully handling it better than we have handled globalization in providing both new forms of income and job transition support We will need to find ways to tame the wilder unpredictable side of AI For their part CEOs will need to rethink their organizational structures and processes to take advantage of the technologies and the performance enhancing effects they can have or risk ending up in the recycle bin of business history While all of this may seem intimidating it is still the best way forward We should embrace automation technologies for the productivity benefits they bring even as we deal proactively with the workforce transitions that will accompany adoption Given that demographic trends increased longevity low birth rates are rapidly increasing the dependent population our societies really need that productivity boost Beyond the prosperity and employment these technologies will create there will be other societal benefits new moonshots as we use the power of AI to tackle daunting problems from cancer to climate change We can already see one of the key challenges that of worker retraining or reskilling as some like to call it advancing to the top of the corporate agenda and in some countries also receiving renewed political attention In our recent work on the skills that will be needed by the workforce we found that demand will rise sharply not just for technological skills of all kinds but also for social and emotional skills that is leadership and empathy with customers as well as for higher cognitive skills linked to creativity and complex information processing Business leaders tell us that they believe finding the right talent to help implement automation is critical to their future financial performance and they expect companies to take the lead in the skills upgrade that is required Some firms are already putting in place large scale retraining initiatives AT T is using external education providers including for example Udacity At SAP the German enterprise software company the focus is on in house efforts to create learning journeys for thousands of employees including engineers who need to acquire softer skills as their roles change to service customers directly Walmart has set up more than 100 academies in the United States that provide hands on training for positions that include customer service managers and online grocery pickup While welcome these disparate retraining efforts are barely a start Given the scale of the occupational and skill shifts that we see coming in the next decade much more will need to be done and not just by business Governments and educational establishments working together with philanthropic foundations will of necessity be part of the mix Foundations have the advantage of being able to test innovative programs as pilots and will not face the disadvantage of concern that workers with new skills will subsequently jump ship for a new employer As a starter governments will need to reverse the 20 plus year decline in spending on labor related services no small task in light of tight government budgets and in the United States reflexive opposition to government intervention They will also need to be more flexible in order to adapt to the rapidly changing workplace Mobility is one key yet labor markets have become markedly less dynamic in recent years In the United States for example job reallocation rates have declined by 25 percent since 1990 This is the time to test ideas such as portable benefits that are owned by workers and not tied to particular jobs or companies Technology itself can help facilitate greater mobility especially digital platforms turbocharged by AI that enable matching of people to jobs But we also need to rethink some basic assumptions In order for changing jobs across sectors to become a common practice companies will need to agree on definitions and qualifications for specific skills And a major debate is overdue about credentialing Today higher education encourages the world to judge graduates by their subject knowledge rather than by their skills in problem solving and creative thinking skills that will be especially valuable in an AI enhanced workplace More than anything we need to prepare for this new era in which humans must work alongside smart machines far more intensively President Lyndon Johnson was prescient in this regard writing a half a century ago Automation is not our enemy Our enemies are ignorance indifference and inertia Automation can be the ally of our prosperity if we will just look ahead if we will understand what is to come and if we will set our course wisely after proper planning Back then nobody other than science fiction writers could have imagined robot dogs opening doors and escaping to wherever those androids from Blade Runner found refuge But LBJ s words resonate planning for change has never been more important 2019 Milken

gaining and maintaining the trust of our various audiences Be it regulation business attraction logistics compliance or awareness building there are few functions of public sector activity that aren t ultimately dependent on getting a message out But the where and the ways to do that have changed and are changing remarkably And addressing that can t be a merely a function of Corporate Communications teams no matter how good they might be If government is to remain relevant into the future its people need to think about their audiences every step of the way whatever their role But how do individual public servants with their own skills sets and natural abilities embrace a communications role Sue Cato perhaps Australia s leading issues management practitioner will join us in a

continues the Reduce Your Juice story that began in session 1A but it is not necessary to have attended that session to get all the benefits and insights from this session The future for policymaking will be a compact between government business and the community to resolve real world problems together More meaningful engagement with expertise in the community can only help to address the complex issues of trust and enhance confidence in public policy solutions Industry Secretary Heather Smith 2018 IPAA address US based CB Insights recently released research that connecting professional expertise that is outside the traditional top down consulting model of billable hours and allows experts to solve problems with non traditional availability increasing the capacity and capability of the problem solvers application to solutions Platforms like MindHive enable this new collaborative compact by harness the power of the crowd They have a capacity to enable industry government and universities to work together to develop more innovative creative and unique solutions to complex problems They provide an opportunity for policy innovators to work at a state national and international level to leverage its unique strengths across a range of private and public sector challenges Based in Brisbane Australia and with over 13 300 community experts and growing MindHive is the world s first crowdsourcing consultancy An Airbnb for brains it s aim is to disrupt the 145B consulting world This session will explore the technologies of expertise engaging crowds shared intelligence collaborative problem solving and strategy co design including a series of case studies drawn from across Mindhive and other idea innovation platforms Program Note The story of MindHive s evolution as a collaborative policy and strategy startup continues in Breakout 3B in a session focused on the digital platform and its future ambitions Many jurisdictions nationally and internationally are already using sustainability concepts to springboard new business models and transform their economies across ideas such as the circular economy But while multinationals and local communities alike are seeing economic environmental and social returns in many ways the core of this model is an innovation based on trust This session will explore the concept of the circular economy using a series of case studies to demonstrate the change that is already happening and changing our society and the way its institutions work from one based on take make and dispose to one that is restorative and regenerative by design The fast pace of digital change is re shaping today s workforce PwC research indicates there will be net job creation from technology however there is an increasing consensus across thought and practice leaders that it s time to get practical about assisting all workers to adapt to the digital age The task of retraining talent goes beyond digital upskilling 87 of Australia s CEOs either agree or strongly agree that they need to strengthen the soft skills of employees alongside their digital skills Human skills such as creativity flexibility agility problem solving collaboration adaptability and emotional intelligence are skills that can t be automated and therefore there is much value to gain from harnessing these skills in employees This session will distil the shift towards automation and AI in workplaces generally and the public sector in particular and use this as the beginning of a constructive even personal conversation A conversation that acknowledges and de mystifies their potential and facilitates a way to embrace the competitive advantage for individuals and organisations alike from developing skills that complement and leverage an integrated AI HI workforce Technological innovations including always on connectivity artificial intelligence and automation are undeniably changing the nature of work As

sector design from its earliest days realising the potential of the concept through a digital platform has been central to ensuring the viability of the original concept With MindHive 2 0 a new crowdsourcing and networking platform nearing launch participants will have the opportunity to observe how the theoretical and practical challenges were resolved and have the opportunity to experience the potential for policy and strategy development through the MindHive methodology firsthand To many minds the rise of technology and the state of the environment have a relationship that is parallel at best and inverse at worst A rise in one has too often been seen as necessarily having to come at the cost of the other But advances in technology from 3D printing to social media to big data are fundamental enablers to many of the facets of circular economy How can government enable and capitalise on this shift across portfolios as diverse as energy infrastructure social services and foreign aid This session will combine case studies with practical experience to show the digital revolution in a whole new shade green We are living through a fundamental transformation in the way we work Automation and thinking machines are replacing human tasks changing the skills that organisations are looking for in their people But what will the future look like This isn t a time to sit back and wait for events to unfold To be prepared for the future you have to understand it In this session PwC will lead participants through a conversation about what the future of work could look like and

Technology is changing not only how we interact with each other but also our expectations when it comes to experiences Government and Enterprise are in the midst of the biggest call to action that we ve had in the last century and it s all coming down to one word Trust This is the new augmented world of humanity and technology fused together at the very core It s also more exciting than ever Just remember this though New world means new rules Global Futurist Chris Riddell will take you on an incredible journey unlocking exciting insights into human change the mega trends of beyond tomorrow and what true innovation in government looks like Welcome to a new Beyond Tomorrow Leaders and organisations are in an overheating crucible of radical transformation showing up their vulnerabilities and lack of agility It is a world characterised by increasing Variety Interdependency Complexity Change Ambiguity Seamlessness and Sustainability VICCASS These exponential changes challenge the established models and approaches of leadership and require very different capabilities and mindsets Leaders need to think differently behave differently and react differently We need to identify leaders early for their agility creativity ability to lead and connect people and teams their thinking patterns and their systems thinking Senior leaders should be measured on their ability to cut through bureaucracy to enable change their ability to create counter intuitive insights and their courage in challenging the norm It s time to change our thinking on who is a leader how they are trained and in what ways they are rewarded and supported Let s rethink reexamine and redesign leadership development and get the right people into leadership roles now while we still can 2018 Breakout Stream 4Most people interested in the field of innovation have heard of agile innovation teams These small entrepreneurial groups are designed to stay close to customers and adapt quickly to changing conditions When implemented correctly they have a reputation for almost always result in higher team productivity and moral faster time to market better quality and lower risk than traditional approaches can achieve But while agile methods caught on first in IT departments and are now widely used in software development the agile approach has potential to transform the public sector in ways far beyond better bits and bytes Conditions are ripe for agile teams in any situation where problems are complex solutions are at first unclear project requirements are likely to change and close collaboration with end users is feasible a description that matches many facing a wide variety of public sector activities This session will provide participants with an opportunity explore what the world of agile can teach them about themselves their work and their potential to serve their clients better whatever their role It will confront some of the common myths and misconceptions about agile and demonstrate how an agile approach can enable teams to deliver sooner and scale faster through a proven learning culture that builds and strengthens the team and its capabilities Navigating today s increasingly complex and volatile business terrain requires deep reservoirs of tenacity optimism and hardiness This session will equip participants with the ability to fundamentally and permanently

conjures up images of sci fi movies and the future They see it as a threat to their jobs and sometimes even their safety but AI represents the biggest leap forward in terms of work productivity since the personal computer and few other industries can benefit from AI as much as government With AI we can change the way government works and help employees do their job better AI is already integrated into numerous cloud platforms and can be used to discover new information and deliver outcomes instantly I like to refer to this as practical AI AI has the potential to improve employee experiences by speeding up decision making and automating mundane and repetitive tasks Bringing machine learning to everyday work enables government agencies and departments to make better decisions faster because they do not have to hunt for data and aggregate it into a spreadsheet By building intelligence into platforms AI helps manage complex workflows and allows organizations to One way that AI will be applied in the workplace is automating service requests Most companies have an IT service desk as well as a customer support center These functions ensure that customers and employees receive help in a timely manner whether it is a request for a new computer a password reset or the status of a repair Manually triaging thousands of incidents or cases categorizing tasks and routing work can consume resources introduce human error and slow resolution In fact a new report from Accenture found that customer support functions spend up to 12 percent of their time categorizing prioritizing and assigning tickets Meanwhile AI accurately categorizes requests nearly instantly It eliminates the bottleneck created by agents having to manually assign categorize and route requests A full two days a week is wasted on manual administrative work according to the recent State of Work survey conducted by ServiceNow If an agency with 5 000 people automated those processes they could get 4 million work hours back a year Adding AI frees up employees to do the work they want to do spurring creativity Nearly half of respondents 48 percent said work levels increased by 20 percent or more after they adopted AI solutions Additionally 91 percent of executives say their skilled employees spend too much time on admin tasks and 93 percent believe that reducing mundane tasks unleashes employee creativity To properly implement AI solutions across government agencies we need to define which tasks are best suited for humans and which ones should be performed by AI The government has a term inherently governmental to describe work processes or decisions that must be done by government employees Contractors do much of the work in our government agencies but certain work is inherently governmental in nature As we move into an age defined by AI we need to identify and define the work processes and decisions that are inherently human We are going to increasingly work in a blended workplace with AI systems and humans working together to achieve a mission There are certain activities within any work environment that can only be performed or should only be performed by humans While there may be many more human activities designated as inherently human in the beginning I believe that as humans become more comfortable with the role of AI in the blended workforce less and less work will be designated as inherently human There will always be a need for humans to remain in charge from factual responsibility and liability aspects as well as from emotional and psychological ones We spend a third of our lives at work It shapes who we are how we feel and how we interact with the world so we must create great work experiences and this is what AI does AI creates work experiences that unleash productivity bringing out the best in us Rather than fearing machines stealing jobs we need to understand how AI will change the way government works though small

18th 2 00 p m 3 00 p m Room Cannon 421Dear Colleague A growing number of business leaders and experts are warning that emerging automation and artificial intelligence technologies will transform the future of work disrupting labor markets possibly displacing large numbers of workers Some estimate tens of millions of jobs being lost in the U S and hundreds of millions worldwide 1 One widely cited Oxford University study estimates that 47 of U S jobs are at risk for being automated by 2033 2 Analysts predict that those workers who can least affordit are going to be hardest hit by job losses An Obama White House study found that the jobs that are threatened by automation are highly concentrated among lower paid lower skilled and less educated workers 3 A study by the Joint Center for Political Economic Studies shows that workers of color are disproportionately at risk finding that Over 31 percent of Latino workers and 27 percent of African American workers are concentrated in just 30 occupations at high risk to automation 4 Automation is one of a number of major forces transforming jobs and the nature of employment Others include the fissuring of employment relationships globalization the financialization of U S corporate governance and de unionization All of these forces are having profound impacts on the labor market altering which jobs will be available in the future to whom the pay and working conditions and how workers acquire necessary skills This roundtable brings together experts to discuss what the federal government can and should do to modernize our labor market institutions to ensure that the future of work is inclusive equitable and leads to increasing standards of living for most Americans The panel will explore policy proposals such as preserving the employer employee relationship in lieu of independent contracting promoting worker inclusive technology adoption offering adjustment assistance for displaced workers increasing worker

DEBUG:root:Apple has integrated 9 000 trees into its futuristic new headquarters campus reflecting research showing that greenery in workplaces increases productivity by 15 percent Several years ago Google s People Analytics division launched Project Aristotle to understand the components of productive teams embracing research that groups are more creative than individuals Private sector businesses are automating tedious tasks augmenting workers with artificial intelligence technologies reskilling and upskilling their workforces focusing on employee wellness and hungrily recruiting talent Government will have to catch up Perhaps nowhere is the gap between the public and private sector greater than in workforce management Most public sector organizations are still locked into decades old employee policies such as rigid job classifications lockstep pay and a reliance on seniority as a substitute for capability The reality is that government agencies are increasingly called upon to address society s most complex challenges while using workforce approaches rooted in the distant past The good news Change is possible and beginning to happen A new Deloitte study explores some of the ways the nature of government work the public workforce itself and the workplace it occupies will all need to continue to evolve Work New technologies can transform the capabilities of a government worker Artificially intelligent chatbots for example can perform triage on citizen questions freeing human attention for less routine queries The Army s recruitment chatbot SGT STAR does the work of 55 recruiters answering 94 percent of questions A Deloitte analysis of AI s potential found that automation could save the federal government as much as 1 2 billion hours of work annually What AI doesn t automate it can enhance Child welfare caseworkers who according to one study spend just 9 percent of their time with children but 37 5 percent of their time on paperwork could use technology to auto populate documentation freeing time for visits AI also can correlate hospital truancy and arrest records to flag children in danger Some restaurant health inspectors already analyze big data to identify likely candidates for inspections In Chicago for instance tests found 24 percent more critical violations and on average isolated dangers from the food system a week earlier For effective work redesign it s helpful to adopt a two pronged strategy of zooming in and zooming out A zooming in approach hones in on individual tasks and processes that have the most potential to be optimized through automation Zooming out entails looking at the bigger picture to define what work redesign means for entire job classifications departments and the organization as a whole Workforce Specialists in fields like cybersecurity agile development and artificial intelligence are not likely to commit decades to one government position and if they did they d still need to swap into the tech sector periodically to sharpen their skills That s why some government technology programs are taking a tour of duty approach letting private sector experts serve in the public sector for a few years on specific projects without locking them into a lifetime of government work At the federal level the General Services Administration s 18F digital services agency the Oak Ridge Institute for Science Education and the Presidential Innovation Fellows program all help government solve problems with temporary outside hires At the state level Michigan s Cyber Civilian Corps a volunteer group of cybersecurity professionals from the private sector and academia as well as government can be called upon if the governor declares a cyber emergency And long term government workers don t need to be stuck in one place A talent cloud can prepare for unexpected staffing needs by identifying in advance workers with special skills and applying them to tasks suited to their expertise Canada is experimenting with letting multiple agencies dip into a talent cloud and hire workers for specific missions Workers keep their union membership rights and benefits but may be called into service by any agency Workplace Empirical science rarely guides hiring But management is becoming more data driven Applying the newest science on team building personal efficiency and employee wellness to government agencies can upgrade the workplace to better attract retain and utilize talent Insights from studies of the composition and functioning of effective teams can inform decisions about using talents more effectively Organizational network analysis for example can use metadata from emails and other sources to map communication patterns in organizations accurately predicting individuals who will be high performers detecting unsatisfied employees six months before they actually quit and identifying leadership behaviors that correlate with success Modern workplace wellness programs are also extremely impactful Improving employee wellness can reduce lost work days increase retention and fuel productivity After the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center provided a physician and nurse case manager for employees it saw an 80 percent decline in lost work days over six years for a cost savings of 1 5 million In short the future of government work will require a level of dynamic workforce management far beyond the current practices of the public sector The potential for government agencies to unlock more human capital potential and make the public sector a magnet for talent is enormous As Buffalo s former mayor demonstrated to bring the right people together you have to know what it takes to make a project succeed Local governments are using internet surveys to better gauge residents needs Some states are finding ways to make rules easier to navigate and less costly for business while continuing to protect the public s interests The amount of missing and unusable public sector data is stunning Every jurisdiction should be comparing itself with its peers to identify problematic practices increase productivity and reduce costs It s all too easy for team members to misunderstand something Effective leaders know the value of the pre brief WRITTEN BY Charlie Tierney Steve Cottle Katie JorgensenWind back the clock to 1971 Jane a freshly minted college graduate joins the government as a clerk Jane s work consists largely of entering information into databases and creating reports which requires her to spend the better part of her work day seated at a terminal near a mainframe computer that fills an entire room Jane and her colleagues are expected to be at their desks from 9 a m to 5 p m five days a week Jane is grateful to have a steady 9 to 5 job and plans to spend her entire career with her agency Flash forward 40 years and meet Jane s grandson Ian He carries a slim tablet wherever he goes which has more computing power than the mainframe with which Jane worked Ian is constantly tethered to the Internet and works 24 7 from wherever he is Ian expects to switch from project to project and office to office as his career develops and his interests evolve If he feels he has reached the limit of his ability to learn or grow in one role he will look elsewhere for a new opportunity What if the government could give Ian the opportunities and experiences he seeks The GovCloud concept proposed in this paper would restructure government workforces in a way that takes advantage of the talents and preferences of workers like Ian who are entering the workforce today The model is based on a large body of research from interviews with public and private sector experts to best practices from innovative organizations both public and private This is the first generation of people that work play think and learn differently than their parents They are the first generation to not be afraid of technology It s like the air to them Don Tapscott author of Grown Up DigitalThis report details trends in work and technology that offer significant opportunities for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the government workforce It lays out the GovCloud model explaining how governments could be organized to take advantage of its flexibility It examines how work would be performed in the new model and discusses potential changes to government HR programs to support GovCloud Other sections provide resources for executives including a tool to help determine cloud eligibility steps they can take to pilot the cloud concept and future scenarios illustrating the cloud in action The GovCloud model represents a dramatic departure from the status quo It is bound to be greeted with some skepticism Without such innovation however governments will be left to confront the challenges of tomorrow with the workforce structure of yesterday The details of the GovCloud model are open for debate The purpose of this paper is to jumpstart that debate Forty years ago more than half of employed American adults worked in either blue collar or clerical jobs Today less than 40 percent work in these same categories and the share continues to shrink 1 Jobs requiring routine or manual tasks are disappearing while those requiring complex communication skills and expert thinking are becoming the norm 2 Increasingly employers seek workers capable of creative and knowledge based work We should ask ourselves whether we re truly satisfied with the status quo Are our workday lives so fulfilling and our organizations so boundlessly capable that it s now pointless to long for something better Gary Hamel author of The Future of ManagementThe next generation of creative knowledge workers has already entered the job market These Millennials came of age in a rapidly and radically changing world They are the first true digital natives They have grown up with instant access to information through technology As such Millennials have considerably different expectations for the kind of work they do and the information they use The pursuit for variety in work has led Millennials to cite simply needing a change as their top reason for switching jobs 3Advances in technology have also changed the actual ways in which people perform work The ability to crowdsource tasks is one example of this change Since its founding in 2001 volunteers have produced and contributed to over 19 million articles in 281 languages on Wikipedia 4 Built around this concept a burgeoning industry is developing around microtasking dividing work up into small tasks that can be farmed out to workers Amazon s Mechanical Turk rolled out in 2005 allows users to post tasks to a platform where registered workers can accept and complete them for a small fee When this paper was written more than 195 000 tasks were available on Mechanical Turk 5Such technologies may offer suitable possibilities for the public sector Microtask a Finnish cloud labor company maintains Digitalkoot a program that helps the Finnish National Library convert its image archives into digital text and correct existing errors It does so with volunteered labor participants simply play a game in which they are shown the image of a word and then must type it out to help a cartoon character cross a bridge In doing so they are turning scanned images into searchable text greatly improving the search accuracy of old manuscripts 6 At present more than 100 000 people have completed over 6 million microtasks associated with this project 7As the pace of computing power and machine learning increases professors Frank Levy and Richard Murnane contend that more tasks will move from human to computer processing 8 Skeptics need look no further than IBM s Watson a computer that can answer questions posed in natural language In February 2011 Watson defeated two all time champions of the quiz show Jeopardy This was not solely a publicity stunt IBM hopes to sell Watson to hospitals and call centers to help them answer questions from the public 9Around the globe more and more governments are looking to increase telework among employees In 2010 the U S government passed legislation calling for more telework opportunities for government employees Likewise the Australian government in order to attract and retain information and communications technology workers instituted a teleworking policy in 2009 requiring agencies to implement flexible work plans 10 Other countries including Norway and Germany are also focusing on flexible work arrangements to improve public sector recruiting 11 In Canada the government has an official telework policy that recognizes changes are occurring in the public service workforce with a shift towards more knowledge workers and encourages departments to implement telework arrangements 12Cloud definitionsCloud computing Internet based computing whereby shared resources software and information are provided to computers and other devices on demand like electricity AmazonCrowdsourcing Neologistic compound of crowd and outsourcing for the act of taking tasks traditionally performed by an employee or contractor and outsourcing them to a group of people or community through an open call to a large group of people a crowd asking for contributions WikipediaGovCloud A new model for government based on team collaboration whereby workforce resources can be surged to provide services to government agencies on demand GovLabSource Frank Levy and Richard J Murnane The New Division of Labor How Computers are Creating the Next Job Market Princeton Princeton University Press 2004 p 50 Figure 1 Trends in routine and non routine tasks in the U S 1960 200213These are all powerful steps in the right direction for employees whose natural work rhythms are not locked into 9 to 5 Some companies have taken telework one step further British Telecom is pushing the concept of agile working through its Workstyle Project where employees decide what work arrangements best suit them rather than a rigid definition by location and hours BT Workstyle is one of the largest flexible working projects in Europe with over 11 000 home based workers BT has found that its home enabled employees are on average 20 percent more productive than their office based colleagues 14Similarly U S electronics retailer Best Buy experimented with a Results Only Work Environment ROWE In a ROWE what matters is not whether employees are in their office but rather that they complete their work and achieve measurable outcomes In a ROWE salaried employees must put in as much time as is actually needed to do their work no more no less The decline in routine and manual tasks and the rise of new ways of working is not isolated to the private sector In 1950 the U S federal workforce largely comprised clerks performing repetitive tasks About 62 percent performed these tasks while only 11 percent performed more white collar work By 2000 those relationships were reversed Fifteen percent performed repetitive tasks compared to 56 percent in the white collar categories 16 Similarly in 1944 the number of workers in the UK civil service considered industrial totaled 505 000 By 2003 this number fell to 18 200 with non industrial workers reaching 538 000 in 2004 17 And in Canada in 2006 knowledge based workers represented 58 percent of federal workers in the Core Public Administration up from 41 percent 11 years earlier 18The swelling ranks of non industrial government workers indicate a shift in public sector jobs toward creative collaborative and complex work The workforce structure however designed for clerks of the last century remains largely the same With limited flexibility to distribute resources governments often address change by creating new agencies and programs This can be seen following major events like the outbreaks of the Avian flu and SARs in the past decade 9 11 and the financial crisis of 2008 Source United States Office of Personnel Management A Fresh Start for Federal Pay A Case for Modernization April 2002 p 5 http www opm gov strategiccomp whtpaper pdfFigure 2 The changing U S federal workforce 1950 200015Given increasing budgetary pressures and burgeoning national debts the conventional model of creating new agencies or permanent structures in response to new challenges is unsustainable This is exacerbated by our inability to accurately predict future needs and trends Consider a 1968 Business Week article proclaiming that the Japanese auto industry isn t likely to carve out a big share of the market for itself or the president of Digital Equipment Corporation who in 1977 said t here is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home 19The world is full of experts who attempt to predict the future and fail 20Instead of endeavoring to predict the future governments can choose to create a flexible workforce that can quickly adapt to future work requirements To accomplish this the government can learn from a game changing concept in the technology world cloud computing Major organizations and small startups alike increase their flexibility by sharing storage space information and resources in a cloud allowing them to quickly scale resources up and down as needed Why not apply the cloud model to people The creation of a government wide human cloud could provide significant benefits including A cloud based government workforce or GovCloud could include workers who perform a range of creative problem focused work Rather than being slotted into any single government agency cloud workers would be true government wide employees This section outlines the organizational structure of the GovCloud model which rests on three main pillars a cloud of government workers thin executive agencies and shared services Most government workforce models tend to constrain workers by isolating them in separate agencies Consider the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom and the subsequent slaughter of more than 6 million pigs sheep and cattle The problem of an impacted food supply is complicated In most countries multiple agencies focus on agriculture food production and public health In the United Kingdom the army and even tourism ministries were impacted by the outbreak as agencies became overwhelmed by the number of animals in need of disposal and by the cordoning off of tourist areas to prevent the spread of the disease Yet the structure of government agencies often confines employees to work in information silos creating inherent operational inefficiencies In a cloud workforce model experts in each area could be pulled together to support remedies and propose coordinated corrective measures I want someone saying Did you know that the Ministry of Justice is doing that or could you piggy back on what the communities department is doing or had you thought about doing it in this way You ve got to get away from thinking about centralized command and control Dame Helen Ghosh Permanent Secretary UK Home Office 21The FedCloud modelThe GovCloud model could become a new pillar of government comprising permanent employees who undertake a wide variety of creative problem focused work As needed the GovCloud model could also take advantage of those outside government including citizens looking for extra part time work full time contractors and individual consultants Cloud workers would vary in background and expertise but would exhibit traits of free agent workers self sufficient self motivated employees who exhibit a strong loyalty to teams colleagues and clients Daniel Pink author of Drive The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us argues that 33 million Americans one quarter of the workforce already operate as free agents 22According to the white paper Lessons of the Great Recession from Swiss staffing company Adecco contingent workers those who chose non traditional employment arrangements23 are expected to eventually make up about 25 percent of the global workforce 24These more autonomous workers according to Pink are better suited to 21st century work and are more productive even without traditional monetary incentives 25The fluid nature of the cloud can provide significant benefits The nature of the cloud teams forming and dissolving as their tasks require encourages workers to focus on specific project outcomes rather than ongoing operations Thin agency structures could lead to Greater use of shared services could allow the federal government to The need to support some ongoing missions will remain of course These missions will be carried out by thin agencies Under the cloud concept federal agencies would remain focused on specific missions and ongoing oversight These agencies however would become thinner as many of their knowledge workers transfer into the cloud Thin agencies could also create opportunities to streamline organizations with overlapping missions Employees working in thin agencies could fall into two main categories GovCloud could change the highest levels of public sector workers as we know them today The Senior Executive Service in the United States Permanent Secretaries and Directors General in the United Kingdom and Australia all such senior officials could rotate between agencies shared services and the cloud which would reflect the original intent behind many of these high level offices giving executives a breadth of experience in roles across government to help develop shared values and a broad perspective An important benefit of rotation would be the ability to tap into cloud networks to assemble high performing teams To further focus agencies on specific missions many of their back office support functions could be pulled into government wide shared service arrangements The use of shared services in government has come and gone in waves usually dictated by fiscal necessity Most countries in Europe as part of their e government strategies have placed increased focus of late on developing shared services whether through an executive agency or a CIO as well as working with EU coordination activities And while the decentralized governments of some EU countries such as Germany make shared services more difficult these countries are using states and agencies to pilot innovative approaches 27Other efforts around the world include the U S e Government Act of 2002 which examined how technology could be used to cut costs and improve services More recently the New Zealand government appointed an advisory group in May 2011 to explore public sector reform to improve services and provide better value In their report Better Public Services the advisory group recommended the use of shared services to improve effectiveness in a variety of government settings including policy advice and real estate 29 Following up on this three New Zealand agencies the Department of the Prime Minister the State Services Commission and the Treasury announced in December 2011 that they would share such corporate functions as human resources and information technology 30 And though shared services in Western Australia were shut down other projects in South Australia are moving ahead and already showing savings 31In August 2011 the government of Canada announced the launch of Shared Services Canada a program that seeks to streamline and identify savings in information technology Among its first targets is something as mundane as email But with more than 100 different email systems being used by government employees the potential savings and boost to efficiency could be significant Not only do these incompatible systems cost money by requiring individual departments to negotiate and maintain separate licenses and technical support it also makes it difficult for government employees to communicate with one another and with the public And with no single standard ensuring the security of information transmitted over email becomes more challenging Shared Services Canada will move the government to one email system as well as consolidate data centers and networks ultimately looking for anticipated savings of between CA 100 million and CA 200 million annually 28While the idea of using shared services is not a novel one it is central to the GovCloud model The GovCloud model envisions building upon effective practices and those shared services already in operation to deliver services like human resources information technology finance and acquisitions government wide Workers in these shared services would include subject matter experts in areas like human resources and information technology as well as generalists who support routine business functions The potential for shared services continues to grow As seen with IBM s Watson and Microtask s Digitalkoot new technologies provide an opportunity to accelerate the automated delivery of basic services Some agencies already have begun capitalizing on these trends For example NASA has moved its shared service center website to a secure government cloud facilitating greater employee self service and helping to reduce demand on finite call center resources 32This decision tool is designed to help leaders determine which employees are appropriate for each of the three structures in the GovCloud model the cloud thin agencies and shared services To the cloud GovCloud Project LifecycleManaging employees in the cloud will require governments to reinvent human resource management Individual and team performance evaluations career development pay structures and benefits and pensions would need to change to support GovCloud This section examines possibilities for HR reinvention including performance management career development workplace flexibility and benefits Employees working in the cloud would require an alternative to determine pay and career advancement The government could take its cues from the gaming world and evaluate cloud workers with a point system The manager as we know it will disappear to be replaced by a new sort of business operative whose expertise is assembling the right people for particular projects Daniel Pink author of Free Agent Nation 33An HR management system that incorporates the accumulation of experience points XP through effective work on cloud projects training education and professional certifications could replace the tenure centric models for cloud employees As employees accumulate XP they could level up and take on additional responsibilities in future projects Workers in the cloud could earn XP in four ways After some high profile incidents slow responses to outbreaks of foot and mouth disease flooding that may have been preventable and a farming subsidy system that seemed to result in more chaos than aid the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs DEFRA was looking to reinvent itself In 2006 the department launched DEFRA Renew One of its key goals was to bring the department s policymaking closer to actual delivery to create more responsive processes Organized mainly by policy with fixed teams DEFRA had been unable to redeploy resources as needed in response to a crisis As part of DEFRA Renew a new operating model was implemented that used flexible resourcing where staff were assigned to specific projects for fixed periods This allowed management to measure and build the required capabilities and competencies needed and to allocate resources efficiently to improve overall service quality New roles were also created to support sustainable staff development and resource management in the new model To create buy in for such a fundamental culture shift within the department a facilitative approach to decision making was employed Change management programs and mentoring were extended to all levels of the department including leadership New mechanisms such as approval panels for resources and the use of business cases also worked to push changes among staff and promote collaborative behavior DEFRA Renew was widely recognized as a key enabler in the department meeting required efficiency improvement targets set by the UK government DEFRA moved to a more project based approach with fewer staff in core teams According to Dame Helen Ghosh former Permanent Secretary of DEFRA they could be more responsive now that the management board won t be made up of director generals with individual policy silos 34Just as XP could be gained through learning new skills it could be lost in the following three ways Any serious discussion about creating a new class of government employees requires a fresh look at employee benefits and compensation For example XP could be used to help determine workers salaries but additional research into alternative pension and benefit programs is needed While any discussion on compensation could be contentious a healthy debate among stakeholders from across the government should be welcomed As new roles emerge in the cloud so too could new career paths Career emphasis could move away from time served in a particular pay grade and toward milestones that are meaningful for employee development Each worker may have different career aspirations For instance not all workers aspire to management some may seek to master a particular subject area instead Career advancement in the cloud would not equate to moving up a ladder but rather moving along a lattice Lattice GovCloud ModelHere s how the lattice could work for Ian who we met in the introduction Think of the lattice as a jungle gym The best opportunities to broaden your experience may be lateral or even down Look every which way and swing to opportunities Pattie Sellers Fortune editor at largeCathleen Benko and Molly Anderson the authors of The Corporate Lattice argue that the corporate ladder is giving way to a lattice that accommodates flatter more networked organizations improves the integration of career and life focuses on competencies rather than tenure and helps increase workforce loyalty 35 The lattice metaphor allows employees to choose many ways to get ahead It is unlikely that all workers will thrive in the new GovCloud environment right out of the gate As such it would be important to assess a worker s readiness before placing her in GovCloud and providing training on core competencies critical to cloud success There could also be opportunities to start workers especially those at earlier stages of a career within an agency or shared service to build up expertise in some area before graduating to the cloud Once in the cloud new workers could be paired with mentors who are more experienced to help navigate the cloud experience itself There should be an emphasis on continuous learning in the cloud It would be important for cloud workers to continue to refine their skills develop additional expertise and adapt to new ways of working Not only could continuous learning affect workers career mobility by increasing the depth and breadth of their skills but it could also impact their salary and level by increasing their XP Learning and development in the cloud could take on many themes of next learning Next learning focuses on creating personalized learning experiences that leverage the latest technologies and collaborative communities to deliver education and learning programs that build knowledge bases and promote learning as a focus and passion not just a checkbox in a career 36To broaden cloud worker skills and the ability to handle multiple tasks and work on a variety of projects cloud learning could include the following principles 37In the cloud careers and expertise will be built in new ways and work will be something we do rather than a place we go to As such the cloud will give workers more control over their schedules and workloads By creating a flexible workplace governments could shed a significant amount of physical infrastructure and create shared workspaces Many buildings could be converted into co located spaces teams could use collaboration spaces or videoconferencing centers Some workers might rarely set foot in a government building instead conducting cloud tasks at home and interacting with project teams virtually With advancing communications and mobile technology distance no longer hinders collaboration It no longer matters whether all workers are at an office between 9 a m and 5 p m what matters is whether project teams produce results and whether everyone contributes A more flexible workplace could also take advantage of resources governments might not otherwise have access to Some retiring workers may not want to quit working altogether and a flexible model could be an enticing way to keep their expertise on retainer Alternatively the model could take advantage of would be government employees unwilling to relocate or unable to work a regular schedule By increasing flexibility governments could increase their available resource pool allowing agencies to access the skills and knowledge they need when they need it For an example of how a retiree could interact with the cloud see Appendix C National Security Case Study Don t think governments will ever take to the cloud At the U S Department of State the idea could soon be a reality The Office of eDiplomacy is preparing to pilot a cloud component to its e internship model for American students as part of the Virtual Student Foreign Service VSFS beginning this year The VSFS currently offers e internships to U S university students of multiple month duration By using a new micro volunteering platform State Department offices and embassies around the world will be able to create non classified tasks that take anywhere from a couple of minutes to a couple of days to complete Each task will be tagged by region and or issue and will automatically populate the profiles of students who have indicated those interests Students can then select the tasks that interest them the most or that fit into their schedule To see that the most pressing work is performed first offices and embassies will be able to prioritize their tasks so critical items appear at the top of the queue Imagine a small embassy preparing for a high profile multilateral meeting The preparations for such an event could be daunting for a small staff The power of the cloud could augment an individual embassy s capacity to prepare for a major event and ensure that related items are performed ahead of those that are less critical While there are plenty of incentives for participating in the VSFS micro volunteering platform from an impressive line on a student s resume to the chance to make a difference by working on topics of interest thought is being put into how to creatively incent high performance One idea is to simply invoke students competitive spirit Competition could be encouraged by a monthly leader board which results in bragging rights and potentially even a low cost but high impact reward Transparency is also key to competition with ratings available to State Department staff and other cloud interns and the ability to make short thank you notes from embassies publicly available interns would be keen to make a good impression The potential applications of this type of program are significant Imagine if offices throughout the State Department could tap into the language and cultural expertise of the thousands of foreign national staff members around the globe Providing a platform for those employees to contribute even a small amount of time to discreet tasks that require their expertise could unlock a world of knowledge 38Creating the GovCloud model will require bold leadership and the ideas and initiatives of entrepreneurial executives While a GovCloud model may be years in the making agencies can begin adopting cloud concepts today The GovCloud concept is designed to be versatile as well as applicable to a wide range of entities Depending on your organization government executives wishing to employ GovCloud may choose to apply the concept first to a unit before expanding to other branches or divisions entire agencies or the whole of government Often GovCloud principles are most effectively implemented as part of a larger reform program within a particular agency as with the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs Renew program as described earlier in this report On a smaller scale the UK Cabinet Office used flexible resourcing FR in its Economic Reform Group ERG with a staff of about 400 as part of its cost reduction plans Using a simple database that it had developed and a strong program of communications FR is now used and embraced by all core ERG employees with strong clear ownership from the top another key implementation factor Says Ian Watmore the UK Cabinet Office s former permanent secretary FR means we are able to deploy people much more quickly to priority projects 40Figure 3 outlines how GovCloud can apply to a variety of organizations Most government workforces haven t undergone a broad restructuring in decades In that time the world has been transformed by computers the Internet and mobile communications To respond to a variety of challenges governments have created scores of new organizations However in today s world of budget cuts and increased fiscal scrutiny the constant creation of new permanent structures is not sustainable The GovCloud model could offer a new way to use government resources A cloud of government wide workers could coalesce into project based teams to solve problems and separate when their work is done This could allow governments to concentrate resources when and where they are needed By using this model in conjunction with thinner agencies and shared services governments can reduce back office redundancies and let agencies focus on their core missions This model capitalizes on the work preferences of Millennials the future government workforce who value career growth over job security or compensation 41 The GovCloud model allows employees to gain a variety of experiences in a shorter amount of time and to self select their career direction To support GovCloud governments could establish the processes by which cloud teams would form work and dissolve New ways to evaluate performance and help workers gain skills and build careers should be considered Today s employee classification system stresses job descriptions and time in service this could be transformed with an XP model that emphasizes the individual s ownership of his or her career The GovCloud model will undoubtedly be controversial Many stakeholders from governing bodies to public employee unions must weigh in to shape the future government workforce The transition to a cloud model will not happen overnight or maybe even in the next five years but the conversation starts today Charlie Tierney is a Manager in Deloitte Consulting LLP s Federal Human

guide the assessment Find out more by reading the terms of reference here Are workers being replaced by machines How is the nature of work and the workforce changing To start this project we ve analysed employment data from the last few decades to help understand what has changed and what future employment trends might be likely Watch this 3 minute video to find out more The Commission will release an issues paper in April outlining the context and scope of the inquiry key issues to be investigated and a list of questions to be addressed and evidence sought We will invite you to review the issues paper and share your feedback on the questions asked or on any issues that you consider relevant to the terms of reference Issues paper released April 2019Series of reports for feedback August November 2019Final report to Government 31 March 2020Our mission is to help leaders in multiple sectors develop a deeper understanding of the global economy Our flagship business publication has been defining and informing the senior management agenda since 1964 Our learning programs help organizations accelerate growth by unlocking their people s potential Higher costs and rising demand have driven rapid increases in spending on core public services such as education healthcare and transport while countries must grapple with complex challenges such as population aging economic inequality and protracted security concerns Government expenditure amounts to more than a third of global GDP budgets are strained and the world public sector deficit is close to 4 trillion a year At the same time governments are struggling to meet citizens rising expectations Satisfaction with key state services such as public transportation schools and healthcare facilities is less than half that of nonstate providers such as banks or utilities Governments need a way to deliver better outcomes and a better experience for citizens at a sustainable cost A new paper by the McKinsey Center for Government MCG Government productivity Unlocking the 3 5 trillion opportunity suggests that goal is within reach It shows that several countries have achieved dramatic productivity improvements in recent years for example by improving health public safety and education outcomes while maintaining or even reducing spending per capita or per student in those sectors If other countries were to match the improvements already demonstrated in these pockets of excellence the world s governments could potentially save as much as 3 5 trillion a year by 2021 equivalent to the entire global fiscal gap Alternatively countries could choose to keep spending constant while boosting the quality of key services For example if all the countries studied had improved the productivity of their healthcare systems at the rate of comparable best performers over the past 5 years they would have added 1 4 years to the healthy life expectancy of their combined populations That translates into 12 billion healthy life years gained without additional per capita spending It s imperative that governments find a way to unlock that productivity opportunity The challenge is that until now there s been limited progress on measuring government productivity even though productivity is a well established and vital measure of the performance of national economies and private sector businesses As a result it is difficult for governments to gauge the true return on spending and debate is often focused on how to increase inputs and not the quality of outputs Governments typically find it challenging to identify improvement opportunities by learning from other countries or from other regions or sectors within the same country To help close this gap MCG built a comprehensive database and benchmarking methodology the Government Productivity Scope to start to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of government expenditure MCG applied the tool across 42 countries that together make up 80 percent of global GDP focusing on seven sectors healthcare primary secondary and tertiary education public safety road transport and tax collection The research was supplemented with insights from more than 50 interviews with government leaders and more than 200 case studies This paper presents the first version of MCG s analysis which we will continue to extend and refine in dialogue with government leaders and academic experts The initial findings point to dramatic differences in countries relative productivity Even among comparable countries with very similar outcomes the least efficient government currently spends more than twice as much per unit of output as its most efficient peer And while most countries have struggled to contain spending growth in every sector MCG found examples of governments that have reduced expenditure per unit while experiencing improved outcomes These differences point to a tremendous opportunity for governments to boost productivity save money and achieve better outcomes for citizens To realize that opportunity though governments need to deepen their functional capabilities in four key areas finance commercial digital technology and data analytics and talent management As MCG shows pioneering countries have reimagined and strengthened these functions so they play a more strategic leadership role in pursuing efficiency and improving outcomes Across these areas those governments have adopted an ambitious structured approach to transform the effectiveness of the state Please sign in to print or download this article Please create a

Development of Australia CEDA WA on 17 July 2018 in Perth Jobs matter For almost all of us they are a source of income But they are also a source of self esteem of social interaction a feeling of purpose and even of community And the skills embedded in jobs remain principal drivers of increasing productivity and ultimately wages So when one opines on the future of work people tend to listen But perhaps when one is opining on the future of work today expectations of the listener are more akin to the BBC announcer of Monty Python s Flying Circus and now for something completely different When perhaps it s simply not so different And I guess that may well prove the damp squib hashtag for my talk today We know from history that soothsayers abound when it comes to opining on the future of work Indeed history is littered with the foretelling of a dystopia of jobless woe or a utopia of little need to work at all And the only universal truth seems to be that they were all wrong both happily and unhappily so The 20th century father of the fiscal stimulus John Maynard Keynes foretold in 1930 that In the 21st century a 15 hour work week will suffice as we turn instead to how to use freedom from pressing economic cares And yet despite significant productivity gains since the Keynes 1930 treatise we still all work on average around 40 hours a week In the late 1970s the historian Ian Turner presided over a major symposium on what new technologies would mean for the worker He predicted an imminent period of change as significant as the Neolithic or Industrial Revolutions To quote By 1988 at least a quarter of the Australian workforce would be made redundant by technological change And a similar adage we heard in 1982 from Barry Jones in his book Sleepers Awake technology and the future of work We all know that the late 1980s did see an exponential uptick in the common use of computers in workplaces and even more so in the 90s as the price of the humble computer plummeted But the foretelling of widespread redundancies of the Australian workforce were not seen For throughout the past 100 years it s been more a case of technology remaining the loyal friend not foe of the worker continuing to remove jobs that are often unpleasant physically tiring downright dangerous or just tedious think toll booth operator More recently we ve seen a plethora of papers and reports produced by think tanks academics consultants and platform giants touting analyses of jobs that could be lost as a result of the latest wave of technological change And that latest wave being the digital age and both the resultant automation and artificial intelligence Some of these reports seem to have settled on a nice big round figure of about 40 per cent of today s jobs now being at risk of automation over the next 10 to 20 years Now most of these reports stem from a seminal 2013 paper by Frey and Osborne where US data was used to predict job losses in the future But their approach left out a few things It did not take into account that new technologies can create new jobs Nor did it contemplate that not all tasks within an occupation can be automated or should be automated And we know that the rate of technological adoption will also depend a lot on consumer preferences do you want a robot cutting your hair and the actual cost or put crudely the business case of adoption Others in taking these factors into account suggest 9 of Australian workers are exposed to the risk of automation So a much smaller but not insignificant number And here I ll mention the must read paper by Melbourne University economists Jeff Borland and Michael Coelli Are the Robots Taking Our Jobs Their work lines up with the more considered studies in the US and Europe So let s look at the evidence a common sense thing to do when in the midst of a chorus of now for something completely different To test whether we have strayed into a world of lies lies and damned statistics And in looking at the evidence I ve drawn on some of the Commission s recent endeavour such as our Digital Disruption report 2016 and Shifting the Dial 2017 as well as the work of Jeff Borland and Michael Coelli and that of Bart van Ark of The Conference Board Overall the evidence suggests that labour markets have been pretty well resilient to shocks posed by new technologies of the past century and even the most recent modern bit Occupations skills and jobs come and they go No matter how transformative the technology be it the telephone electricity indoor plumbing refrigeration air transport the personal computer and today s digital No technology has removed people s capacity to work And in productivity terms all have been more transformative than the digital revolution so far with emphasis being on the so far And a bunch of measures suggest that technology is not having as large of an effect as expected at least not in our current modern times The rise of the New Digital Economy which encompasses mobile technology ubiquitous access to the internet and the world of the cloud is unquestionably changing lots of things But to date productivity is not one So much so that this has become known as the Productivity Paradox So whilst our low rate of multi factor productivity growth observed recently is not unique to Australia it has been observed across other countries too it represents something of a puzzle This is because it suggests that at least in aggregate our economies have not become any more efficient in producing things And we know the policy reasons why productivity may have slowed in Australia but this is notwithstanding our purported better ability to exploit information technologies One explanation for this is that there has been a change in the nature of technological progress That recent technologies characterised by some as dramatic have been minor compared to those in the previous century The other explanation one offered by Bart van Ark and perhaps one of intuitive appeal is that whilst we still see rapidly declining ICT prices along with a shift from ICT investment to ICT services perhaps the new digital economy is still in its installation phase And we shouldn t expect to see the productivity dividend until it truly enters the deployment phase This makes sense when you see that in the US the contribution of the most ICT intensive industries to productivity growth has dropped markedly from 46 to 26 in the past decade 2007 16 And for the US and the UK it has even at times registered negative productivity growth in these sectors Which could suggest that the dividend only makes its way into the deployment and hopefully productivity dividend phase once users fully grapple with how to absorb technology effectively So returning to the evidence on the impact on jobs And we do know that there has been automation of many tasks in the workplace But arguably if technology was both disruptive and displacing replacing existing jobs without creating new ones we would expect to see a persistent upward trend in the unemployment rate And we don t Whilst routine manual and routine cognitive jobs have fallen as a proportion of jobs from 50 to 37 non routine manual and non routine cognitive jobs have increased from 42 to 53 Think child care aged care nursing office managers designers and engineers using software Most importantly the aggregate amount of work available to the Australian population on a per capita basis has not seen a decline since the 1980s when computers became common in the workplace The amount of work available has actually increased by about 14 since the early 1980s But that s not to say there hasn t been a lot of change in our workforce and the nature of work since the 1980s Since the 1980s the workforce participation rate for females has increased a lot by some 15 percentage points to now be just over 60 Marriage and even children are placing much less of a brake on economic participation of women Which is both a good thing for the economy and for women There has also been an increase in the incidence of part time jobs by some 25 percentage points since the late 1960s to now account for nearly one third of total employment around 35 in Australia And despite what some have suggested the pace at which workers are changing between jobs in the Australian labour market is not getting quicker Not only is there no evidence that more workers are being forced to work in short duration jobs but what is apparent is that the opposite has happened The proportion of workers in very long duration jobs more than 10 years has increased from just under 20 per cent in 1982 to around 27 per cent in 2016 Which is perhaps unsurprising when you also take into account the participation rate of older Australians 65 in age has risen steeply having nearly doubled in the past 30 years to now represent 12 of our workforce Also a good thing with our ageing population We do know that more workers today have multiple jobs now around 7 of workers And perhaps of much greater significance when workers do change jobs today more are changing occupations some 40 and industries over 50 And it was this modern day workforce reality that informed much of our thinking around the Commission s proposed changes to superannuation default arrangements in our current superannuation Inquiry And our thinking on what is needed from our tertiary education system which I ll return to later And whilst the gig economy is still in its infancy this has not translated yet to any increase in the proportion of the workforce being independent contractors Indeed this has not changed significantly since 2001 it s actually fallen a few percentage points from 20 per cent of employed persons in 2001 to around 18 per cent in 2014 So what does any of this mean or matter for public policy And perhaps here our focus should be two fold First on making sure there are no road blocks to our economy reaching the deployment phase of the digital or any technological age And second making sure we avoid a workforce of have and have nots in the benefits from the changes in the economy and ultimately jobs A sense of equality in the ultimate job productivity and wage dividend So let me pose a few policy questions Are we getting better at assisting transitioning workers We know that structural change whatever its source can result in considerable work and thus life disruption for the workers impacted unless we get the consequential skill adjustment right So have we gotten better in assisting displaced workers get the right skills to transition into new occupations and industries Recent work by the Commission on transitioning regional economies found that effectiveness of government in doing this is at best unclear Some programs found to be not well targeted automotive industry or create conflicting incentives Tasmanian forestry industry And why unclear use of data to simply track the impacted workers and decent evaluation of transitional assistance are largely missing in action Put simply we can and should be doing better Further it s a tad perverse that if the digital economy ultimately disrupts more jobs we do not use the data fuelling that economic activity to assist those disrupted We know of such endeavour in Germany using data to track the worker and the resultant human capital modelling which in turn better informs what requalification programs will deliver a better job transition to a displaced worker Are the right incentives in place to get the workers to the new jobs We know that jobs at least risk of automation jobs that require soft skills such as good old fashioned empathy account for the largest and growing part of our workforce And the latest metrics from the ABS brand new quarterly labour account experimental estimates reveal health care and social assistance as the largest employment sectors accounting for over 1 6 million jobs or 12 2 of all filled jobs This is largely a function of our demographic changes an ageing population women working more along with the NDIS arguably our single biggest social reform since Medicare The Commission s recent review of NDIS costs found that the NDIS workforce was not growing fast enough most regions require between a 50 per cent and 150 per cent increase in the disability services workforce Put simply for the foreseeable future 1 in 5 new jobs in Australia are projected to be for services for the NDIS Thus care is needed to ensure that the demand for these skills and workers is not frustrated by poor incentives The most notable as highlighted in our NDIS review being the need to ensure the pricing of these services allows this massive labour force response to occur Lest we have a program delivering disappointment and not services to the 475 000 Australians with eligible disabilities Is our education and training system fit for purpose for the workers of today and tomorrow Perhaps this is our biggest public policy must have when thinking of ensuring innovation and technology delivers not just more jobs but jobs for most That sense of equality in who shares in the ultimate job productivity and wage dividend And this was a question the Commission sought to ask and answer last year in our inaugural 5 yearly productivity review Shifting the Dial A policy roadmap for Australian Governments on what is needed to deliver on economic participation and productivity two of the three Ps population participation and productivity that matter most for economic growth and ultimately jobs and their real wages And we identified some fundamental fractures in our current education and training system First deteriorating results in subjects that matter for future work think science maths and reading the cognitive trifecta at school Second the VET system is a mess struggling to deliver relevant competency based qualifications Employers today are more satisfied with non accredited training courses 90 than VET 76 Third universities need to improve student employment outcomes delivering qualifications relevant to labour market needs and at a time relevant to the worker s needs Our key educational institutions seem more focused on research than student employment outcomes which is unsurprising given the notable absence of their skin in the game As manifest in 26 of students today not completing their undergraduate studies in less than 9 years Whilst undergraduate underemployment has more than doubled in the last decade to now reach just over 20 Currently the tertiary education system is set up against becoming a chef at age 40 or a dementia care worker at age 50 Retraining is currently inconvenient and expensive and the approach of educational institutions remains outdated and outmoded still emphasising a one career for life approach Which is not the modern day reality for many workers from the metrics cited earlier Taken collectively this unfortunate troika can only put at risk our capacity to deal with future labour market changes in an efficient and equitable way So we ve proposed a few things change for schools evidence and evaluation of what works with teaching for universities incentives be redressed around student employment outcomes and for work skills government to develop two things First tools for proficiency based assessment for skills rather than simply competency based assessment whether they can perform it at all And second a framework to facilitate independent accreditation of skills obtained agnostic of learning method Do current policy settings constrain us getting to and through the installation phase and on to realising benefits in the deployment phase of the digital economy Today s market power arguably resides in data and content The growth of the digital economy automation and artificial intelligence coupled with greater availability of data and algorithm advances will be key drivers of new business activity research endeavour products skills and jobs In short access and use of data and content will be the determining force in realising the economic benefits of the digital economy and artificial intelligence On data the Commission s report last year on Data Use and Availability proposed fundamental and novel changes to data availability and access policy to ensure it generates new economic opportunities and business opportunities driven by consumer needs and preferences A pro consumer and thus pro competition stimulus with the consumer in the drivers seat for their data held with business and government today And the good news is the Government s response to this inquiry has been one of can and will do The Government has committed to support the two most structurally significant recommendations First the passage of national legislation to remove barriers to data sharing and integration across major public interest data sets and create trusted user access And second the complementary legislated concept of a new general Right for Consumers to exercise joint control in the sharing and use of their data So it s now all down to getting the implementation right On content the Commission s Inquiry in 2016 on Intellectual Property Arrangements examined whether those arrangements meet the needs of the Australian economy And the short answer was no for copyright Currently Australia s copyright exceptions are too narrow and prescriptive do not reflect the way people today consume and use content and do not readily accommodate new legitimate uses of copyright material We found ourselves mired in the wrong debate of publishers clamouring for well protected profit for the purported benefit of local authors For access to content be it snippets of images maps pixels words song sounds is needed alongside data to actually do artificial intelligence But our arrangements unlike those in countries like the US South Korea and Israel pose a seemingly impenetrable barrier to AI being alive and well in our economy For in the absence of meaningful reform to copyright Australia will inevitably and demonstrably be a net importer of AI services and products And fair access to content also matters for education Now more than ever workers need flexible access to ongoing learning MOOCs are a key component of providing low cost and flexible access to ongoing learning And in consulting with the states on Shifting the Dial we were implored to think of the transitioning worker in NW Tasmania in our approach to ongoing skills acquisition especially for mature age workers Yet Australia s current system of copyright usage heavily constrain Universities TAFEs and schools from offering MOOCs So on a final note I ve failed dismally to foretell a future of dystopia or utopia and happily so but that doesn t mean that the deployment phase of the digital economy may yet still surprise us And in reflecting on the Inquiries that formed much of the Commission s endeavour over the last five years or so nearly all have dealt in some way shape or form with the now of work and thus the future of work And in doing so tried to view it through the lens of the needs of workers and students And through that lens it affords a sense of what policies new or tweaked will see our economy able to access the installation phase and realise the benefits of the deployment phase of any technological change And perhaps most importantly ensuring those phases see the benefits of jobs productivity and higher wages shared across the workforce Avoiding a world of technology driven haves and have nots Because that s what matters most for the future of work Follow OnSubscribeThank you for inviting me to speak with you here today In particular I want to thank the Productivity Commission and all involved in the Productivity Hub The previous presenters today have touched on a range of ideas for how we can face the challenge of improving our productivity in a changing world From technology and data to public services and the energy transition I m excited to see forward thinking people working on such a broad range of important topics I d like to commend you all and encourage you to keep up the good work My presentation today will focus on an issue that is at the heart of a productive economy how we approach the rapidly changing world of work I want to talk about how this fits with the overall economic strategy of the Government the core policy areas that we have identified to support New Zealanders in this process and the institutional settings required to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of the Future of Work Economic StrategyBy harnessing the potential of new technology and innovation educating and upskilling our workforce and incentivising research and development we can lift productivity and transition to an economy that is sustainable inclusive and productive That is this Government s overarching economic aim The lessons learned from the Future of Work Commission heavily influenced this Government s economic strategy We aim to shape an economy where we work smarter make better use of our resources ensure everyone who wants to work can work and ensure that the benefits of growth are spread across society In an article published this past weekend Rod Oram argued that we can rise to the immense challenge of making this a high value high wage economy over the next decade The global and local conditions for doing so are the most favourable ever I know there is an appetite among businesses and workers to take up this challenge and I couldn t agree more that the time is right to face up to this Boosting productivity across the economy will be one of the key drivers to improving New Zealanders living standards and wellbeing The Government will put this at the heart of what we do Our focus on lifting wellbeing will require a different approach and different measures of success We want to take a broader view of success and move beyond simple measures such as GDP which while an important measure of economic output does not tell the full story of peoples wellbeing We are working with our Confidence and Supply partner the Green Party on new sustainable development indicators to paint a fuller picture of how well off people are and how the Government can focus its resources best I have also instructed the Treasury to accelerate their work on the Living Standards Framework which measures the impact of policies on four capitals Human Social Natural and Financial Physical I intend to use this framework to inform the Budget process for Budget 2019 making it our first ever Wellbeing Budget By placing wellbeing at the heart of what we do we will be able to measure the extent to which our policies and investments are making real improvements to peoples lives Improving productivity is key to improving wellbeing By producing more from every hour worked businesses become more profitable incomes rise and workers wellbeing rises as time is freed up and purchasing power rises The challenge is how we achieve this The Changing World of WorkThis Government has come into office at an interesting time in New Zealand s economic story Technological advances are transforming our world for example through increased processing power and big data sensors remote work or smart devices The full effect of forces such as automation algorithms and globalisation are not yet known but we do know that they already are and will continue to be disruptive to what only 5 or 10 years ago we considered the status quo My thinking on this topic was shaped by the Future of Work Commission which I chaired for the Labour Party when we were in Opposition It was an ambitious undertaking that saw us engage with thousands of New Zealanders and experts from around the world It is hard to distil that work down to a few points but overall my takeaway is that there is an enormous possibility for us to have productive and fulfilling work over the coming decades But it will only happen if we prepare now We are facing a world where the change has been estimated by McKinsey Global Institute to be occurring at ten times the pace of the Industrial Revolution and 300 times the scale or roughly 3 000 times the impact Every aspect of our working lives is changing Whole jobs are disappearing and almost every job is being re shaped The very notion of what a job is has been challenged by the so called gig economy Advances in technology present both challenges and opportunities for this sometimes all at once For example a company which automates production of its products will experience productivity gains but there might be consequences for the company s workers What happens to those who are laid off How well positioned are they to quickly retrain Could their past training help them swiftly move into other work How can we benefit from changes to the nature of work while negating or limiting the disadvantages We cannot say with any certainty exactly what the world of work will look like but there are some core changes we can identify and the responses to them that are needed This represents both challenges and opportunities How we respond will drive the future of New Zealand s economy and shape how productive sustainable and inclusive our growth will be over the next few decades We all know the story of the New Zealand economy Over the past 20 years New Zealand has generally done well in the creating more part of the productivity equation GDP growth has averaged about 2 8 over that time compared to the OECD average of 2 1 But it s the other part of the equation the resources required to create more where we have been weak Of that headline growth about 1 7 can be attributed to growth in the volume of labour input or simply total hours worked In other words we required strong population growth and more people entering the workforce to ensure more hours were worked in order to increase production More people working is not a recipe for long term sustainable and inclusive growth The portion of that growth which can be attributed to getting more from each unit of labour in producing goods and services has been 1 1 of that 2 8 over the past 20 years that is we are one of the weaker performers in the OECD In fact our relatively low labour productivity growth over a long period of time means the level of labour productivity in New Zealand GDP per hour worked is about 20 below the OECD average The Productivity Commission has told us that New Zealand s shallow capital markets have meant low levels of investment of productive capital the stuff we need to invest in to help us create more from our available resources Our investment in non residential capital per person in the labour force in 2016 was 25 lower than the OECD average In order to get ahead in terms of headline growth we relied on more people coming here to work and those who were already here to enter work We are at a point where the level of labour productivity in New Zealand GDP per hour worked is around 30 below Australia We have to do something different In recent years the main growth drivers have been population growth and a run away housing market That is not a sustainable path and as those forces recede we need to move deliberately and with urgency to establish an economy that is based on a thriving productive sector We also have to ensure that the benefits of this growth translate into meaningful improvements to the living standards of many New Zealanders who missed out in recent years I spoke earlier about our Government s emphasis on wellbeing and delivering higher living standards for all New Zealanders We want to ensure the economy is delivering real benefits to peoples lives rather than simply pursuing growth for the sake of growth Our success in achieving this will largely be determined by how we respond to the challenges we face including New Zealand s productivity challenge With this in mind today I want to talk you through this Government s plan to ensure we are prepared to face the changes that are coming due to technological advances and the changing nature of work In responding to this our Future of Work report identified three core values to drive our response We need to be Inclusive offering opportunity and harnessing the talents of all Resilient to deal with the changes and shocks that are coming our way and Adaptable to be leaders of the change and shape it in line with our values There are a huge range of policy approaches and changes to the way we run our economy that are needed to meet these challenges and take the opportunities that will arise Our Tax Working Group and the reforms we are making to the Reserve Bank Act are an important part of setting the path to a more productive economy That focus on improving productivity is at the heart of the terms of reference for both these reviews Beyond these we had more than 63 recommendations in our report and you will be pleased I am not going to go through them all now I want to touch on just a few of the main themes Just TransitionIn the face of this rapid change it is essential that we have a just transition for those most affected We saw in New Zealand in the 1980s and 1990s the damage that can be done when major changes are made without enough thought or support given to those who face the immediate consequences In this instance I am using that phrase to primarily talk about two things one at a system level the other at a practical on the ground level The government has committed itself to the goal of a net zero carbon economy by 2050 This is an essential shift for New Zealand away from an economy that hastens climate change to one that is more sustainable and develops New Zealand s strategic advantages We will need to ensure this is a just transition where affected industries and communities are given the support to find new sustainable growth opportunities We are in the process of establishing an Independent Climate Commission which will have the job of establishing goals and targets Meanwhile under the leadership of Hon James Shaw a Green Investment Fund is being created to leverage private sector investment to support business developments that will support a low carbon economy Innovation science and research will have significant roles to play in this However New Zealand s total investment in Research and Development is only 1 3 of GDP about half the OECD average When the OECD issued its most recent assessment of the New Zealand economy last year this is what it had to say on R D Expenditure on R D is low as a share of GDP most notably in the business sector Collaboration between firms education and research institutions is low And its advice Increase fiscal support for business research and development Maintain or increase long term support for successful collaboration between research institutions and industry In the Coalition Agreement with New Zealand First we have set a target of hitting an R D spend of 2 of GDP in ten years That s more than a 50 increase in R D investment relative to GDP over that time and will make a significant contribution to improving our productivity Officials say that this is an ambitious goal We believe this can be done with the Government incentivising such vital work by the private sector Minister for Research Science and Innovation Megan Woods has already begun work on overhauling New Zealand s R D regime with Ministers set to discuss officials initial findings later this month We are committed in the first instance to restoring R D tax credits to give firms some certainty about their investments One other key investment identified in our Future of Work programme is in direct support of the technology sector and for businesses to make better use of new technology Research by Swedish academic and technologist Goran Roos found that 55 of New Zealand jobs are at risk due to technological advances and that countries likely to be least affected will be those with the highest levels of economic complexity This is just one of the reasons why it is important for us to diversify our skills base and look for more sustainable drivers of growth By putting the right policies and incentives in place the technology sector can be one of those economic drivers While technological advances present challenges to existing jobs we also have the opportunity to create new forms of work According to NZTech chief executive Graeme Muller only 14 percent of large NZ businesses have deployed any enabling technology for the Internet of Things despite 70 percent believing it will be strategically important for their business to do so Their concerns are largely around costs and changes in technology This Government wants to nurture an environment that gives businesses the confidence to take up new technology Minister Clare Curran is in the process of creating the position of Chief Technology Officer CTO who will report directly to the Prime Minister and Cabinet The CTO will be responsible for introducing and managing a National Digital Architecture and Digital Technology Roadmap They will also work with the wider industry to develop ingenuity and creativity in the ICT sector Our aim is for the ICT industry to be our second largest contributor to GDP by 2025 Learning For LifeThe other critical element of a just transition to this new world of work is how we support people to gain the relevant skills and knowledge We need to both support those workers whose jobs are under threat and prepare those who are yet to start working for the kind of labour market they are likely to enter New Zealand currently spends a fraction of what other countries do on active labour market policies Other countries around the world such as Singapore France and Germany have recognised that they need to both plan ahead for the changes but also provide greater support for people who are displaced by technological change The Future of Work was the catalyst for our three years free training and education policy One of this Government s key policies is to provide one year of free post secondary education or training gradually progressing to 3 years by 2025 In 2018 we will see 30 000 students enrolled in tertiary education courses and 50 000 in industry training without paying fees for their first year of education thanks to this policy This is extremely important for those whose jobs or future jobs are affected by automation and other technologies One aspect of this policy has not had a lot of attention which is for adults who have never trained or studied before They will be able to take up the three years free policy as it is rolled out This can be taken in short bursts or as complete re training This policy also covers the costs of those undertaking apprenticeships and aspects of industry training Because of the relative costs from 2018 this means two years free for apprentices right away For the next generation of people entering the workforce it is essential they are given the skills to be resilient and adaptable In the Future of Work Commission s time we heard from employer after employer that they were looking for people with what we once called soft skills the ability to collaborate be creative and solve problems These ideas lie at the heart of New Zealand s education curriculum but there is work to do to ensure they are developed for all our young people We will be embarking on a host of initiatives to see this happen including reform of our careers advice and guidance in schools to give all young people the opportunity to understand and experience the world of work This will be developed in close cooperation with business and training providers to create a more seamless transition from school to whatever comes next In January Employment Minister Willie Jackson announced the first of a series of initiatives to help give a group of young people who have fallen outside of the system sustainable work opportunities Sadly Maori and Pacifika young people are over represented among this group They are the most at risk of being excluded from the future of work and we need practical programmes that provide work experience to get them back into a training journey In the long term I believe we will need to radically alter the way we think about training and learning and work if we are to continue to lift productivity As the pace of technological change picks up we need to see ourselves as genuinely learning for life In many ways jobs will be events on that learning and training journey rather than the other way around This presents a series of challenges and opportunities for our education and training system that we will look at over the coming years There are of course many other areas of policy response that will contribute to our response to the Future of Work but I wanted to finish today on what systemic changes we will need to ensure we are leading the change rather than being passive recipients of it Active and Capable StateA critical element identified in our Future of Work report is that the state needs to be an active participant in how we shape the future of work It is important to note that by active I do not mean that it controls or dictates what happens but rather that we move beyond the tired and dangerous idea that we can simply leave the response to market forces to decide how New Zealand fares in the future world of work This means working alongside businesses to identify opportunities as noted above in the R and D and Tech sectors for example It means developing a new partnership between the Crown and Maori as the settlement of historic Treaty breaches comes to an end and opportunities for economic development emerge It also means being innovative and entrepreneurial when that is appropriate We are wanting public servants to co design with both politicians and the wider community what we can do to stay ahead of the curve A major example of this is the Provincial Growth Fund developed as part of our coalition agreement with New Zealand First This will see significant investments in the regions of New Zealand to grow sustainable and productive job opportunities The details of the Fund are to be released shortly and will provide some of the most significant development of our regions in decades These will be driven from the ground up with the Government as an active partner A New Social PartnershipIt is my strong belief that the most critical element to New Zealand succeeding in the Future of Work is a renewed social partnership between businesses workers and the government In the course of our Commission we saw examples in both large and small businesses of innovative approaches to this idea Air New Zealand s High Performance Engagement model is one useful example By involving workers in the full range of strategic decisions and change processes Air New Zealand has not only seen significant productivity benefits they have created far more harmonious workplace relations In a number of the new smaller technology businesses we have seen flat management structures and workplace democracy in action that is core to the way they run their businesses These companies give a significant voice to their employees and have seen productivity growth and improved workplace relations as a result We are working with MBIE and others to facilitate these approaches across a range of industries We can also see innovations happening in the way we work An example which has grabbed attention recently is Perpetual Guardian s decision to switch to trial a four day working week for five days pay The move was designed to improve workers wellbeing by giving them more time to spend with family and on other aspects of life with the expectation that this will enhance their productivity during the days they do work the same levels of output for fewer hours worked These are the kinds of practices that we need to see more of If we look at Germany as an example union members often sit on company boards as part of the decision making process ensuring that employee wellbeing is considered alongside high level corporate profit and financial targets It is unsurprising then that German workers on average worked the fewest hours annually in 2016 of all OECD countries with New Zealand workers on average doing 400 more hours every year This is possible because Germany s workers are also some of the most productive in the world I want to see New Zealand reach a point where we are able to work 400 fewer hours a year while producing more than we do today For us to get there we need to make the advances in productivity we have been discussing today Technological improvements will play a huge role in this One of my goals as Minister of Finance is to develop this new partnership at a system wide level to promote a combined work stream on how we can apply these lessons to other industries and sectors My parting challenge to the many public servants here today is to think about how we can do this across Government and break down some of the silos we have created to enable businesses and workers and their representatives to easily engage in such a partnership ConclusionI am most certainly not the first New Zealand politician to both highlight the challenge of low productivity nor to say that we will address it So the proof will be in what we actually do But we are in an environment that has change occurring at a pace and scale we have never seen before We have to take the opportunity now to capitalise on that to finally make the leaps that have so far eluded our country We have already made a start with the initiatives I have mentioned today I want us to re write our productivity story so that New Zealand becomes a leading example of a sustainable and productive economy in which everyone gets a share of economic success We have a long way to go but this Government is committed to tackling the long term challenges that this country has faced for many years I look forward to working with you on this journey Thank you CommentFor many people artificial intelligence conjures up images of sci fi movies and the future They see it as a threat to their jobs and sometimes even their safety but AI represents the biggest leap forward in terms of work productivity since the personal computer and few other industries can benefit from AI as much as government With AI we can change the way government works and help employees do their job better AI is already integrated into numerous cloud platforms and can be used to discover new information and deliver outcomes instantly I like to refer to this as practical AI AI has the potential to improve employee experiences by speeding up decision making and automating mundane and repetitive tasks Bringing machine learning to everyday work enables government agencies and departments to make better decisions faster because they do not have to hunt for data and aggregate it into a spreadsheet By building intelligence into platforms AI helps manage complex workflows and allows organizations to One way that AI will be applied in the workplace is automating service requests Most companies have an IT service desk as well as a customer support center These functions ensure that customers and employees receive help in a timely manner whether it is a request for a new computer a password reset or the status of a repair Manually triaging thousands of incidents or cases categorizing tasks and routing work can consume resources introduce human error and slow resolution In fact a new report from Accenture found that customer support functions spend up to 12 percent of their time categorizing prioritizing and assigning tickets Meanwhile AI accurately categorizes requests nearly instantly It eliminates the bottleneck created by agents having to manually assign categorize and route requests A full two days a week is wasted on manual administrative work according to the recent State of Work survey conducted by ServiceNow If an agency with 5 000 people automated those processes they could get 4 million work hours back a year Adding AI frees up employees to do the work they want to do spurring creativity Nearly half of respondents 48 percent said work levels increased by 20 percent or more after they adopted AI solutions Additionally 91 percent of executives say their skilled employees spend too much time on admin tasks and 93 percent believe that reducing mundane tasks unleashes employee creativity To properly implement AI solutions across government agencies we need to define which tasks are best suited for humans and which ones should be performed by AI The government has a term inherently governmental to describe work processes or decisions that must be done by government employees Contractors do much of the work in our government agencies but certain work is inherently governmental in nature As we move into an age defined by AI we need to identify and define the work processes and decisions that are inherently human We are going to increasingly work in a blended workplace with AI systems and humans working together to achieve a mission There are certain activities within any work environment that can only be performed or should only be performed by humans While there may be many more human activities designated as inherently human in the beginning I believe that as humans become more comfortable with the role of AI in the blended workforce less and less work will be designated as inherently human There will always be a need for humans to remain in charge from factual responsibility and liability aspects as well as from emotional and psychological ones We spend a third of our lives at work It shapes who we are how we feel and how we interact with the world so we must create great work experiences and this is what AI does AI creates work experiences that unleash productivity bringing out the best in us Rather than fearing machines stealing jobs we need to understand how AI will change the way government works though small but practical ways and prepare the

that has IT at its core Advanced SearchSign up for our newsletter I agree to this site s Privacy Policy If machines can do something better than people can it would be senseless to hold back progress for fear of lost jobs Finding or inventing a new job however is harder than it once was At the pinnacle of technological progress man becomes a god New machines and software are continually forged in man s image and taught to do things that once only people could do A day will come when man s machines surpass their creators in their capacity to do and to think and it will be at that technological singularity that the economy will double on a weekly basis and mankind will become peripheral to a new reality and consciousness beyond human comprehension Conservative estimates place that date at about 100 years from now but in the meantime there are smaller fish to fry The American middle class is shrinking and it s technology that s causing it It s not all bad The gains in efficiency begotten by automation have been great for productivity And productivity means progress It always has Since the Industrial Revolution began around 1760 new technologies have been stealing jobs and since 1760 people have responded by finding or inventing new jobs that contemporary technologies couldn t do It s a good system in the long term everyone benefits from technological progress and while the workers losing their jobs in the interim might feel a bit miffed people have always found a way to bounce back into an ever adapting economy Besides if machines can do something better than people can it would be senseless to ignore such utility and hold back progress for fear of a few temporarily lost jobs Unfortunately for today s average worker finding or inventing a new job is harder than it once was When economists look back they see that it was around 1999 when something changed Productivity kept going up but where in the past median household income and employment per capita would have also hitched along they instead diverged Median household income is on a steep decline employment isn t bouncing back strongly after the Great Recession and a greater percentage of Americans now identify themselves as lower class than at any point in history Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson director and professor respectively at the MIT Sloan School of Management named this divergence of productivity and employment the great decoupling Technology is a broad term It can be equally applied to a stick being used by a chimpanzee to extract insects from the Earth and to a rocket launching a chimpanzee into suborbital flight above the Earth Today s technologies are more scalable and complex than the machines people needed to outsmart in the past which is a big reason for the decoupling Surveying a county road in 1998 meant that a team of workers needed to get into a pickup truck with a government seal on the side of it drive take photos and measurements of the area return to the office and assess the information that was gathered Researchers at the Michigan Tech Research Institute found in 2013 that it s much easier to just send a drone They also developed software that takes the sensory data gathered by the drone and generates a fully characterized 3 D model People are still needed in the process to make high level decisions and babysit the technology when things go wrong but not as many people are needed And even fewer will be necessary if the researchers concept is honed and commercialized The trouble is that the guy who once rode along in the pickup truck is now unemployed and he doesn t know how to design drones or code 3 D modeling software The average American is looking more and more like that guy A study by two researchers at the Oxford Martin School concludes that within the next 20 years or so approximately 47 percent of all jobs could be replaced by automation Technology is racing ahead but our skills our organizations our institutions aren t keeping up Brynjolfsson said As they adjust we will see more of the benefit show up in the economics but right now there are a lot of technologies with more potential than has been fully realized This trend is just getting started A lot of economists technologists and policymakers agree with McAfee and Brynjolfsson but some say today s technologies aren t special people will find new jobs just as they always have and no intervention is needed It s just the recession they say To understand why that s not the case people need to look closely at today s technology Brynjolfsson said For example there are prototypes of autonomous vehicles on the roads Legislators in Nevada California Florida and Michigan have penned laws allowing the vehicles limited public use and some estimate that almost all vehicular traffic will be autonomous by 2050 In a recent span of two months Google purchased eight robotics and machine learning companies not just because the technology will make cars drive themselves but because smart robots can improve productivity across almost all of the company s businesses The problem with this extremely fast progress is that people are relatively slow Although it won t happen overnight today s 233 000 taxi drivers and 1 7 million truck drivers aren t ready to become an anachronism In addition decoupling means the upper 1 percent gets a bigger piece of a growing pie Brynjolfsson said which also accounts for the shrinking middle class A lot of these digital technologies have winner take all or winner take most economics where you can get a small group of people producing a better piece of software or insight and once they ve digitized that they can replicate it 10 times or a hundred million times and dominate the market for that he said You can see it in checkout counter software you can see it in tax preparation software there are 17 percent fewer tax preparers than there were a few years ago you can see it in airline reservations In more and more categories software is eating the world Software can give legal advice analyze data and automate data entry and robots like IBM s Watson can even diagnose and recommend accurate cancer treatments much better than humans can One study showed that Watson can diagnose lung cancer accurately 90 percent of the time compared to a measly 50 percent rate for human doctors There s no economic law that says everyone is going to benefit from technological progress even if it does make the pie a lot bigger Brynjolfsson said So both in terms of theory and evidence I think there s a potential to be concerned and I am concerned Amazon spent 775 million buying out Kiva Systems in 2012 the maker of a disc shaped robot used in warehousing Today Amazon uses the robots to fetch pallets of goods saving workers the time and energy of running around to find products themselves The purchase came soon after a report showing that some Amazon warehouse workers were walking 10 to 15 miles per shift Most workers are probably grateful that their job is now to pack goods and do various administrative tasks rather than play fetch all day but on the other hand Amazon doesn t need as many human employees now If technology gets automatic and simple enough it will eventually just be one guy in the Bahamas running the company from his smartphone That might seem far fetched but it was in living memory that the idea of autonomous vehicles and talking robots were science fiction Now those technologies border on pass Researchers from MIT s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory are developing a theoretical model and algorithms that would let robots like the ones used by Amazon communicate more intelligently with one another so they can solve logistical problems on the fly and also communicate with other sensory agents in the environment human and otherwise Once robots can talk to each other and solve problems on their own even fewer people will be needed in those warehouses When robots like Baxter a 25 000 production line worker with a calm demeanor get cheap enough even sweatshop workers will be out of a job What the Industrial Revolution did for muscle power Brynjolfsson said the second machine age is doing for brain power and especially so in government As you automate and augment a lot of mental tasks it s a little less clear whether those technologies will be complements or maybe substitutes for human labor and that s one of the things we re working through now as a society Brynjolfsson said Government jobs on average tend to include more information processing and on average the workers in that sector are more educated and doing more knowledge work than in a lot of other parts of the economy So they in some ways are likely to be more affected Today s robots are very poor at doing some things such as folding laundry as one YouTube video confirms and even worse at others like offering compassion to a young student or making a sound moral decision as a police officer Those traditionally human skills are expected to gradually improve in robots but in the meantime data analytics and the Internet of Things provide a waypoint for progress Facilities like the Domain Awareness Center now being constructed in Oakland Calif will make monitoring cities for crime and dispatching help a more efficient process Likewise predictive crime software is a rising trend in law enforcement in many cities Making better use of data and distributed sensor networks means that fewer officers will be needed to cover a given geographic area because officers are better informed and more efficient Even if it s not the extreme scenario of Robocop taking over for human police officers technology finds gains in efficiency everywhere and the cost is usually displacing human jobs Some are optimistic about what all this means for the world and others less so but to take either position is to accept that technological progress has a foregone conclusion Brynjolfsson said and it doesn t It s been said that the best idea America ever had was mass public education he said That helped us make the transition from an agricultural economy to one based on industry and services It didn t happen by accident it happened through public policy We re going to have to reinvent what education is and focus more on creativity and interpersonal skills things that machines are not very good at and less on having people sit quietly in rows listen to instructions and carry out those instructions Nicco Mele agreed that education and government policy need to be revolutionized and that s why he teaches future policymakers at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government Mele is a consultant to the Fortune 1000 and was named by Esquire as one of America s best and brightest Modern technology Mele said compels us to rethink the assumptions of every discipline Look at our health care policy look at our retirement policy he said Those policies are built on this assumption that people have 9 to 5 jobs and stay with one employer their whole lives That s profoundly not true for the American workforce and hasn t been true for well over a decade A third of American workers are self employed and another third are contingently employed which means only about a third of the workforce has a traditional 9 to 5 job Yet our policymakers and our politicians are building all the policy on the assumption that this is a good way to do it American policymakers are on average older and richer but they also tend to know less about technology care less about technology and delegate technological responsibilities to others Mele said and this is unacceptable in a world where tech influences everything Imagine a state legislator saying I don t think about money I don t worry about money I don t worry about the tax rate I don t worry about the budget I just let accountants deal with it We d kick them out of office right That s not an acceptable answer and we need that same kind of expectation technologically he said The idea that tech is separate from the rest of the world is rooted in a past era where digital technology was less prevalent Today there are remnants everywhere of that old way of thinking that reinforce technological illiteracy in some of government s most critical positions Mele said One of the things I hate most in the world is the Genius Bar at Apple because it sets up this dichotomy he said It sets up this world where they re geniuses and we have to just do what they tell us People must demand that their leaders be technologically literate Mele said because it s profoundly dangerous to have elected officials or policymakers who don t have any technical literacy to evaluate what s going on A recent Gartner report identified that 60 percent of CEOs dismiss the idea that automated and smart technologies could displace a huge percentage of jobs in the next 15 years Michael Armstrong CIO of Corpus Christi Texas is not a denier of the second machine age s power and influence As a CIO Armstrong said the best one can hope for is to influence policymakers The coming years will bring incredible new changes he said Advances in 3 D printing have applications in medicine and other fields that haven t even been realized yet Advances in prosthesis are allowing people to live longer and there are even philosophical questions being opened up about what it means to be human The Shadow Robot Co based in London spent 1 million building the Bionic Man a robot composed entirely of artificial body parts and internal organs Life is changing fast for everyone I think we re hitting the knee of the curve and things are getting exponential Armstrong said Make sure that you understand and your leadership understands what is happening in these areas and what the implications are because that s going to drive social policy and government policy to a huge degree A lot of this stuff is happening very quietly Government has been shrinking for so long that s been an accepted way of doing business I think this is not going to leave anyone alone One way or another it s going to affect us all he said In any kind of revolution we always lose jobs but there s always been something to replace all those jobs and that may not be the case this time Colin wrote for Government Technology from 2010 through most

invitation only events Commission has been asked to consider the potential impacts of rapid technological changeMinister of finance Grant Robertson has asked the Productivity Commission to examine and report on technological change disruption and the future of work in a project to be undertaken jointly with the Australian Productivity Commission The move follows the launch last August of a joint Australia NZ project focused on growing the digital economy and maximising opportunities for small and medium sized enterprises The minister said the commission had been asked to consider the potential impacts of rapid technological change and its impact on the future of work and the workforce in New Zealand to help inform future government policy so the opportunities presented by disruptive technologies for economic productivity and social prosperity could be realised and the risks managed The commission said its earlier joint project had been designed to explore how institutional and regulatory settings in the two countries could support the use of digital technology and in particular how small and medium enterprises could maximise the opportunities from digital transformation NZ Productivity Commission director Judy Kavanagh said the joint report had highlighted the challenges and opportunities presented by the digital economy In this new mandate the commission will provide recommendations that will help manage the likely impacts of wider technological disruption and change on the future of work the workforce labour markets productivity and wellbeing She said the commission s work would be informed by the knowledge and insights of all sectors of the economy and society The Commission will be speaking with public bodies unions businesses academics and other interested parties to better understand the impacts of technological change on the future of work In his instructions to the commission Robertson said well designed and coordinated government responses could allow New Zealand to fully realise the potential of disruptive technologies for economic productivity and social prosperity improve the services provided by government and increase the efficiency and effectiveness with which government functions He said it would also enable the Government to provide an enabling environment without unnecessary barriers to desirable change while effectively managing risks and help to prepare New Zealand for any rapid labour displacement and distributional impacts Given the uncertainty around future technology and its impact the inquiry is not expected to make detailed quantified predictions of impacts Robertson said Rather it should give a sense of the nature and relative scale of impacts in different scenarios The inquiry should have a long term focus with recommendations that can be implemented in the short to medium term It should provide a resource for government to develop policies and programmes that make the most of the technological opportunities on offer and allow New Zealanders to face an uncertain future with confidence The Commission s final report to the Government is due on 31 March 2020 Sign up to gain

EngineeringInstitute of MedicineNational Research CouncilSince Abraham Lincoln approved the Congressional charter of the National Academy of Sciences in 1863 the Academy complex now made up of the National Academy of Sciences the National Academy of Engineering the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council has been advising government about the impact of science and technology on society The Academy complex provides independent advice to government by appointing committees of experts who serve without compensation asking these committees to prepare draft reports by consensus and subjecting these drafts to rigorous independent scientific review before release to ensure their quality and integrity To avoid potential conflict of interest and bias careful attention is given to the composition and balance of study committees As the 21st century approaches with science and technology assuming increasing importance in society the Governing Board of the National Research Council has synthesized summarized and highlighted principal conclusions and recommendations from recent reports to inform decisions in a number of key policy matters The resulting series of papers do not address all the intersections of science and technology with public policy but they do address some of the most important They are directed to federal administrators members of Congress university administrators leaders of nongovernmental organizations and all others involved in the development and implementation of public policies involving science and technology This paper focuses on government policies regarding technology development and proposes measures to facilitate the translation of new knowledge to new capabilities Another paper in this series Science and Engineering Research in a Changing World describes policies that can strengthen linkages between science and engineering research and national objectives Previous reports from the Academy complex have had a major effect on the technology activities and policies of the federal government For example two 19th century reports provided advice on restoring the Declaration of Independence and controlling landslides during the construction of the Panama Canal The issues summarized in this paper from past reports continue to be relevant to the work of the Academy complex and to the nation This document with direct links to the text of all reports cited herein is available on the Internet at http www2 nas edu 21st A box at the end describes other ways to obtain information on the Academy complex and the topics discussed in this paper PREPARING FOR THE 21st CENTURYTECHNOLOGY AND THE NATION S FUTUREPrivate firms have the primary responsibility for the development and adoption of technology in this country but federal and state governments play an important role in enhancing civilian technology development and adoption through their economic regulatory and trade policies their support for research and development and their own procurement of technology As the 20th century draws to a close the technological landscape is changing The United States is now only one of several technologically powerful nations The end of the Cold War has heightened the importance of commercial technologies in maintaining both economic and military security New technologies depend increasingly on scientific and engineering knowledge this interdependence strengthens the reciprocal links between understanding and capability In the United States technology development and adoption occur through a complex system that encompasses many individuals and organizations Researchers in academic government and industrial laboratories create new knowledge on which many advanced technologies are based Colleges and universities educate new generations of scientists and engineers who will put that knowledge to work Private companies invest financial and human resources in developing new technologies and adapting existing technologies to meet perceived needs Several key objectives set forth in Academy complex reports can help guide the development and implementation of public policies related to technology Among these objectives are the following When Captain Scott O Grady parachuted into Bosnia Herzegovina after his F 16 fighter was shot down in 1995 he carried in his vest a portable radio receiver tuned to a network of 24 satellites known as the Global Positioning System GPS While hiding in the woods O Grady used the receiver to determine his position behind enemy lines longitude latitude and altitude to within a few tens of meters and he was able to signal that information to the Marines who successfully rescued him GPS technology originated in the creation of atomic clocks for studying relativity and Einsteinian physics It first found use in military applications including the Gulf War GPS technology became commercially available a few years ago and since then the range of its applications has been exploding Delivery and emergency vehicles now use GPS to pinpoint destinations and map their routes Shipping companies and private boaters use GPS for navigation Commercial airlines have saved billions of dollars by honing their flight plans with GPS The current worldwide market for GPS receivers and technology is already estimated at over 2 billion and is expected to grow to over 30 billion in the next 10 years For more information The Global Positioning System National Academy of Sciences 1996The most important role of government in technology development and adoption is maintaining an environment conducive to private sector innovation and investment Many policies affect that environment including policies on taxes trade investment patents product liability environmental and consumer protection international arms control and human resources Those policies have multiple and sometimes competing aims By explicitly recognizing the effects of public policies on technology development and adoption government could better integrate its pursuit of technological economic and social objectives A 1 The government s economic and regulatory policies have an especially broad influence on technology development and adoption For example government policies help to determine levels of investment in the economy which in turn drives productivity economic growth and job creation Public and private investment in research and development leads to new products and processes that can spur productivity and investment in new facilities and equipment gives companies an opportunity to incorporate more productive technologies into their operations Private investment is closely related to the level of public and private saving in the economy and today the levels of both saving and investment are severely inadequate As a percentage of gross domestic product GDP public and private saving has been below 3 since 1990 compared with norms of 8 10 among other industrial countries 20 in Japan Half the saving shortfall in this country is a result of the need to fund the federal budget deficit The other half results from a low and declining rate of private saving by households and companies The resulting low level of investment will not sustain a growth in productivity sufficient to meet Americans legitimate expectations for an improving standard of living As an example of how government policies can have both beneficial and harmful effects on technology development and adoption consider today s policies governing standards and conformity assessment the testing and certifying of products and processes for their conformity to standards A wide range of federal state and local government agencies are involved in developing standards for products processes services interfaces and materials and in assessing conformity to standards Unnecessary duplication and complexity among government policies especially in conformity assessment have led to increasing costs and burdens for manufacturers procurement agencies testing laboratories product certifiers and consumers Government agencies should increase their use of private sector consensus standards for both regulatory and procurement purposes and cooperate more effectively with private sector standards developers For example the Department of Defense s experience in procurement reform indicates that relying on commercial standards instead of government unique standards can substantially reduce acquisition costs Recent legislation P L 104 113 implemented National Research Council recommendations to extend and strengthen this policy throughout the federal government In addition conformity assessment is performed most efficiently and effectively by the private sector To simplify the system and lower costs the federal government should immediately begin to phase out its conformity assessment activities and to rely instead on private testing certification and accreditation services that are recognized as competent by the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST NIST also should work with state and local governments to eliminate duplication at those levels For more information To address the saving shortfall the administration and Congress should set benchmarks for private investment net saving and productivity growth A 2 Moving toward saving and investment rates of 8 10 of GDP over a 3 10 year period would contribute measurably to enhancing productivity and economic growth in the United States These benchmarks do not need to be achieved immediately but public officials need to set goals and develop a public consensus behind them so that the actions needed to move toward the goals are not crowded out by short term pressures Structural changes in US tax policy would be the most direct and effective way to increase investment and saving While retaining the progressivity of the tax structure the United States should move toward a system in which saving and investment are taxed less and consumption is taxed more A 2 Efforts to reduce the cost of capital in the United States and to emphasize long term investments also could boost saving and investment rates For more information on government s climate setting role In some cases government has a compelling rationale for directly enhancing the development and adoption of technologies For example federal and state agencies pursue a number of public missions that depend heavily on technological advances such as safeguarding public health ensuring national security and protecting the environment In the past technologies developed with public funds to meet those government missions often have had important commercial applications For example federal R D funding and procurement contributed substantially to the development of such high technology products as airframes and aircraft engines a wide range of pharmaceuticals and biomedical devices satellites semiconductors computers biotechnology and nuclear power In select cases the government also has a rationale for supporting the development of commercial technologies beyond those explicitly linked to federal agency missions For example there is a role for government in facilitation of the development of path breaking technologies those with the potential to create major new industries or transform existing industries and thereby yield high returns to society as a whole but whose development poses risks too high to attract sufficient private sector investment Examples of past and present path breaking technologies are nuclear medicine biotechnology semiconductors aircraft engines and communication satellites Similarly government has a role in facilitating the development of infrastructural technologies those that enhance the performance of a broad spectrum of firms in the near to intermediate term but do not offer sufficient private returns Examples of these technologies are the development of engineering methods compilation and validation of technical data measurement tools and the refinement of manufacturing processes Identifying technologies that meet those criteria is difficult and requires a combined public private effort The federal government should work with the private sector to ensure that the United States has world class capabilities in technologies that promise to have a major and continuing impact on broad areas of industrial and economic performance B 1 But the government need not invest in fields in which the private sector already has programs of development in place B 2 The concept of a government role in subsidizing the development of commercial technologies is controversial Firms motivated by market forces and judged by their performance in satisfying demand have a better record than governments of investing in new technologies with large commercial payoffs Insulated from market forces and critical evaluation government support for commercial technologies risks being influenced more by political than by economic considerations B 3 To sustain public support for technology development government needs to develop criteria and mechanisms for evaluation feedback and institutional learning so that successes and failures can be identified and better understood Government must be prepared to discard programs that do not work and reallocate resources to programs that do Government R D efforts also should avoid competition with commercial firms government can then work more effectively with market forces and the private sector to leverage national strengths in science and technology to the enhancement of US productivity and economic growth B 2 For more information on government support of commercial technologies The Academy complex has not conducted a comparative analysis of public and private sector responsibilities in civilian technology But it has analyzed the roles of private and public organizations in several technological fields These analyses point toward a number of ways in which government can play a constructive role in technology development and dissemination A notable example involves information technologies Over the last 5 decades information technologies have grown to a 500 billion industry and the personal computer has become a defining symbol of our age In 1945 it was not known that computers would become a revolutionary device that would profoundly affect industry commerce the financial world government science education communications entertainment and society as a whole Today information technology and its applications continue to advance steadily Computers and communication technology will become even more valuable to society as they are increasingly able to recognize and simulate speech build huge automated libraries control robots and even create virtual worlds where people can learn work shop and be entertained The federal government has supported the development of information technologies in a number of ways In the early days of the industry government procurement especially for defense and space applications was a powerful influence on technological advances Government also has funded a broad spectrum of research and development from basic computer science to the development of prototype technologies including the advanced networks that evolved into the Internet Today it is continuing to invest in a variety of new ideas and approaches For example the federal government supported the development of the Mosaic browser for the World Wide Web which has led to the development of several commercial products that have greatly increased access to resources on the Internet The private sector will remain the principal source of research and development in information technology But to ensure continued US leadership in information technology the federal government needs to maintain strong support for a broadly based program of research C 1 Although sometimes the benefits from publicly supported research programs in information technology have been of unexpected types the record of accomplishments suggests that government investment in computing and communications research has been very productive and has yielded high social returns despite the high risk involved It is important to maintain the information infrastructure The competitive drive of private industry will dominate the process by which the National Information Infrastructure NII evolves Private firms will build it their business plans must justify the investments and competition and the desire for new markets not a pursuit of abstract visions or societal goals will define and shape it That reality provides the impetus that will make the NII happen at the same time it triggers many fears and concerns In this context opinions differ considerably on whether there is an appropriate government role in advancing the NII and if so what it is Most people can agree that an ideal information infrastructure would have such qualities as extended interoperability broad accessibility and support for broad participation It would also allow multiple channels for many to many communications and information sharing as well as one to one communications familiar today through telephony and one to many communications familiar through broadcast and cable television Progress toward that ideal is more likely if the government can set an example with its own services and help to promote a consensus on a vision of the future by removing barriers to its realization C 2 Government also has a major influence on information technologies in its roles as customer publisher regulator arbiter conveyer of public interests and leader in the interest of equity and a productive society For example although most communications standards are developed in the private sector government is an essential partner New forms of communication such as teleconferencing and electronic mail publications and bulletin boards raise tough questions For example who is liable when someone posts a defamatory message pornography or copyrighted material on a publicly accessible electronic bulletin board What is the role of regulation and law versus that of ethics informal norms of community behavior and the marketplace Government will be a key player in building on existing traditions and rules to accommodate new media and new forms of human expression Cryptography is one important tool for protecting information that is very difficult for governments to control Cryptography supports the confidentiality and integrity of digitally represented information such as computer data software and video and the authentication of individuals and computer systems communicating with other computer systems these capabilities are important in varied degrees for protecting the information security interests of many different private and public stakeholders including law enforcement and national security Furthermore cryptography can help to support law enforcement objectives in preventing information crimes such as economic espionage Current national cryptography policy is not adequate to support the information security requirements of an information society US national policy should be changed to support the broad use of cryptography in ways that take into account competing US needs and desires for individual privacy international economic competitiveness law enforcement national security and world leadership The framework for national cryptography policy should provide coherent structure and reduce uncertainty for potential vendors and nongovernment and government users of cryptography in ways that it does not today For example no law should bar the manufacture sale or use of any form of encryption within the United States Furthermore national cryptography policy affecting the development and use of commercial cryptography should be more closely aligned with market forces And export controls on cryptography should be progressively relaxed but not eliminated For more information Rapid progress toward a harmonious national environment of interrelated information services and capabilities would be valuable to the nation A rational set of public and private services is unlikely to emerge from the action of market forces alone However the proper role for the government is to be a partner and participant with the private sector and to exercise its regulatory authority with restraint Another industrial enterprise in which government support for basic research and technology development has contributed substantially to US industrial leadership is aeronautics In recent years foreign aircraft manufacturers have made inroads into the global aircraft market to the detriment of US interests Foreign governments in close relationships with their aircraft industries have invested heavily in the basic aeronautics research and technology that is necessary for developing and maintaining a competitive posture meeting future constraints on air traffic management and reducing the environmental impact of aircraft Technology alone does not ensure economic success in the aircraft industry but without competitive technology US manufacturers will fail economically The federal government needs to work with commercial interests and universities to define the aeronautics technologies with the greatest potential payoff and work in a concerted fashion toward their development C 3 Government cannot adequately address the needs of industry unless industry is involved from the beginning By the same token cooperative programs can be structured so as not to jeopardize the autonomy of basic research or the constraints of fair trade New biomedical technologies often derive from the combined efforts of the public and private sectors Academic government and industrial laboratories are all involved in the development of many new technologies and ideas and people flow quickly among all three types of institutions Efforts to control cost and regulate health care should be designed to encourage continued technological discovery and experimentation How services are provided and goods are produced delivered used and disposed of affect the environment An ecology of industry that is characterized by entire systems of production and consumption is a concept that can be used to enhance environmental quality Advances in technology applied usually by private firms present the primary opportunities for improvement within these integrated systems There are also opportunities for societies to become less resource dependent and to develop and deploy environmentally safer materials processes and systems using technologies that are more environmentally sensitive Corporate decisions and the personal choices of consumers are important determinants of environmental quality Policymakers need to formulate effective economic incentives to foster a systems approach to improving environmental quality C 5 In particular they need to reduce liability barriers and regulatory barriers and develop ways of providing consumers with credible information about environmental impacts via such actions as marketing and labeling C 6 C 7 The Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles PNGV a cooperative R D program between the federal government and the US Council for Automotive Research has the goal of developing technologies for a new generation of vehicles that could achieve fuel mileage up to three times that of comparable 1994 family sedans At the same time the new vehicles should maintain performance size utility and ownership and operating costs and should meet and exceed federal safety and emissions requirements The intent of the program is to develop production prototype vehicles by 2004 The PNGV program also aims to improve national competitiveness in manufacturing substantially and to implement commercially sustainable innovation of conventional vehicles The United States enjoys the world s most effective and most extensive road transportation system Over 175 million passenger cars and light trucks travel more than 2 billion miles a year on 3 9 million miles of public roads Some extremely attractive technologies under consideration for the PNGV have the potential to introduce large changes in the demands on the infrastructure which will result in requirements for new capital labor and natural resources The extent of these changes will vary widely depending on body and structural materials power plants and energy storage systems The PNGV must continue to address infrastructure issues as an integral part of its program A careful assessment of infrastructure issues associated with alternative technologies should be an essential part of the technology selection process C 8 As a final example of the government s varied roles in technology development consider the collection and use of the geographic information that describes the arrangement and attributes of features and phenomena on the earth known as spatial data Many federal state and local agencies and private organizations generate and use such data for many purposes including agriculture land use planning and environmental management An entity called the National Spatial Data Infrastructure acquires processes stores and distributes the information Data sharing can minimize duplication reduce long term costs and streamline analysis and decision making The public and private sectors should work together to integrate the collection use and distribution of spatial data into the National Spatial Data Infrastructure C 9 An integrated system would eliminate much of the overlap and duplication that occur today while creating many new opportunities for the use of spatial information For more information on the role of government in the development of the above technologies The skills capacity for continuous learning and effective management of a nation s workforce largely determine the nation s ability to attract and retain high value added high skill industries and its ability to absorb and exploit new technology for economic benefit US producers of goods and services must adopt more productive approaches to the organization of work and the management and motivation of their workforce if they expect to cultivate and take advantage of their employees skills ingenuity and creativity The United States has one of the largest most diversified but poorly coordinated training enterprises in the world In the United States work related training and continuing education are provided by a broad spectrum of private and public institutions including 2 year colleges and technical institutions noncollegiate postsecondary vocational schools 4 year colleges and universities apprenticeship programs professional associations unions vendors and employers Across this vast and diverse training enterprise there are few common standards the quality of training is uneven and important subsets of the nation s current and potential workforce are poorly served particularly with regard to job related training and continuing education within industry The United States should foster the timely adoption and effective use of commercially valuable technology throughout the economy by supporting experimentation at the federal state and local levels with a wide range of public and private initiatives for increasing the quantity and quality of school to work transition programs and of job related training and continuing education for the nation s workforce D 1 For more information on gaps in workforce training and continuing education Policies that influence the development and adoption of technologies must reflect two mutually reinforcing trends that build global networks of R D production and marketing 1 expanding international trade foreign direct investment and corporate alliances and 2 converging technological capabilities of the industrialized nations Economic and technical interdependence among nations is growing and this increasing interdependence is creating both opportunities and challenges for the private and public sectors It opens doors to new markets new technologies and new sources of competition which spur the creativity and productivity of US companies and workers Many of the fastest growing markets are now in other countries and increasing openness in trade gives companies opportunities to compete in those markets International interdependence also helps to disseminate new technologies and management practices All those factors can contribute to productivity increases wealth generation employment growth and higher standards of living in the United States At the same time deepening interdependence has accelerated the pace of structural and organizational change within the US economy and has increased demands on individuals organizations and communities to adapt to changing circumstances Those able to respond to demands can reap significant benefits but those unable to adapt quickly and effectively can suffer severe economic hardships The loss of control over national markets that is associated with international interdependence also can greatly complicate the task of advancing national interests economic political and military In addition shifts in the balance of economic and technological strength among nations can raise concerns about access to markets and technological assets High technology products and their development require particular attention in light of their importance to the national economy and because these industries are the target of industrial policies of many participants in the multilateral trading system A particular challenge that has been intensified by international interdependence involves the protection of intellectual property Today the competitiveness of many firms is determined by their ability to develop commercialize and most important capture the economic benefits of innovations Intellectual property rights such as patent rights and copyrights allow firms to protect their investments in innovation and R D But with innovations traveling so quickly around the globe protection of intellectual property rights needs to extend internationally to maintain current incentives for companies to innovate and invest in R D E 1 E 2 Growing international interdependence is not without its costs but on balance this trend is a positive force both for the United States and for the rest of the world Furthermore it cannot be reversed or slowed substantially without unacceptable cost to the American people and the rest of the world The critical question is how to respond to the trend more effectively so that we can maximize the associated benefits reduce the associated costs and find ways to distribute both the benefits and costs of globalization more equitably at home A case in point is the growing involvement of foreign companies researchers and students in US R D Through transnational alliances and direct investment in US companies foreign firms are increasingly engaged in the US industrial R D base Similarly foreign students researchers and firms are becoming more and more involved in publicly funded R D performed in US research universities and federal laboratories Some policymakers and business leaders noting the extent to which foreign researchers and companies draw upon the US R D enterprise have expressed concern about the transfer of technologies developed in the United States to other countries and about a corresponding loss of opportunities to US citizens The concern is intensified when the technologies have potential national security implications or when the foreign entities involved originate in countries that deny US citizens reciprocal access to domestic markets and R D assets At the same time it is clear that the United States derives substantial benefits from the involvement of foreign nationals in the country s research enterprise as do foreign countries from the R D activities of US firms Each needs to work in the other s markets to be successful in their home markets For example foreign science and engineering talent in the nation s research universities federal laboratories and industrial R D enterprise contributes substantially to our nation s technological and economic strength The US affiliates of foreign owned firms bring large amounts of technology and know how into our country and employ over 100 000 Americans in US based R D Given the magnitude of those benefits and the rapid growth of foreign technological capabilities in recent decades US policymakers in their attempts to address specific concerns related to foreign competition should avoid actions that would deny the United States the benefits of foreign participation in US R D E 3 E 4 Public policymakers should avoid restricting whenever possible transnational cooperative efforts among firms provided that sufficient competition is preserved The commercial aircraft industry demonstrates both the risks and the rewards of the globalization of R D production investment markets and technology For more than 50 years US leadership in aircraft manufacturing and aviation has been a major component of our economic strength and national security But today as markets capital and technologies are increasingly global international alliances and other cross border linkages are increasingly common In particular the importance of companies based outside the United States including those in Europe and Japan is already substantial and growing rapidly For example the growing strength of Japanese companies particularly in the supply of aircraft components and equipment constitutes one long term challenge to US preeminence in transport aircraft Yet US companies and the federal government have more to gain from promoting a balanced flow of technology between the two countries than they do from retreating into a defensive stance A private sector effort the National Aviation Advisory Committee NAAC composed of knowledgeable leaders from industry academe and elsewhere should be established to develop a shared vision for maintaining US leadership The NAAC would provide input to government in identifying critical aerospace technologies assessing international technology transfers and improving civil military integration in aircraft technology development and manufacturing For more information There is a productive tension between the ideal of growing international interdependence and openness and the current unresolved issues in high technology competition The preferred approach is to arrive at mutually beneficial rules of the game for transnational corporations and their home and host countries The rules cover a wide variety of policies including antitrust restrictions government procurement intellectual property rights industrial targeting and subsidy practices foreign direct investment local content and international standard setting While continuing to address unresolved issues the federal government should further efforts to open foreign markets to US trade and investment through negotiation in bilateral and multilateral forums E 2 E 4 The ability of the United States to capture the benefits of the global technical enterprise will depend primarily on the success with which private corporations operating within US borders seize the opportunities presented by the emerging global technology base Policymakers can influence this success by recognizing the interdependence of domestic and international policies that affect technology development and adoption For more information on technology and trade The widespread perception of the middle to late 1980s that many American companies were less effective than their foreign competitors at harnessing the output of R D is giving way to a more optimistic view Through their collective efforts US companies are now more effective in responding to foreign competition Overall the US economy remains the most productive and competitive in the world In many technological fields the public and private sectors have worked together effectively to combine their contrasting capabilities Continued cooperation between the public and private sectors will be essential to meeting the objectives of both industry and the public at large New technologies and new concerns will continue to emerge Balancing the benefits and the risks of change will require communication planning and collaboration between government and business

DEBUG:root:VideoAre the robots coming for government jobs According to Bill Eggers the answer is yes sort of Eggers who runs Deloitte s Center for Government Insights said at a Nov 29 FCW event on government modernization that 20 to 30 percent of all work activities will soon be automatable thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence He pointed to a Deloitte study of the federal workforce that found 4 3 billion hours are spent each year on a wide range of task and activities A huge share of those hours is devoted to essentially moving paper he said while relatively little time goes to coaching and other sorts of human activities But the study also found that four out of five of the most labor intensive activities have either a medium or high automation potential Eggers said That could allow for reductions in certain parts of the workforce he noted but it also frees up time for critical higher value work and the chance to deliver better service by giving the human workforce AI powered support Studies have repeatedly shown Eggers said that it s the human machine pairing that gives the best results he said The full video of Eggers half hour talk which explores the larger implications for government as AI becomes the new electricity is available below Note This dual screen video recording is best viewed when expanded to the full browser window For more

publication has been defining and informing the senior management agenda since 1964 Our learning programs help organizations accelerate growth by unlocking their people s potential Automation and artificial intelligence AI are transforming businesses and will contribute to economic growth via contributions to productivity They will also help address moonshot societal challenges in areas from health to climate change At the same time these technologies will transform the nature of work and the workplace itself Machines will be able to carry out more of the tasks done by humans complement the work that humans do and even perform some tasks that go beyond what humans can do As a result some occupations will decline others will grow and many more will change While we believe there will be enough work to go around barring extreme scenarios society will need to grapple with significant workforce transitions and dislocation Workers will need to acquire new skills and adapt to the increasingly capable machines alongside them in the workplace They may have to move from declining occupations to growing and in some cases new occupations This executive briefing which draws on the latest research from the McKinsey Global Institute examines both the promise and the challenge of automation and AI in the workplace and outlines some of the critical issues that policy makers companies and individuals will need to solve for Automation and AI are not new but recent technological progress is pushing the frontier of what machines can do Our research suggests that society needs these improvements to provide value for businesses contribute to economic growth and make once unimaginable progress on some of our most difficult societal challenges In summary Beyond traditional industrial automation and advanced robots new generations of more capable autonomous systems are appearing in environments ranging from autonomous vehicles on roads to automated check outs in grocery stores Much of this progress has been driven by improvements in systems and components including mechanics sensors and software AI has made especially large strides in recent years as machine learning algorithms have become more sophisticated and made use of huge increases in computing power and of the exponential growth in data available to train them Spectacular breakthroughs are making headlines many involving beyond human capabilities in computer vision natural language processing and complex games such as Go These technologies are already generating value in various products and services and companies across sectors use them in an array of processes to personalize product recommendations find anomalies in production identify fraudulent transactions and more The latest generation of AI advances including techniques that address classification estimation and clustering problems promises significantly more value still An analysis we conducted of several hundred AI use cases found that the most advanced deep learning techniques deploying artificial neural networks could account for as much as 3 5 trillion to 5 8 trillion in annual value or 40 percent of the value created by all analytics techniques Exhibit 1 Deployment of AI and automation technologies can do much to lift the global economy and increase global prosperity at a time when aging and falling birth rates are acting as a drag on growth Labor productivity growth a key driver of economic growth has slowed in many economies dropping to an average of 0 5 percent in 2010 2014 from 2 4 percent a decade earlier in the United States and major European economies in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis after a previous productivity boom had waned AI and automation have the potential to reverse that decline productivity growth could potentially reach 2 percent annually over the next decade with 60 percent of this increase from digital opportunities AI is also being used in areas ranging from material science to medical research and climate science Application of the technologies in these and other disciplines could help tackle societal moonshot challenges For example researchers at Geisinger have developed an algorithm that could reduce diagnostic times for intracranial hemorrhaging by up to 96 percent Researchers at George Washington University meanwhile are using machine learning to more accurately weight the climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AI and automation still face challenges The limitations are partly technical such as the need for massive training data and difficulties generalizing algorithms across use cases Recent innovations are just starting to address these issues Other challenges are in the use of AI techniques For example explaining decisions made by machine learning algorithms is technically challenging which particularly matters for use cases involving financial lending or legal applications Potential bias in the training data and algorithms as well as data privacy malicious use and security are all issues that must be addressed Europe is leading with the new General Data Protection Regulation which codifies more rights for users over data collection and usage A different sort of challenge concerns the ability of organizations to adopt these technologies where people data availability technology and process readiness often make it difficult Adoption is already uneven across sectors and countries The finance automotive and telecommunications sectors lead AI adoption Among countries US investment in AI ranked first at 15 billion to 23 billion in 2016 followed by Asia s investments of 8 billion to 12 billion with Europe lagging behind at 3 billion to 4 billion Even as AI and automation bring benefits to business and society we will need to prepare for major disruptions to work Our analysis of more than 2000 work activities across more than 800 occupations shows that certain categories of activities are more easily automatable than others They include physical activities in highly predictable and structured environments as well as data collection and data processing These account for roughly half of the activities that people do across all sectors The least susceptible categories include managing others providing expertise and interfacing with stakeholders Nearly all occupations will be affected by automation but only about 5 percent of occupations could be fully automated by currently demonstrated technologies Many more occupations have portions of their constituent activities that are automatable we find that about 30 percent of the activities in 60 percent of all occupations could be automated This means that most workers from welders to mortgage brokers to CEOs will work alongside rapidly evolving machines The nature of these occupations will likely change as a result Automation will displace some workers We have found that around 15 percent of the global workforce or about 400 million workers could be displaced by automation in the period 2016 2030 This reflects our midpoint scenario in projecting the pace and scope of adoption Under the fastest scenario we have modeled that figure rises to 30 percent or 800 million workers In our slowest adoption scenario only about 10 million people would be displaced close to zero percent of the global workforce Exhibit 2 The wide range underscores the multiple factors that will impact the pace and scope of AI and automation adoption Technical feasibility of automation is only the first influencing factor Other factors include the cost of deployment labor market dynamics including labor supply quantity quality and the associated wages the benefits beyond labor substitution that contribute to business cases for adoption and finally social norms and acceptance Adoption will continue to vary significantly across countries and sectors because of differences in the above factors especially labor market dynamics in advanced economies with relatively high wage levels such as France Japan and the United States automation could displace 20 to 25 percent of the workforce by 2030 in a midpoint adoption scenario more than double the rate in India Even as workers are displaced there will be growth in demand for work and consequently jobs We developed scenarios for labor demand to 2030 from several catalysts of demand for work including rising incomes increased spending on healthcare and continuing or stepped up investment in infrastructure energy and technology development and deployment These scenarios showed a range of additional labor demand of between 21 percent to 33 percent of the global workforce 555 million and 890 million jobs to 2030 more than offsetting the numbers of jobs lost Some of the largest gains will be in emerging economies such as India where the working age population is already growing rapidly Additional economic growth including from business dynamism and rising productivity growth will also continue to create jobs Many other new occupations that we cannot currently imagine will also emerge and may account for as much as 10 percent of jobs created by 2030 if history is a guide Moreover technology itself has historically been a net job creator For example the introduction of the personal computer in the 1970s and 1980s created millions of jobs not just for semiconductor makers but also for software and app developers of all types customer service representatives and information analysts Partial automation will become more prevalent as machines complement human labor For example AI algorithms that can read diagnostic scans with a high degree of accuracy will help doctors diagnose patient cases and identify suitable treatment In other fields jobs with repetitive tasks could shift toward a model of managing and troubleshooting automated systems At retailer Amazon employees who previously lifted and stacked objects are becoming robot operators monitoring the automated arms and resolving issues such as an interruption in the flow of objects While we expect there will be enough work to ensure full employment in 2030 based on most of our scenarios the transitions that will accompany automation and AI adoption will be significant The mix of occupations will change as will skill and educational requirements Work will need to be redesigned to ensure that humans work alongside machines most effectively Automation will accelerate the shift in required workforce skills we have seen over the past 15 years Demand for advanced technological skills such as programming will grow rapidly Social emotional and higher cognitive skills such as creativity critical thinking and complex information processing will also see growing demand Basic digital skills demand has been increasing and that trend will continue and accelerate Demand for physical and manual skills will decline but will remain the single largest category of workforce skills in 2030 in many countries Exhibit 3 This will put additional pressure on the already existing workforce skills challenge as well as the need for new credentialing systems While some innovative solutions are emerging solutions that can match the scale of the challenge will be needed Our research suggests that in a midpoint scenario around 3 percent of the global workforce will need to change occupational categories by 2030 though scenarios range from about 0 to 14 percent Some of these shifts will happen within companies and sectors but many will occur across sectors and even geographies Occupations made up of physical activities in highly structured environments or in data processing or collection will see declines Growing occupations will include those with difficult to automate activities such as managers and those in unpredictable physical environments such as plumbers Other occupations that will see increasing demand for work include teachers nursing aides and tech and other professionals As intelligent machines and software are integrated more deeply into the workplace workflows and workspaces will continue to evolve to enable humans and machines to work together As self checkout machines are introduced in stores for example cashiers can become checkout assistance helpers who can help answer questions or troubleshoot the machines More system level solutions will prompt rethinking of the entire workflow and workspace Warehouse design may change significantly as some portions are designed to accommodate primarily robots and others to facilitate safe human machine interaction The occupational mix shifts will likely put pressure on wages Many of the current middle wage jobs in advanced economies are dominated by highly automatable activities such as in manufacturing or in accounting which are likely to decline High wage jobs will grow significantly especially for high skill medical and tech or other professionals but a large portion of jobs expected to be created including teachers and nursing aides typically have lower wage structures The risk is that automation could exacerbate wage polarization income inequality and the lack of income advancement that has characterized the past decade across advanced economies stoking social and political tensions Most countries already face the challenge of adequately educating and training their workforces to meet the current requirements of employers Across the OECD spending on worker education and training has been declining over the last two decades Spending on worker transition and dislocation assistance has also continued to shrink as a percentage of GDP One lesson of the past decade is that while globalization may have benefited economic growth and people as consumers the wage and dislocation effects on workers were not adequately addressed Most analyses including our own suggest that the scale of these issues is likely to grow in the coming decades We have also seen in the past that large scale workforce transitions can have a lasting effect on wages during the 19th century Industrial Revolution wages in the United Kingdom remained stagnant for about half a century despite rising productivity a phenomenon known as Engels Pause PDF 690KB after the German philosopher who identified it In the search for appropriate measures and policies to address these challenges we should not seek to roll back or slow diffusion of the technologies Companies and governments should harness automation and AI to benefit from the enhanced performance and productivity contributions as well as the societal benefits These technologies will create the economic surpluses that will help societies manage workforce transitions Rather the focus should be on ways to ensure that the workforce transitions are as smooth as possible This is likely to require actionable and scalable solutions in several key areas There is work for everyone today and there will be work for everyone tomorrow even in a future with automation Yet that work will be different requiring new skills and a far greater adaptability of the workforce than we have seen Training and retraining both midcareer workers and new generations for the coming challenges will be an imperative Government private sector leaders and innovators all need to work together to better coordinate public and private initiatives including creating the right incentives to invest more in human capital The future with automation and AI will be challenging but a much richer one if we harness the technologies with aplomb and mitigate the negative effects James Manyika is chairman and

by 2025 and beyond and examined how technology will help not hinder their effectiveness Discussions of how technology is changing the job of government sometimes view the challenge reactively but a recent report from Deloitte lands ahead of the issue probing how the work will change and predicting positions based on advances in tech and the rising influence of the consumer and talent markets In Government Jobs of the Future authors Amrita Datar William D Eggers and Jenn Gustetic consider what will government work look like in 2025 and beyond The aim is to educate readers on how public sector staff and machines can work together to optimize our collective impact A central goal Eggers told Government Technology was to deconstruct how that work takes place then reimagine it enabled by machine learning and digital technologies and new business tools The idea of human to machine pairing permeates the study which Eggers said aims to change the dystopian narrative that s often heard about automation leading to disappearing jobs In fact he noted human to machine pairings date back to the mechanization of farming The current shift is already creating new jobs he said highlighting recent additions to teams like the user experience coordinator and positions in search engine optimization What s new Eggers said is the rise of artificial intelligence and tools and techniques around virtual reality augmented reality and in other areas which should dramatically augment staffers capabilities The report s prediction of future jobs suggests a heavy lean on the use of technology to power flexible remote and connected work Additionally the authors found that future jobs will center on employees focusing on their wellness and personal development and enabling broader on the job mobility and personal opportunities such as passion projects This was really about saying we have an opportunity to shape this future of government work It can be incredibly empowering for employees and we wanted to start that process by developing these future government jobs said Eggers The report released Oct 4 envisions six new public sector job profiles of the future built on areas of government service that regardless of their eventual evolution aren t going anywhere Child aid coordinator would investigate abuse neglect or harm against children offer counseling court testimony and coordinate services and interventions The person profiled in this report has a bachelor s in social work along with certifications in analytics and as a social worker they would have previously worked in analytics and as a child welfare specialist Criminal redirection officer would assist low risk nonviolent offenders in virtual incarceration skill building and employment monitored by digital tools This person would have earned a bachelor s in social work and started their career as a correctional case manager after interning at a county probation department Mobility platform manager oversees the city s multimodal transportation system via AI to minimize accidents and disruption while helping optimize prices and routes This individual would hold a bachelor s in mechanical engineering and a master s in urban and regional planning and would be certified in the use of AI for transportation systems Public health and safety guardian inspects public spaces including restaurants schools and day cares and nursing homes investigates incidences of illness analyzes health data and advises public and private officials This person would have a bachelor s in public health and national environmental certifications Smart base commander would command a garrison managing infrastructure and daily operations and connecting with mission commanders and officials A graduate of military schools this individual would hold dual master s degrees in international relations and strategic studies Talent cloud coordinator is grounded in human resources and helps an agency identify and deploy its workforce enterprisewide based on need and skill sets This person would have a bachelor s in business administration and HR certification Technology underpins each future job classification augmenting as the report s authors wrote the existing abilities of these human workers Powered by tech the child aid coordinator and smart base commander were able to pivot their time away from administrative tasks toward client interactions and strategy sessions In the former case Eggers said the time shift could be particularly welcome He cited an analysis done recently in Colorado indicating case workers there spent less than 10 percent of their work time interacting with children and families In the Deloitte report the child aid coordinator s client interaction time rose from 25 percent to 40 percent The criminal redirection officer whose toolbox includes machine learning to enable virtual check ins with clients and a virtual reality training environment epitomizes the ongoing shift that has seen law enforcement deploy predictive policing body worn cameras AI and analytics The emphasis here on virtual incarceration could be a valuable change for the public sector Eggers said calling it a really big opportunity that could save a lot of money In a recent interview around his company s release of Reimagining the Police Workforce A Vision for the Future Jody Weis Accenture s public safety lead for North America and a federal and local member of law enforcement agreed agencies are embracing technology to varying degrees and praised its potential for expanding their grasp Just sifting through that huge haystack to find that proverbial needle having the tool to help you a little bit is incredibly helpful Weis said But hiring and retention will be ongoing challenges for agencies seeking to modernize or redefine job classifications around technology In the area of cybersecurity and creating a hardened posture Eggers recommended agencies engage with the private and educational sectors to facilitate reskilling and training but also consider imbedding AI into their cyberdefense to expand its reach The issue of outdated job classifications and work rules remains a big one for the public sector the author said As part of early steps toward meeting the challenge of technology he recommended being more strategic with HR and moving away from systems that focus on classifications and rules I think at the very basic level governments need to understand where the world is moving and show a destination and that s a little bit of what these jobs of the future are doing and kind of reimagining how to get there and doing some of that basic analysis Eggers said He suggested agencies consider new jobs they ll need to add future skills employees will need and which activities can be automated Theo Douglas is a staff writer for Government Technology His reporting experience includes covering municipal county and state governments business and

forward 40 years and meet Jane s grandson Ian He carries a slim tablet wherever he goes which has more computing power than the mainframe with which Jane worked Ian is constantly tethered to the Internet and works 24 7 from wherever he is Ian expects to switch from project to project and office to office as his career develops and his interests evolve If he feels he has reached the limit of his ability to learn or grow in one role he will look elsewhere for a new opportunity What if the government could give Ian the opportunities and experiences he seeks The GovCloud concept proposed in this paper would restructure government workforces in a way that takes advantage of the talents and preferences of workers like Ian who are entering the workforce today The model is based on a large body of research from interviews with public and private sector experts to best practices from innovative organizations both public and private This is the first generation of people that work play think and learn differently than their parents They are the first generation to not be afraid of technology It s like the air to them Don Tapscott author of Grown Up DigitalThis report details trends in work and technology that offer significant opportunities for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the government workforce It lays out the GovCloud model explaining how governments could be organized to take advantage of its flexibility It examines how work would be performed in the new model and discusses potential changes to government HR programs to support GovCloud Other sections provide resources for executives including a tool to help determine cloud eligibility steps they can take to pilot the cloud concept and future scenarios illustrating the cloud in action The GovCloud model represents a dramatic departure from the status quo It is bound to be greeted with some skepticism Without such innovation however governments will be left to confront the challenges of tomorrow with the workforce structure of yesterday The details of the GovCloud model are open for debate The purpose of this paper is to jumpstart that debate Forty years ago more than half of employed American adults worked in either blue collar or clerical jobs Today less than 40 percent work in these same categories and the share continues to shrink 1 Jobs requiring routine or manual tasks are disappearing while those requiring complex communication skills and expert thinking are becoming the norm 2 Increasingly employers seek workers capable of creative and knowledge based work We should ask ourselves whether we re truly satisfied with the status quo Are our workday lives so fulfilling and our organizations so boundlessly capable that it s now pointless to long for something better Gary Hamel author of The Future of ManagementThe next generation of creative knowledge workers has already entered the job market These Millennials came of age in a rapidly and radically changing world They are the first true digital natives They have grown up with instant access to information through technology As such Millennials have considerably different expectations for the kind of work they do and the information they use The pursuit for variety in work has led Millennials to cite simply needing a change as their top reason for switching jobs 3Advances in technology have also changed the actual ways in which people perform work The ability to crowdsource tasks is one example of this change Since its founding in 2001 volunteers have produced and contributed to over 19 million articles in 281 languages on Wikipedia 4 Built around this concept a burgeoning industry is developing around microtasking dividing work up into small tasks that can be farmed out to workers Amazon s Mechanical Turk rolled out in 2005 allows users to post tasks to a platform where registered workers can accept and complete them for a small fee When this paper was written more than 195 000 tasks were available on Mechanical Turk 5Such technologies may offer suitable possibilities for the public sector Microtask a Finnish cloud labor company maintains Digitalkoot a program that helps the Finnish National Library convert its image archives into digital text and correct existing errors It does so with volunteered labor participants simply play a game in which they are shown the image of a word and then must type it out to help a cartoon character cross a bridge In doing so they are turning scanned images into searchable text greatly improving the search accuracy of old manuscripts 6 At present more than 100 000 people have completed over 6 million microtasks associated with this project 7As the pace of computing power and machine learning increases professors Frank Levy and Richard Murnane contend that more tasks will move from human to computer processing 8 Skeptics need look no further than IBM s Watson a computer that can answer questions posed in natural language In February 2011 Watson defeated two all time champions of the quiz show Jeopardy This was not solely a publicity stunt IBM hopes to sell Watson to hospitals and call centers to help them answer questions from the public 9Around the globe more and more governments are looking to increase telework among employees In 2010 the U S government passed legislation calling for more telework opportunities for government employees Likewise the Australian government in order to attract and retain information and communications technology workers instituted a teleworking policy in 2009 requiring agencies to implement flexible work plans 10 Other countries including Norway and Germany are also focusing on flexible work arrangements to improve public sector recruiting 11 In Canada the government has an official telework policy that recognizes changes are occurring in the public service workforce with a shift towards more knowledge workers and encourages departments to implement telework arrangements 12Cloud definitionsCloud computing Internet based computing whereby shared resources software and information are provided to computers and other devices on demand like

Princeton University Press 2004 p 50 Figure 1 Trends in routine and non routine tasks in the U S 1960 200213These are all powerful steps in the right direction for employees whose natural work rhythms are not locked into 9 to 5 Some companies have taken telework one step further British Telecom is pushing the concept of agile working through its Workstyle Project where employees decide what work arrangements best suit them rather than a rigid definition by location and hours BT Workstyle is one of the largest flexible working projects in Europe with over 11 000 home based workers BT has found that its home enabled employees are on average 20 percent more productive than their office based colleagues 14Similarly U S electronics retailer Best Buy experimented with a Results Only Work Environment ROWE In a ROWE what matters is not whether employees are in their office but rather that they complete their work and achieve measurable outcomes In a ROWE salaried employees must put in as much time as is actually needed to do their work no more no less The decline in routine and manual tasks and the rise of new ways of working is not isolated to the private sector In 1950 the U S federal workforce largely comprised clerks performing repetitive tasks About 62 percent performed these tasks while only 11 percent performed more white collar work By 2000 those relationships were reversed Fifteen percent performed repetitive tasks compared to 56 percent in the white collar categories 16 Similarly in 1944 the number of workers in the UK civil service considered industrial totaled 505 000 By 2003 this number fell to 18 200 with non industrial workers reaching 538 000 in 2004 17 And in Canada in 2006 knowledge based workers represented 58 percent of federal workers in the Core Public Administration up from 41 percent 11 years earlier 18The swelling ranks of non industrial government workers indicate a shift in public sector jobs toward creative collaborative and complex work The workforce structure however designed for clerks of the last century remains largely the same With limited flexibility to distribute resources governments often address change by creating new agencies and programs This can be seen following major events like the outbreaks of the Avian flu and SARs in the past decade 9 11 and the financial crisis of 2008 Source United States Office of Personnel Management A Fresh Start for Federal Pay A Case for Modernization April 2002 p 5 http www opm gov strategiccomp whtpaper pdfFigure 2 The changing U S federal workforce 1950 200015Given increasing budgetary pressures and burgeoning national debts the conventional model of creating new agencies or permanent structures in response to new challenges is unsustainable This is exacerbated by our inability to accurately predict future needs and trends Consider a 1968 Business Week article proclaiming that the Japanese auto industry isn t likely to carve out a big share of the market for itself or the president of Digital Equipment Corporation who in 1977 said t here is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home 19The world is full of experts who attempt to predict the future and fail 20Instead of endeavoring to predict the future governments can choose to create a flexible workforce that can quickly adapt to future work requirements To accomplish this the government can learn from a game changing concept in the technology world cloud computing Major organizations and small startups alike increase their flexibility by sharing storage space information and resources in a cloud allowing them to quickly scale resources up and down as needed Why not apply the cloud model to people The creation of a government wide human cloud could provide significant benefits including A cloud based government workforce or GovCloud could include workers who perform a range of creative problem focused work Rather than being slotted into any single government agency cloud workers would be true government wide employees This section outlines the organizational structure of the GovCloud model which rests on three main pillars a cloud of government workers thin executive agencies and shared services Most government workforce models tend to constrain workers by isolating them in separate agencies Consider the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom and the subsequent slaughter of more than 6 million pigs sheep and cattle The problem of an impacted food supply is complicated In most countries multiple agencies focus on agriculture food production and public health In the United Kingdom the army and even tourism ministries were impacted by the outbreak as agencies became overwhelmed by the number of animals in need of disposal and by the cordoning off of tourist areas to prevent the spread of the disease Yet the structure of government agencies often confines employees to work in information silos creating inherent operational inefficiencies In a cloud workforce model experts in each area could be pulled together to support remedies and propose coordinated corrective measures I want someone saying Did you know that the Ministry of Justice is doing that or could you piggy back on what the communities department is doing or had you thought about doing it in this way You ve got to get away from thinking about centralized command and control Dame Helen Ghosh Permanent Secretary UK Home Office 21The FedCloud modelThe GovCloud model could become a new pillar of government comprising permanent employees who undertake a wide variety of creative problem focused work As needed the GovCloud model could also take advantage of those outside government including citizens looking for extra part time work full time contractors and individual consultants Cloud workers would vary in background and expertise but would exhibit traits of free agent workers self sufficient self motivated employees who exhibit a strong loyalty to teams colleagues and clients Daniel Pink author of Drive The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us argues that 33 million Americans one quarter of the workforce already operate as free agents 22According to the white paper Lessons of the Great Recession from Swiss staffing company Adecco contingent workers those who chose non traditional employment arrangements23 are expected to eventually make up about 25 percent of the global workforce 24These more autonomous workers according to Pink are better suited to 21st century work and are more productive even without traditional monetary incentives 25The fluid nature of the cloud can provide significant benefits The nature of the cloud teams forming and dissolving as their tasks require encourages workers to focus on specific project outcomes rather than ongoing operations Thin agency structures could lead to Greater use of shared services could allow the federal government to The need to support some ongoing missions will remain of course These missions will be carried out by thin agencies Under the cloud concept federal agencies would remain focused on specific missions and ongoing oversight These agencies however would become thinner as many of their knowledge workers transfer into the cloud Thin agencies could also create opportunities to streamline organizations with overlapping missions Employees working in thin agencies could fall into two main categories GovCloud could change the highest levels of public sector workers as we know them today The Senior Executive Service in the United States Permanent Secretaries and Directors General in the United Kingdom and Australia all such senior officials could rotate between agencies shared services and the cloud which would reflect the original intent behind many of these high level offices giving executives a breadth of experience in roles across government to help develop shared values and a broad perspective An important benefit of rotation would be the ability to tap into cloud networks to assemble high performing teams To further focus agencies on specific missions many of their back office support functions could be pulled into government wide shared service arrangements The use of shared services in government has come and gone in waves usually dictated by fiscal necessity Most countries in Europe as part of their e government strategies have placed increased focus of late on developing shared services whether through an executive agency or a CIO as well as working with EU coordination activities And while the decentralized governments of some EU countries such as Germany make shared services more difficult these countries are using states and agencies to pilot innovative approaches 27Other efforts around the world include the U S e Government Act of 2002 which examined how technology could be used to cut costs and improve services More recently the New Zealand government appointed an advisory group in May 2011 to explore public sector reform to improve services and provide better value In their report Better Public Services the advisory group recommended the use of shared services to improve effectiveness in a variety of government settings including policy advice and real estate 29 Following up on this three New Zealand agencies the Department of the Prime Minister the State Services Commission and the Treasury announced in December 2011 that they would share such corporate functions as human resources and information technology 30 And though shared services in Western Australia were shut down other projects in South Australia are moving ahead and already showing savings 31In August 2011 the government of Canada announced the launch of Shared Services Canada a program that seeks to streamline and identify savings in information technology Among its first targets is something as mundane as email But with more than 100 different email systems being used by government employees the potential savings and boost to efficiency could be significant Not only do these incompatible systems cost money by requiring individual departments to negotiate and maintain separate licenses and technical support it also makes it difficult for government employees to communicate with one another and with the public And with no single standard ensuring the security of information transmitted over email becomes more challenging Shared Services Canada will move the government to one email system as well as consolidate data centers and networks ultimately looking for anticipated savings of between CA 100 million and CA 200 million annually 28While the idea of using shared services is not a novel one it is central to the GovCloud model The GovCloud model envisions building upon effective practices and those shared services already in operation to deliver services like human resources information technology finance and acquisitions government wide Workers in these shared services would include subject matter experts in areas like human resources and information technology as well as generalists who support routine business functions The potential for shared services continues to grow As seen with IBM s Watson and Microtask s Digitalkoot new technologies provide an opportunity to accelerate the automated delivery of basic services Some agencies already have begun capitalizing on these trends For example NASA has moved its shared service center website to a secure government cloud facilitating greater employee self service and helping to reduce demand on finite call center resources 32This decision tool is designed to help leaders determine which employees are appropriate for each of the three structures in the GovCloud model the cloud thin agencies and shared services To the cloud GovCloud Project LifecycleManaging employees in the cloud will require governments to reinvent human resource management Individual and team performance evaluations career development pay structures and benefits and pensions would need to change to support GovCloud This section examines possibilities for HR reinvention including performance management career development workplace flexibility and benefits Employees working in the cloud would require an alternative to determine pay and career advancement The government could take its cues from the gaming world and evaluate cloud workers with a point system The manager as we know it will disappear to be replaced by a new sort of business operative whose expertise is assembling the right people for particular projects Daniel Pink author of Free Agent Nation 33An HR management system that incorporates the accumulation of experience points XP through effective work on cloud projects training education and professional certifications could replace the tenure centric models for cloud employees As employees accumulate XP they could level up and take on additional responsibilities in future projects Workers in the cloud could earn XP in four ways After some high profile incidents slow responses to outbreaks of foot and mouth disease flooding that may have been preventable and a farming subsidy system that seemed to result in more chaos than aid the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs DEFRA was looking to reinvent itself In 2006 the department launched DEFRA Renew One of its key goals was to bring the department s policymaking closer to actual delivery to create more responsive processes Organized mainly by policy with fixed teams DEFRA had been unable to redeploy resources as needed in response to a crisis As part of DEFRA Renew a new operating model was implemented that used flexible resourcing where staff were assigned to specific projects for fixed periods This allowed management to measure and build the required capabilities and competencies needed and to allocate resources efficiently to improve overall service quality New roles were also created to support sustainable staff development and resource management in the new model To create buy in for such a fundamental culture shift within the department a facilitative approach to decision making was employed Change management programs and mentoring were extended to all levels of the department including leadership New mechanisms such as approval panels for resources and the use of business cases also worked to push changes among staff and promote collaborative behavior DEFRA Renew was widely recognized as a key enabler in the department meeting required efficiency improvement targets set by the UK government DEFRA moved to a more project based approach with fewer staff in core teams According to Dame Helen Ghosh former Permanent Secretary of DEFRA they could be more responsive now that the management board won t be made up of director generals with individual policy silos 34Just as XP could be gained through learning new skills it could be lost in the following three ways Any serious discussion about creating a new class of government employees requires a fresh look at employee benefits and compensation For example XP could be used to help determine workers salaries but additional research into alternative pension and benefit programs is needed While any discussion on compensation could be contentious a healthy debate among stakeholders from across the government should be welcomed As new roles emerge in the cloud so too could new career paths Career emphasis could move away from time served in a particular pay grade and toward milestones that are meaningful for employee development Each worker may have different career aspirations For instance not all workers aspire to management some may seek to master a particular subject area instead Career advancement in the cloud would not equate to moving up a ladder but rather moving along a lattice Lattice GovCloud ModelHere s how the lattice could work for Ian who we met in the introduction Think of the lattice as a jungle gym The best opportunities to broaden your experience may be lateral or even down Look every which way and swing to opportunities Pattie Sellers Fortune editor at largeCathleen Benko and Molly Anderson the authors of The Corporate Lattice argue that the corporate ladder is giving way to a lattice that accommodates flatter more networked organizations improves the integration of career and life focuses on competencies rather than tenure and helps increase workforce loyalty 35 The lattice metaphor allows employees to choose many ways to get ahead It is unlikely that all workers will thrive in the new GovCloud environment right out of the gate As such it would be important to assess a worker s readiness before placing her in GovCloud and providing training on core competencies critical to cloud success There could also be opportunities to start workers especially those at earlier stages of a career within an agency or shared service to build up expertise in some area before graduating to the cloud Once in the cloud new workers could be paired with mentors who are more experienced to help navigate the cloud experience itself There should be an emphasis on continuous learning in the cloud It would be important for cloud workers to continue to refine their skills develop additional expertise and adapt to new ways of working Not only could continuous learning affect workers career mobility by increasing the depth and breadth of their skills but it could also impact their salary and level by increasing their XP Learning and development in the cloud could take on many themes of next learning Next learning focuses on creating personalized learning experiences that leverage the latest technologies and collaborative communities to deliver education and learning programs that build knowledge bases and promote learning as a focus and passion not just a checkbox in a career 36To broaden cloud worker skills and the ability to handle multiple tasks and work on a variety of projects cloud learning could include the following principles 37In the cloud careers and expertise will be built in new ways and work will be something we do rather than a place we go to As such the cloud will give workers more control over their schedules and workloads By creating a flexible workplace governments could shed a significant amount of physical infrastructure and create shared workspaces Many buildings could be converted into co located spaces teams could use collaboration spaces or videoconferencing centers Some workers might rarely set foot in a government building instead conducting cloud tasks at home and interacting with project teams virtually With advancing communications and mobile technology distance no longer hinders collaboration It no longer matters whether all workers are at an office between 9 a m and 5 p m what matters is whether project teams produce results and whether everyone contributes A more flexible workplace could also take advantage of resources governments might not otherwise have access to Some retiring workers may not want to quit working altogether and a flexible model could be an enticing way to keep their expertise on retainer Alternatively the model could take advantage of would be government employees unwilling to relocate or unable to work a regular schedule By increasing flexibility governments could increase their available resource pool allowing agencies to access the skills and knowledge they need when they need it For an example of how a retiree could interact with the cloud see Appendix C National Security Case Study Don t think governments will ever take to the cloud At the U S Department of State the idea could soon be a reality The Office of eDiplomacy is preparing to pilot a cloud component to its e internship model for American students as part of the Virtual Student Foreign Service VSFS beginning this year The VSFS currently offers e internships to U S university students of multiple month duration By using a new micro volunteering platform State Department offices and embassies around the world will be able to create non classified tasks that take anywhere from a couple of minutes to a couple of days to complete Each task will be tagged by region and or issue and will automatically populate the profiles of students who have indicated those interests Students can then select the tasks that interest them the most or that fit into their schedule To see that the most pressing work is performed first offices and embassies will be able to prioritize their tasks so critical items appear at the top of the queue Imagine a small embassy preparing for a high profile multilateral meeting The preparations for such an event could be daunting for a small staff The power of the cloud could augment an individual embassy s capacity to prepare for a major event and ensure that related items are performed ahead of those that are less critical While there are plenty of incentives for participating in the VSFS micro volunteering platform from an impressive line on a student s resume to the chance to make a difference by working on topics of interest thought is being put into how to creatively incent high performance One idea is to simply invoke students competitive spirit Competition could be encouraged by a monthly leader board which results in bragging rights and potentially even a low cost but high impact reward Transparency is also key to competition with ratings available to State Department staff and other cloud interns and the ability to make short thank you notes from embassies publicly available interns would be keen to make a good impression The potential applications of this type of program are significant Imagine if offices throughout the State Department could tap into the language and cultural expertise of the thousands of foreign national staff members around the globe Providing a platform for those employees to contribute even a small amount of time to discreet tasks that require their expertise could unlock a world of knowledge 38Creating the GovCloud model will require bold leadership and the ideas and initiatives of entrepreneurial executives While a GovCloud model may be years in the making agencies can begin adopting cloud concepts today The GovCloud concept is designed to be versatile as well as applicable to a wide range of entities Depending on your organization government executives wishing to employ GovCloud may choose to apply the concept first to a unit before expanding to other branches or divisions entire agencies or the whole of government Often GovCloud principles are most effectively implemented as part of a larger reform program within a particular agency as with the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs Renew program as described earlier in this report On a smaller scale the UK Cabinet Office used flexible resourcing FR in its Economic Reform Group ERG with a staff of about 400 as part of its cost reduction plans Using a simple database that it had developed and a strong program of communications FR is now used and embraced by all core ERG employees with strong clear ownership from the top another key implementation factor Says Ian Watmore the UK Cabinet Office s former permanent secretary FR means we are able to deploy people much more quickly to priority projects 40Figure 3 outlines how GovCloud can apply to a variety of organizations Most government workforces haven t undergone a broad restructuring in decades In that time the world has been transformed by computers the Internet and mobile communications To respond to a variety of challenges governments have created scores of new organizations However in today s world of budget cuts and increased fiscal scrutiny the constant creation of new permanent structures is not sustainable The GovCloud model could offer a new way to use government resources A cloud of government wide workers could coalesce into project based teams to solve problems and separate when their work is done This could allow governments to concentrate resources when and where they are needed By using this model in conjunction with thinner agencies and shared services governments can reduce back office redundancies and let agencies focus on their core missions This model capitalizes on the work preferences of Millennials the future government workforce who value career growth over job security or compensation 41 The GovCloud model allows employees to gain a variety of experiences in a shorter amount of time and to self select their career direction To support GovCloud governments could establish the processes by which cloud teams would form work and dissolve New ways to evaluate performance and help workers gain skills and build careers should be considered Today s employee classification system stresses job descriptions and time in service this could be transformed with an XP model that emphasizes the individual s ownership of his or her career The GovCloud model will undoubtedly be controversial Many stakeholders from governing bodies to public employee unions must weigh in to shape the future government workforce The transition to a cloud model will not happen overnight or maybe even in the next five years but the conversation starts today Charlie Tierney is a Manager in Deloitte Consulting LLP s Federal Human Capital Practice and a former GovLab Fellow He

be discussed at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires Will its impact be the same across the globe What jobs will be most affected What new skillsets will be required But above all how can governments prepare and what role can Multilateral Development Banks play All four leading regional development banks recently came together in Washington to present some key perspectives regarding the jobs of the future which can be found in the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives Here are a few worth considering On the one hand Emerging Europe Developing Asia Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean are witnessing how robotics automation and artificial intelligence are lowering costs and increasing productivity providing an opportunity for accelerated growth Countries like Estonia have taken the lead in digital technology youth in Nigeria and Ethiopia are harnessing technology to boost yields in agriculture in Vietnam and Bangladesh Information and Communication Technologies ICT is boosting the service industry and across Latin America and the Caribbean smartphone adoption is expected to reach beyond 70 by 2020 On the other hand as a result of this new wave of technological advances known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution a series of myths emerge that it is important to clarify Myth 1 All regions will be impacted in the same way The truth is that technology will be adopted at varying speeds depending on the region s economic development and demographic trends An aging population in Emerging Europe will face different challenges than Africa where 12 to 15 million young people enter the job market each year Myth 2 Mass unemployment is unavoidable The truth is that the jobless rate will be lower than originally expected Mass unemployment is unlikely to become a reality But the shifts in job opportunities will certainly require flexibility and access to new training tools which may in turn be provided by technology itself Myth 3 Automation will replace all human jobs and tasks The truth is that automation only takes place where it is both technically and economically feasible A human workforce will still be required in most sectors particularly those such as health and education At the same time it would be foolish to ignore the genuine threats of unemployment and increased income inequality that the rapid expansion of new technology will generate Above all as Multilateral Development Banks the question we need to be asking is how can governments ease the transition What can governments do to ensure that the largest number of people possible benefit from this transition Policymakers can take four actions to ease the adoption of technology while mitigating potentially adverse effects on jobs and incomes Multilateral Development Banks certainly have their own role to play not only by acting as think tanks for initiatives on how to capitalize on new technologies and mitigate their negative effects but also in coordinating global or regional policy responses strengthening partnerships between policymakers and employers to jointly identify and address challenges Our products and services will need to adapt A recent IDB health project in the Dominican Republic which uses drones to link remote rural clinics with hospital laboratories is a prime example of this Change will also take place within our workforce Outsourcing the IDB s human resources department from Washington to Costa Rica to ensure efficiency and reduce costs was certainly a step in the right direction It is important that we take the time to seriously identify the opportunities and risks the 21st century global job market presents so that together we can help shape the future of work In the meantime we must also remain relevant for our customer base and at the forefront of innovation Whether we succeed or not is up to all of us Downlaod the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives hereFiled Under Beyond development effectiveness Tagged

seen populist campaigners railing against the threat to jobs from low wage migrants entering a country and outsourcing to low cost regions by multinationals What hasn t really been touched on is the impact automation might have on jobs in the future What began with the famous study from Oxford University academics Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne back in 2013 which highlighted the huge number of white and blue collar jobs that could be disrupted by automation has progressed to growing interest from governments around the world For instance a report by the British government s Science Technology Select Committee into AI examined the issue from a range of aspects from ethics to employment Watch on Forbes This was followed by a second report from the Chief Scientific Advisor to the British government which looked at the possible benefits to the state of an AI driven world in areas such as tax collection Further afield you have a recent report from the United Nations that looked at the disruptive possibilities of automation in the labor market It suggested that for now at least most of the disruption from automation will be in routine tasks and therefore the biggest impact will be in the developing world rather than the developed world Automation In AmericaDespite the rhetoric from the President elect it s perhaps no surprise that the White House has a view on this topic too and a recent report from the President s Council of Economic Advisors highlights the significant impact on professions such as driving What each of these reports have in common is their advocated response to the threat of automation All highlight the growing importance of education and the ability of people to adapt quickly to changes in the labor market We should not advance a policy that is premised on giving up on the possibility of workers remaining employed the White House paper says Our goal should be first and foremost to foster the skills training job search assistance and other labor market institutions to make sure people can get into jobs This is important because history tells us that technology and automation tend to create more jobs than they destroy but we don t tend to know what those jobs are yet Indeed the U S Department of Labor predicted a few years ago that around 65 of school children today will be employed in jobs that don t yet exist A Glass Half FullIt s also important because there is a backlash against globalization at the moment that is easy to imagine transferring its ire towards technology in the coming years The merits of globalization were quite aptly described by British economist Henry Martyn back in the 1700s He used the analogy of technological innovation to make his point and suggested that by using a tool a sawmill in his case we could perform the work of 30 men with the labor of two men Now of course we could employ those 30 men instead but that would be a waste of human resources The same is true for most technologies and whilst most would surely agree that technology is a force for good it s not an assumption that can be guaranteed Martyn went on to compare this with globalization and suggested that if another country can produce textiles for instance more efficiently than we can then it is akin to having a new technology to do likewise and we should jump at such an opportunity and instead deploy our resources to trade with that nation in areas that we can excel A Measured ResponseWhilst the White House report makes a number of measured responses including greater funding for adult education and an expanded welfare safety net the response of the new Trump administration is much less certain Whilst he currently blames immigration and free trade for the loss of jobs in America it s easy to imagine him flip flopping his attention onto automation if machines represent a more attractive target for him In reality the answers are largely the same in both instances whether it s providing greater support for lifelong learning supporting people to move where the jobs are and so on These responses do necessitate some action on behalf of those that are disrupted by technology however It s not enough to blame an external actor and hope to roll back change it requires one to take control and strive to learn the skills that give you a chance in the labor market This is a topic I ve covered a few times and whilst there is a growing appreciation for the urgency of such measures I can t help but feel that governments around the world are asleep at the wheel For more visit adigaskell org I am a free range human who believes that the future already exists if we know where to look From the bustling Knowledge Quarter in London it is my mission in life t By Mark Baillie 2018 05 24T09 00 34 143Z BusinessThe British government is keen to recognise the importance of artificial intelligence AI and automation in ensuring the long term future success of UK industry In line with this it has acknowledged that one of its grand challenges is putting the UK at the forefront of the AI and data revolution In fact comments from Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond have suggested that large swathes of government activity will soon be performed by AI and automation to free up time for human civil servants Automating some aspects of government jobs will result in savings and efficiencies However there are concerns that public sector workers will be at risk of losing their jobs to AI and automation in the next decade Think tank Reform estimated early last year that 250 000 of the UK s five million public sector workers risk losing jobs to AI and automation in the next 15 years Speaking to a House of Lords committee in 2017 Hammond said The government is looking at how it can apply artificial intelligence There are very significant areas of government activity which involve relatively low level decision making which will be highly susceptible to AI probably over a relatively short period of time which does present the tantalising possibility of being able to drive some real productivity enhancement in the delivery of government processes The truth is that automation in the public sector is already developing at a rapid pace New initiatives range from implementing AI and automation into day to day bureaucratic tasks such as form filling and applying for patents to using facial recognition technologies to verify the identity of individuals entering the UK But it s time to stop viewing AI and automation as an existential threat to our livelihoods Far from replacing people AI and automation will transform the workplace as menial tasks and some non routine jobs are digitalised through AI and process automation enabling greater efficiency while taking away some of the strain of day to day tasks In its industrial strategy report the UK government rightly realised we are at one of the most important exciting and challenging times in the history of global enterprise Importantly that report highlights that Britain is well placed to benefit from this new Industrial Revolution This digital revolution will be powered by humans increasing reliance on AI and automation Set to impact almost every sector of British industry AI and automation is here to stay Organisations are turning to digital transformation to boost innovation and enhance user experience and AI and automation will play a major role in this change While some jobs may disappear or evolve along the road to automation there is considerable opportunity for innovation and change AI and automation can give government departments both at the national and local level much faster access to sophisticated insights Combining this technology and big data will allow them to make better decisions more quickly for a greater number of citizens This ability to rapidly adapt to and drive new innovations is part of what allowed Britain to prosper and develop so quickly during the first industrial revolution After all as the government goes on to note in the industrial strategy report We are an open enterprising economy built on invention innovation and competition We have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business with high standards respected institutions and the reliable rule of law We have achieved near historic levels of employment We are a crossing point for the world because of our geographic position the English language our strong ties our openness to ideas and our vibrant culture Driving an automated future offers a wide range of benefits Not least is the prospect of boosting productivity across all of Britain s leading industries from high tech post industrial manufacturing through to the creative industries sector The UK s industrial strategy has already identified the four grand challenges in the years ahead as artificial intelligence and big data clean growth the future of mobility and meeting the needs of an ageing society Astute investments in AI and automation can enable huge productivity boosts UK consumers are already beginning to recognise that more organisations are embracing this technology and the advantages it can offer including within the public sector In fact after surveying 2 000 UK consumers on their attitudes towards AI and automation in government last year OpenText found that two thirds of UK citizens 66 per cent believe this technology will be introduced into government services within 20 years with 16 per cent claiming that this could happen in the next two years The same poll revealed less fear and uncertainty about the introduction of AI and automation in government than many headlines suggest The majority of those surveyed were not concerned about the implementation of this technology in government with over a quarter 26 per cent going as far as claiming AI and automated technologies would be able to make better decisions than most elected representatives though they would prefer for final decisions to be made by a human Many respondents recognised the immediate benefits of the technology A fifth 20 per cent felt that updating processes by bringing in AI and automation would lead to less admin and form filling Additionally 24 per cent pinpointed reduced waiting times as a major advantage while 19 per cent thought that there would be fewer errors in government as a result of the effective implementation of AI and automation This research shows increasing acceptance of AI and automation as a method to improve services but Britain still has some way to go to fully embrace its potential The UK ranked lowest 16 per cent across the countries surveyed when asked if AI and automated technology would be working in government in the next five years showing more hesitance around its uptake than countries such as France 24 per cent the Netherlands 28 per cent and the USA 22 per cent AI and automation will transform the workplace and bring a wide range of benefits to all sectors including the public sector With the potential to increase the speed efficiency and effectiveness of a wide range of government services AI and automated technologies cannot be ignored While the technology already exists the key challenge over the next few years will be gaining trust amongst both public sector employees and British citizens Mark Baillie director public sector UK Ireland OpenText Image Credit Razum ShutterstockSign up below to get the latest from IT Pro Portal plus exclusive special

BA1 1UA All rights reserved England and Wales company registration number 2008885 From TV shows like Black Mirror to McKinsey Oxford OECD and Brookfield Institute studies many views of the impact of technology particularly automation on the future of jobs and society is bleak We are told stories of automation that will eliminate broad swaths of jobs opening up opportunity for some and having catastrophic effects for others like non college educated workers Brookfield Institute s The Talented Mr Robot 2016 estimates that nearly 42 of the employed Canadian labour force is at a high risk 70 or higher probability of being affected by automation over the next 10 to 20 years Some speculate like futurist Thomas Frey 2014 that hundreds of new types of jobs resulting from emerging technologies capabilities and needs will emerge to employ those people NESTA predicts that around one tenth of the workforce are in occupations that are likely to grow as a percentage of the workforce Around one fifth are in occupations that will likely shrink This latter figure is much lower than recent studies of automation have suggested This means that roughly seven in ten people are currently in jobs where we simply cannot know for certain what will happen It is clear there is not a consensus on what the overall job loss or creation impact of emerging technologies could be with wide ranging estimates of across sectors Further while predictions for job loss like these abound there are far fewer organizations working on envisioning the future of work and the jobs of the future that will employ the workforce of the future as current jobs are changed by automation and other emerging technologies This is where I ve focused my research with my digitalHKS research fellowship Since January 2018 I ve been collaborating with Bill Eggers and Amrita Datar from the Deloitte Center for Government insights to humanize the future of work and visualize the impact of technology on jobs to empower organizations employees and individuals to create a more positive future This week at MIT s EmTech NEXT Conference Bill and I debuted some of the early products and methods we ve developed together including a Future of Government Work Gallery Walk This gallery walk featured four government jobs of the future depicted through futuristic art text and storytelling including Child Aid Coordinators of the future are smart connected and always prepared the deliver on their mission protecting vulnerable children They safeguard the rights of children and intervene in cases of abuse neglect or ill treatment Garrison Commander of the future uses analytical software virtual reality training tools and secure communications to ensure a smoothly functional military installation that service members family members and civilian employees are proud to call home Mobility Platform Managers of their future and their teams are responsible for managing the city s integrated multimodal transportation network and ensuring the seamless movement of people and vehicles They supervise advanced AI systems that power the mobility platform Public Health and Safety Guardians of the future use the power of data cognitive technologies and their public health expertise to protect the health and safety of citizens The Gallery Walk exhibition seeks to invite observers to consider how emerging technologies will enable government work to become more impactful and productive increase decision making capability and better support the overall wellbeing of the employee while focusing on the core building block of the future of work the individual person doing the job The exhibition seeks to humanize the work transformation we might expect to see by 2025 This work demonstrates that not only new jobs will be created but some existing jobs will change in very real ways that we also need to be prepared for It also provides a story that both employees and employers can relate to in order to help encourage real discussion about these futures and enable people to visualize how they might start to approach those possible destinations Our work reverses the current tendency to go from generalizations about changing technology to assumptions about broad job classifications and instead starts with specifics about particular jobs for a more concrete understanding of what could happen in the workplace The Gallery Walk is just a taste of what we re working on We ve been busy developing content examples of jobs of the future and a method for developing jobs of the future and engagement approaches such as workshops and the gallery walk to encourage engagement and discussion around that content Developing proactive and productive tools for designing the future of work is both timely and important According to McKinsey 375 million workers or roughly 14 percent of the global workforce may need to switch occupational categories as digitization automation and advances in artificial intelligence disrupt the world of work In terms of magnitude it s akin to coping with the large scale shift from agricultural work to manufacturing that occurred in the early 20th century in North America and Europe and more recently in China The task confronting every economy particularly advanced economies will likely be to retrain and redeploy tens of millions of mid career middle age workers As the MGI report notes there are few precedents in which societies have successfully re trained such large numbers of people Both employers and employees will need to own their continued education and skill development in order to fill the jobs of the future Thus employers and employees will need to be given tools to envision the jobs of the future in a more visceral way so we can move towards them as a realistic destination Today society has an opportunity to design a better future given the transformation in jobs and way of working that is coming a future where workers aren t just more productive but where their individual well being is better cared for in a job Emerging technologies will change existing jobs as well as create brand new ones It will affect almost everyone you me our family our neighbors Its time humanize the discussion to one beyond an economic discussion about workforce and labour The individual people that will be affected by this change should also be engaged in this discussion The content and engagement approaches that I ve been developing through my digitalHKS fellowship in partnership with Deloitte are a few ways I believe we can start increasing the diversity of voices in the discussion about the future of work You can hear more about our call to put people back at the center of the future of work discussion in the talk I delivered at EmTech NEXT here https events technologyreview com video watch jenn gustetic harvard people future work Powered by SquarespaceEditor s Note Facing the Future of Work Facing the Future of Work In the last few years it has felt like every big election has focused on jobs and the threats they supposedly face from trade from immigrants and most accurately from technology No wonder Until recently the forecasts were almost unanimously grim The robots were coming we were told and they d soon make us humans redundant In the summer of 2015 the Atlantic captured the panic with a cover story titled A World Without Work which warned that the moment when machines make workers obsolete may finally be arriving Then on March 18 of this year a self driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Tempe Arizona and the conversation began to shift Suddenly the fear that humans would soon be superfluous started to seem a little less likely Around the same time the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released a new study that gave intellectual and statistical heft to this idea Yes automation will supplant some workers the report found But not nearly as many as we once thought and not nearly as soon As a result what exactly we should expect work to look like in the future has now become a lot more complicated and the discussions about it much more nuanced Which is why Foreign Policy has devoted this special issue to making sense of the emerging reality While the questions still outnumber the answers a few themes have started to surface As Molly Kinder argues in Learning to Work With Robots new technologies will create both winners and losers Artificial intelligence won t eliminate human labor in some cases it will even produce new jobs But automation is rapidly changing the nature of work and governments must help workers adapt Ryan Avent explores this idea further In Then They Came for the Lawyers he shows how manual laborers won t be the only ones forced to contend with a shifting workplace AI will also change the lives of doctors teachers and other professionals Adaptation is key but it s not the only task ahead of us In Protect Yourself Before You Wreck Yourself Michael Lind warns that retraining workers won t be enough governments must also reshape their trade policies to reflect the new era Of course despite the new developments and the strategies meant to deal with them automation still poses plenty of risks In Closing the Factory Doors Christina Larson shows how automated factories by replacing human textile and other light manufacturing workers may deprive poor nations of a traditional route out of poverty But the key point is that the news is far from uniformly bad FP s Ravi Agrawal shows how the much criticized gig economy is proving a boon for the developing world see Why India Gives Uber 5 Stars And as FP s Rhys Dubin reminds us in There s No Such Thing as a Stable Career constant change has been a fact of life for as long as there has been work to do just ask lectors and longshoremen Indeed just about the only factor that has remained the same is humans ability to adjust to new circumstances and generally make their lives better in the process Big changes are coming and plenty of them But there s no reason to think we won t weather them in typical fashion by working smart and working hard Jonathan Tepperman

business and economics research arm of McKinsey Company Published October 29 2018The SpotMini robot trapped in a room with its mate looks uncannily like a dog well maybe a mutant dog with a canary yellow body and a proboscis sticking out where its head should be The robot confidently scurries to the door raises itself to the perfect height and then uses its appendage to press down the handle Pulling open the door the robot allows its mate to be first across the threshold before the two of them make their dash for freedom Such is the content of a short video by Boston Dynamics that has gone viral since it was released in February Reactions to it on social media have ranged from amusement soon they ll be opening our fridges and stealing our beer to alarm this is how we die It is the latest evidence of recent remarkable advances in robotics and artificial intelligence robots can now perform backflips and ride bicycles and machines empowered by AI are able to analyze X ray images better than expert radiologists and to teach themselves to play the ancient game of Go better than world champions Yet the dog clip is also powerful because it conjures up a more worrisome vision of robots on the loose beyond the control of us humans Thus it plays into a powerful angst laden contemporary narrative about technology and the future of work and maybe even of mankind itself What really are the risks from this new wave of technology And will the opportunities these advances bring with them outweigh those risks To address such questions about the future it is useful indeed necessary to look to the past Technology has for centuries both excited the human imagination and prompted fears about the effects Back in 1589 Queen Elizabeth I of England refused to grant a patent to a stocking frame invented by one William Lee because Her Majesty was concerned about the effect of the contraption on the livelihoods of those who knitted stockings by hand The Luddite weavers in Britain and silk workers in Lyons France famously staged revolts in the early 19th century against new automated looms that threatened their skilled and well paid jobs And in the realm of fiction imagination has run riot since the Czech writer Karel Capek coined the word robot from a Slavic word for work in his 1920 play Rossum s Universal Robots a k a RUR which ends with the destruction of mankind As one of Capek s characters explains Robots are not people Mechanically they are more perfect than we are they have an enormously developed intelligence but they have no soul Almost a century later that same concern about soulless hyper intelligence infuses not just movies like The Matrix and mind bending video series like Philip K Dick s Electric Dreams but also warnings about AI and its potential consequences expressed by Elon Musk and the late Stephen Hawking among others Back in the 1950s the German philosopher Martin Heidegger fretted about the risk that humans would become enslaved by the technologies we rely on With the rise of machines able to mimic many human traits from speech albeit still falteringly to facial recognition already significantly more accurately than humans that time appears to be much closer Yet when we switch from philosophy to economics we find a very different story a long historical record of innovation that shows technological change has been overwhelmingly positive for productivity and surprisingly benign when it comes to employment Job displacement has occurred in waves first with the structural shift from agriculture to manufacturing and then with the move from manufacturing to services Throughout productivity gains generated by new technology have been reinvested and the GDP bounce from that productivity eventually raises consumption and on balance increases the demand for labor In McKinsey s research we have sought to quantify this trend and its net impact in several ways For example we looked at the very big picture what happened to employment as productivity grew over the past 50 years We found no tradeoff between the two for 100 percent of continuous 10 year periods in the United States technologically driven productivity gains have gone hand in hand with rising employment Even when measured in one year snapshots productivity and employment have risen together four years in five The personal computer provides an iconic case to support the compatibility of technological progress with job growth We measured how many jobs were lost and how many gained in the United States between 1980 and 2015 as a result of the diffusion of computer technology Several hundred thousand bookkeepers and auditing clerks secretaries and typists did lose their jobs But the overall balance was strongly positive the desktop laptop computer created more than 19 million jobs in industries ranging from computer hardware to enterprise software to online retail sales against the loss of about 3 5 million jobs a net gain of 15 7 million That figure amounts to 18 percent of all the net U S employment created in the period almost one in five jobs Something similar happened with the invention of the automobile which destroyed the horse and buggy business but gave rise to a wealth of new sometimes unimagined products from petroleum based synthetic rubber to motels That said we ignore those left along the way at our peril For the many workers who are displaced painful transitions are a reality In Britain during the industrial revolution starting in about 1800 wages of the masses stagnated for almost a half century despite a strong surge in productivity that enriched the owners of capital a phenomenon often referred to as Engels pause because it was first noted by the German philosopher who co authored with Karl Marx The Communist Manifesto Wages picked up again as the fruits of productivity gains eventually trickled down to workers But eventually can be a long time the Luddites fears were not entirely unfounded And once again today the link between productivity gains and wage growth seems bent if not broken U S median hourly compensation rose only 11 percent from 1973 to 2016 even as hourly labor productivity grew by 75 percent While it is natural to focus on labor displacement through technology one element often overlooked in the discussion of the future of work is the number of jobs that are neither lost nor gained but fundamentally changed for reasons that are hard to predict History again provides some examples When ATMs became as common as vending machines in the 1970s the number of bank tellers actually increased That s because the new technology reduced the costs of processing individual transactions giving the banks incentives to open more branches to meet local demand for other financial services The tellers primary tasks changed from cashing checks and taking deposits to providing advice and selling securities mortgages and the like To be sure this tale is not yet complete with the rise of online banking the demand for tellers has again waned and so their numbers have thinned especially after the 2008 financial crisis But modern economies are nothing if not dynamic and the only certainty is change There s a similar story to be told about jobs and information technology Thanks to the internet and some ingenious software anyone can now dig up information at the blink of a cursor Yet the need for data analysis has exploded even as the need for data gathering clerks and the like has plummeted And so the number of information analysts of the genus homo sapiens has quintupled since 1980 to about two million today This largely comforting history isn t much help in determining whether this time will be different To the point the rise of ever more sophisticated technologies especially artificial intelligence that can be brought to bear on any number of tasks is likely to usher in a new age of rapid workforce transitions The McKinsey Global Institute recently estimated that in our fastest automation adoption scenario as many as 375 million workers worldwide or about 14 percent of the global workforce will need to switch occupational categories by 2030 in order to avoid obsolescence Even if the pace of adoption is slower as in our midpoint scenario some 75 million workers will need to switch occupational categories in the next 10 to 15 years Among the work most vulnerable to automation jobs that require routinized physical activity in a predictable setting and collecting and processing data Some aspects of the current technological transformation seem in line with that of previous eras the rise of computers for example and earlier epochs of technical change such as the diffusion of the steam engine that transformed work across multiple sectors of the economy simultaneously Every new wave of automation seems remarkable at the time and AI is not the first technology to chip away at cognitive tasks Since the birth of computerized spreadsheets in the 1980s machines have tackled ever more sophisticated problems that previously required human brainpower Still other aspects of the new technologies do seem qualitatively different from previous waves of innovation The rate of technological change today is strikingly rapid and while hard to measure appears to be accelerating Consider in this regard the development of deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques based on neural networks the exponential increase in computing capacity made available through the cloud and the sheer volume of data that can be generated These advances are driving AI for example enabling the development of autonomous vehicles but also heralding breakthrough applications such as a heightened ability to diagnose disease with non invasive techniques Accordingly the share of jobs that could be automated could also be larger than historical precedents suggest That said we see no evidence to date suggesting that the time it takes for new technologies to be diffused throughout the economy is shrinking Looking at a range of high value technologies over the past 60 years from airbags to MRI machines to smartphones we find that the pace of adoption hasn t changed It still takes between 5 and 16 years to reach 50 percent adoption and 5 to 28 years to reach 80 percent adoption Even highly popular social media applications do not beat this clock Facebook for example was begun in 2004 and had attracted more than 2 2 billion followers 13 years later but the untapped market remains vast Consider too that new technology is rarely applied to a blank canvas a variety of economic and social factors play a big role in determining the pace of adoption They include the cost of developing and deploying the hardware and software labor market dynamics the regulatory environment and social acceptance Computer algorithms in state of the art technology aircraft can do just about anything asked of them without a helping hand but we still insist on humans in the cockpit for peace of mind And who wants to be cared for in a hospital solely by a robot We remain disconcerted by the uncanny valley the term coined by the Japanese robotics guru Masahiro Mori to characterize that unsettling feeling people may experience when facing humanoid robots Indeed for tech luminaries ranging from the MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson to the former Google chairman Eric Schmidt the future of work looks set to be not a tale of machines replacing humans but of machines complementing humans in the workplace The rise of AI and the ascendance of self learned algorithms whose logic can be hard to explain pose some arguably unique problems A recent report from a who s who of experts on the malicious use of AI lists a number of the darkest scenarios from political manipulation through hyper personalized disinformation campaigns to a major increase in sophisticated computer hacking attacks For now AI pioneers including Google DeepMind s chief executive Demis Hassabis are clear that while machines are proving formidable in specific areas such as games we remain a long way away from the time when they will have mastered a general artificial intelligence enabling them to think and act like humans And a number of groups including Stanford University s AI100 with which I am associated are trying to look ahead to study and anticipate how AI will affect the way people live work and play long into the future The challenges here for policymakers and business leaders worldwide are significant We will need to institute retraining of workers on a scale we have not seen for generations We will need to rethink and adapt our social systems to help hundreds of millions of workers affected by the new technologies hopefully handling it better than we have handled globalization in providing both new forms of income and job transition support We will need to find ways to tame the wilder unpredictable side of AI For their part CEOs will need to rethink their organizational structures and processes to take advantage of the technologies and the performance enhancing effects they can have or risk ending up in the recycle bin of business history While all of this may seem intimidating it is still the best way forward We should embrace automation technologies for the productivity benefits they bring even as we deal proactively with the workforce transitions that will accompany adoption Given that demographic trends increased longevity low birth rates are rapidly increasing the dependent population our societies really need that productivity boost Beyond the prosperity and employment these technologies will create there will be other societal benefits new moonshots as we use the power of AI to tackle daunting problems from cancer to climate change We can already see one of the key challenges that of worker retraining or reskilling as some like to call it advancing to the top of the corporate agenda and in some countries also receiving renewed political attention In our recent work on the skills that will be needed by the workforce we found that demand will rise sharply not just for technological skills of all kinds but also for social and emotional skills that is leadership and empathy with customers as well as for higher cognitive skills linked to creativity and complex information processing Business leaders tell us that they believe finding the right talent to help implement automation is critical to their future financial performance and they expect companies to take the lead in the skills upgrade that is required Some firms are already putting in place large scale retraining initiatives AT T is using external education providers including for example Udacity At SAP the German enterprise software company the focus is on in house efforts to create learning journeys for thousands of employees including engineers who need to acquire softer skills as their roles change to service customers directly Walmart has set up more than 100 academies in the United States that provide hands on training for positions that include customer service managers and online grocery pickup While welcome these disparate retraining efforts are barely a start Given the scale of the occupational and skill shifts that we see coming in the next decade much more will need to be done and not just by business Governments and educational establishments working together with philanthropic foundations will of necessity be part of the mix Foundations have the advantage of being able to test innovative programs as pilots and will not face the disadvantage of concern that workers with new skills will subsequently jump ship for a new employer As a starter governments will need to reverse the 20 plus year decline in spending on labor related services no small task in light of tight government budgets and in the United States reflexive opposition to government intervention They will also need to be more flexible in order to adapt to the rapidly changing workplace Mobility is one key yet labor markets have become markedly less dynamic in recent years In the United States for example job reallocation rates have declined by 25 percent since 1990 This is the time to test ideas such as portable benefits that are owned by workers and not tied to particular jobs or companies Technology itself can help facilitate greater mobility especially digital platforms turbocharged by AI that enable matching of people to jobs But we also need to rethink some basic assumptions In order for changing jobs across sectors to become a common practice companies will need to agree on definitions and qualifications for specific skills And a major debate is overdue about credentialing Today higher education encourages the world to judge graduates by their subject knowledge rather than by their skills in problem solving and creative thinking skills that will be especially valuable in an AI enhanced workplace More than anything we need to prepare for this new era in which humans must work alongside smart machines far more intensively President Lyndon Johnson was prescient in this regard writing a half a century ago Automation is not our enemy Our enemies are ignorance indifference and inertia Automation can be the ally of our prosperity if we will just look ahead if we will understand what is to come and if we will set our course wisely after proper planning Back then nobody other than science fiction writers could have imagined robot dogs opening doors and escaping to wherever those androids from Blade Runner found refuge But LBJ s words resonate planning for change has never been more important 2019 Milken

gaining and maintaining the trust of our various audiences Be it regulation business attraction logistics compliance or awareness building there are few functions of public sector activity that aren t ultimately dependent on getting a message out But the where and the ways to do that have changed and are changing remarkably And addressing that can t be a merely a function of Corporate Communications teams no matter how good they might be If government is to remain relevant into the future its people need to think about their audiences every step of the way whatever their role But how do individual public servants with their own skills sets and natural abilities embrace a communications role Sue Cato perhaps Australia s leading issues management practitioner will join us in a facilitated discussion that will empower participants to start to realise their own individual potential to make strategic communication work for them their careers and the areas of public work for

restorative and regenerative by design The fast pace of digital change is re shaping today s workforce PwC research indicates there will be net job creation from technology however there is an increasing consensus across thought and practice leaders that it s time to get practical about assisting all workers to adapt to the digital age The task of retraining talent goes beyond digital upskilling 87 of Australia s CEOs either agree or strongly agree that they need to strengthen the soft skills of employees alongside their digital skills Human skills such as creativity flexibility agility problem solving collaboration adaptability and emotional intelligence are skills that can t be automated and therefore there is much value to gain from harnessing these skills in employees This session will distil the shift towards automation and AI in workplaces generally and the public sector in particular and use this as the beginning of a constructive even personal conversation A conversation that acknowledges and de mystifies their potential and facilitates a way to embrace the competitive advantage for individuals and organisations alike from developing skills that complement and leverage an integrated AI HI workforce Technological innovations including always on connectivity artificial intelligence and automation are undeniably changing the nature of work As

sector design from its earliest days realising the potential of the concept through a digital platform has been central to ensuring the viability of the original concept With MindHive 2 0 a new crowdsourcing and networking platform nearing launch participants will have the opportunity to observe how the theoretical and practical challenges were resolved and have the opportunity to experience the potential for policy and strategy development through the MindHive methodology firsthand To many minds the rise of technology and the state of the environment have a relationship that is parallel at best and inverse at worst A rise in one has too often been seen as necessarily having to come at the cost of the other But advances in technology from 3D printing to social media to big data are fundamental enablers to many of the facets of circular economy How can government enable and capitalise on this shift across portfolios as diverse as energy infrastructure social services and foreign aid This session will combine case studies with practical experience to show the digital revolution in a whole new shade green We are living through a fundamental transformation in the way we work Automation and thinking machines are replacing human tasks changing the skills that organisations are looking for in their people But what will the future look like This isn t a time to sit back and

Technology is changing not only how we interact with each other but also our expectations when it comes to experiences Government and Enterprise are in the midst of the biggest call to action that we ve had in the last century and it s all coming down to one word Trust This is the new augmented world of humanity and technology fused together at the very core It s also more exciting than ever Just remember this though New world means new rules Global Futurist Chris Riddell will take you on an incredible journey unlocking exciting insights into human change the mega trends of beyond tomorrow and what true innovation in government looks like Welcome to a new Beyond Tomorrow Leaders and organisations are in an overheating crucible of radical transformation showing up their vulnerabilities and lack of agility It is a world characterised by increasing Variety Interdependency Complexity Change Ambiguity Seamlessness and Sustainability VICCASS These exponential changes challenge the established models and approaches of leadership and require very different capabilities and mindsets Leaders need to think differently behave differently and react differently We need to identify leaders early for their agility creativity ability to lead and connect people and teams their thinking patterns and their systems thinking Senior leaders should be measured on their ability to cut through bureaucracy to enable change their ability to create counter intuitive insights and their courage in challenging the norm It s time to change our thinking on who is a leader how they are trained and in what ways they are rewarded and supported Let s rethink reexamine and redesign leadership development and get the right people into leadership roles now while we still can 2018 Breakout Stream 4Most people interested in the field of innovation have heard of agile innovation teams These small entrepreneurial groups are designed to stay close to customers and adapt quickly to changing conditions When implemented correctly they have a reputation for almost always result in higher team productivity and moral faster time to market better quality and lower risk than traditional approaches can achieve But while agile methods caught on first in IT departments and are now widely used in software development the agile approach has potential to transform the public sector in ways far beyond better bits and bytes Conditions are ripe for agile teams in any situation where problems are complex solutions are at first unclear project requirements are likely to change and close collaboration with end users is feasible a description that matches many facing a wide variety of public sector activities This session will provide participants with an opportunity explore what the world of agile can teach them about themselves their work and their potential to serve their clients better whatever their role It will confront some of the common myths and misconceptions about agile and demonstrate how an agile approach can enable teams to deliver sooner and scale faster through a proven learning culture that builds and strengthens the team and its capabilities Navigating today s

conjures up images of sci fi movies and the future They see it as a threat to their jobs and sometimes even their safety but AI represents the biggest leap forward in terms of work productivity since the personal computer and few other industries can benefit from AI as much as government With AI we can change the way government works and help employees do their job better AI is already integrated into numerous cloud platforms and can be used to discover new information and deliver outcomes instantly I like to refer to this as practical AI AI has the potential to improve employee experiences by speeding up decision making and automating mundane and repetitive tasks Bringing machine learning to everyday work enables government agencies and departments to make better decisions faster because they do not have to hunt for data and aggregate it into a spreadsheet By building intelligence into platforms AI helps manage complex workflows and allows organizations to One way that AI will be applied in the workplace is automating service requests Most companies have an IT service desk as well as a customer support center These functions ensure that customers and employees receive help in a timely manner whether it is a request for a new computer a password reset or the status of a repair Manually triaging thousands of incidents or cases categorizing tasks and routing work can consume resources introduce human error and slow resolution In fact a new report from Accenture found that customer support functions spend up to 12 percent of their time categorizing prioritizing and assigning tickets Meanwhile AI accurately categorizes requests nearly instantly It eliminates the bottleneck created by agents having to manually assign categorize and route requests A full two days a week is wasted on manual administrative work according to the recent State of Work survey conducted by ServiceNow If an agency with 5 000 people automated those processes they could get 4 million work hours back a year Adding AI frees up employees to do the work they want to do spurring creativity Nearly half of respondents 48 percent said work levels increased by 20 percent or more after they adopted AI solutions Additionally 91 percent of executives say their skilled employees spend too much time on admin tasks and 93 percent believe that reducing mundane tasks unleashes employee creativity To properly implement AI solutions across government agencies we need to define which tasks are best suited for humans and which ones should be performed by AI The government has a term inherently governmental to describe work processes or decisions that must be done by government employees Contractors do much of the work in our government agencies but certain work is inherently governmental in nature As we move into an age defined by AI we need to identify and define the work processes and decisions that are inherently human We are going to increasingly work in a blended workplace with AI systems and humans working together to achieve a mission There are certain activities within any work environment that can only be performed or should only be performed by humans While there may be many more human activities designated as inherently human in the beginning I believe that as humans become more comfortable with the role of AI in the blended workforce less and less work will be designated as inherently human There will always be a need for humans to remain in charge from factual responsibility and liability aspects as well as from emotional and psychological ones We spend a third of our lives at work It shapes who we are how we feel and how we interact with the world so we must create great work experiences and this is what AI does AI creates work experiences that unleash productivity bringing out the best in us Rather than fearing machines stealing jobs we need to understand how AI will change the way government works though small

intelligence technologies will transform the future of work disrupting labor markets possibly displacing large numbers of workers Some estimate tens of millions of jobs being lost in the U S and hundreds of millions worldwide 1 One widely cited Oxford University study estimates that 47 of U S jobs are at risk for being automated by 2033 2 Analysts predict that those workers who can least affordit are going to be hardest hit by job losses An Obama White House study found that the jobs that are threatened by automation are highly concentrated among lower paid lower skilled and less educated workers 3 A study by the Joint Center for Political Economic Studies shows that workers of color are disproportionately at risk finding that Over 31 percent of Latino workers and 27 percent of African American workers are concentrated in just 30 occupations at high risk to automation 4 Automation is one of a number of major forces transforming jobs and the nature of employment Others include the fissuring of employment relationships globalization the financialization of U S corporate governance and de unionization All of these forces are having profound impacts on the labor market altering which jobs will be available in the future to whom the pay and working conditions and how workers acquire necessary skills This roundtable brings together experts to discuss what the federal government can and should do to modernize our labor market institutions to ensure that the future of work is inclusive equitable and leads to increasing standards of living for most Americans The panel will explore policy proposals such as preserving the employer employee relationship in lieu of independent contracting promoting worker inclusive technology adoption offering adjustment assistance for displaced workers increasing worker voice improving workforce development and lifelong learning and modernizing the safety net to improve labor mobility Opening

communicate with their stakeholders and citizens while enforcing security privacy and regulations compliance Government workforces are taking on increased workloads with increased expectations and under increased scrutiny while relying on dated and disconnected technology systems to make it all work Enter Intelligent Automation By combining the power of artificial intelligence AI robotic process automation RPA business process management BPM and integration government agencies can address speed process improvement quality accuracy and even the citizen experience At all levels of government automating processes allows time to focus on high value strategic initiatives But in order to enhance programs and services government agencies must first understand how to harness intelligent automation to reap maximum benefits Here are a few benefits that agencies are already seeing with each technology Robotic Process Automation Public sector agencies are finding that RPA bots are valuable for automating mundane repetitive tasks such as cutting and pasting data from one system to another These tools can work with existing IT systems making them a great way to get started Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence AI can solve a number of challenges that the public sector faces today Governments are already implementing AI to improve the quality of citizen engagement and deliver cost savings through chatbots Business Process Management When used effectively BPM can uncover process inefficiencies and improve the quality of end to end processes while also ensuring regulatory compliance and improving government services to citizens by making it easier to modify decision rules and processes as requirements change Integration Integrations empower government to support multiple public data systems on one platform and consolidate the data into a single unified interface Although the Federal government has made gradual strides toward overhauling its IT systems agencies must place a greater emphasis on automation and the new possibilities that come with emerging technologies Intelligent Automation offers government agencies huge potential to

DEBUG:root:Apple has integrated 9 000 trees into its futuristic new headquarters campus reflecting research showing that greenery in workplaces increases productivity by 15 percent Several years ago Google s People Analytics division launched Project Aristotle to understand the components of productive teams embracing research that groups are more creative than individuals Private sector businesses are automating tedious tasks augmenting workers with artificial intelligence technologies reskilling and upskilling their workforces focusing on employee wellness and hungrily recruiting talent Government will have to catch up Perhaps nowhere is the gap between the public and private sector greater than in workforce management Most public sector organizations are still locked into decades old employee policies such as rigid job classifications lockstep pay and a reliance on seniority as a substitute for capability The reality is that government agencies are increasingly called upon to address society s most complex challenges while using workforce approaches rooted in the distant past The good news Change is possible and beginning to happen A new Deloitte study explores some of the ways the nature of government work the public workforce itself and the workplace it occupies will all need to continue to evolve Work New technologies can transform the capabilities of a government worker Artificially intelligent chatbots for example can perform triage on citizen questions freeing human attention for less routine queries The Army s recruitment chatbot SGT STAR does the work of 55 recruiters answering 94 percent of questions A Deloitte analysis of AI s potential found that automation could save the federal government as much as 1 2 billion hours of work annually What AI doesn t automate it can enhance Child welfare caseworkers who according to one study spend just 9 percent of their time with children but 37 5 percent of their time on paperwork could use technology to auto populate documentation freeing time for visits AI also can correlate hospital truancy and arrest records to flag children in danger Some restaurant health inspectors already analyze big data to identify likely candidates for inspections In Chicago for instance tests found 24 percent more critical violations and on average isolated dangers from the food system a week earlier For effective work redesign it s helpful to adopt a two pronged strategy of zooming in and zooming out A zooming in approach hones in on individual tasks and processes that have the most potential to be optimized through automation Zooming out entails looking at the bigger picture to define what work redesign means for entire job classifications departments and the organization as a whole Workforce Specialists in fields like cybersecurity agile development and artificial intelligence are not likely to commit decades to one government position and if they did they d still need to swap into the tech sector periodically to sharpen their skills That s why some government technology programs are taking a tour of duty approach letting private sector experts serve in the public sector for a few years on specific projects without locking them into a lifetime of government work At the federal level the General Services Administration s 18F digital services agency the Oak Ridge Institute for Science Education and the Presidential Innovation Fellows program all help government solve problems with temporary outside hires At the state level Michigan s Cyber Civilian Corps a volunteer group of cybersecurity professionals from the private sector and academia as well as government can be called upon if the governor declares a cyber emergency And long term government workers don t need to be stuck in one place A talent cloud can prepare for unexpected staffing needs by identifying in advance workers with special skills and applying them to tasks suited to their expertise Canada is experimenting with letting multiple agencies dip into a talent cloud and hire workers for specific missions Workers keep their union membership rights and benefits but may be called into service by any agency Workplace Empirical science rarely guides hiring But management is becoming more data driven Applying the newest science on team building personal efficiency and employee wellness to government agencies can upgrade the workplace to better attract retain and utilize talent Insights from studies of the composition and functioning of effective teams can inform decisions about using talents more effectively Organizational network analysis for example can use metadata from emails and other sources to map communication patterns in organizations accurately predicting individuals who will be high performers detecting unsatisfied employees six months before they actually quit and identifying leadership behaviors that correlate with success Modern workplace wellness programs are also extremely impactful Improving employee wellness can reduce lost work days increase retention and fuel productivity After the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center provided a physician and nurse case manager for employees it saw an 80 percent decline in lost work days over six years for a cost savings of 1 5 million In short the future of government work will require a level of dynamic workforce management far beyond the current practices of the public sector The potential for government agencies to unlock more human capital potential and make the public sector a magnet for talent is enormous As Buffalo s former mayor demonstrated to bring the right people together you have to know what it takes to make a project succeed Local governments are using internet surveys to better gauge residents needs Some states are finding ways to make rules easier to navigate and less costly for business while continuing to protect the public s interests The amount of missing and unusable public sector data is stunning Every jurisdiction should be comparing itself with its peers to identify problematic practices increase productivity and reduce costs It s all too easy for team members to misunderstand something Effective leaders know the value of the pre brief WRITTEN BY Charlie Tierney Steve Cottle Katie JorgensenWind back the clock to 1971 Jane a freshly minted college graduate joins the government as a clerk Jane s work consists largely of entering information into databases and creating reports which requires her to spend the better part of her work day seated at a terminal near a mainframe computer that fills an entire room Jane and her colleagues are expected to be at their desks from 9 a m to 5 p m five days a week Jane is grateful to have a steady 9 to 5 job and plans to spend her entire career with her agency Flash forward 40 years and meet Jane s grandson Ian He carries a slim tablet wherever he goes which has more computing power than the mainframe with which Jane worked Ian is constantly tethered to the Internet and works 24 7 from wherever he is Ian expects to switch from project to project and office to office as his career develops and his interests evolve If he feels he has reached the limit of his ability to learn or grow in one role he will look elsewhere for a new opportunity What if the government could give Ian the opportunities and experiences he seeks The GovCloud concept proposed in this paper would restructure government workforces in a way that takes advantage of the talents and preferences of workers like Ian who are entering the workforce today The model is based on a large body of research from interviews with public and private sector experts to best practices from innovative organizations both public and private This is the first generation of people that work play think and learn differently than their parents They are the first generation to not be afraid of technology It s like the air to them Don Tapscott author of Grown Up DigitalThis report details trends in work and technology that offer significant opportunities for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the government workforce It lays out the GovCloud model explaining how governments could be organized to take advantage of its flexibility It examines how work would be performed in the new model and discusses potential changes to government HR programs to support GovCloud Other sections provide resources for executives including a tool to help determine cloud eligibility steps they can take to pilot the cloud concept and future scenarios illustrating the cloud in action The GovCloud model represents a dramatic departure from the status quo It is bound to be greeted with some skepticism Without such innovation however governments will be left to confront the challenges of tomorrow with the workforce structure of yesterday The details of the GovCloud model are open for debate The purpose of this paper is to jumpstart that debate Forty years ago more than half of employed American adults worked in either blue collar or clerical jobs Today less than 40 percent work in these same categories and the share continues to shrink 1 Jobs requiring routine or manual tasks are disappearing while those requiring complex communication skills and expert thinking are becoming the norm 2 Increasingly employers seek workers capable of creative and knowledge based work We should ask ourselves whether we re truly satisfied with the status quo Are our workday lives so fulfilling and our organizations so boundlessly capable that it s now pointless to long for something better Gary Hamel author of The Future of ManagementThe next generation of creative knowledge workers has already entered the job market These Millennials came of age in a rapidly and radically changing world They are the first true digital natives They have grown up with instant access to information through technology As such Millennials have considerably different expectations for the kind of work they do and the information they use The pursuit for variety in work has led Millennials to cite simply needing a change as their top reason for switching jobs 3Advances in technology have also changed the actual ways in which people perform work The ability to crowdsource tasks is one example of this change Since its founding in 2001 volunteers have produced and contributed to over 19 million articles in 281 languages on Wikipedia 4 Built around this concept a burgeoning industry is developing around microtasking dividing work up into small tasks that can be farmed out to workers Amazon s Mechanical Turk rolled out in 2005 allows users to post tasks to a platform where registered workers can accept and complete them for a small fee When this paper was written more than 195 000 tasks were available on Mechanical Turk 5Such technologies may offer suitable possibilities for the public sector Microtask a Finnish cloud labor company maintains Digitalkoot a program that helps the Finnish National Library convert its image archives into digital text and correct existing errors It does so with volunteered labor participants simply play a game in which they are shown the image of a word and then must type it out to help a cartoon character cross a bridge In doing so they are turning scanned images into searchable text greatly improving the search accuracy of old manuscripts 6 At present more than 100 000 people have completed over 6 million microtasks associated with this project 7As the pace of computing power and machine learning increases professors Frank Levy and Richard Murnane contend that more tasks will move from human to computer processing 8 Skeptics need look no further than IBM s Watson a computer that can answer questions posed in natural language In February 2011 Watson defeated two all time champions of the quiz show Jeopardy This was not solely a publicity stunt IBM hopes to sell Watson to hospitals and call centers to help them answer questions from the public 9Around the globe more and more governments are looking to increase telework among employees In 2010 the U S government passed legislation calling for more telework opportunities for government employees Likewise the Australian government in order to attract and retain information and communications technology workers instituted a teleworking policy in 2009 requiring agencies to implement flexible work plans 10 Other countries including Norway and Germany are also focusing on flexible work arrangements to improve public sector recruiting 11 In Canada the government has an official telework policy that recognizes changes are occurring in the public service workforce with a shift towards more knowledge workers and encourages departments to implement telework arrangements 12Cloud definitionsCloud computing Internet based computing whereby shared resources software and information are provided to computers and other devices on demand like electricity AmazonCrowdsourcing Neologistic compound of crowd and outsourcing for the act of taking tasks traditionally performed by an employee or contractor and outsourcing them to a group of people or community through an open call to a large group of people a crowd asking for contributions WikipediaGovCloud A new model for government based on team collaboration whereby workforce resources can be surged to provide services to government agencies on demand GovLabSource Frank Levy and Richard J Murnane The New Division of Labor How Computers are Creating the Next Job Market Princeton Princeton University Press 2004 p 50 Figure 1 Trends in routine and non routine tasks in the U S 1960 200213These are all powerful steps in the right direction for employees whose natural work rhythms are not locked into 9 to 5 Some companies have taken telework one step further British Telecom is pushing the concept of agile working through its Workstyle Project where employees decide what work arrangements best suit them rather than a rigid definition by location and hours BT Workstyle is one of the largest flexible working projects in Europe with over 11 000 home based workers BT has found that its home enabled employees are on average 20 percent more productive than their office based colleagues 14Similarly U S electronics retailer Best Buy experimented with a Results Only Work Environment ROWE In a ROWE what matters is not whether employees are in their office but rather that they complete their work and achieve measurable outcomes In a ROWE salaried employees must put in as much time as is actually needed to do their work no more no less The decline in routine and manual tasks and the rise of new ways of working is not isolated to the private sector In 1950 the U S federal workforce largely comprised clerks performing repetitive tasks About 62 percent performed these tasks while only 11 percent performed more white collar work By 2000 those relationships were reversed Fifteen percent performed repetitive tasks compared to 56 percent in the white collar categories 16 Similarly in 1944 the number of workers in the UK civil service considered industrial totaled 505 000 By 2003 this number fell to 18 200 with non industrial workers reaching 538 000 in 2004 17 And in Canada in 2006 knowledge based workers represented 58 percent of federal workers in the Core Public Administration up from 41 percent 11 years earlier 18The swelling ranks of non industrial government workers indicate a shift in public sector jobs toward creative collaborative and complex work The workforce structure however designed for clerks of the last century remains largely the same With limited flexibility to distribute resources governments often address change by creating new agencies and programs This can be seen following major events like the outbreaks of the Avian flu and SARs in the past decade 9 11 and the financial crisis of 2008 Source United States Office of Personnel Management A Fresh Start for Federal Pay A Case for Modernization April 2002 p 5 http www opm gov strategiccomp whtpaper pdfFigure 2 The changing U S federal workforce 1950 200015Given increasing budgetary pressures and burgeoning national debts the conventional model of creating new agencies or permanent structures in response to new challenges is unsustainable This is exacerbated by our inability to accurately predict future needs and trends Consider a 1968 Business Week article proclaiming that the Japanese auto industry isn t likely to carve out a big share of the market for itself or the president of Digital Equipment Corporation who in 1977 said t here is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home 19The world is full of experts who attempt to predict the future and fail 20Instead of endeavoring to predict the future governments can choose to create a flexible workforce that can quickly adapt to future work requirements To accomplish this the government can learn from a game changing concept in the technology world cloud computing Major organizations and small startups alike increase their flexibility by sharing storage space information and resources in a cloud allowing them to quickly scale resources up and down as needed Why not apply the cloud model to people The creation of a government wide human cloud could provide significant benefits including A cloud based government workforce or GovCloud could include workers who perform a range of creative problem focused work Rather than being slotted into any single government agency cloud workers would be true government wide employees This section outlines the organizational structure of the GovCloud model which rests on three main pillars a cloud of government workers thin executive agencies and shared services Most government workforce models tend to constrain workers by isolating them in separate agencies Consider the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom and the subsequent slaughter of more than 6 million pigs sheep and cattle The problem of an impacted food supply is complicated In most countries multiple agencies focus on agriculture food production and public health In the United Kingdom the army and even tourism ministries were impacted by the outbreak as agencies became overwhelmed by the number of animals in need of disposal and by the cordoning off of tourist areas to prevent the spread of the disease Yet the structure of government agencies often confines employees to work in information silos creating inherent operational inefficiencies In a cloud workforce model experts in each area could be pulled together to support remedies and propose coordinated corrective measures I want someone saying Did you know that the Ministry of Justice is doing that or could you piggy back on what the communities department is doing or had you thought about doing it in this way You ve got to get away from thinking about centralized command and control Dame Helen Ghosh Permanent Secretary UK Home Office 21The FedCloud modelThe GovCloud model could become a new pillar of government comprising permanent employees who undertake a wide variety of creative problem focused work As needed the GovCloud model could also take advantage of those outside government including citizens looking for extra part time work full time contractors and individual consultants Cloud workers would vary in background and expertise but would exhibit traits of free agent workers self sufficient self motivated employees who exhibit a strong loyalty to teams colleagues and clients Daniel Pink author of Drive The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us argues that 33 million Americans one quarter of the workforce already operate as free agents 22According to the white paper Lessons of the Great Recession from Swiss staffing company Adecco contingent workers those who chose non traditional employment arrangements23 are expected to eventually make up about 25 percent of the global workforce 24These more autonomous workers according to Pink are better suited to 21st century work and are more productive even without traditional monetary incentives 25The fluid nature of the cloud can provide significant benefits The nature of the cloud teams forming and dissolving as their tasks require encourages workers to focus on specific project outcomes rather than ongoing operations Thin agency structures could lead to Greater use of shared services could allow the federal government to The need to support some ongoing missions will remain of course These missions will be carried out by thin agencies Under the cloud concept federal agencies would remain focused on specific missions and ongoing oversight These agencies however would become thinner as many of their knowledge workers transfer into the cloud Thin agencies could also create opportunities to streamline organizations with overlapping missions Employees working in thin agencies could fall into two main categories GovCloud could change the highest levels of public sector workers as we know them today The Senior Executive Service in the United States Permanent Secretaries and Directors General in the United Kingdom and Australia all such senior officials could rotate between agencies shared services and the cloud which would reflect the original intent behind many of these high level offices giving executives a breadth of experience in roles across government to help develop shared values and a broad perspective An important benefit of rotation would be the ability to tap into cloud networks to assemble high performing teams To further focus agencies on specific missions many of their back office support functions could be pulled into government wide shared service arrangements The use of shared services in government has come and gone in waves usually dictated by fiscal necessity Most countries in Europe as part of their e government strategies have placed increased focus of late on developing shared services whether through an executive agency or a CIO as well as working with EU coordination activities And while the decentralized governments of some EU countries such as Germany make shared services more difficult these countries are using states and agencies to pilot innovative approaches 27Other efforts around the world include the U S e Government Act of 2002 which examined how technology could be used to cut costs and improve services More recently the New Zealand government appointed an advisory group in May 2011 to explore public sector reform to improve services and provide better value In their report Better Public Services the advisory group recommended the use of shared services to improve effectiveness in a variety of government settings including policy advice and real estate 29 Following up on this three New Zealand agencies the Department of the Prime Minister the State Services Commission and the Treasury announced in December 2011 that they would share such corporate functions as human resources and information technology 30 And though shared services in Western Australia were shut down other projects in South Australia are moving ahead and already showing savings 31In August 2011 the government of Canada announced the launch of Shared Services Canada a program that seeks to streamline and identify savings in information technology Among its first targets is something as mundane as email But with more than 100 different email systems being used by government employees the potential savings and boost to efficiency could be significant Not only do these incompatible systems cost money by requiring individual departments to negotiate and maintain separate licenses and technical support it also makes it difficult for government employees to communicate with one another and with the public And with no single standard ensuring the security of information transmitted over email becomes more challenging Shared Services Canada will move the government to one email system as well as consolidate data centers and networks ultimately looking for anticipated savings of between CA 100 million and CA 200 million annually 28While the idea of using shared services is not a novel one it is central to the GovCloud model The GovCloud model envisions building upon effective practices and those shared services already in operation to deliver services like human resources information technology finance and acquisitions government wide Workers in these shared services would include subject matter experts in areas like human resources and information technology as well as generalists who support routine business functions The potential for shared services continues to grow As seen with IBM s Watson and Microtask s Digitalkoot new technologies provide an opportunity to accelerate the automated delivery of basic services Some agencies already have begun capitalizing on these trends For example NASA has moved its shared service center website to a secure government cloud facilitating greater employee self service and helping to reduce demand on finite call center resources 32This decision tool is designed to help leaders determine which employees are appropriate for each of the three structures in the GovCloud model the cloud thin agencies and shared services To the cloud GovCloud Project LifecycleManaging employees in the cloud will require governments to reinvent human resource management Individual and team performance evaluations career development pay structures and benefits and pensions would need to change to support GovCloud This section examines possibilities for HR reinvention including performance management career development workplace flexibility and benefits Employees working in the cloud would require an alternative to determine pay and career advancement The government could take its cues from the gaming world and evaluate cloud workers with a point system The manager as we know it will disappear to be replaced by a new sort of business operative whose expertise is assembling the right people for particular projects Daniel Pink author of Free Agent Nation 33An HR management system that incorporates the accumulation of experience points XP through effective work on cloud projects training education and professional certifications could replace the tenure centric models for cloud employees As employees accumulate XP they could level up and take on additional responsibilities in future projects Workers in the cloud could earn XP in four ways After some high profile incidents slow responses to outbreaks of foot and mouth disease flooding that may have been preventable and a farming subsidy system that seemed to result in more chaos than aid the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs DEFRA was looking to reinvent itself In 2006 the department launched DEFRA Renew One of its key goals was to bring the department s policymaking closer to actual delivery to create more responsive processes Organized mainly by policy with fixed teams DEFRA had been unable to redeploy resources as needed in response to a crisis As part of DEFRA Renew a new operating model was implemented that used flexible resourcing where staff were assigned to specific projects for fixed periods This allowed management to measure and build the required capabilities and competencies needed and to allocate resources efficiently to improve overall service quality New roles were also created to support sustainable staff development and resource management in the new model To create buy in for such a fundamental culture shift within the department a facilitative approach to decision making was employed Change management programs and mentoring were extended to all levels of the department including leadership New mechanisms such as approval panels for resources and the use of business cases also worked to push changes among staff and promote collaborative behavior DEFRA Renew was widely recognized as a key enabler in the department meeting required efficiency improvement targets set by the UK government DEFRA moved to a more project based approach with fewer staff in core teams According to Dame Helen Ghosh former Permanent Secretary of DEFRA they could be more responsive now that the management board won t be made up of director generals with individual policy silos 34Just as XP could be gained through learning new skills it could be lost in the following three ways Any serious discussion about creating a new class of government employees requires a fresh look at employee benefits and compensation For example XP could be used to help determine workers salaries but additional research into alternative pension and benefit programs is needed While any discussion on compensation could be contentious a healthy debate among stakeholders from across the government should be welcomed As new roles emerge in the cloud so too could new career paths Career emphasis could move away from time served in a particular pay grade and toward milestones that are meaningful for employee development Each worker may have different career aspirations For instance not all workers aspire to management some may seek to master a particular subject area instead Career advancement in the cloud would not equate to moving up a ladder but rather moving along a lattice Lattice GovCloud ModelHere s how the lattice could work for Ian who we met in the introduction Think of the lattice as a jungle gym The best opportunities to broaden your experience may be lateral or even down Look every which way and swing to opportunities Pattie Sellers Fortune editor at largeCathleen Benko and Molly Anderson the authors of The Corporate Lattice argue that the corporate ladder is giving way to a lattice that accommodates flatter more networked organizations improves the integration of career and life focuses on competencies rather than tenure and helps increase workforce loyalty 35 The lattice metaphor allows employees to choose many ways to get ahead It is unlikely that all workers will thrive in the new GovCloud environment right out of the gate As such it would be important to assess a worker s readiness before placing her in GovCloud and providing training on core competencies critical to cloud success There could also be opportunities to start workers especially those at earlier stages of a career within an agency or shared service to build up expertise in some area before graduating to the cloud Once in the cloud new workers could be paired with mentors who are more experienced to help navigate the cloud experience itself There should be an emphasis on continuous learning in the cloud It would be important for cloud workers to continue to refine their skills develop additional expertise and adapt to new ways of working Not only could continuous learning affect workers career mobility by increasing the depth and breadth of their skills but it could also impact their salary and level by increasing their XP Learning and development in the cloud could take on many themes of next learning Next learning focuses on creating personalized learning experiences that leverage the latest technologies and collaborative communities to deliver education and learning programs that build knowledge bases and promote learning as a focus and passion not just a checkbox in a career 36To broaden cloud worker skills and the ability to handle multiple tasks and work on a variety of projects cloud learning could include the following principles 37In the cloud careers and expertise will be built in new ways and work will be something we do rather than a place we go to As such the cloud will give workers more control over their schedules and workloads By creating a flexible workplace governments could shed a significant amount of physical infrastructure and create shared workspaces Many buildings could be converted into co located spaces teams could use collaboration spaces or videoconferencing centers Some workers might rarely set foot in a government building instead conducting cloud tasks at home and interacting with project teams virtually With advancing communications and mobile technology distance no longer hinders collaboration It no longer matters whether all workers are at an office between 9 a m and 5 p m what matters is whether project teams produce results and whether everyone contributes A more flexible workplace could also take advantage of resources governments might not otherwise have access to Some retiring workers may not want to quit working altogether and a flexible model could be an enticing way to keep their expertise on retainer Alternatively the model could take advantage of would be government employees unwilling to relocate or unable to work a regular schedule By increasing flexibility governments could increase their available resource pool allowing agencies to access the skills and knowledge they need when they need it For an example of how a retiree could interact with the cloud see Appendix C National Security Case Study Don t think governments will ever take to the cloud At the U S Department of State the idea could soon be a reality The Office of eDiplomacy is preparing to pilot a cloud component to its e internship model for American students as part of the Virtual Student Foreign Service VSFS beginning this year The VSFS currently offers e internships to U S university students of multiple month duration By using a new micro volunteering platform State Department offices and embassies around the world will be able to create non classified tasks that take anywhere from a couple of minutes to a couple of days to complete Each task will be tagged by region and or issue and will automatically populate the profiles of students who have indicated those interests Students can then select the tasks that interest them the most or that fit into their schedule To see that the most pressing work is performed first offices and embassies will be able to prioritize their tasks so critical items appear at the top of the queue Imagine a small embassy preparing for a high profile multilateral meeting The preparations for such an event could be daunting for a small staff The power of the cloud could augment an individual embassy s capacity to prepare for a major event and ensure that related items are performed ahead of those that are less critical While there are plenty of incentives for participating in the VSFS micro volunteering platform from an impressive line on a student s resume to the chance to make a difference by working on topics of interest thought is being put into how to creatively incent high performance One idea is to simply invoke students competitive spirit Competition could be encouraged by a monthly leader board which results in bragging rights and potentially even a low cost but high impact reward Transparency is also key to competition with ratings available to State Department staff and other cloud interns and the ability to make short thank you notes from embassies publicly available interns would be keen to make a good impression The potential applications of this type of program are significant Imagine if offices throughout the State Department could tap into the language and cultural expertise of the thousands of foreign national staff members around the globe Providing a platform for those employees to contribute even a small amount of time to discreet tasks that require their expertise could unlock a world of knowledge 38Creating the GovCloud model will require bold leadership and the ideas and initiatives of entrepreneurial executives While a GovCloud model may be years in the making agencies can begin adopting cloud concepts today The GovCloud concept is designed to be versatile as well as applicable to a wide range of entities Depending on your organization government executives wishing to employ GovCloud may choose to apply the concept first to a unit before expanding to other branches or divisions entire agencies or the whole of government Often GovCloud principles are most effectively implemented as part of a larger reform program within a particular agency as with the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs Renew program as described earlier in this report On a smaller scale the UK Cabinet Office used flexible resourcing FR in its Economic Reform Group ERG with a staff of about 400 as part of its cost reduction plans Using a simple database that it had developed and a strong program of communications FR is now used and embraced by all core ERG employees with strong clear ownership from the top another key implementation factor Says Ian Watmore the UK Cabinet Office s former permanent secretary FR means we are able to deploy people much more quickly to priority projects 40Figure 3 outlines how GovCloud can apply to a variety of organizations Most government workforces haven t undergone a broad restructuring in decades In that time the world has been transformed by computers the Internet and mobile communications To respond to a variety of challenges governments have created scores of new organizations However in today s world of budget cuts and increased fiscal scrutiny the constant creation of new permanent structures is not sustainable The GovCloud model could offer a new way to use government resources A cloud of government wide workers could coalesce into project based teams to solve problems and separate when their work is done This could allow governments to concentrate resources when and where they are needed By using this model in conjunction with thinner agencies and shared services governments can reduce back office redundancies and let agencies focus on their core missions This model capitalizes on the work preferences of Millennials the future government workforce who value career growth over job security or compensation 41 The GovCloud model allows employees to gain a variety of experiences in a shorter amount of time and to self select their career direction To support GovCloud governments could establish the processes by which cloud teams would form work and dissolve New ways to evaluate performance and help workers gain skills and build careers should be considered Today s employee classification system stresses job descriptions and time in service this could be transformed with an XP model that emphasizes the individual s ownership of his or her career The GovCloud model will undoubtedly be controversial Many stakeholders from governing bodies to public employee unions must weigh in to shape the future government workforce The transition to a cloud model will not happen overnight or maybe even in the next five years but the conversation starts today Charlie Tierney is a Manager in Deloitte Consulting LLP s Federal Human

impact on the future of work and the workforce We will provide an independent assessment of the scale and potential impacts of rapid technological change and its disruptive impact on the future of work and the workforce in New Zealand The overriding aim is to harness changes to maximise the wellbeing of New Zealanders The assessment is to provide material for future government policy development and other initiatives to prepare the country for a productive sustainable and socially inclusive future despite uncertainties around the impact of technology Two broad questions are to guide the assessment Find out more by reading the terms of reference here Are workers being replaced by machines How is the nature of work and the workforce changing To start this project we ve analysed employment data from the last few decades to help understand what has changed and what future employment trends might be likely Watch this 3 minute video to find out more The Commission will release an issues paper in April outlining the context and scope of the inquiry key issues to be investigated and a list of questions to be addressed and evidence sought We will invite you to review the issues paper and share your feedback on the questions asked or on any issues that you consider relevant to the terms of reference Issues paper released April 2019Series of reports for feedback August November 2019Final report to Government 31 March 2020Our mission is to help leaders in multiple sectors develop a deeper understanding of the global economy Our flagship business publication has been defining and informing the senior management agenda since 1964 Our learning programs help organizations accelerate growth by unlocking their people s potential Higher costs and rising demand have driven rapid increases in spending on core public services such as education healthcare and transport while countries must grapple with complex challenges such as population aging economic inequality and protracted security concerns Government expenditure amounts to more than a third of global GDP budgets are strained and the world public sector deficit is close to 4 trillion a year At the same time governments are struggling to meet citizens rising expectations Satisfaction with key state services such as public transportation schools and healthcare facilities is less than half that of nonstate providers such as banks or utilities Governments need a way to deliver better outcomes and a better experience for citizens at a sustainable cost A new paper by the McKinsey Center for Government MCG Government productivity Unlocking the 3 5 trillion opportunity suggests that goal is within reach It shows that several countries have achieved dramatic productivity improvements in recent years for example by improving health public safety and education outcomes while maintaining or even reducing spending per capita or per student in those sectors If other countries were to match the improvements already demonstrated in these pockets of excellence the world s governments could potentially save as much as 3 5 trillion a year by 2021 equivalent to the entire global fiscal gap Alternatively countries could choose to keep spending constant while boosting the quality of key services For example if all the countries studied had improved the productivity of their healthcare systems at the rate of comparable best performers over the past 5 years they would have added 1 4 years to the healthy life expectancy of their combined populations That translates into 12 billion healthy life years gained without additional per capita spending It s imperative that governments find a way to unlock that productivity opportunity The challenge is that until now there s been limited progress on measuring government productivity even though productivity is a well established and vital measure of the performance of national economies and private sector businesses As a result it is difficult for governments to gauge the true return on spending and debate is often focused on how to increase inputs and not the quality of outputs Governments typically find it challenging to identify improvement opportunities by learning from other countries or from other regions or sectors within the same country To help close this gap MCG built a comprehensive database and benchmarking methodology the Government Productivity Scope to start to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of government expenditure MCG applied the tool across 42 countries that together make up 80 percent of global GDP focusing on seven sectors healthcare primary secondary and tertiary education public safety road transport and tax collection The research was supplemented with insights from more than 50 interviews with government leaders and more than 200 case studies This paper presents the first version of MCG s analysis which we will continue to extend and refine in dialogue with government leaders and academic experts The initial findings point to dramatic differences in countries relative productivity Even among comparable countries with very similar outcomes the least efficient government currently spends more than twice as much per unit of output as its most efficient peer And while most countries have struggled to contain spending growth in every sector MCG found examples of governments that have reduced expenditure per unit while experiencing improved outcomes These differences point to a tremendous opportunity for governments to boost productivity save money and achieve better outcomes for citizens To realize that opportunity though governments need to deepen their functional capabilities in four key areas finance commercial digital technology and data analytics and talent management As MCG shows pioneering countries have reimagined and strengthened these functions so they play a more strategic leadership role in pursuing efficiency and improving outcomes Across these areas those governments have adopted an ambitious structured approach to transform the effectiveness of the state Please sign in to print or download this article Please create a

Development of Australia CEDA WA on 17 July 2018 in Perth Jobs matter For almost all of us they are a source of income But they are also a source of self esteem of social interaction a feeling of purpose and even of community And the skills embedded in jobs remain principal drivers of increasing productivity and ultimately wages So when one opines on the future of work people tend to listen But perhaps when one is opining on the future of work today expectations of the listener are more akin to the BBC announcer of Monty Python s Flying Circus and now for something completely different When perhaps it s simply not so different And I guess that may well prove the damp squib hashtag for my talk today We know from history that soothsayers abound when it comes to opining on the future of work Indeed history is littered with the foretelling of a dystopia of jobless woe or a utopia of little need to work at all And the only universal truth seems to be that they were all wrong both happily and unhappily so The 20th century father of the fiscal stimulus John Maynard Keynes foretold in 1930 that In the 21st century a 15 hour work week will suffice as we turn instead to how to use freedom from pressing economic cares And yet despite significant productivity gains since the Keynes 1930 treatise we still all work on average around 40 hours a week In the late 1970s the historian Ian Turner presided over a major symposium on what new technologies would mean for the worker He predicted an imminent period of change as significant as the Neolithic or Industrial Revolutions To quote By 1988 at least a quarter of the Australian workforce would be made redundant by technological change And a similar adage we heard in 1982 from Barry Jones in his book Sleepers Awake technology and the future of work We all know that the late 1980s did see an exponential uptick in the common use of computers in workplaces and even more so in the 90s as the price of the humble computer plummeted But the foretelling of widespread redundancies of the Australian workforce were not seen For throughout the past 100 years it s been more a case of technology remaining the loyal friend not foe of the worker continuing to remove jobs that are often unpleasant physically tiring downright dangerous or just tedious think toll booth operator More recently we ve seen a plethora of papers and reports produced by think tanks academics consultants and platform giants touting analyses of jobs that could be lost as a result of the latest wave of technological change And that latest wave being the digital age and both the resultant automation and artificial intelligence Some of these reports seem to have settled on a nice big round figure of about 40 per cent of today s jobs now being at risk of automation over the next 10 to 20 years Now most of these reports stem from a seminal 2013 paper by Frey and Osborne where US data was used to predict job losses in the future But their approach left out a few things It did not take into account that new technologies can create new jobs Nor did it contemplate that not all tasks within an occupation can be automated or should be automated And we know that the rate of technological adoption will also depend a lot on consumer preferences do you want a robot cutting your hair and the actual cost or put crudely the business case of adoption Others in taking these factors into account suggest 9 of Australian workers are exposed to the risk of automation So a much smaller but not insignificant number And here I ll mention the must read paper by Melbourne University economists Jeff Borland and Michael Coelli Are the Robots Taking Our Jobs Their work lines up with the more considered studies in the US and Europe So let s look at the evidence a common sense thing to do when in the midst of a chorus of now for something completely different To test whether we have strayed into a world of lies lies and damned statistics And in looking at the evidence I ve drawn on some of the Commission s recent endeavour such as our Digital Disruption report 2016 and Shifting the Dial 2017 as well as the work of Jeff Borland and Michael Coelli and that of Bart van Ark of The Conference Board Overall the evidence suggests that labour markets have been pretty well resilient to shocks posed by new technologies of the past century and even the most recent modern bit Occupations skills and jobs come and they go No matter how transformative the technology be it the telephone electricity indoor plumbing refrigeration air transport the personal computer and today s digital No technology has removed people s capacity to work And in productivity terms all have been more transformative than the digital revolution so far with emphasis being on the so far And a bunch of measures suggest that technology is not having as large of an effect as expected at least not in our current modern times The rise of the New Digital Economy which encompasses mobile technology ubiquitous access to the internet and the world of the cloud is unquestionably changing lots of things But to date productivity is not one So much so that this has become known as the Productivity Paradox So whilst our low rate of multi factor productivity growth observed recently is not unique to Australia it has been observed across other countries too it represents something of a puzzle This is because it suggests that at least in aggregate our economies have not become any more efficient in producing things And we know the policy reasons why productivity may have slowed in Australia but this is notwithstanding our purported better ability to exploit information technologies One explanation for this is that there has been a change in the nature of technological progress That recent technologies characterised by some as dramatic have been minor compared to those in the previous century The other explanation one offered by Bart van Ark and perhaps one of intuitive appeal is that whilst we still see rapidly declining ICT prices along with a shift from ICT investment to ICT services perhaps the new digital economy is still in its installation phase And we shouldn t expect to see the productivity dividend until it truly enters the deployment phase This makes sense when you see that in the US the contribution of the most ICT intensive industries to productivity growth has dropped markedly from 46 to 26 in the past decade 2007 16 And for the US and the UK it has even at times registered negative productivity growth in these sectors Which could suggest that the dividend only makes its way into the deployment and hopefully productivity dividend phase once users fully grapple with how to absorb technology effectively So returning to the evidence on the impact on jobs And we do know that there has been automation of many tasks in the workplace But arguably if technology was both disruptive and displacing replacing existing jobs without creating new ones we would expect to see a persistent upward trend in the unemployment rate And we don t Whilst routine manual and routine cognitive jobs have fallen as a proportion of jobs from 50 to 37 non routine manual and non routine cognitive jobs have increased from 42 to 53 Think child care aged care nursing office managers designers and engineers using software Most importantly the aggregate amount of work available to the Australian population on a per capita basis has not seen a decline since the 1980s when computers became common in the workplace The amount of work available has actually increased by about 14 since the early 1980s But that s not to say there hasn t been a lot of change in our workforce and the nature of work since the 1980s Since the 1980s the workforce participation rate for females has increased a lot by some 15 percentage points to now be just over 60 Marriage and even children are placing much less of a brake on economic participation of women Which is both a good thing for the economy and for women There has also been an increase in the incidence of part time jobs by some 25 percentage points since the late 1960s to now account for nearly one third of total employment around 35 in Australia And despite what some have suggested the pace at which workers are changing between jobs in the Australian labour market is not getting quicker Not only is there no evidence that more workers are being forced to work in short duration jobs but what is apparent is that the opposite has happened The proportion of workers in very long duration jobs more than 10 years has increased from just under 20 per cent in 1982 to around 27 per cent in 2016 Which is perhaps unsurprising when you also take into account the participation rate of older Australians 65 in age has risen steeply having nearly doubled in the past 30 years to now represent 12 of our workforce Also a good thing with our ageing population We do know that more workers today have multiple jobs now around 7 of workers And perhaps of much greater significance when workers do change jobs today more are changing occupations some 40 and industries over 50 And it was this modern day workforce reality that informed much of our thinking around the Commission s proposed changes to superannuation default arrangements in our current superannuation Inquiry And our thinking on what is needed from our tertiary education system which I ll return to later And whilst the gig economy is still in its infancy this has not translated yet to any increase in the proportion of the workforce being independent contractors Indeed this has not changed significantly since 2001 it s actually fallen a few percentage points from 20 per cent of employed persons in 2001 to around 18 per cent in 2014 So what does any of this mean or matter for public policy And perhaps here our focus should be two fold First on making sure there are no road blocks to our economy reaching the deployment phase of the digital or any technological age And second making sure we avoid a workforce of have and have nots in the benefits from the changes in the economy and ultimately jobs A sense of equality in the ultimate job productivity and wage dividend So let me pose a few policy questions Are we getting better at assisting transitioning workers We know that structural change whatever its source can result in considerable work and thus life disruption for the workers impacted unless we get the consequential skill adjustment right So have we gotten better in assisting displaced workers get the right skills to transition into new occupations and industries Recent work by the Commission on transitioning regional economies found that effectiveness of government in doing this is at best unclear Some programs found to be not well targeted automotive industry or create conflicting incentives Tasmanian forestry industry And why unclear use of data to simply track the impacted workers and decent evaluation of transitional assistance are largely missing in action Put simply we can and should be doing better Further it s a tad perverse that if the digital economy ultimately disrupts more jobs we do not use the data fuelling that economic activity to assist those disrupted We know of such endeavour in Germany using data to track the worker and the resultant human capital modelling which in turn better informs what requalification programs will deliver a better job transition to a displaced worker Are the right incentives in place to get the workers to the new jobs We know that jobs at least risk of automation jobs that require soft skills such as good old fashioned empathy account for the largest and growing part of our workforce And the latest metrics from the ABS brand new quarterly labour account experimental estimates reveal health care and social assistance as the largest employment sectors accounting for over 1 6 million jobs or 12 2 of all filled jobs This is largely a function of our demographic changes an ageing population women working more along with the NDIS arguably our single biggest social reform since Medicare The Commission s recent review of NDIS costs found that the NDIS workforce was not growing fast enough most regions require between a 50 per cent and 150 per cent increase in the disability services workforce Put simply for the foreseeable future 1 in 5 new jobs in Australia are projected to be for services for the NDIS Thus care is needed to ensure that the demand for these skills and workers is not frustrated by poor incentives The most notable as highlighted in our NDIS review being the need to ensure the pricing of these services allows this massive labour force response to occur Lest we have a program delivering disappointment and not services to the 475 000 Australians with eligible disabilities Is our education and training system fit for purpose for the workers of today and tomorrow Perhaps this is our biggest public policy must have when thinking of ensuring innovation and technology delivers not just more jobs but jobs for most That sense of equality in who shares in the ultimate job productivity and wage dividend And this was a question the Commission sought to ask and answer last year in our inaugural 5 yearly productivity review Shifting the Dial A policy roadmap for Australian Governments on what is needed to deliver on economic participation and productivity two of the three Ps population participation and productivity that matter most for economic growth and ultimately jobs and their real wages And we identified some fundamental fractures in our current education and training system First deteriorating results in subjects that matter for future work think science maths and reading the cognitive trifecta at school Second the VET system is a mess struggling to deliver relevant competency based qualifications Employers today are more satisfied with non accredited training courses 90 than VET 76 Third universities need to improve student employment outcomes delivering qualifications relevant to labour market needs and at a time relevant to the worker s needs Our key educational institutions seem more focused on research than student employment outcomes which is unsurprising given the notable absence of their skin in the game As manifest in 26 of students today not completing their undergraduate studies in less than 9 years Whilst undergraduate underemployment has more than doubled in the last decade to now reach just over 20 Currently the tertiary education system is set up against becoming a chef at age 40 or a dementia care worker at age 50 Retraining is currently inconvenient and expensive and the approach of educational institutions remains outdated and outmoded still emphasising a one career for life approach Which is not the modern day reality for many workers from the metrics cited earlier Taken collectively this unfortunate troika can only put at risk our capacity to deal with future labour market changes in an efficient and equitable way So we ve proposed a few things change for schools evidence and evaluation of what works with teaching for universities incentives be redressed around student employment outcomes and for work skills government to develop two things First tools for proficiency based assessment for skills rather than simply competency based assessment whether they can perform it at all And second a framework to facilitate independent accreditation of skills obtained agnostic of learning method Do current policy settings constrain us getting to and through the installation phase and on to realising benefits in the deployment phase of the digital economy Today s market power arguably resides in data and content The growth of the digital economy automation and artificial intelligence coupled with greater availability of data and algorithm advances will be key drivers of new business activity research endeavour products skills and jobs In short access and use of data and content will be the determining force in realising the economic benefits of the digital economy and artificial intelligence On data the Commission s report last year on Data Use and Availability proposed fundamental and novel changes to data availability and access policy to ensure it generates new economic opportunities and business opportunities driven by consumer needs and preferences A pro consumer and thus pro competition stimulus with the consumer in the drivers seat for their data held with business and government today And the good news is the Government s response to this inquiry has been one of can and will do The Government has committed to support the two most structurally significant recommendations First the passage of national legislation to remove barriers to data sharing and integration across major public interest data sets and create trusted user access And second the complementary legislated concept of a new general Right for Consumers to exercise joint control in the sharing and use of their data So it s now all down to getting the implementation right On content the Commission s Inquiry in 2016 on Intellectual Property Arrangements examined whether those arrangements meet the needs of the Australian economy And the short answer was no for copyright Currently Australia s copyright exceptions are too narrow and prescriptive do not reflect the way people today consume and use content and do not readily accommodate new legitimate uses of copyright material We found ourselves mired in the wrong debate of publishers clamouring for well protected profit for the purported benefit of local authors For access to content be it snippets of images maps pixels words song sounds is needed alongside data to actually do artificial intelligence But our arrangements unlike those in countries like the US South Korea and Israel pose a seemingly impenetrable barrier to AI being alive and well in our economy For in the absence of meaningful reform to copyright Australia will inevitably and demonstrably be a net importer of AI services and products And fair access to content also matters for education Now more than ever workers need flexible access to ongoing learning MOOCs are a key component of providing low cost and flexible access to ongoing learning And in consulting with the states on Shifting the Dial we were implored to think of the transitioning worker in NW Tasmania in our approach to ongoing skills acquisition especially for mature age workers Yet Australia s current system of copyright usage heavily constrain Universities TAFEs and schools from offering MOOCs So on a final note I ve failed dismally to foretell a future of dystopia or utopia and happily so but that doesn t mean that the deployment phase of the digital economy may yet still surprise us And in reflecting on the Inquiries that formed much of the Commission s endeavour over the last five years or so nearly all have dealt in some way shape or form with the now of work and thus the future of work And in doing so tried to view it through the lens of the needs of workers and students And through that lens it affords a sense of what policies new or tweaked will see our economy able to access the installation phase and realise the benefits of the deployment phase of any technological change And perhaps most importantly ensuring those phases see the benefits of jobs productivity and higher wages shared across the workforce Avoiding a world of technology driven haves and have nots Because that s what matters most for the future of work Follow OnSubscribeThank you for inviting me to speak with you here today In particular I want to thank the Productivity Commission and all involved in the Productivity Hub The previous presenters today have touched on a range of ideas for how we can face the challenge of improving our productivity in a changing world From technology and data to public services and the energy transition I m excited to see forward thinking people working on such a broad range of important topics I d like to commend you all and encourage you to keep up the good work My presentation today will focus on an issue that is at the heart of a productive economy how we approach the rapidly changing world of work I want to talk about how this fits with the overall economic strategy of the Government the core policy areas that we have identified to support New Zealanders in this process and the institutional settings required to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of the Future of Work Economic StrategyBy harnessing the potential of new technology and innovation educating and upskilling our workforce and incentivising research and development we can lift productivity and transition to an economy that is sustainable inclusive and productive That is this Government s overarching economic aim The lessons learned from the Future of Work Commission heavily influenced this Government s economic strategy We aim to shape an economy where we work smarter make better use of our resources ensure everyone who wants to work can work and ensure that the benefits of growth are spread across society In an article published this past weekend Rod Oram argued that we can rise to the immense challenge of making this a high value high wage economy over the next decade The global and local conditions for doing so are the most favourable ever I know there is an appetite among businesses and workers to take up this challenge and I couldn t agree more that the time is right to face up to this Boosting productivity across the economy will be one of the key drivers to improving New Zealanders living standards and wellbeing The Government will put this at the heart of what we do Our focus on lifting wellbeing will require a different approach and different measures of success We want to take a broader view of success and move beyond simple measures such as GDP which while an important measure of economic output does not tell the full story of peoples wellbeing We are working with our Confidence and Supply partner the Green Party on new sustainable development indicators to paint a fuller picture of how well off people are and how the Government can focus its resources best I have also instructed the Treasury to accelerate their work on the Living Standards Framework which measures the impact of policies on four capitals Human Social Natural and Financial Physical I intend to use this framework to inform the Budget process for Budget 2019 making it our first ever Wellbeing Budget By placing wellbeing at the heart of what we do we will be able to measure the extent to which our policies and investments are making real improvements to peoples lives Improving productivity is key to improving wellbeing By producing more from every hour worked businesses become more profitable incomes rise and workers wellbeing rises as time is freed up and purchasing power rises The challenge is how we achieve this The Changing World of WorkThis Government has come into office at an interesting time in New Zealand s economic story Technological advances are transforming our world for example through increased processing power and big data sensors remote work or smart devices The full effect of forces such as automation algorithms and globalisation are not yet known but we do know that they already are and will continue to be disruptive to what only 5 or 10 years ago we considered the status quo My thinking on this topic was shaped by the Future of Work Commission which I chaired for the Labour Party when we were in Opposition It was an ambitious undertaking that saw us engage with thousands of New Zealanders and experts from around the world It is hard to distil that work down to a few points but overall my takeaway is that there is an enormous possibility for us to have productive and fulfilling work over the coming decades But it will only happen if we prepare now We are facing a world where the change has been estimated by McKinsey Global Institute to be occurring at ten times the pace of the Industrial Revolution and 300 times the scale or roughly 3 000 times the impact Every aspect of our working lives is changing Whole jobs are disappearing and almost every job is being re shaped The very notion of what a job is has been challenged by the so called gig economy Advances in technology present both challenges and opportunities for this sometimes all at once For example a company which automates production of its products will experience productivity gains but there might be consequences for the company s workers What happens to those who are laid off How well positioned are they to quickly retrain Could their past training help them swiftly move into other work How can we benefit from changes to the nature of work while negating or limiting the disadvantages We cannot say with any certainty exactly what the world of work will look like but there are some core changes we can identify and the responses to them that are needed This represents both challenges and opportunities How we respond will drive the future of New Zealand s economy and shape how productive sustainable and inclusive our growth will be over the next few decades We all know the story of the New Zealand economy Over the past 20 years New Zealand has generally done well in the creating more part of the productivity equation GDP growth has averaged about 2 8 over that time compared to the OECD average of 2 1 But it s the other part of the equation the resources required to create more where we have been weak Of that headline growth about 1 7 can be attributed to growth in the volume of labour input or simply total hours worked In other words we required strong population growth and more people entering the workforce to ensure more hours were worked in order to increase production More people working is not a recipe for long term sustainable and inclusive growth The portion of that growth which can be attributed to getting more from each unit of labour in producing goods and services has been 1 1 of that 2 8 over the past 20 years that is we are one of the weaker performers in the OECD In fact our relatively low labour productivity growth over a long period of time means the level of labour productivity in New Zealand GDP per hour worked is about 20 below the OECD average The Productivity Commission has told us that New Zealand s shallow capital markets have meant low levels of investment of productive capital the stuff we need to invest in to help us create more from our available resources Our investment in non residential capital per person in the labour force in 2016 was 25 lower than the OECD average In order to get ahead in terms of headline growth we relied on more people coming here to work and those who were already here to enter work We are at a point where the level of labour productivity in New Zealand GDP per hour worked is around 30 below Australia We have to do something different In recent years the main growth drivers have been population growth and a run away housing market That is not a sustainable path and as those forces recede we need to move deliberately and with urgency to establish an economy that is based on a thriving productive sector We also have to ensure that the benefits of this growth translate into meaningful improvements to the living standards of many New Zealanders who missed out in recent years I spoke earlier about our Government s emphasis on wellbeing and delivering higher living standards for all New Zealanders We want to ensure the economy is delivering real benefits to peoples lives rather than simply pursuing growth for the sake of growth Our success in achieving this will largely be determined by how we respond to the challenges we face including New Zealand s productivity challenge With this in mind today I want to talk you through this Government s plan to ensure we are prepared to face the changes that are coming due to technological advances and the changing nature of work In responding to this our Future of Work report identified three core values to drive our response We need to be Inclusive offering opportunity and harnessing the talents of all Resilient to deal with the changes and shocks that are coming our way and Adaptable to be leaders of the change and shape it in line with our values There are a huge range of policy approaches and changes to the way we run our economy that are needed to meet these challenges and take the opportunities that will arise Our Tax Working Group and the reforms we are making to the Reserve Bank Act are an important part of setting the path to a more productive economy That focus on improving productivity is at the heart of the terms of reference for both these reviews Beyond these we had more than 63 recommendations in our report and you will be pleased I am not going to go through them all now I want to touch on just a few of the main themes Just TransitionIn the face of this rapid change it is essential that we have a just transition for those most affected We saw in New Zealand in the 1980s and 1990s the damage that can be done when major changes are made without enough thought or support given to those who face the immediate consequences In this instance I am using that phrase to primarily talk about two things one at a system level the other at a practical on the ground level The government has committed itself to the goal of a net zero carbon economy by 2050 This is an essential shift for New Zealand away from an economy that hastens climate change to one that is more sustainable and develops New Zealand s strategic advantages We will need to ensure this is a just transition where affected industries and communities are given the support to find new sustainable growth opportunities We are in the process of establishing an Independent Climate Commission which will have the job of establishing goals and targets Meanwhile under the leadership of Hon James Shaw a Green Investment Fund is being created to leverage private sector investment to support business developments that will support a low carbon economy Innovation science and research will have significant roles to play in this However New Zealand s total investment in Research and Development is only 1 3 of GDP about half the OECD average When the OECD issued its most recent assessment of the New Zealand economy last year this is what it had to say on R D Expenditure on R D is low as a share of GDP most notably in the business sector Collaboration between firms education and research institutions is low And its advice Increase fiscal support for business research and development Maintain or increase long term support for successful collaboration between research institutions and industry In the Coalition Agreement with New Zealand First we have set a target of hitting an R D spend of 2 of GDP in ten years That s more than a 50 increase in R D investment relative to GDP over that time and will make a significant contribution to improving our productivity Officials say that this is an ambitious goal We believe this can be done with the Government incentivising such vital work by the private sector Minister for Research Science and Innovation Megan Woods has already begun work on overhauling New Zealand s R D regime with Ministers set to discuss officials initial findings later this month We are committed in the first instance to restoring R D tax credits to give firms some certainty about their investments One other key investment identified in our Future of Work programme is in direct support of the technology sector and for businesses to make better use of new technology Research by Swedish academic and technologist Goran Roos found that 55 of New Zealand jobs are at risk due to technological advances and that countries likely to be least affected will be those with the highest levels of economic complexity This is just one of the reasons why it is important for us to diversify our skills base and look for more sustainable drivers of growth By putting the right policies and incentives in place the technology sector can be one of those economic drivers While technological advances present challenges to existing jobs we also have the opportunity to create new forms of work According to NZTech chief executive Graeme Muller only 14 percent of large NZ businesses have deployed any enabling technology for the Internet of Things despite 70 percent believing it will be strategically important for their business to do so Their concerns are largely around costs and changes in technology This Government wants to nurture an environment that gives businesses the confidence to take up new technology Minister Clare Curran is in the process of creating the position of Chief Technology Officer CTO who will report directly to the Prime Minister and Cabinet The CTO will be responsible for introducing and managing a National Digital Architecture and Digital Technology Roadmap They will also work with the wider industry to develop ingenuity and creativity in the ICT sector Our aim is for the ICT industry to be our second largest contributor to GDP by 2025 Learning For LifeThe other critical element of a just transition to this new world of work is how we support people to gain the relevant skills and knowledge We need to both support those workers whose jobs are under threat and prepare those who are yet to start working for the kind of labour market they are likely to enter New Zealand currently spends a fraction of what other countries do on active labour market policies Other countries around the world such as Singapore France and Germany have recognised that they need to both plan ahead for the changes but also provide greater support for people who are displaced by technological change The Future of Work was the catalyst for our three years free training and education policy One of this Government s key policies is to provide one year of free post secondary education or training gradually progressing to 3 years by 2025 In 2018 we will see 30 000 students enrolled in tertiary education courses and 50 000 in industry training without paying fees for their first year of education thanks to this policy This is extremely important for those whose jobs or future jobs are affected by automation and other technologies One aspect of this policy has not had a lot of attention which is for adults who have never trained or studied before They will be able to take up the three years free policy as it is rolled out This can be taken in short bursts or as complete re training This policy also covers the costs of those undertaking apprenticeships and aspects of industry training Because of the relative costs from 2018 this means two years free for apprentices right away For the next generation of people entering the workforce it is essential they are given the skills to be resilient and adaptable In the Future of Work Commission s time we heard from employer after employer that they were looking for people with what we once called soft skills the ability to collaborate be creative and solve problems These ideas lie at the heart of New Zealand s education curriculum but there is work to do to ensure they are developed for all our young people We will be embarking on a host of initiatives to see this happen including reform of our careers advice and guidance in schools to give all young people the opportunity to understand and experience the world of work This will be developed in close cooperation with business and training providers to create a more seamless transition from school to whatever comes next In January Employment Minister Willie Jackson announced the first of a series of initiatives to help give a group of young people who have fallen outside of the system sustainable work opportunities Sadly Maori and Pacifika young people are over represented among this group They are the most at risk of being excluded from the future of work and we need practical programmes that provide work experience to get them back into a training journey In the long term I believe we will need to radically alter the way we think about training and learning and work if we are to continue to lift productivity As the pace of technological change picks up we need to see ourselves as genuinely learning for life In many ways jobs will be events on that learning and training journey rather than the other way around This presents a series of challenges and opportunities for our education and training system that we will look at over the coming years There are of course many other areas of policy response that will contribute to our response to the Future of Work but I wanted to finish today on what systemic changes we will need to ensure we are leading the change rather than being passive recipients of it Active and Capable StateA critical element identified in our Future of Work report is that the state needs to be an active participant in how we shape the future of work It is important to note that by active I do not mean that it controls or dictates what happens but rather that we move beyond the tired and dangerous idea that we can simply leave the response to market forces to decide how New Zealand fares in the future world of work This means working alongside businesses to identify opportunities as noted above in the R and D and Tech sectors for example It means developing a new partnership between the Crown and Maori as the settlement of historic Treaty breaches comes to an end and opportunities for economic development emerge It also means being innovative and entrepreneurial when that is appropriate We are wanting public servants to co design with both politicians and the wider community what we can do to stay ahead of the curve A major example of this is the Provincial Growth Fund developed as part of our coalition agreement with New Zealand First This will see significant investments in the regions of New Zealand to grow sustainable and productive job opportunities The details of the Fund are to be released shortly and will provide some of the most significant development of our regions in decades These will be driven from the ground up with the Government as an active partner A New Social PartnershipIt is my strong belief that the most critical element to New Zealand succeeding in the Future of Work is a renewed social partnership between businesses workers and the government In the course of our Commission we saw examples in both large and small businesses of innovative approaches to this idea Air New Zealand s High Performance Engagement model is one useful example By involving workers in the full range of strategic decisions and change processes Air New Zealand has not only seen significant productivity benefits they have created far more harmonious workplace relations In a number of the new smaller technology businesses we have seen flat management structures and workplace democracy in action that is core to the way they run their businesses These companies give a significant voice to their employees and have seen productivity growth and improved workplace relations as a result We are working with MBIE and others to facilitate these approaches across a range of industries We can also see innovations happening in the way we work An example which has grabbed attention recently is Perpetual Guardian s decision to switch to trial a four day working week for five days pay The move was designed to improve workers wellbeing by giving them more time to spend with family and on other aspects of life with the expectation that this will enhance their productivity during the days they do work the same levels of output for fewer hours worked These are the kinds of practices that we need to see more of If we look at Germany as an example union members often sit on company boards as part of the decision making process ensuring that employee wellbeing is considered alongside high level corporate profit and financial targets It is unsurprising then that German workers on average worked the fewest hours annually in 2016 of all OECD countries with New Zealand workers on average doing 400 more hours every year This is possible because Germany s workers are also some of the most productive in the world I want to see New Zealand reach a point where we are able to work 400 fewer hours a year while producing more than we do today For us to get there we need to make the advances in productivity we have been discussing today Technological improvements will play a huge role in this One of my goals as Minister of Finance is to develop this new partnership at a system wide level to promote a combined work stream on how we can apply these lessons to other industries and sectors My parting challenge to the many public servants here today is to think about how we can do this across Government and break down some of the silos we have created to enable businesses and workers and their representatives to easily engage in such a partnership ConclusionI am most certainly not the first New Zealand politician to both highlight the challenge of low productivity nor to say that we will address it So the proof will be in what we actually do But we are in an environment that has change occurring at a pace and scale we have never seen before We have to take the opportunity now to capitalise on that to finally make the leaps that have so far eluded our country We have already made a start with the initiatives I have mentioned today I want us to re write our productivity story so that New Zealand becomes a leading example of a sustainable and productive economy in which everyone gets a share of economic success We have a long way to go but this Government is committed to tackling the long term challenges that this country has faced for many years I look forward to working with you on this journey Thank you CommentFor many people artificial intelligence conjures up images of sci fi movies and the future They see it as a threat to their jobs and sometimes even their safety but AI represents the biggest leap forward in terms of work productivity since the personal computer and few other industries can benefit from AI as much as government With AI we can change the way government works and help employees do their job better AI is already integrated into numerous cloud platforms and can be used to discover new information and deliver outcomes instantly I like to refer to this as practical AI AI has the potential to improve employee experiences by speeding up decision making and automating mundane and repetitive tasks Bringing machine learning to everyday work enables government agencies and departments to make better decisions faster because they do not have to hunt for data and aggregate it into a spreadsheet By building intelligence into platforms AI helps manage complex workflows and allows organizations to One way that AI will be applied in the workplace is automating service requests Most companies have an IT service desk as well as a customer support center These functions ensure that customers and employees receive help in a timely manner whether it is a request for a new computer a password reset or the status of a repair Manually triaging thousands of incidents or cases categorizing tasks and routing work can consume resources introduce human error and slow resolution In fact a new report from Accenture found that customer support functions spend up to 12 percent of their time categorizing prioritizing and assigning tickets Meanwhile AI accurately categorizes requests nearly instantly It eliminates the bottleneck created by agents having to manually assign categorize and route requests A full two days a week is wasted on manual administrative work according to the recent State of Work survey conducted by ServiceNow If an agency with 5 000 people automated those processes they could get 4 million work hours back a year Adding AI frees up employees to do the work they want to do spurring creativity Nearly half of respondents 48 percent said work levels increased by 20 percent or more after they adopted AI solutions Additionally 91 percent of executives say their skilled employees spend too much time on admin tasks and 93 percent believe that reducing mundane tasks unleashes employee creativity To properly implement AI solutions across government agencies we need to define which tasks are best suited for humans and which ones should be performed by AI The government has a term inherently governmental to describe work processes or decisions that must be done by government employees Contractors do much of the work in our government agencies but certain work is inherently governmental in nature As we move into an age defined by AI we need to identify and define the work processes and decisions that are inherently human We are going to increasingly work in a blended workplace with AI systems and humans working together to achieve a mission There are certain activities within any work environment that can only be performed or should only be performed by humans While there may be many more human activities designated as inherently human in the beginning I believe that as humans become more comfortable with the role of AI in the blended workforce less and less work will be designated as inherently human There will always be a need for humans to remain in charge from factual responsibility and liability aspects as well as from emotional and psychological ones We spend a third of our lives at work It shapes who we are how we feel and how we interact with the world so we must create great work experiences and this is what AI does AI creates work experiences that unleash productivity bringing out the best in us Rather than fearing machines stealing jobs we need to understand how AI will change the way government works though small but practical ways and prepare the

for fear of lost jobs Finding or inventing a new job however is harder than it once was At the pinnacle of technological progress man becomes a god New machines and software are continually forged in man s image and taught to do things that once only people could do A day will come when man s machines surpass their creators in their capacity to do and to think and it will be at that technological singularity that the economy will double on a weekly basis and mankind will become peripheral to a new reality and consciousness beyond human comprehension Conservative estimates place that date at about 100 years from now but in the meantime there are smaller fish to fry The American middle class is shrinking and it s technology that s causing it It s not all bad The gains in efficiency begotten by automation have been great for productivity And productivity means progress It always has Since the Industrial Revolution began around 1760 new technologies have been stealing jobs and since 1760 people have responded by finding or inventing new jobs that contemporary technologies couldn t do It s a good system in the long term everyone benefits from technological progress and while the workers losing their jobs in the interim might feel a bit miffed people have always found a way to bounce back into an ever adapting economy Besides if machines can do something better than people can it would be senseless to ignore such utility and hold back progress for fear of a few temporarily lost jobs Unfortunately for today s average worker finding or inventing a new job is harder than it once was When economists look back they see that it was around 1999 when something changed Productivity kept going up but where in the past median household income and employment per capita would have also hitched along they instead diverged Median household income is on a steep decline employment isn t bouncing back strongly after the Great Recession and a greater percentage of Americans now identify themselves as lower class than at any point in history Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson director and professor respectively at the MIT Sloan School of Management named this divergence of productivity and employment the great decoupling Technology is a broad term It can be equally applied to a stick being used by a chimpanzee to extract insects from the Earth and to a rocket launching a chimpanzee into suborbital flight above the Earth Today s technologies are more scalable and complex than the machines people needed to outsmart in the past which is a big reason for the decoupling Surveying a county road in 1998 meant that a team of workers needed to get into a pickup truck with a government seal on the side of it drive take photos and measurements of the area return to the office and assess the information that was gathered Researchers at the Michigan Tech Research Institute found in 2013 that it s much easier to just send a drone They also developed software that takes the sensory data gathered by the drone and generates a fully characterized 3 D model People are still needed in the process to make high level decisions and babysit the technology when things go wrong but not as many people are needed And even fewer will be necessary if the researchers concept is honed and commercialized The trouble is that the guy who once rode along in the pickup truck is now unemployed and he doesn t know how to design drones or code 3 D modeling software The average American is looking more and more like that guy A study by two researchers at the Oxford Martin School concludes that within the next 20 years or so approximately 47 percent of all jobs could be replaced by automation Technology is racing ahead but our skills our organizations our institutions aren t keeping up Brynjolfsson said As they adjust we will see more of the benefit show up in the economics but right now there are a lot of technologies with more potential than has been fully realized This trend is just getting started A lot of economists technologists and policymakers agree with McAfee and Brynjolfsson but some say today s technologies aren t special people will find new jobs just as they always have and no intervention is needed It s just the recession they say To understand why that s not the case people need to look closely at today s technology Brynjolfsson said For example there are prototypes of autonomous vehicles on the roads Legislators in Nevada California Florida and Michigan have penned laws allowing the vehicles limited public use and some estimate that almost all vehicular traffic will be autonomous by 2050 In a recent span of two months Google purchased eight robotics and machine learning companies not just because the technology will make cars drive themselves but because smart robots can improve productivity across almost all of the company s businesses The problem with this extremely fast progress is that people are relatively slow Although it won t happen overnight today s 233 000 taxi drivers and 1 7 million truck drivers aren t ready to become an anachronism In addition decoupling means the upper 1 percent gets a bigger piece of a growing pie Brynjolfsson said which also accounts for the shrinking middle class A lot of these digital technologies have winner take all or winner take most economics where you can get a small group of people producing a better piece of software or insight and once they ve digitized that they can replicate it 10 times or a hundred million times and dominate the market for that he said You can see it in checkout counter software you can see it in tax preparation software there are 17 percent fewer tax preparers than there were a few years ago you can see it in airline reservations In more and more categories software is eating the world Software can give legal advice analyze data and automate data entry and robots like IBM s Watson can even diagnose and recommend accurate cancer treatments much better than humans can One study showed that Watson can diagnose lung cancer accurately 90 percent of the time compared to a measly 50 percent rate for human doctors There s no economic law that says everyone is going to benefit from technological progress even if it does make the pie a lot bigger Brynjolfsson said So both in terms of theory and evidence I think there s a potential to be concerned and I am concerned Amazon spent 775 million buying out Kiva Systems in 2012 the maker of a disc shaped robot used in warehousing Today Amazon uses the robots to fetch pallets of goods saving workers the time and energy of running around to find products themselves The purchase came soon after a report showing that some Amazon warehouse workers were walking 10 to 15 miles per shift Most workers are probably grateful that their job is now to pack goods and do various administrative tasks rather than play fetch all day but on the other hand Amazon doesn t need as many human employees now If technology gets automatic and simple enough it will eventually just be one guy in the Bahamas running the company from his smartphone That might seem far fetched but it was in living memory that the idea of autonomous vehicles and talking robots were science fiction Now those technologies border on pass Researchers from MIT s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory are developing a theoretical model and algorithms that would let robots like the ones used by Amazon communicate more intelligently with one another so they can solve logistical problems on the fly and also communicate with other sensory agents in the environment human and otherwise Once robots can talk to each other and solve problems on their own even fewer people will be needed in those warehouses When robots like Baxter a 25 000 production line worker with a calm demeanor get cheap enough even sweatshop workers will be out of a job What the Industrial Revolution did for muscle power Brynjolfsson said the second machine age is doing for brain power and especially so in government As you automate and augment a lot of mental tasks it s a little less clear whether those technologies will be complements or maybe substitutes for human labor and that s one of the things we re working through now as a society Brynjolfsson said Government jobs on average tend to include more information processing and on average the workers in that sector are more educated and doing more knowledge work than in a lot of other parts of the economy So they in some ways are likely to be more affected Today s robots are very poor at doing some things such as folding laundry as one YouTube video confirms and even worse at others like offering compassion to a young student or making a sound moral decision as a police officer Those traditionally human skills are expected to gradually improve in robots but in the meantime data analytics and the Internet of Things provide a waypoint for progress Facilities like the Domain Awareness Center now being constructed in Oakland Calif will make monitoring cities for crime and dispatching help a more efficient process Likewise predictive crime software is a rising trend in law enforcement in many cities Making better use of data and distributed sensor networks means that fewer officers will be needed to cover a given geographic area because officers are better informed and more efficient Even if it s not the extreme scenario of Robocop taking over for human police officers technology finds gains in efficiency everywhere and the cost is usually displacing human jobs Some are optimistic about what all this means for the world and others less so but to take either position is to accept that technological progress has a foregone conclusion Brynjolfsson said and it doesn t It s been said that the best idea America ever had was mass public education he said That helped us make the transition from an agricultural economy to one based on industry and services It didn t happen by accident it happened through public policy We re going to have to reinvent what education is and focus more on creativity and interpersonal skills things that machines are not very good at and less on having people sit quietly in rows listen to instructions and carry out those instructions Nicco Mele agreed that education and government policy need to be revolutionized and that s why he teaches future policymakers at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government Mele is a consultant to the Fortune 1000 and was named by Esquire as one of America s best and brightest Modern technology Mele said compels us to rethink the assumptions of every discipline Look at our health care policy look at our retirement policy he said Those policies are built on this assumption that people have 9 to 5 jobs and stay with one employer their whole lives That s profoundly not true for the American workforce and hasn t been true for well over a decade A third of American workers are self employed and another third are contingently employed which means only about a third of the workforce has a traditional 9 to 5 job Yet our policymakers and our politicians are building all the policy on the assumption that this is a good way to do it American policymakers are on average older and richer but they also tend to know less about technology care less about technology and delegate technological responsibilities to others Mele said and this is unacceptable in a world where tech influences everything Imagine a state legislator saying I don t think about money I don t worry about money I don t worry about the tax rate I don t worry about the budget I just let accountants deal with it We d kick them out of office right That s not an acceptable answer and we need that same kind of expectation technologically he said The idea that tech is separate from the rest of the world is rooted in a past era where digital technology was less prevalent Today there are remnants everywhere of that old way of thinking that reinforce technological illiteracy in some of government s most critical positions Mele said One of the things I hate most in the world is the Genius Bar at Apple because it sets up this dichotomy he said It sets up this world where they re geniuses and we have to just do what they tell us People must demand that their leaders be technologically literate Mele said because it s profoundly dangerous to have elected officials or policymakers who don t have any technical literacy to evaluate what s going on A recent Gartner report identified that 60 percent of CEOs dismiss the idea that automated and smart technologies could displace a huge percentage of jobs in the next 15 years Michael Armstrong CIO of Corpus Christi Texas is not a denier of the second machine age s power and influence As a CIO Armstrong said the best one can hope for is to influence policymakers The coming years will bring incredible new changes he said Advances in 3 D printing have applications in medicine and other fields that haven t even been realized yet Advances in prosthesis are allowing people to live longer and there are even philosophical questions being opened up about what it means to be human The Shadow Robot Co based in London spent 1 million building the Bionic Man a robot composed entirely of artificial body parts and internal organs Life is changing fast for everyone I think we re hitting the knee of the curve and things are getting exponential Armstrong said Make sure that you understand and your leadership understands what is happening in these areas and what the implications are because that s going to drive social policy and government policy to a huge degree A lot of this stuff is happening very quietly Government has been shrinking for so long that s been an accepted way of doing business I think this is not going to leave anyone alone One way or another it s going to affect us all he said In any

invitation only events Commission has been asked to consider the potential impacts of rapid technological changeMinister of finance Grant Robertson has asked the Productivity Commission to examine and report on technological change disruption and the future of work in a project to be undertaken jointly with the Australian Productivity Commission The move follows the launch last August of a joint Australia NZ project focused on growing the digital economy and maximising opportunities for small and medium sized enterprises The minister said the commission had been asked to consider the potential impacts of rapid technological change and its impact on the future of work and the workforce in New Zealand to help inform future government policy so the opportunities presented by disruptive technologies for economic productivity and social prosperity could be realised and the risks managed The commission said its earlier joint project had been designed to explore how institutional and regulatory settings in the two countries could support the use of digital technology and in particular how small and medium enterprises could maximise the opportunities from digital transformation NZ Productivity Commission director Judy Kavanagh said the joint report had highlighted the challenges and opportunities presented by the digital economy In this new mandate the commission will provide recommendations that will help manage the likely impacts of wider technological disruption and change on the future of work the workforce labour markets productivity and wellbeing She said the commission s work would be informed by the knowledge and insights of all sectors of the economy and society The Commission will be speaking with public bodies unions businesses academics and other interested parties to better understand the impacts of technological change on the future of work In his instructions to the commission Robertson said well designed and coordinated government responses could allow New Zealand to fully realise the potential of disruptive technologies for economic productivity and social prosperity improve the services provided by government and increase the efficiency and effectiveness with which government functions He said it would also enable the Government to provide an enabling environment without unnecessary barriers to desirable change while effectively managing risks and help to prepare New Zealand for any rapid labour displacement and distributional impacts Given the uncertainty around future technology and its impact the inquiry is not expected to make detailed quantified predictions of impacts Robertson said Rather it should give a sense of the nature and relative scale of impacts in different scenarios The inquiry should have a long term focus with recommendations that can be implemented in the short to medium term It should provide a resource for government to develop policies and programmes that make the most of the technological opportunities on offer and allow New Zealanders to face an uncertain future with confidence The Commission s final report to the Government is due on 31 March 2020 Sign up to gain

EngineeringInstitute of MedicineNational Research CouncilSince Abraham Lincoln approved the Congressional charter of the National Academy of Sciences in 1863 the Academy complex now made up of the National Academy of Sciences the National Academy of Engineering the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council has been advising government about the impact of science and technology on society The Academy complex provides independent advice to government by appointing committees of experts who serve without compensation asking these committees to prepare draft reports by consensus and subjecting these drafts to rigorous independent scientific review before release to ensure their quality and integrity To avoid potential conflict of interest and bias careful attention is given to the composition and balance of study committees As the 21st century approaches with science and technology assuming increasing importance in society the Governing Board of the National Research Council has synthesized summarized and highlighted principal conclusions and recommendations from recent reports to inform decisions in a number of key policy matters The resulting series of papers do not address all the intersections of science and technology with public policy but they do address some of the most important They are directed to federal administrators members of Congress university administrators leaders of nongovernmental organizations and all others involved in the development and implementation of public policies involving science and technology This paper focuses on government policies regarding technology development and proposes measures to facilitate the translation of new knowledge to new capabilities Another paper in this series Science and Engineering Research in a Changing World describes policies that can strengthen linkages between science and engineering research and national objectives Previous reports from the Academy complex have had a major effect on the technology activities and policies of the federal government For example two 19th century reports provided advice on restoring the Declaration of Independence and controlling landslides during the construction of the Panama Canal The issues summarized in this paper from past reports continue to be relevant to the work of the Academy complex and to the nation This document with direct links to the text of all reports cited herein is available on the Internet at http www2 nas edu 21st A box at the end describes other ways to obtain information on the Academy complex and the topics discussed in this paper PREPARING FOR THE 21st CENTURYTECHNOLOGY AND THE NATION S FUTUREPrivate firms have the primary responsibility for the development and adoption of technology in this country but federal and state governments play an important role in enhancing civilian technology development and adoption through their economic regulatory and trade policies their support for research and development and their own procurement of technology As the 20th century draws to a close the technological landscape is changing The United States is now only one of several technologically powerful nations The end of the Cold War has heightened the importance of commercial technologies in maintaining both economic and military security New technologies depend increasingly on scientific and engineering knowledge this interdependence strengthens the reciprocal links between understanding and capability In the United States technology development and adoption occur through a complex system that encompasses many individuals and organizations Researchers in academic government and industrial laboratories create new knowledge on which many advanced technologies are based Colleges and universities educate new generations of scientists and engineers who will put that knowledge to work Private companies invest financial and human resources in developing new technologies and adapting existing technologies to meet perceived needs Several key objectives set forth in Academy complex reports can help guide the development and implementation of public policies related to technology Among these objectives are the following When Captain Scott O Grady parachuted into Bosnia Herzegovina after his F 16 fighter was shot down in 1995 he carried in his vest a portable radio receiver tuned to a network of 24 satellites known as the Global Positioning System GPS While hiding in the woods O Grady used the receiver to determine his position behind enemy lines longitude latitude and altitude to within a few tens of meters and he was able to signal that information to the Marines who successfully rescued him GPS technology originated in the creation of atomic clocks for studying relativity and Einsteinian physics It first found use in military applications including the Gulf War GPS technology became commercially available a few years ago and since then the range of its applications has been exploding Delivery and emergency vehicles now use GPS to pinpoint destinations and map their routes Shipping companies and private boaters use GPS for navigation Commercial airlines have saved billions of dollars by honing their flight plans with GPS The current worldwide market for GPS receivers and technology is already estimated at over 2 billion and is expected to grow to over 30 billion in the next 10 years For more information The Global Positioning System National Academy of Sciences 1996The most important role of government in technology development and adoption is maintaining an environment conducive to private sector innovation and investment Many policies affect that environment including policies on taxes trade investment patents product liability environmental and consumer protection international arms control and human resources Those policies have multiple and sometimes competing aims By explicitly recognizing the effects of public policies on technology development and adoption government could better integrate its pursuit of technological economic and social objectives A 1 The government s economic and regulatory policies have an especially broad influence on technology development and adoption For example government policies help to determine levels of investment in the economy which in turn drives productivity economic growth and job creation Public and private investment in research and development leads to new products and processes that can spur productivity and investment in new facilities and equipment gives companies an opportunity to incorporate more productive technologies into their operations Private investment is closely related to the level of public and private saving in the economy and today the levels of both saving and investment are severely inadequate As a percentage of gross domestic product GDP public and private saving has been below 3 since 1990 compared with norms of 8 10 among other industrial countries 20 in Japan Half the saving shortfall in this country is a result of the need to fund the federal budget deficit The other half results from a low and declining rate of private saving by households and companies The resulting low level of investment will not sustain a growth in productivity sufficient to meet Americans legitimate expectations for an improving standard of living As an example of how government policies can have both beneficial and harmful effects on technology development and adoption consider today s policies governing standards and conformity assessment the testing and certifying of products and processes for their conformity to standards A wide range of federal state and local government agencies are involved in developing standards for products processes services interfaces and materials and in assessing conformity to standards Unnecessary duplication and complexity among government policies especially in conformity assessment have led to increasing costs and burdens for manufacturers procurement agencies testing laboratories product certifiers and consumers Government agencies should increase their use of private sector consensus standards for both regulatory and procurement purposes and cooperate more effectively with private sector standards developers For example the Department of Defense s experience in procurement reform indicates that relying on commercial standards instead of government unique standards can substantially reduce acquisition costs Recent legislation P L 104 113 implemented National Research Council recommendations to extend and strengthen this policy throughout the federal government In addition conformity assessment is performed most efficiently and effectively by the private sector To simplify the system and lower costs the federal government should immediately begin to phase out its conformity assessment activities and to rely instead on private testing certification and accreditation services that are recognized as competent by the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST NIST also should work with state and local governments to eliminate duplication at those levels For more information To address the saving shortfall the administration and Congress should set benchmarks for private investment net saving and productivity growth A 2 Moving toward saving and investment rates of 8 10 of GDP over a 3 10 year period would contribute measurably to enhancing productivity and economic growth in the United States These benchmarks do not need to be achieved immediately but public officials need to set goals and develop a public consensus behind them so that the actions needed to move toward the goals are not crowded out by short term pressures Structural changes in US tax policy would be the most direct and effective way to increase investment and saving While retaining the progressivity of the tax structure the United States should move toward a system in which saving and investment are taxed less and consumption is taxed more A 2 Efforts to reduce the cost of capital in the United States and to emphasize long term investments also could boost saving and investment rates For more information on government s climate setting role In some cases government has a compelling rationale for directly enhancing the development and adoption of technologies For example federal and state agencies pursue a number of public missions that depend heavily on technological advances such as safeguarding public health ensuring national security and protecting the environment In the past technologies developed with public funds to meet those government missions often have had important commercial applications For example federal R D funding and procurement contributed substantially to the development of such high technology products as airframes and aircraft engines a wide range of pharmaceuticals and biomedical devices satellites semiconductors computers biotechnology and nuclear power In select cases the government also has a rationale for supporting the development of commercial technologies beyond those explicitly linked to federal agency missions For example there is a role for government in facilitation of the development of path breaking technologies those with the potential to create major new industries or transform existing industries and thereby yield high returns to society as a whole but whose development poses risks too high to attract sufficient private sector investment Examples of past and present path breaking technologies are nuclear medicine biotechnology semiconductors aircraft engines and communication satellites Similarly government has a role in facilitating the development of infrastructural technologies those that enhance the performance of a broad spectrum of firms in the near to intermediate term but do not offer sufficient private returns Examples of these technologies are the development of engineering methods compilation and validation of technical data measurement tools and the refinement of manufacturing processes Identifying technologies that meet those criteria is difficult and requires a combined public private effort The federal government should work with the private sector to ensure that the United States has world class capabilities in technologies that promise to have a major and continuing impact on broad areas of industrial and economic performance B 1 But the government need not invest in fields in which the private sector already has programs of development in place B 2 The concept of a government role in subsidizing the development of commercial technologies is controversial Firms motivated by market forces and judged by their performance in satisfying demand have a better record than governments of investing in new technologies with large commercial payoffs Insulated from market forces and critical evaluation government support for commercial technologies risks being influenced more by political than by economic considerations B 3 To sustain public support for technology development government needs to develop criteria and mechanisms for evaluation feedback and institutional learning so that successes and failures can be identified and better understood Government must be prepared to discard programs that do not work and reallocate resources to programs that do Government R D efforts also should avoid competition with commercial firms government can then work more effectively with market forces and the private sector to leverage national strengths in science and technology to the enhancement of US productivity and economic growth B 2 For more information on government support of commercial technologies The Academy complex has not conducted a comparative analysis of public and private sector responsibilities in civilian technology But it has analyzed the roles of private and public organizations in several technological fields These analyses point toward a number of ways in which government can play a constructive role in technology development and dissemination A notable example involves information technologies Over the last 5 decades information technologies have grown to a 500 billion industry and the personal computer has become a defining symbol of our age In 1945 it was not known that computers would become a revolutionary device that would profoundly affect industry commerce the financial world government science education communications entertainment and society as a whole Today information technology and its applications continue to advance steadily Computers and communication technology will become even more valuable to society as they are increasingly able to recognize and simulate speech build huge automated libraries control robots and even create virtual worlds where people can learn work shop and be entertained The federal government has supported the development of information technologies in a number of ways In the early days of the industry government procurement especially for defense and space applications was a powerful influence on technological advances Government also has funded a broad spectrum of research and development from basic computer science to the development of prototype technologies including the advanced networks that evolved into the Internet Today it is continuing to invest in a variety of new ideas and approaches For example the federal government supported the development of the Mosaic browser for the World Wide Web which has led to the development of several commercial products that have greatly increased access to resources on the Internet The private sector will remain the principal source of research and development in information technology But to ensure continued US leadership in information technology the federal government needs to maintain strong support for a broadly based program of research C 1 Although sometimes the benefits from publicly supported research programs in information technology have been of unexpected types the record of accomplishments suggests that government investment in computing and communications research has been very productive and has yielded high social returns despite the high risk involved It is important to maintain the information infrastructure The competitive drive of private industry will dominate the process by which the National Information Infrastructure NII evolves Private firms will build it their business plans must justify the investments and competition and the desire for new markets not a pursuit of abstract visions or societal goals will define and shape it That reality provides the impetus that will make the NII happen at the same time it triggers many fears and concerns In this context opinions differ considerably on whether there is an appropriate government role in advancing the NII and if so what it is Most people can agree that an ideal information infrastructure would have such qualities as extended interoperability broad accessibility and support for broad participation It would also allow multiple channels for many to many communications and information sharing as well as one to one communications familiar today through telephony and one to many communications familiar through broadcast and cable television Progress toward that ideal is more likely if the government can set an example with its own services and help to promote a consensus on a vision of the future by removing barriers to its realization C 2 Government also has a major influence on information technologies in its roles as customer publisher regulator arbiter conveyer of public interests and leader in the interest of equity and a productive society For example although most communications standards are developed in the private sector government is an essential partner New forms of communication such as teleconferencing and electronic mail publications and bulletin boards raise tough questions For example who is liable when someone posts a defamatory message pornography or copyrighted material on a publicly accessible electronic bulletin board What is the role of regulation and law versus that of ethics informal norms of community behavior and the marketplace Government will be a key player in building on existing traditions and rules to accommodate new media and new forms of human expression Cryptography is one important tool for protecting information that is very difficult for governments to control Cryptography supports the confidentiality and integrity of digitally represented information such as computer data software and video and the authentication of individuals and computer systems communicating with other computer systems these capabilities are important in varied degrees for protecting the information security interests of many different private and public stakeholders including law enforcement and national security Furthermore cryptography can help to support law enforcement objectives in preventing information crimes such as economic espionage Current national cryptography policy is not adequate to support the information security requirements of an information society US national policy should be changed to support the broad use of cryptography in ways that take into account competing US needs and desires for individual privacy international economic competitiveness law enforcement national security and world leadership The framework for national cryptography policy should provide coherent structure and reduce uncertainty for potential vendors and nongovernment and government users of cryptography in ways that it does not today For example no law should bar the manufacture sale or use of any form of encryption within the United States Furthermore national cryptography policy affecting the development and use of commercial cryptography should be more closely aligned with market forces And export controls on cryptography should be progressively relaxed but not eliminated For more information Rapid progress toward a harmonious national environment of interrelated information services and capabilities would be valuable to the nation A rational set of public and private services is unlikely to emerge from the action of market forces alone However the proper role for the government is to be a partner and participant with the private sector and to exercise its regulatory authority with restraint Another industrial enterprise in which government support for basic research and technology development has contributed substantially to US industrial leadership is aeronautics In recent years foreign aircraft manufacturers have made inroads into the global aircraft market to the detriment of US interests Foreign governments in close relationships with their aircraft industries have invested heavily in the basic aeronautics research and technology that is necessary for developing and maintaining a competitive posture meeting future constraints on air traffic management and reducing the environmental impact of aircraft Technology alone does not ensure economic success in the aircraft industry but without competitive technology US manufacturers will fail economically The federal government needs to work with commercial interests and universities to define the aeronautics technologies with the greatest potential payoff and work in a concerted fashion toward their development C 3 Government cannot adequately address the needs of industry unless industry is involved from the beginning By the same token cooperative programs can be structured so as not to jeopardize the autonomy of basic research or the constraints of fair trade New biomedical technologies often derive from the combined efforts of the public and private sectors Academic government and industrial laboratories are all involved in the development of many new technologies and ideas and people flow quickly among all three types of institutions Efforts to control cost and regulate health care should be designed to encourage continued technological discovery and experimentation How services are provided and goods are produced delivered used and disposed of affect the environment An ecology of industry that is characterized by entire systems of production and consumption is a concept that can be used to enhance environmental quality Advances in technology applied usually by private firms present the primary opportunities for improvement within these integrated systems There are also opportunities for societies to become less resource dependent and to develop and deploy environmentally safer materials processes and systems using technologies that are more environmentally sensitive Corporate decisions and the personal choices of consumers are important determinants of environmental quality Policymakers need to formulate effective economic incentives to foster a systems approach to improving environmental quality C 5 In particular they need to reduce liability barriers and regulatory barriers and develop ways of providing consumers with credible information about environmental impacts via such actions as marketing and labeling C 6 C 7 The Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles PNGV a cooperative R D program between the federal government and the US Council for Automotive Research has the goal of developing technologies for a new generation of vehicles that could achieve fuel mileage up to three times that of comparable 1994 family sedans At the same time the new vehicles should maintain performance size utility and ownership and operating costs and should meet and exceed federal safety and emissions requirements The intent of the program is to develop production prototype vehicles by 2004 The PNGV program also aims to improve national competitiveness in manufacturing substantially and to implement commercially sustainable innovation of conventional vehicles The United States enjoys the world s most effective and most extensive road transportation system Over 175 million passenger cars and light trucks travel more than 2 billion miles a year on 3 9 million miles of public roads Some extremely attractive technologies under consideration for the PNGV have the potential to introduce large changes in the demands on the infrastructure which will result in requirements for new capital labor and natural resources The extent of these changes will vary widely depending on body and structural materials power plants and energy storage systems The PNGV must continue to address infrastructure issues as an integral part of its program A careful assessment of infrastructure issues associated with alternative technologies should be an essential part of the technology selection process C 8 As a final example of the government s varied roles in technology development consider the collection and use of the geographic information that describes the arrangement and attributes of features and phenomena on the earth known as spatial data Many federal state and local agencies and private organizations generate and use such data for many purposes including agriculture land use planning and environmental management An entity called the National Spatial Data Infrastructure acquires processes stores and distributes the information Data sharing can minimize duplication reduce long term costs and streamline analysis and decision making The public and private sectors should work together to integrate the collection use and distribution of spatial data into the National Spatial Data Infrastructure C 9 An integrated system would eliminate much of the overlap and duplication that occur today while creating many new opportunities for the use of spatial information For more information on the role of government in the development of the above technologies The skills capacity for continuous learning and effective management of a nation s workforce largely determine the nation s ability to attract and retain high value added high skill industries and its ability to absorb and exploit new technology for economic benefit US producers of goods and services must adopt more productive approaches to the organization of work and the management and motivation of their workforce if they expect to cultivate and take advantage of their employees skills ingenuity and creativity The United States has one of the largest most diversified but poorly coordinated training enterprises in the world In the United States work related training and continuing education are provided by a broad spectrum of private and public institutions including 2 year colleges and technical institutions noncollegiate postsecondary vocational schools 4 year colleges and universities apprenticeship programs professional associations unions vendors and employers Across this vast and diverse training enterprise there are few common standards the quality of training is uneven and important subsets of the nation s current and potential workforce are poorly served particularly with regard to job related training and continuing education within industry The United States should foster the timely adoption and effective use of commercially valuable technology throughout the economy by supporting experimentation at the federal state and local levels with a wide range of public and private initiatives for increasing the quantity and quality of school to work transition programs and of job related training and continuing education for the nation s workforce D 1 For more information on gaps in workforce training and continuing education Policies that influence the development and adoption of technologies must reflect two mutually reinforcing trends that build global networks of R D production and marketing 1 expanding international trade foreign direct investment and corporate alliances and 2 converging technological capabilities of the industrialized nations Economic and technical interdependence among nations is growing and this increasing interdependence is creating both opportunities and challenges for the private and public sectors It opens doors to new markets new technologies and new sources of competition which spur the creativity and productivity of US companies and workers Many of the fastest growing markets are now in other countries and increasing openness in trade gives companies opportunities to compete in those markets International interdependence also helps to disseminate new technologies and management practices All those factors can contribute to productivity increases wealth generation employment growth and higher standards of living in the United States At the same time deepening interdependence has accelerated the pace of structural and organizational change within the US economy and has increased demands on individuals organizations and communities to adapt to changing circumstances Those able to respond to demands can reap significant benefits but those unable to adapt quickly and effectively can suffer severe economic hardships The loss of control over national markets that is associated with international interdependence also can greatly complicate the task of advancing national interests economic political and military In addition shifts in the balance of economic and technological strength among nations can raise concerns about access to markets and technological assets High technology products and their development require particular attention in light of their importance to the national economy and because these industries are the target of industrial policies of many participants in the multilateral trading system A particular challenge that has been intensified by international interdependence involves the protection of intellectual property Today the competitiveness of many firms is determined by their ability to develop commercialize and most important capture the economic benefits of innovations Intellectual property rights such as patent rights and copyrights allow firms to protect their investments in innovation and R D But with innovations traveling so quickly around the globe protection of intellectual property rights needs to extend internationally to maintain current incentives for companies to innovate and invest in R D E 1 E 2 Growing international interdependence is not without its costs but on balance this trend is a positive force both for the United States and for the rest of the world Furthermore it cannot be reversed or slowed substantially without unacceptable cost to the American people and the rest of the world The critical question is how to respond to the trend more effectively so that we can maximize the associated benefits reduce the associated costs and find ways to distribute both the benefits and costs of globalization more equitably at home A case in point is the growing involvement of foreign companies researchers and students in US R D Through transnational alliances and direct investment in US companies foreign firms are increasingly engaged in the US industrial R D base Similarly foreign students researchers and firms are becoming more and more involved in publicly funded R D performed in US research universities and federal laboratories Some policymakers and business leaders noting the extent to which foreign researchers and companies draw upon the US R D enterprise have expressed concern about the transfer of technologies developed in the United States to other countries and about a corresponding loss of opportunities to US citizens The concern is intensified when the technologies have potential national security implications or when the foreign entities involved originate in countries that deny US citizens reciprocal access to domestic markets and R D assets At the same time it is clear that the United States derives substantial benefits from the involvement of foreign nationals in the country s research enterprise as do foreign countries from the R D activities of US firms Each needs to work in the other s markets to be successful in their home markets For example foreign science and engineering talent in the nation s research universities federal laboratories and industrial R D enterprise contributes substantially to our nation s technological and economic strength The US affiliates of foreign owned firms bring large amounts of technology and know how into our country and employ over 100 000 Americans in US based R D Given the magnitude of those benefits and the rapid growth of foreign technological capabilities in recent decades US policymakers in their attempts to address specific concerns related to foreign competition should avoid actions that would deny the United States the benefits of foreign participation in US R D E 3 E 4 Public policymakers should avoid restricting whenever possible transnational cooperative efforts among firms provided that sufficient competition is preserved The commercial aircraft industry demonstrates both the risks and the rewards of the globalization of R D production investment markets and technology For more than 50 years US leadership in aircraft manufacturing and aviation has been a major component of our economic strength and national security But today as markets capital and technologies are increasingly global international alliances and other cross border linkages are increasingly common In particular the importance of companies based outside the United States including those in Europe and Japan is already substantial and growing rapidly For example the growing strength of Japanese companies particularly in the supply of aircraft components and equipment constitutes one long term challenge to US preeminence in transport aircraft Yet US companies and the federal government have more to gain from promoting a balanced flow of technology between the two countries than they do from retreating into a defensive stance A private sector effort the National Aviation Advisory Committee NAAC composed of knowledgeable leaders from industry academe and elsewhere should be established to develop a shared vision for maintaining US leadership The NAAC would provide input to government in identifying critical aerospace technologies assessing international technology transfers and improving civil military integration in aircraft technology development and manufacturing For more information There is a productive tension between the ideal of growing international interdependence and openness and the current unresolved issues in high technology competition The preferred approach is to arrive at mutually beneficial rules of the game for transnational corporations and their home and host countries The rules cover a wide variety of policies including antitrust restrictions government procurement intellectual property rights industrial targeting and subsidy practices foreign direct investment local content and international standard setting While continuing to address unresolved issues the federal government should further efforts to open foreign markets to US trade and investment through negotiation in bilateral and multilateral forums E 2 E 4 The ability of the United States to capture the benefits of the global technical enterprise will depend primarily on the success with which private corporations operating within US borders seize the opportunities presented by the emerging global technology base Policymakers can influence this success by recognizing the interdependence of domestic and international policies that affect technology development and adoption For more information on technology and trade The widespread perception of the middle to late 1980s that many American companies were less effective than their foreign competitors at harnessing the output of R D is giving way to a more optimistic view Through their collective efforts US companies are now more effective in responding to foreign competition Overall the US economy remains the most productive and competitive in the world In many technological fields the public and private sectors have worked together effectively to combine their contrasting capabilities Continued cooperation between the public and private sectors will be essential to meeting the objectives of both industry and the public at large New technologies and new concerns will continue to emerge Balancing the benefits and the risks of change will require communication planning and collaboration between government and business
