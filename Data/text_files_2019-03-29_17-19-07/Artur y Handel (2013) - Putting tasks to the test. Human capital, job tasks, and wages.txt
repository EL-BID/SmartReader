Autor, MIT and National Bureau of Economic Research Michael J. Handel, Northeastern University Using original, representative survey data, we document that analytical, routine, and manual job tasks can be measured with high validity, vary substantially within and between occupations, are significantly related to workers’ characteristics, and are robustly predictive of wage differences between occupations and among workers in the same occupation. We offer a conceptual framework that makes explicit the causal links between human capital endowments, occupational assignment, job tasks, and wages, which motivate a Roy model of the allocation of workers to occupations. We offer two simple tests of the model’s gross predictions for the relationship between tasks andwages, both of which receive qualified empirical support.
 Introduction Contemporary analysis of the economic value of skill in the labor market is rooted in Becker’s ð1964Þ human capital model. A central insight of the Becker framework is that skill can be treated as a durable investment good that is acquired ði.e., purchasedÞ in part by attending school or engaging in We thank the Princeton Data Improvement Initiative for conducting the survey underlying this analysis.

Building from this logic, empirical analysis of themarket price of skill, starting with Mincer ð1974Þ, uses investment measures, such as S60 Autor/Handel years of schooling and experience, as proxies for skill. The human capital model has been highly successful in explaining both the level of the return to education and its evolution over time ðGoldin and Katz 2008Þ. This model is not directly informative about the demand side of the human capital market, however. In particular, it is silent on what factors determine the skills that employers demand, why these skills are required, and how these skill requirements have changed over time. To answer these foundational questions requires a conceptual framework that links the tasks and activities that workers perform on the job to the skills needed to carry out these activities.
 Recent literature attempts to supply this conceptual apparatus by using a “task framework” to analyze job skill requirements ðAutor, Levy, and Murnane 2003Þ. The simple idea of this approach is to classify jobs according to their core task requirements—that is, the main activities that workers must accomplish in their work—and then consider the set of formal and informal skills required to carry out these tasks. The task approach potentially offers a microfoundation for linking the aggregate demand for skill in the labor market—a primitive in the human capital model—to the specific skill demands of given job activities. The task approach has found application in several recent strands of work. Autor et al. ð2003Þ study the link between evolving technology, changes in job task requirements, and shifts in the demand for workers of different levels of education.
 Their primary hypothesis is that workplace computerization leads to the automation of a large set of “middle education” ði.e., high school or some collegeÞ routine cognitive and manual tasks, such as bookkeeping, clerical work, and repetitive production tasks. Job tasks in these occupations are readily automated because they follow precise, well-understood procedures or “routines”—that lend themselves to codification in computer software. A key implication of the Autor et al. ð2003Þ hypothesis is that the well-documented hollowing out ðor “polarization”Þ of the occupational distribution of employment in numerous advanced countries is in part attributable to computerization.
 Subsequent work by Autor, Katz, and Kearney ð2006, 2008Þ, SpitzOener ð2006Þ, Bartel, Ichniowski, and Shaw ð2007Þ, Felstead et al. ð2007Þ, Goos and Manning ð2007Þ, Smith ð2008Þ, Dustmann, Ludsteck, and Schönberg ð2009Þ, Antonczyk, DeLeire, and Fitzenberger ð2010Þ, Black and Spitz-Oener ð2010Þ, Gathmann and Schönberg ð2010Þ, Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux ð2011Þ, Goos,Manning, and Salomons ð2012Þ, andAutor and Dorn ðforthcomingÞ, along with many other recent studies too numerous to list here, have used the “task approach” to explore links between technological change, changes in task inputs, and shifts in wage structure.1 1 Goos and Manning use the term “polarization” in a 2003 working paper.

29.240 on Sat, 11 May 2013 08:56:48 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions Recent work in the immigration literature also employs a task approach. Papers by Cortes ð2008Þ and Peri and Sparber ð2009Þ compare the job task Human Capital, Job Tasks, and Wages S61 assignments of equally educated native and immigrant workers.2 Several recent studies consider the effect of international offshoring on US employment. In these studies, the unit of analysis is job tasks rather than jobs per se. Antràs, Garicano, and Rossi-Hansberg ð2006Þ and Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg ð2008Þ develop theoretical models of international offshoring built upon the notion that routine job tasks are more suitable for offshoring than nonroutine job tasks.
 Empirical papers by Blinder ð2007Þ and Jensen andKletzer ð2010Þ analyze the task content of US jobs to assess their potential for international offshoring. While these examples highlight the potential value of job tasks as an organizing framework, the task approach faces two significant challenges. The first is conceptual. Research using the task approach has not to date made explicit the economic mapping between tasks, which are characteristics of jobs, and human capital, which is a characteristic of workers. This disjuncture between tasks and human capital is particularly relevant to the analysis of the wage “returns” to job tasks, as we discuss below.3 The second challenge is measurement.
 The primary research data sets used for studying employment and earnings provide rough measures of workers’ human capital, such as education, potential experience, gender, race, and place of birth, but essentially no information on their job tasks. To overcome this limitation, researchers typically impute task requireOener ð2006Þ, Smith ð2008Þ, Dustmann et al. ð2009Þ, Goos et al. ð2012Þ , and Autor 2 In related work, Black and Spitz-Oener ð2010Þ point to differences between males and females in job task specialization as a factor contributing to the closing of the gender gap in the United States and Germany. 3 Heckman and Scheinkman ð1987Þ provide the canonical theoretical treatment of the pricing of skill “bundles” in the labor market in a setting where workers cannot unbundle their skills. A general result of their model is that, due to bundling, skills will not generally be uniformly priced across sectors except under specialized circumstances.
 Two recent papers that offer explicit links between humancapital returnsand taskprices areAcemogluandAutor ð2011Þ andFirpoet al. ð2011Þ. The first offers an assignment framework that characterizes the equilibrium assignment of skills to tasks and the determination of wages when different skill groups differ in their comparative advantage across task categories. The second considers how a change in task prices affects wage inequality in a static Roy model setting where returns to tasks are assumed to differ by occupation. and Dorn ðforthcomingÞ present evidence that employment polarization has occurred during the last two decades in the United Kingdom, United States, and in 14 of 16 Western European countries for which consistent data are available for 1993–2006. Black and Spitz-Oener ð2010Þ consider implications of this phenomenon for demand for female labor.
 Bartel et al. ð2007Þ present plant-level evidence on the impact of computerization on work organization and productivity in the valve manufacturing industry. Firpo et al. ð2011Þ explore the degree to which the polarization of US wages during the 1990s ði.e., the relative growth of earnings at high and low wage percentilesÞ can be explained by changes in task prices, growth of offshoring, and changes in labor market institutions.

Both data sets offer representative measures of job requirements in detailed occupation, but their limitations for task measurement are substantial.4 Most significantly, both DOT and O*Net provide information on job characteristics only at the level of occupations, not workers.
 This makes analysis of withinoccupation heterogeneity in task demands and its relationship to earnings infeasible.5 We present evidence below both that job tasks differ among workers within an occupation and that this variation is an important determinant of earnings. The current paper provides an exploratory effort to confront both of the limitations above: a lack of conceptual structure for analyzing the wage “returns” to tasks and a lack of data for analyzing the person-level relationship between tasks, education, and wages. The first section offers a simple conceptual framework for interpreting the relationship between job tasks and wages. We argue that the familiar logic of the Mincerian wage regression, used to estimate the “return to education,” does not carry over to estimating the “returns to tasks.” Distinct from durable investments such as education, job tasks are not fixed worker attributes; workers can modify their task inputs by self-selecting into particular jobs according to comparative advantage and reallocate their labor input among tasks when the market value of tasks changes.
 These assumptions motivate the use of a Roy ð1951Þ self-selection framework to analyze the relationship between tasks and wages. We show that a simple, multidimensional Roy model implies some testable restrictions on the relationship between “task returns” within and between occupations and that these implications are distinct from the Mincerian model.6 The second goal of our paper is to explore the value added of task measurement at the person level for analyzing job content and wage determination. For this analysis, we collected new data on the job activities of a representative sample of US workers across a variety of task domains, including cognitive, interpersonal, and physical activities. These data, a subcomponent of the Princeton Data Improvement Initiative ðPDIIÞ sur4 While an earlier generation of scholars criticized the DOT for its subjective, nonrepresentative, and outmoded measurement of job characteristics ðMiller et al. 1980Þ, the Department of Labor’s substantial investments in the O*Net have improved this instrument relative to its predecessor ðbut see National Research Council 2010, 195ff.
; and Handel 2013Þ. 5 Another key limitation is that job content measures in these databases are updated infrequently ðtheDOT is no longer updatedÞ, with time lags that differ among occupations. This makes it difficult to use these tools to track changes in task content within jobs. 6 Classic works that consider the relationship between education and comparative advantage include Welch ð1970Þ and Willis and Rosen ð1979Þ.

We further assess the value added of self-reported job tasks as predictors of labor market outcomes relative to similar occupation-level measures available from sources like the O*Net. We find that ð1Þ occupationlevel PDII measures have predictive power for earnings conditional on O*Net occupation-level measures; and ð2Þ person-level PDII measures have predictive power for earnings conditional on both PDII and O*Net occupation-levelmeasures.7 This suggests that tasks are a potentially valuable tool for characterizing individual jobs in addition to broader occupations, as is the conventional practice. In the final section of the paper, we offer two high-level empirical tests of the Roy model’s implications using the PDII data, and these tests yield qualified support.
 Although the primary purpose of our model is to build intuition for how job tasks “should” be related to worker earnings in equilibrium, we believe that the general approach and initial empirical evidence provide a useful foundation for more comprehensive analyses. I. How Will Job Tasks Be Rewarded in the Labor Market? Some Simple Theoretical Ideas The Mincer ð1974Þ earnings model provides the conceptual underpinnings for empirical analysis of the market returns to human capital investments. In theMincermodel, human capital is proxied by education and potential experience, and the coefficient on years of schooling obtained from a log earnings regression is interpreted as the compensating differential for income forgone while in school. If human capital is unidimensional and markets are competitive, the law of one price applies: the economy-wide price of human capital should be invariant across jobs.
 These assumptions motivate a hedonic model of earnings such as the following: lnwi 5 a1 b1Si 1 b3Expi 1 b4Exp 2 i 1 b3Xi 1 ei; ð1Þ where wi is the log hourly wage of worker i, Xi is a vector of person-level covariates, Si is years of completed schooling, and Expi is potential experience. In this model, b̂1 is an estimate of the market return to a year of schooling. If the primary cost of schooling is forgone earnings and capital markets function efficiently, the Mincer model further predicts that the 7 Black and Spitz-Oener ð2010Þ analyze the relationship between job tasks and wages in West Germany. Distinct from our approach, their task measures are constructed at the occupation rather than person level. This content downloaded from 18.7.
29.240 on Sat, 11 May 2013 08:56:48 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions equilibrium rate of return to a year of education should approximately equal the market interest rate. S64 Autor/Handel Does this hedonic reasoning also carry over to the interpretation of the market returns to job tasks—that is, should we expect the coefficient on job tasks in a wage regression to capture the equilibrium, economy-wide price of these tasks? Our answer to this question is no.8 Job tasks differ from education in two key respects. First, tasks are not durable investment goods like education that must earn a well-defined market rate of return.
 The tasks that a worker performs on the job are an application of that worker’s skill endowment to a given set of activities, and workers can modify these task inputs as job requirements change. This ongoing selfselection of workers into job tasks implies that there will not generally be a one-to-one mapping between a worker’s stock of human capital and the job tasks she performs. The second key distinction between job tasks and years of schooling is that tasks are a high-dimensional bundle of activities, the elements of which must be performed jointly to produce output. For example, flight attendants engage in both interpersonal and physical tasks, construction workers perform both analytical and physical tasks, and managers perform both analytical and interpersonal tasks. In each case, these core job tasks cannot be unbundled; each worker occupying the job must perform them. These two observations—ongoing self-selection of workers into tasks and bundling of task demands within jobs—motivate a Roy ð1951Þmodel of the allocation of workers to job tasks.
 We conceive of a job, or, more broadly, an occupation, as an indivisible bundle of task demands, all of which are performed simultaneously by each worker in the occupation. We assume that workers are income maximizing. They self-select into the occupations that offer the highest wage ðor, more generally, highest utilityÞ to the bundle of tasks they are able to produce given their skill endowments. The empirical implications of this model differ significantly from the Mincerian compensating differentials framework, as we highlight below. A. Conceptual Model We write workers’ skill endowments as a vector of task efficiencies ðequivalently, abilitiesÞ, where the skill endowment of worker i is written as Fi 5 ffi1;fi2 : : : ;fiKg.
 Each element of Fi is a strictly positive number measuring the efficiency of worker i at task k. Thus, worker i can perform fik units of task k in a given time interval. We think of Fi as representing a worker’s stock of human capital, and her efficiency in each 8 Our claim here is thus similar to that of Heckman and Scheinkman ð1987Þ, but our argument is an informal one.

We make no further assumption on the distribution of F or Human Capital, Job Tasks, and Wages S65 the correlation among its elements except that F has continuous support on RK11. 9 Occupations produce output using the vector of K tasks, where the productive value of tasks differs among occupation. This assumption differs from the Mincerian framework for human capital in which the marginal productivity of education is equated across sectors. It is logical for job tasks, however, due to occupation-level indivisibilities.10 Let the output of worker i in occupation j equal: Yij 5 e aj1ΣKljkfik1mi ; ð2Þ where ljk ≥ 0 ∀ j; k and mi is a worker-specific error term.
 Note that aj is not constrained to be positive, such that a worker with insufficient skills at the occupation’s key tasks would have a negative marginal product ðe.g., an untrained airline pilotÞ. We normalize the output price for each occupation at unity. This normalization is not restrictive since a logarithmic change in the market price of an occupation’s output is equivalent to a multiplicative change in the exponentiated terms of ð2Þ.11 Thus, we can summarize the production structure of occupation j with the vector Lj 5 faj; lj1; lj2; : : : ; ljKg.
 If workers are paid their marginal product, the log wage of worker i in occupation j is: wi 5 aj 1 o K ljkfik 1 mi: ð3Þ Taking this production structure as given, each worker chooses the occupation j that maximizes her output and hence earnings: Yi 5 max j fYi1;Yi2; : : : YiK ; g5 max j faj 1 FiL0jg: ð4Þ This economy is characterized by self-selection of workers into occupations based on comparative advantage. In equilibrium, the marginal worker in occupation j is indifferent between that occupation and the 9 The assumptions that all elements of F are positive and have continuous support assures that the self-selection of workers into occupations is well determined. Absent this assumption, two occupations that offered different rewards to a specific task k0 but identical rewards to all other tasks could be equally attractive to a given worker ði.e., if that worker’s endowment had fk0 5 0Þ. 10 Firpo et al.
 ð2011Þ adopt a similar assumption. 11 We could equivalently write eq. ð2Þ as Yij 5 exp � pj � a0j 1oKl0jkfik 1 ðmi=pjÞ �� , where pj > 0 is a productivity shifter that reflects market demand and other factors, a0j 5 aj=pj, and l 0 jk 5 ljk=pj. This content downloaded from 18.7.29.

Observe that S66 Autor/Handel task returns in this model are occupation specific: yw=yfkjJ5j 5 ljk. The equilibrium of the model ensures that workers are employed in the occupation that has the highest reward to their bundle of tasks. But this does not imply that workers necessarily receive the maximummarket reward to each element in their task bundle or that each element is equally valuable in all occupations. B.
 Some Straightforward Empirical Implications As is well understood, identifying the market locus of the “return to skills” in the presence of self-selection is not empirically straightforward ðHeckman and Scheinkman 1986; Heckman and Honoré 1990Þ. Given the nonrandom assignment of workers to occupations, a regression of log wages on workers’ job tasks will not generally recover the average returns to those tasks. Concretely, workers with high efficiencies in given tasks will sort toward occupations that have high rewards for those tasks. The average “return to tasks” observed in the datawill therefore not correspond to the average return over all occupations ðe.g., if workers were randomly assigned to occupationsÞ.
 Estimating task returns using observational data is particularly challenging when the rewards to clusters of tasks are correlated. Consider, for example, a hypothetical case where the marginal productivity of physically demanding ðmanualÞ tasks is strictly positive in all occupations ðljm > 0 ∀ jÞ but the productivity of manual tasks is highest in occupations that have comparatively low returns to other major task categories ðe.g., analytical tasksÞ, soCovðljm; ljaÞ < 0. LetMi and Ai denote the intensity of worker i0s manual and analytical task input on the job, respectively. An ordinary least squares ðOLSÞ regression of log wages on individual task input of the following form, wi 5 a1 bAAi 1 bMMi 1 ei; ð5Þ may potentially recover a “return” to physically demanding tasks that is negative ði.
e., b̂M < 0Þ. This spurious inference would arise because the cross-occupation correlation between the returns to physical and analytical 12 This assumes that occupations are sufficiently “close together” that there is a marginal worker in each occupation. With a finite set of occupations, it is conceivable that all workers would strictly prefer the occupation they are in. This would not affect our substantive conclusions.

7.29.240 on Sat, 11 May 2013 08:56:48 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions tasks is negative, even though the within-occupation return to physical tasks is uniformly positive.13 Human Capital, Job Tasks, and Wages S67 Without further strong assumptions on the distribution of task endowments, it would be infeasible to identify the structural parameters that underlie this model. The model does, however, imply some testable restrictions on the relationship between tasks and wages that do not rely on these parameters. PROPOSITION 1.
 Let G be the set of all occupations that have nonzero employment in equilibrium. For each occupation j ∈ G, it must be the case that Lj is not vector dominated by some other occupation Lj0 where j0 ∈ G. This proposition says that for occupation j to attract workers ðand thus belong to GÞ, there cannot be an alternative occupation j0 that has both a higher intercept and a higher return to all tasks. If such an occupation existed, all workers in occupation j would strictly prefer occupation j0 and hence j ∉ G. PROPOSITION 2. For all occupations j ∈ G, the cross-occupation covariance among task returns cannot be uniformly positive across all task pairs k; k0.
 That is, either Covðlk; lk0 Þ ≤ 0 for some k; k0, or Covða; lkÞ for some k, or both. To see why this proposition holds, consider a case where all occupations use only one task k, so each occupation j can be described by the double Lj 5 faj; ljg. For each occupation j ∈ G, it must be the case that YjðfkÞ > Yj0 ðfkÞ ∀ j ≠ j \ j0 ∈ G for some value of fk. That is, there must be a worker i who prefers occupation j to j0. Given that j0 ∈ G, however, there must also be some value of fk0 ≠ fk such that Yjðfk0 Þ < Yj0 ðfk0 Þ, so some worker i0 prefers j0 to j. Jointly, these restrictions imply that ðaj 2 a0jÞ � ðlj 2 l0jÞ: ð6Þ That is, the returns to tasks must negatively covary within the set of occupations that have positive employment.
 Were this not so, some subset of workers could be made strictly better off by changing occupations. This reasoning extends to the case of multiple tasks: the covariances among task returns, and between task returns and the intercept, cannot be uni13 This bias will be present if there is nonzero cross-occupation correlation between the returns to physical and analytical tasks. The sign and magnitude of the bias will depend on both the sign and magnitude of the covariance term and the magnitude of cross-occupation variances in task returns.

240 on Sat, 11 May 2013 08:56:48 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions formly positive.14 We explore this proposition below, but it should be acknowledged that it does not offer a very restrictive test of the Roymodel. S68 Autor/Handel It establishes a necessary but not sufficient condition for the data to be consistent with self-selection, which is that occupations with positive employment are preferred by some, but not all, workers depending upon their task endowments. In the subsequent data analysis, we also analyze a second empirical implication of the Roy model: workers who have higher efficiency— equivalently, ability—in a given task domain will generally self-select into occupations that have a higher return to that task. To formalize this idea, and delineate under what conditions it holds, we extend the simple case considered above in proposition 2 to a parametric selection setting with normally distributed task efficiencies. Consider a case with two occupations, j and j0, and two distinct tasks, k and k0.
 Let the corresponding price vectors be Lj 5 faj; l1; l2g and Lj0 5 fa0j; l01; l02g. Log wages continue to be given by equation ð3Þ. To simplify the analysis, we assume that occupation j rewards only task 1 and occupation j0 rewards only task 2: l1; l02 > 0 and l2 5 l 0 1 5 0. Let the population distribution of worker endowments of tasks 1 and 2 be given by the bivariate unit normal distribution: ε1 ε2 � � ∼N 0 0 � � ; 1 : j12 1 � �� : ð7Þ To conserve notation, define v5 ε1 2 ε2 equal to the difference in a worker’s efficiency in task 1 versus task 2—so, a worker with v > 0 has relatively greater efficiency in task 1 while a worker with v < 0 has relatively greater efficiency in task 2. Following the derivation in Borjas ð1994Þ, we can calculate the expected task endowments of workers who self-select into each occupation as: E½ε1ji5 j�5 l1l 0 2 jv l1 l02 2 r � fð2zÞ FðzÞ � E½ε2ji5 j0�5 l1l 0 2 jv r2 l02 l1 � fð2zÞ FðzÞ � ; ð8Þ where z5 ða0j 2 ajÞ=jv, r5 l1l02j12=l1l02j1j2 5 j12, and fðzÞ=Fð2zÞ is the Inverse Mills Ratio. These equations imply that workers with above average capabilities in tasks 1 and 2, respectively, will self-select into the occupations that differentially reward these tasks ð j and j0Þ if and only if the population correlation between workers’ abilities in these two tasks is not too high.
 14 It does not need to be negative for all elements, however. This content downloaded from 18.7.29.240 on Sat, 11 May 2013 08:56:48 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions PROPOSITION 3. A necessary condition for workers to be positively self-selected on task 1 capability into occupation j and on task 2 Human Capital, Job Tasks, and Wages S69 capability into occupation j0 is that r <min l1 l02 ; l02 l1 � : ð9Þ A sufficient condition for this expression to hold is that r ≤ 0: worker abilities in tasks 1 and 2 are either uncorrelated or negatively correlated.
 This proposition says that if the correlation between worker abilities in each task is not too high,workerswill self-select into occupations that offer high returns to the tasks in which they are particularly well endowed— meaning that self-selection takes the form of comparative advantage. What are the empirical implications of proposition 3 for wages? If we were to estimate equation ð5Þ above by OLS with two tasks, the presence of heterogeneous task returns implies that this equation would be too restrictive: the b’s should be allowed to vary by occupation. We can make progress, however, by observing that self-selection implies that we will observe nonzero covariances between occupation-level task returns and the task endowments of workers who self-select into these occupations. To recover these covariances, we can estimate an augmented version of equation ð5Þwhere we interact occupational task means with worker-level task inputs: wij 5 a1 bAAi 1 bMMi 1 dAAj 1 dMMj 1 gAAi �Aj 1 gMMi �Mj 1 eij: ð10Þ Following proposition 3, two cases emerge that make different predictions on the signs of the interaction terms gA, gM in this equation. The first case, which we refer to as comparative advantage, is a setting where workers are positively self-selected into each occupation.
 This occurs when the correlation between worker abilities across tasks is sufficiently low that equation ð9Þ is satisfied. This implies that there will be a positive covariance between occupational task returns and the task endowments of workers in each occupation. Hence, task returns will be higher in occupations that differentially use each task. Formally, this implies that gA, gM > 0. Conversely, if the population distribution of skills has a strong element of absolute advantage—that is, workers who excel at task 1 also excel at task 2—then positive self-selection on task 1 into occupation jmust imply negative self-selection on task 2 into occupation j0, and vice versa. Hence, if one occupation has workers who are particularly productive at the task This content downloaded from 18.

Formally, min½gA; gM� > 0. In the subsequent empirical sections, we test the two sets of complementary empirical implications following from propositions 2 and 3: task returns across occupations are not uniformly positively correlated ði.
e., they are negatively correlated for at least one task categoryÞ; and workers are positively self-selected into occupations along at least one task dimension. Since these implications are admittedly not highly restrictive, we view the tests of the model as exploratory rather than dispositive. Although the implications that we develop here are cross-sectional, a theoretical setting in which workers differ in their productivity across tasks and task returns differ across occupations also has immediate implications for the evolution of job changes and wage growth over the course of the career. Lazear ð2009Þ provides a general theoretical statement of this problem, while Neal ð1999Þ, Gibbons et al. ð2005Þ, and Gathmann and Schönberg ð2010Þ develop and test detailed empirical implications.
 Gathman and Schönberg’s ð2010Þ longitudinal study, which employs occupation-level measures of job tasks, is particularly germane. A key result is thatwhenworkers change jobs, theymovemostly tonewoccupations that have task requirements that are similar to those of their previous occupations. Althoughwe cannot explore similar longitudinal patterns in the crosssectional data collected for this analysis, we view this body of work linking workers’ task productivities to their employment and wage dynamics as extremely promising. II. Data Sources The primary data source for our analysis is a module of the Princeton Data Improvement Initiative survey ðPDIIÞ that collects data on the cognitive, interpersonal, and physical job tasks that workers regularly perform on their jobs. Our primary analyses focus on three broad dimensions motivated by the conceptual framework in Autor et al.
 2003: abstract problem solving and creative, organizational, andmanagerial tasks ð“Abstract tasks”Þ; routine, codifiable cognitive and manual tasks that 15 Note that absolute advantage is a special case of comparative advantage where there is a positive hierarchical ranking of workers by ability across all activities. Even in this case, the assignment of workers to occupations is determined by comparative advantage: labor market clearing implies that all skill groups will hold comparative advantage ðafter accounting for labor costsÞ in some set of occupations. What is distinctive about the absolute advantage case relative to the standard comparative advantage case is that in equilibrium not all workers are assigned to the activity in which they have the highest productivity.

Human Capital, Job Tasks, and Wages S71 Four items from the PDII elicit information on Abstract job demands: ð1Þ the length of longest document typically read as part of the job ðranging from one page or less to more than 25 pagesÞ; ð2Þ frequency of mathematics tasks involving high school or higher mathematics ðalgebra, geometry, trigonometry, probability/statistics, or calculusÞ; ð3Þ frequency of problem-solving tasks requiring at least 30 minutes to find a good solution; and ð4Þ proportion of workday managing or supervising other workers. The items are combined into a standardized scale of Abstract tasks using the first component of a principal components analysis, which accounts for 41% of their variation. Four items from the PDII were used to identify jobs with Routine tasks: ð1Þ proportion of the workday spent performing short, repetitive tasks and complete absence of face-to-face interactions with ð2Þ customers or clients, ð3Þ suppliers or contractors, or ð4Þ students or trainees.16 The items are combined into a standardized scale of Routine tasks using the first component of a principal components analysis, which accounts for 56% of their variation. A single PDII item elicits information on Manual job tasks: proportion of the workday spent performing physical tasks such as standing, operating machinery or vehicles, or making or fixing things by hand.
 This variable is also standardized for our analyses. For most analyses, we use a consistent sample of cases with full information on tasks, demographics, human capital, and wages, and with at least two cases per six-digit Standard Occupational Classification ðSOCÞ system ðn 5 1,333Þ. For analyses that estimate returns to tasks separately by occupation, the regression model requires at least five cases per occupation for identification, which further limits the sample.17 Summary statistics for our primary sample are given in appendix table A1. Many of the task questions contained in the PDII are adapted from the survey of Skills, Technology, and Management Practices ðSTAMPÞ written and fielded by Handel ð2007, 2008a, 2008b; see also Hilton 2008Þ. Handel ð2008aÞ provides an extensive discussion of the conceptual basis, 16 These questions are from the PDII module that measures the suitability of jobs for international offshoring ðBlinder and Krueger 2008Þ.
 17 Our precise sample restrictions in sequence, based on an initial PDII sample of 2,500 cases, are: currently working ð238 observations droppedÞ; ages 18–64 ð211 observations droppedÞ; nonmissing task measures ð35 observations droppedÞ; nonmissing education ð6 observations droppedÞ; nonmissing wage data ð486 observations droppedÞ; nonmissing, nonmilitary, andnonfarmoccupation ð36 observations droppedÞ; at least two valid observations in each occupation ð168 observations droppedÞ. Finally, in the exercise where five valid observations are required per occupation, an additional 405 observations are dropped.

 Handel ð2008bÞ presents preliminary reS72 Autor/Handel sults from the STAMP survey, which can be compared to results presented below. An alternative source of information on job content is the US Department of Labor’s Occupational Information Network ðO*NetÞ, which contains occupation-level measures and replaces the Dictionary of Occupational Titles as an official career counseling tool. The O*Net database, many years in the making, is only beginning to be used by academic researchers but is a useful point of comparison. If parallel measures from the PDII and O*Net are highly correlated, this offers evidence of what psychologists call convergent validity. Comparing results across wage regressions provides evidence on the relative strengths of two different approaches to measuring task input ðHandel 2008aÞ and the value added of person-level relative to occupation-level job content measures. The O*Net-based Abstract, Routine, and Manual scales are from Acemoglu andAutor ð2011Þ and useO*Net items that appear likely to capture similar dimensions of task input as the PDII.
 TheO*Net scales are matched to the PDII person records at the six-digit SOC 2000 occupation level. The appendix provides further details on the O*Net measures. Other approaches to providing job task measures alongside human capital variables at the person level include the German IAB/BIBB data set and the British Skills Survey, which are repeated cross-sections of workers over one or two decades ðSpitz-Oener 2006; Felstead et al. 2007; Dustmann et al. 2009Þ. If the PDII analyses prove illuminating, they may suggest the utility of a similar time series for the United States.
 III. Job Tasks: Levels and Differences among Education and Occupation Groups A. Descriptive Statistics The PDII measures provide a snapshot of the skill levels and task content of US jobs ðtable 1Þ. Only about one-quarter ð24%Þ of wage and salary workers use any kind of higher-level math on at least a weekly basis, while about one-third ð37%Þ read documents longer than six pages on a regular basis as part of their jobs. Along with similar results from the STAMP survey, these are the first figures on the actual levels of math and reading that individuals use on their jobs. A far larger percentage report engaging in extended problem solving either daily ð47%Þ orweekly ð29%Þ.
 Approximately 29% manage or supervise others at least half the time on their jobs. More than half ð51%Þ of wage and salary workers have a lot of contact with customers or clients as part of their jobs. Not surprisingly, far fewer This content downloaded from 18.7.29.240 on Sat, 11 May 2013 08:56:48 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions people have a lot of contact with students or trainees ð22%Þ and suppliers ð11%Þ as part of their jobs.
 Human Capital, Job Tasks, and Wages S73 Slightly more than half ð51%Þ of workers report spending more than half their time on short, repetitive tasks, and almost two-thirds ð60%Þ report spending at least half their time doing physical tasks, such as standing, handling objects, or operating equipment. Because these characteristics describe important dimensions of both jobs and the persons selected into them, one expects the measures to be associated with both demographic and job characteristics. Subsequent columns of table 1 summarize PDII responses by gender, race ðwhite, black, HispanicÞ, and education ðless than high school, high school only, some college, college degree or greaterÞ.18 There are striking differences across gender, race, and education categories in all task activities. For example, females are substantially more likely than males to spend at least half of their time on repetitive tasks ð58% versus 44%Þ, and blacks and Hispanics are substantially more likely than whites to spend at least half of their time on physical job tasks ðthese percentages are 56%, 70%, and 76% for whites, blacks, and Hispanics, respectivelyÞ. The lower panel of table 1 presents means and standard deviations for the standardized task scales.
 Most notably, the gap between high school dropouts and those with college or more is about one standard deviation for Abstract and Manual tasks and about three-quarters of a standard deviation for Routine. Table 2 shows breakdowns by one-digit occupation. In this case, the largest and smallest means differ by approximately 1.4 standard deviations for Manual tasks, by 1.3 standard deviations for Abstract tasks, and by 1.2 standard deviations for Routine tasks.
 Broad occupation does a better job than personal education in identifying individuals who perform most of the interpersonal tasks. The first two panels of table 3 present correlations of the items and scales with one another and with education and six-digit occupation. Education correlates moderately to strongly with the scales for Manual tasks ð20.41Þ, Routine tasks ð20.39Þ, and Abstract tasks ð0.38Þ, as well as the item for reading ð0.
33Þ. The correlations with detailed occupation were calculated by regressing item and scale values on the 241 unique six-digit occupation dummies present in the data, and taking the square root of R-squared to calculate the multiple correlation coefficient. These correlations are much larger than those involving personal education, ranging from 0.60 to 0.79. This is not entirely surprising given that the occupation level regressions contain 241 explanatory variables whereas the bivariate 18 A fourth race group, Asian, makes up 1.
5% of the sample. Because of the very small number of respondents ð12Þ, we do not separately tabulate this group.

Taken together, the PDII task measures show generally sensible patterns of varHuman Capital, Job Tasks, and Wages S79 iation across education and occupational groups and provide concrete information on what people do on their jobs and the share of the workforce performing each task at different intensities.
 The third panel of table 3 presents correlations between the O*Net scales and the corresponding PDII scales, measured both at the individual level ðcol. 1Þ and averaged by detailed occupation to match the level of O*Net’s aggregation ðcol. 2Þ. The occupation-level correlations in column 2 are larger, which is expected given that the O*Net measures only vary at the occupation level and thus cannot covary with PDII responses within occupations. The PDII measures of Abstract and Manual tasks correlate strongly with their O*Net counterparts, particularly when PDII occupation means are used ð0.63–0.

 Explaining Differences in Job Tasks: The Roles of Human Capital, Occupation, and Demographic Characteristics Although almost all analyses of job tasks treat tasks as an occupationlevel construct, a virtue of the PDII’s individual-level task measures is that they permit investigation of the variance of job tasks within occupations and the degree to which this variation is systematically related to worker as well as job attributes. This section analyzes the extent to which the tasks workers perform on the job can be explained by their individual human capital, demographic attributes, and the technical requirements of the job itself, proxied by detailed occupation dummies. Our descriptive OLS regressions take the following form: Tij 5 a1 d1Si 1 d1Xi 1 gj 1 eij; ð11Þ where the vector S includes human capital measures ðeducation, potential experience, primary languageÞ, X is a vector of demographic characteristics ðrace, ethnicity, sexÞ, and g is a vector of 240 occupation dummies ðwith one omittedÞ.19 The reference group for this regression is white male English-speaking high school graduates.20 Table 4 presents regressions results for the standardized Abstract, Routine, and Manual scales.

 All of the effects of education on Abstract tasks except for postcollege are fully mediated by occupational assignment—that is, conditioning on occupation dummies substantially attenuates the coefficients and eliminates their statistical significance. The relationships between education and performance of Routine and Manual tasks tend to remain significant after the addition of occupation dummies, but the coefficients drop substantially. By contrast, the inclusion of occupation controls has little effect on the strong negative association between Spanish-language primacy and Abstract tasks on the This content downloaded from 18.7.29.240 on Sat, 11 May 2013 08:56:48 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions one hand, and the strong positive associations between Spanish-language primacy and use of Routine and Manual tasks on the other hand.
 Females’ Human Capital, Job Tasks, and Wages S81 lower use of Abstract tasks, controlling for human capital, is fully mediated by occupation, while their higher use of Routine tasks persists after controlling for occupation. None of the coefficients for black are significant, while Hispanic ethnicity seems to be positively related to Abstract tasks once occupation is controlled. In sum, the models suggest that a substantial proportion of Abstract task content is “hard wired” into occupations. Individual human capital remains relevant, however, for workers with a graduate education and for Spanish-language speakers, even after accounting for occupation effects. While the substantial female-male gap in the use of Abstract tasks is entirely accounted for by occupation, the higher propensity of females to engage in Routine tasks is not.21 These results and others not reported ð2009Þ are notable for revealing the structuring power of occupations as determinants of job content.
 Indeed, occupation is the dominant measurable predictor of job tasks in our data. Alongside this fact, measures of human capital—in particular, higher education and Spanish-language primacy—are significant predictors of within- as well as between-occupation variation in job tasks. Human capital therefore plays a dual role in determining workers’ job tasks, both allocating workers to occupations and influencing their job tasks within occupations ðalthough it is apparent that the occupation channel is quantitatively largerÞ. Race and sex are also strong predictors of workers’ job tasks across all categories. But the relationship between race, sex, and job tasks runs largely, although not entirely, through occupational assignment; we find relatively few systematic race or sex differences in job task demands among workers within occupations. IV.
 Job Tasks and Wages: Descriptive Regressions A. Predicting Wages Using the PDII Measures Industrial psychologists typically view occupational titles as coherent, well-defined job categories rather than merely as pragmatic classification tools, and hence tend to treat all within-occupation variation as measurement error ðHarvey 1991; Peterson et al. 1999Þ. To what extent does within-occupation variation in self-reported job tasks capture substantive differences, rather than noise, in job content? If self-reported variation in job tasks is a robust predictor of wages, this would provide prima facie 21 Bertrand, Goldin, and Katz ð2009Þ find that among US workers obtaining an MBA from a top US business school between 1990 and 2006, substantial gender gaps in career advancement develop and accumulate within a few years of graduation, reflecting differences in training prior to MBA completion, differences in career interruptions, and differences in weekly hours.

 S82 Autor/Handel We examine the relationship between tasks and wages in table 5 by regressing workers’ log hourly wages on their self-reported job tasks, as well as human capital, demographic background, and detailed occupation vari22 An alternative interpretation would be that omitted worker characteristics affect both wages and self-reported jobs tasks but do not affect actual job tasks This content downloaded from 18.7.29.240 on Sat, 11 May 2013 08:56:48 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions ables. As a benchmark, column 1 presents a standard cross-sectional Mincerian wage regression of hourly wages on human capital and demographic Human Capital, Job Tasks, and Wages S83 measures. All variables in this regression have the expected signs and magnitudes.
 The R-squared of this model is equal to 0.39, comparable to standard cross-sectional models estimated using the Current Population Survey. Column 2 replaces the human capital and demographic controls with the three tasks scales, which predict substantial wage differentials. A one standard deviation increase in the Abstract task scale is associated with a 20% wage premium, while similar increases in Routine and Manual tasks are associated with wage penalties of 10% and 19%, respectively. By themselves, the three task scales account for 30% of the variation in log wages, which is 25% less than the full set of human capital and demographic measures. When 240 detailed occupation dummies are used in place of the task measures ðcol.
 3Þ, they account for 61% of wage variation. The remainder of the table demonstrates that these three sets of variables—human capital and demographics, job tasks, and occupation— capture distinct sources of wage variance. The task measures remain significant predictors of wages conditional on either human capital and demographic measures ðcol. 4Þ or a full set of occupation dummies ðcol. 6Þ. Similarly, the human capital measures are also robust to inclusion of either task measures ðcol.
 4Þ or occupation variables ðcol. 5Þ. Indeed, when all three clusters of variables are entered simultaneously, each is a significant predictor of wages ðcol. 7Þ. Notably, comparing the Wald tests for the joint significance of each group of variables ðbottom row of table 7Þ, we find that the F-statistic for the task measures is substantially larger than for the other two groups of variables. While statistical significance is not synonymous with economic significance, the economic magnitude of the relationship between tasks and wages—even net of other variables—is sizable.
 Within occupations, a one standard deviation increase in Abstract tasks predicts a 7 log point wage premium. A one standard deviation increase in Manual tasks predicts a 15 log point wage penalty ðcol. 6Þ. When human capital and gender controls are also included ðcol. 7Þ, these effects are diminished slightly but remain large and significant. Among these three measures, the Routine task variable proves least robust, losing significance when either human capital controls ðcol.
 4Þ or occupation dummies ðcol. 6Þ are included. One aspect of these results merits particular emphasis. The estimates in table 4 indicate that even within occupations, there are systematic differences in job tasks among workers who differ according to human capital, race, and gender. This pattern directly implies that job tasks must also be predictive of wages—since tasks are correlated with education, demoper se ðor do not affect wages through tasksÞ. We cannot dismiss this possibility out of hand, althoughwe doubt that it is the primary explanation for the findings below.
 This content downloaded from 18.7.29.240 on Sat, 11 May 2013 08:56:48 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions graphics, and occupation, and these variables are in turn predictors of wages. What is not known from the prior results, however, is whether the S84 Autor/Handel residual variation in job tasks remaining after netting out occupation, education, race, and sex is also predictive of wages. Column 7 of table 5 reveals that this residual variation is indeed predictive of wages.
 These results indicate that self-reported job tasks capture substantive differences in job activities among workers, both within and between occupations. B. Do PDII Task Measures Add Value to O*Net Task Measures? A further means to assess the value added of the individual-level PDII measures is to compare their predictive power with the corresponding O*Net measures. In this section, we use the O*Net measures introduced in table 3, along with the PDII measures used in the prior two tables, to make this comparison. The first column of table 6 repeats the simple regression of wages on the Abstract, Routine, and Manual task measures from table 5.
 Here we cluster standard errors at the occupation rather than person level because we will also be using occupation-level means of PDII and O*Net variables as predictors. In column 2, we replace the individual-level scales with PDII occupational means, following the O*Net approach.23 These occupation-level scales are also highly significant predictors of earnings.When both personand occupation-level task measures are entered simultaneously ðcol. 3Þ, both sets of variables remain highly significant, and this remains true when human capital and demographic controls are added to the model ðcol. 4Þ.
24 Notably, the F-value of the person-level task measures substantially exceeds the F-value of the occupation-level measures. Given that measurement error in tasks will generally be greater at the person level than at the occupation level, this pattern argues strongly that the person-level task measures are informative. Perhaps surprisingly, the person- and occupation-level relationships between job tasks and wages are quite similar for Abstract and Routine tasks across columns 1 and 2. The occupation-level Manual task measure is substantially attenuated, however, when the person-level Manual measure is included in column 3.25 23 To avoid confounding the predictive power of occupational averages with the direct correlation between a worker’s own tasks and wages, the PDII occupational mean assigned to each observation is a “leave-out” mean, equal to the grand mean of the task measure for all workers in the occupation except for the current worker. 24 Demographic variables are included in table 6 in all columns that include human capital measures, but we do not report them to conserve space.
 25 The table reports tests of the joint hypothesis that the coefficient of each of the three person-level task measures is equal to the corresponding occupationlevel measure. We further test these restrictions for each task measure separately and readily accept the null hypothesis for the Routine and Abstract measures in all specifications. Conversely, we always reject the null for the Manual task measure. This content downloaded from 18.7.29.

7.29.240 on Sat, 11 May 2013 08:56:48 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions In columns 5–9 of table 6, we introduce the O*Net measures and compare their performance with the PDII scales. Column 5 shows that the S86 Autor/Handel standardized O*Net Abstract scale has a stronger effect on wages ð0.36Þ than the parallel PDII Abstract scale calculated at the occupational level ð0.22Þ.
 But when both O*Net and PDII occupation-level scales are included in column 7, both coefficients remain large. We find less comparability between the PDII and O*Net coefficients for the Routine and Manual measures. Both Routine measures are relatively small in magnitude and not highly robust. We find a similar pattern for the PDII and O*NET Manual task measure, with the PDII measure taking a negative sign and the O*Net measure taking a positive sign. In this case, the discrepancy in magnitudes is substantial, and the O*Net Manual measure proves robustly significant. One summary conclusion we draw from this exercise is that deriving comparable task measures from different survey instruments presents a substantial challenge.
 More encouraging from the table is the fact that the PDII person- and occupation-level measures generally retain significance even conditional on inclusion of the O*Net task measures. As the F-tests of joint significance reported in the final rows of table 6 indicate, the PDII person-level measures are highly significant in all models, as are theO*Net occupationlevel measures. The PDII occupation-level measures are also highly significant in all but the final specification, where human capital and demographic variables are included in the model along with all three sets of task measures. One inference from this exercise is that mean PDII scores could potentially be usefully merged onto other data sets that lack detailed information about the task content of jobs, such as the Current Population Survey. But the results in tables 5 and 6 also underscore that this procedure would discard meaningful variation in job tasks that occurs within rather than between occupations. Indeed, the main takeaway of these wage models is that, relative to standard, occupation-level measures of job tasks, person-level task measures appear to add significant value in explaining worker outcomes.
 V. Job Tasks and Wages: Testing the Model’s Predictions This section provides two exploratory tests of the primary implication of the conceptual model following the simple theoretical ideas outlined in Section I. The first implication that we test is that the returns to the task categories must negatively covary within occupations.26 To implement this test, we first estimate separately by occupation the following OLS regression of workers’ hourly wages on their task inputs: 26 To simplify terminology but with no loss of generality, we also refer to an occupation’s wage regression intercept as a “task return.” This content downloaded from 18.7.

More precisely, we expect that minfg1; : : : ; g5g < 0. Consistent with the model’s theoretical prediction, we find a nonzero number of negative relationships among task returns within occupations ðtable 7Þ. In general, occupations that have high returns to Abstract tasks have low returns to Manual and Routine tasks.
 Conversely, returns to Manual and Routine tasks are positively correlated across occupations. Columns 4–6 in table 7 indicate that occupations with high returns to Manual tasks have relatively low wage intercepts, whereas occupations with high returns to Abstract and Routine tasks have higher intercepts as well. Overall, of the six bivariate relationships in the table, three are negative, and one of these is highly significant. While these patterns are supportive of the model, the prediction that at least one of the six coefficients in table 7 must be negative is minimally restrictive.28 Indeed, half of the six coefficients in the table are positive, and these coefficients display a similar pattern of statistical significance to the three point estimates that are negative. A second complementary implication of the Roy framework is that workers will positively self-select into occupations along at least one task 27 There are four parameters to be estimated, and hence at least five observations are required to estimate the parameters plus standard errors.
 28 If the regression coefficients were drawn at random, and assuming that the standard errors have the appropriate size, we would anticipate that one in 40 ð2.5%Þ point estimates would be negative and statistically significant at the 5% level or better. With six coefficients drawn at random, the chance of obtaining at least one negative and significant coefficient is equal to 14% ð12 0:9756Þ. Thus, in the best case, our test would reject the null by chance in 15% of cases. One could also note, for example, that half of the coefficients in the table are positive and that these display a similar pattern of statistical significance to the negative point estimates. While this pattern is not at odds with the model, it underscores that the model places very modest restrictions on the pattern of coefficients.

We anticipate that at least one of these three interaction terms will be significantly positive—and that more than one will be positive if selection takes the form of comparative but not absolute advantage. The estimates in table 8 offer support for these predictions. Column 1, which augments our prior OLS wage model with occupation-level task means, indicates that wages are significantly higher in occupations that are intensive in Abstract tasks and significantly lower in occupations that are intensive in Routine tasks.
 When we add interactions between workerlevel and occupational-level mean task use in column 2, a surprising pattern emerges: two of the three interaction terms ðRoutine � mean Routine, Manual � mean ManualÞ are positive, and the Routine interaction term is highly significant.29 As indicated by the F-statistic at the bottom of the table, these three interaction terms are also jointly significant. This is particularly noteworthy given that the coefficients on both the worker and occupation measures of Routine and Manual task inputs are negative, likely reflecting the fact that Routine and Manual tasks are most prevalent 29 The table 8 estimates differ slightly from the specification in table 6 in that we do not use “leave-out” means of occupation task measures in table 8.

Human Capital, Job Tasks, and Wages S89 controls in columns 3–6, confirming their robustness. The Routine interaction term remains negative and significant in all cases. These positive interaction terms are potentially consistent with the Roy model’s implication that workers who are highly productive at a given set of tasks selfselect into occupations that differentially reward those tasks.
30 30 In a separate analysis available from the authors, we replaced all of the PDII occupational task means with the corresponding task scales from O*Net. In these regression models, all three interactions between person-level task inputs and their corresponding occupational means were positive and jointly significant ðalthough significance declines once we include demographic and human capital controlsÞ. Given the imperfect correspondence between the PDII and O*Net task measures, we place less weight on this test of the Roy model than on the prior estimates in table 8.

Conclusions S90 Autor/Handel This paper makes three contributions to the expanding empirical and theoretical literature that employs job tasks as a building block for conceptualizing and quantifying job skill demands. Drawing on original, representative survey data containing detailed measures of workers’ job tasks, we document that job tasks vary substantially within ðas well as betweenÞ occupations and we establish that variation in job tasks among workers in the same occupations is systematically related to their race, gender, and English-language proficiency. The most pronounced and systematic differences in job task activity are found for Spanish-language speakers, who perform substantially fewer analytic and interpersonal tasks and substantially more repetitive physical and cognitive tasks than equally educated workers in the same occupations. Notably, females perform substantially fewer analytic tasks and substantially more interpersonal and routine tasks than equally educated males, but this pattern is proximately accounted for by differences in the occupations inwhichmales and females are employed. The second contribution of the paper is to explore the degree to which person-level variation in job tasks is a robust predictor of wages.
 While it would be hypothetically possible that the systematic differences in selfreported job tasks that we find between demographic groups are primarily an artifact of group differences in response patterns, the wage analysis suggests that this is not the case. The tasks that workers perform on the job are significant predictors of their hourly wages, both between and within occupational, demographic, and education groups. Notably, worker-level measures remain powerful predictors of wages when occupation-level job task measures from both O*Net and the PDII survey are simultaneously included in regression models. Thus, job task measures effectively distinguish normally unobserved attributes of workers and jobs that vary within occupational, demographic, and education groups. The third contribution of the paper is to offer a conceptual framework that makes explicit the links between workers’ human capital endowments, their occupation, the tasks that they perform on the job, and the wages they earn. The simple observation that motivates our approach is that, while workers can hold multiple jobs, they can supply tasks to only one job at a time.
 The indivisible bundling of tasks within jobs means that the productivity of particular task inputs will not necessarily be equated across jobs—and so the “law of one price” will not generally apply to the market rewards to job tasks. We propose a high-dimensional Roy framework in which the allocation of workers to tasks is driven by individuals self-selecting into occupations to maximize their incomes given their skill endowments. While this conceptual model is primarily intended to build intuition rather than guide empirical analysis, our exploratory empirical analysis provides some initial This content downloaded from 18.7.29.240 on Sat, 11 May 2013 08:56:48 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions support for the conceptual model.
 In particular, we find evidence that ð1Þ task returns vary across occupations in a manner that is consistent with Human Capital, Job Tasks, and Wages S91 competitive equilibrium and ð2Þ worker self-selection into occupations takes a form that is consistent with comparative advantage.31 This evidence also has two main limitations. The first, emphasized above, is that these tests of the theory are not high powered. A second limitation is perhaps more fundamental: even if the evidence above were to constitute a definitive “existence proof” of self-selection in the labor market, our bare-bonesmodel does not in its current form offer any deeper insight into the nature of self-selection that is operative. A richer model would potentially allow us to credibly characterize the variation in task returns across sectors and to study in detail the allocation of workers to tasks. This tool would be invaluable for forecasting how changes in task prices—catalyzed, for example, by automation or offshoring—may reshape the occupational assignments and earnings of different skill and demographic groups.
 We see a richer and more structured elaboration of this simple task approach as a promising avenue for further research. Appendix We used multi-item, additive scales from the O*Net database version 14.0 that were constructed by Acemoglu and Autor ð2011Þ to evaluate the convergent validity of the PDII items and to assess the relative merits of person-level and occupation-level task measures. The names of the constructed scales are “Abstract,” “Routine,” and “Nonroutine Manual,” and the O*Net items used in each are listed below. 1.
