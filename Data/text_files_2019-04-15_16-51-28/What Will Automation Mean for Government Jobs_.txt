New studies shed light on the job security of certain government jobs in an increasingly digital age. BY MIKE MACIAG, GOVERNING / JANUARY 4, 2018 While teachers incorporate technology into their daily routines, few expect their jobs to disappear from payrolls anytime soon.

 2/11 Automation has already altered several industries, and it’s only a matter of time before it transforms more of them. Given that many governments continue to grapple with tight budgets and suppressed staffing levels, it’s worth considering whether they might one day rely more on automation and technology to carry out tasks performed by humans. Recent studies have shed some light on what this might look like, particularly in the public sector. Automation has already made some forays into government. Kirke Everson, a KPMG intelligent automation consultant, cited "chatbots" utilized in call centers ( technology.html) as an example.
 He suggested that automation could soon replace personnel who perform repetitive back-office tasks, such as eligibility checks and other procedures following a defined set of rules. “Government is ripe for automation,” Everson says. "But if it requires a large amount of judgments or human interaction, maybe you don’t start there.” In the U.K., an estimated 861,000 public-sector jobs could be automated by 2030, according to an analysis ( releases/articles/automation-set-to-transform-public-services.
html) by Deloitte and Oxford University. “Administrative and operative” roles, which account for 27 percent of the public workforce, were identified as having the highest probability of being automated. These types of jobs are already declining, and the report projects their numbers in the U.K. to fall further from 87,000 in 2015 to only 4,000 by 2030. A separate Oxford University study (.
 examined U.S. job occupations, deeming about 47 percent of total employment in both government and the private sector to be “at risk” of computerization. Some public-sector roles considered most vulnerable included library workers, postal service clerks and transportation inspectors -- all positions with highly repetitive tasks. Many of the other occupations researchers identified were especially common in transportation. These included bus drivers and subway or streetcar operators, as well as highway maintenance workers.

Osborne But does this mean large numbers of public employees will one day be out of work? Historically, industrialization and improvements in technology haven't caused higher long-term unemployment. It’s unknown whether this time will be any different, though, with economists offering different predictions for automation’s effects. Neil Reichenberg, who heads the International Public Management Association for Human Resources, views it more as a shift.
 “It’s not so much cutting staff as it is moving people to more strategic, higher-level work,” he says. While technology has already reshaped countless occupations across just about every segment of the economy, it hasn’t yet prompted the complete elimination of many types of jobs. Consider teachers, who employ greater use of educational software programs in 3/19/2019 What Will Automation Mean for Government Jobs? 6/11 classrooms. These and other types of public employee positions haven’t vanished, but they do require greater tech skills than in years past. Although some might associate automation with armies of robots, it’s computers that are most responsible for redefining work these days.
 A recent Brookings Institution report ( workforce/) assessed “digitization,” or the degree of computer skills and related knowledge typically required of various occupations. Several public-sector jobs that required few digital skills in 2002 now mandate at least mid-level proficiency of computers or other devices. Parking enforcement workers and compliance officers, for example, might have relied entirely on paper records not long ago. Today, the Brookings data suggests digital skills for these occupations have jumped considerably over the past decade.

Unions, Reichenberg says, will likely oppose efforts expected to result in job losses. Last year, the union membership rate () for government workers was more than five times that of the private sector. Still, if automation offers governments ways to cut costs without sacrificing quality of services, they'll likely consider it. Resources remain limited. Revenues aren’t expected to grow much, and total state and local government employment is still below ( recession.

In some jurisdictions, automated processes or technologies could enable governments to provide services that otherwise wouldn’t be available. “It’s inevitable," Reichenberg says. "If you look at the way we do work today, technology is going to play a major role.” 3/19/2019 What Will Automation Mean for Government Jobs? 9/11 DISCUSS MORE FROM WORKFORCE (HTTPS://WWW.
