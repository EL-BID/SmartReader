Abstract
There is a lively ongoing debate about the effects of the widespread introduction of
robots in work environments. Many people in the labor market worry about inequal-
ity and possible job loss that robot technology may create. However, large-scale
studies on the determinants of these perceptions are thus far lacking. This article
assesses which members of the labor force are most fearful of the introduction of ro-
bots at work by using the 2012 Eurobarometer Public Attitudes towards Robots data-
set, covering 11 206 respondents in 20 European countries. Our study shows that
those (a) in economic positions that are more likely to be negatively affected by ro-
botics are more likely to be fearful of robots at work, along with, to some extent,
those living in countries (b) with adverse economic conditions and (c) where em-
ployees are less protected from market forces. The theoretical and practical implica-
tions of these findings are discussed.

Key words: technological change, robots, labor market institutions, trade unions, fear of robots

1. Introduction

Technological progress has been a central driving force behind the rise in living standards
since the Industrial Revolution. The current wave of technological innovation, known as the
Digital Revolution, has engendered digital technologies encompassing desktop computing,
the Internet and other information and communication technologies, bio- and nano-technol-
ogies and robotics.

There is a lively public debate about the introduction of these digital technologies in the
workplace and its consequences for jobs.1 Such technologies are sometimes argued to be det-
rimental for future employment opportunities (Frey and Osborne, 2013; Ford, 2015), and
these concerns are reflected in newspaper headlines such as ‘Coming to an office near you’
(The Economist, 2014), ‘Third of Britons fear the rise of robots’ (The Guardian, 2014) and

‘What happens to society when robots replace workers?’ (Harvard Business Review, 2014).
This fits into a long-standing public debate on the perceived threat of technological innova-
tion to job opportunities that started with the Luddite protests during the Industrial
Revolution, and has ever since periodically come to the fore again (Forester, 1980; Autor,
2015; Mokyr et al., 2015).

The current public debate is, to a large extent, centered on robotics. The word ‘robot’
was first introduced in 1921: robots are machines that can navigate through and interact
with the physical world of factories, warehouses, battlefields and offices (Brynjolfsson and
McAfee, 2014, p. 27). The adoption of robots in the workplace has been rapid: in developed
countries, the stock of robots per million hours worked has increased by over 150% in the
past decade and a half (Graetz and Michaels, 2015). Furthermore, robotic technologies are
continuing to advance, for example, with the application of machine-learning algorithms
that do not require tasks to follow a well-defined protocol; and the development of ‘cobots’,2

which are robots designed to interact with humans (e.g. Colgate et al., 1996).
In addition to the public debate, there has also been an academic debate on the labor

market impacts of digital technologies. Along with other factors such as globalization, the
introduction of new technologies has been found to change the jobs that are available, the
skills those jobs require, and the wages they pay. This is argued to be the case because tech-
nological change is a biased shock: it does not affect all work in the same way [see
Acemoglu and Autor (2011) for an overview]. In particular, rule-based digital technologies
are argued to replace human labor in so-called routine tasks (Autor et al., 2003). Jobs in-
tense in such routine tasks are typically medium skilled (including white-collar jobs such as
office clerks and blue-collar jobs like machine operators), whereas jobs intense in nonroutine
tasks are both high- (such as managers and professionals) and low skilled (such as hair-
dressers and cleaners). Empirical studies do indeed demonstrate that digital technology has
led to a decline in the relative demand for routine jobs in advanced economies (e.g. Goos
and Manning, 2007; Goldin and Katz, 2009; Autor and Dorn, 2013; Goos et al., 2014). To
the extent that robots still mostly use rule-based technologies, we would expect that the find-
ings from the literature on the declining relative demand for routine jobs apply. Indeed,
Graetz and Michaels (2015) show that the introduction of industrial robotics has led to a de-
cline in hours worked for both low- and middle-skilled workers. This does not rule out that
the (future) impact may be different insofar as machine-learning technologies and cobots al-
low automating different types of tasks3 and could intrinsically more strongly complement
(rather than replace) human labor.

While many studies have been published on the impact of technology on employment,
much less is known about how people subjectively experience technological change.
Therefore, in this era of digitization, we will focus on a better understanding of fears of ro-
bots in work settings. This is important because fear may impact rates of public acceptance
of the development and introduction of new (robotic) technologies and, therefore, influence
innovation and investment in them, ultimately affecting the economic growth potential4 of
economies worldwide.5 This study also contributes to discussions on the societal implica-
tions of unemployment and the fear of job loss. Previous studies have revealed a positive
link between adverse labor market conditions and crime (e.g. Lin, 2008), as well as between
a fear of job loss and status anxiety on the one hand and racism and support for right-wing
extremism on the other (e.g. Stynen and De Witte, 2011). A fear of robots in the workplace
may also fuel these anxieties (Chijindu and Inyiama, 2012). It is against this background

that this study aims to provide a better understanding of the ways in which people interpret
the introduction of new technologies in their working lives.

Worries about the use of robots in various societal domains have already been the subject of
scientific study. Existing work has focused on human–robot interactions (e.g. Nomura et al.,
2006; Bethel and Murphy, 2010; Kim and Mutlu, 2014), and documents people’s attitudes to-
ward specific types of robots. Bartneck et al. (2007), for example, study differences in people’s
attitudes toward commercial robots; Shibata et al. (2004) examine perceptions of the therapeutic
robot Paro; and Broadbent et al. (2009) investigate human responses to healthcare robots.
Several authors have considered country-specific attitudes: Han et al. (2009) examine differences
in attitudes toward tutoring robots between Korean, Japanese and Spanish parents; Choi et al.
(2008) study preferences for educational robots among European and Korean parents; while
MacDorman et al. (2009) report no clear differences in robot-related perceptions between
Japanese and US survey participants. These studies provide various valuable insights, but mostly
use small-scale surveys and/or do not focus on the fear of robots at work specifically. Two ex-
ceptions are Fink et al. (1992), who demonstrate that American production workers perceive in-
dustrial robots as a threat, and Taipale et al. (2015), who analyze people’s overall attitudes to
the use of robots in different domains of life, demonstrating that approximately 50% of
Europeans support the use of robots in manufacturing. Despite these empirically informed ac-
counts of the fear of robots at work, it is thus far not entirely clear who is most fearful and why.
Until recently, it was not possible to investigate this topic systematically, due to a lack of data.

This article aims to fill this gap by assessing the determinants of the fear of robots at work
across a broad set of European countries using a large and representative survey dataset from the
Eurobarometer Public Attitudes towards Robots survey of 2012. This dataset covers 27 European
countries and includes several questions on the perceived consequences of robots at work.

Our research will be guided theoretically by the implicit notions in the public concerns out-
lined above. As robots are increasingly being used in the workplace (e.g. see International
Federation of Robotics, 2016), some groups of workers may feel threatened by them, making
them feel less secure. We will assess whether the fear of robots at work is strongest among those
who are most likely to be adversely affected. To do this, we draw on the scholarly literature on
the antecedents of self-reported job insecurity at both the micro and macro level (e.g. Anderson
and Pontusson, 2007; Emmenegger, 2009; Chung and Van Oorschot, 2011; Mau et al., 2012;
Dixon et al., 2013; Chung and Mau, 2014). This literature indicates that such fears are largely
driven by economic self-interest. At the individual level, it can, therefore, be expected that those
in weak economic positions are more likely to be fearful of robots at work. Meanwhile, at the
macro level, those living in countries with adverse economic conditions or low decommodifica-
tion are also more likely to be fearful. We will, therefore, address the following research ques-
tion: Can fear of robots at work be explained by economic self-interest?

This article is structured as follows. First, we develop the theoretical background for our
analyses. Next, we introduce the dataset and methods, followed by the results obtained
from testing our hypotheses across a range of different models. Finally, we discuss the theo-
retical and practical implications of our findings.

This study considers whether a fear of robots in the workplace can be understood as result-
ing from one’s individual economic position (Section 2.1); and is related to country-level

economic (Section 2.2) and institutional (Section 2.3) conditions that have been shown to
determine perceptions of job insecurity more generally (e.g. Emmenegger, 2009; Chung and
Van Oorschot, 2011; Mau et al., 2012; Chung and Mau, 2014). All these factors may be as-
sociated with people’s fear of robots, based on different levels of self-interest: we expect that
people with stronger labor market positions respond more positively to robots, and that
higher levels of macroeconomic prosperity, lower levels of unemployment and more regu-
lated labor markets are accompanied by positive attitudes to robots in the workplace as
well. In other words, a fear of robots is fueled by people being exposed to greater risks in the
labor market, without having the means to gain security. Finally, to examine the impact of
these conditions more precisely, we include several control variables that may influence a
fear of robots as well (Section 2.4).

2.1 Individual-level explanations: economic position
Research on the individual-level determinants of perceived job insecurity has concluded that
socioeconomic determinants are an important part of the explanation. Specifically, those in
stronger labor market positions report lower levels of subjective job insecurity for two rea-
sons. First, their labor contracts are more secure and they are, therefore, better able to retain
their jobs. Second, when those in a strong labor market position become unemployed, they
find a new job relatively easily. This is why the higher educated, managers, workers in full-
time employment and men report lower levels of subjective job insecurity than their lower
educated, nonmanager, part-time employee and female counterparts (e.g. Green, 2009; Mau
et al., 2012).

A similar argument may apply to the fear of robots at work. In particular, those in eco-
nomic positions that are not negatively, or even positively, affected by automation may be
less fearful of robots being used in the workplace. As such, those (a) in a strong labor market
position, (b) participating in activities at work that are hard to automate via robotics and (c)
who directly reap the benefits of automation, can be expected to be less fearful of robots at
work than their counterparts in a weak economic position, whose work is easy to automate,
and who do not directly benefit from automation. Consequently, we expect that the higher
educated and the employed are less fearful of robots at work than, respectively, the less edu-
cated (H1a) and the unemployed (H1b). The former are in a stronger labor market position,
and their labor market opportunities (in terms of the odds of job loss, and the chances of
finding a new job after being laid off) are, therefore, not (or are less) negatively affected by
the introduction of robotics. Furthermore, the employed are not only in a stronger overall la-
bor market position as compared to the unemployed, but may also have more opportunities
to keep their skills up to date by working with the latest technologies.6 In addition, among
the employed, managers and professionals are less fearful of robots at work than manual
and white-collar workers (H1c), as the former’s main activities in the workplace are more
difficult to automate than those of the latter. Finally, employers are less fearful of robots
than employees (H1d), as employers are expected to benefit directly from automation-driven
productivity gains, whereas the latter might see their job opportunities decline due as tech-
nology replaces labor in routine tasks.7

2.2 Macro-level explanations: economic conditions
It has been established that economic conditions may affect perceptions of job insecurity. In
particular, existing work has shown that perceived job insecurity is higher in insecure

macroeconomic environments. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth, for example, is
found to be negatively related to the perception of job insecurity (e.g. Lübke and
Erlinghagen, 2014). The explanation given for this is that workers view their future eco-
nomic fortunes more optimistically, as high economic growth rates are associated with bet-
ter employment opportunities. Furthermore, the literature suggests that workers are more
insecure in countries with higher unemployment rates (e.g. Green, 2006; Erlinghagen, 2008;
Chung and Van Oorschot, 2011), to which the same argument applies: in periods of high
unemployment, the likelihood of holding on to or getting a job decreases.

Along a similar line of argument, we expect robotic technology to be perceived as a
greater threat in contexts of low economic growth and high unemployment levels. In those
contexts, the labor market adjustments resulting from the introduction of new technologies
are more likely to be painful, for example, because changes in the structure of employment
occur through job destruction rather than slower job growth (Jaimovich and Siu, 2012).
Accordingly, we expect that the fear of robots at work is higher as GDP growth is lower
(H2a) and unemployment rates are higher (H2b).

2.3 Macro-level explanations: institutional conditions
In addition to the economic position of individuals and macroeconomic conditions, in-
stitutional conditions may be linked to the fear of robots at work as well. It seems
plausible that people may adapt more easily to new situations in the labor market un-
der conditions of institutional security. Various institutional arrangements are di-
rected at shielding employees from market forces. Three important sources of such
protection are (a) the generosity of unemployment benefits, (b) the level of employment
protection legislation (EPL) and (c) trade union density. If unemployment benefits are
more generous, the consequences of becoming unemployed are less dire, and one is less
dependent on the labor market for providing the means of existence. This is probably
why people report less-subjective job insecurity in contexts with higher levels of public
social expenditure (Mau et al., 2012). In addition, a higher level of EPL and more pow-
erful trade unions make it more difficult to lay off workers. In other words, EPL and
trade unions may serve to protect workers against actions by management that would
harm the employee (Sverke et al., 2006, p. 11). This, in turn, affects an individual’s
perception of insecurity. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that workers feel less job-
insecure in countries with higher levels of EPL (Anderson and Pontusson, 2007) and a
greater trade union density (Sverke et al., 2006; Esser and Olson, 2012; Dixon et al.,
2013). In a broader sense, most scholars relate this finding to differences in the institu-
tional design of welfare states (e.g. Esping-Andersen, 2000) and labor markets (e.g.
Gallie, 2007).

In a similar vein, the fear of robots at work is likely to be related to institutional condi-
tions aimed at protecting employees from market forces. It can be expected that institutional
conditions aimed at abating the consequences of unemployment and unemployment risks
will reduce the fear of robots at work. The generosity of unemployment benefits makes being
replaced by robots less problematic in terms of providing a livelihood. In addition, EPL and
powerful unions may make it less likely that robots can be used to replace employees as a
strategy for increasing productivity. Accordingly, we expect that the fear of robots is lower
when unemployment benefits are more generous (H3a), employment protection is higher
(H3b) and trade union density is higher (H3c).

2.4 Confounding factors
Finally, the fear of robots at work may be influenced by other factors, both at the macroeco-
nomic and the individual level, and these factors may be correlated to our independent vari-
ables of interest. For one, cultural conditions may have a strong impact on such fears. While
the notion of culture can be defined in several ways, we associate this concept with the set of
shared values, norms and beliefs among individuals in a country (DiMaggio, 1994).
Cultural beliefs can affect individual actions and perceptions, which is why cultural differ-
ences are argued to explain variation in attitudes toward technological change across coun-
tries (e.g. Shibata et al., 2004; Bartneck et al., 2007; Choi et al., 2008; Han et al., 2009;
MacDorman et al., 2009; Shaw-Garlock, 2009). Although most relevant research does not
focus on the world of work and/or relies on a small number of observations, it does indicate
that attitudes toward robots can covary with people’s cultural backgrounds (Bartneck et al.,
2007, p. 225). For example, despite the fact that there are many subcultures within coun-
tries, people in Western economies are usually less positive toward robots than their coun-
terparts in Eastern economies (e.g. Shaw-Garlock, 2009). Moreover, it is likely that such
cultural factors correlate with countries’ institutional conditions: institutional protections
may arise in part as a result of cultural preferences. We will attempt to capture these cultural
factors by controlling for countries’ ‘uncertainty avoidance’. Uncertainty avoidance is one of
the central indicators developed by Hofstede (1991) to capture cultural differences across
countries. In nations characterized by lower uncertainty avoidance, people are expected to
adapt more easily to change. In these settings, risks such as changing jobs and entering un-
known situations are more accepted (Hofstede, 2001). As the introduction of robots in the
workplace is a concrete example of this, it can be expected that people in low uncertainty
avoidance countries will perceive the appearance of robots at work more optimistically.

Similarly, it is necessary to control for previous individual experience with robots, since
previous exposure to robots decreases fear of robots in the workplace (e.g. Nomura et al.,
2006; Bartneck et al., 2007; Stafford et al., 2010). A possible explanation is fear of the un-
known: people who are not used to new technology have more negative attitudes toward it.
Such experience with robotics at work may be related to labor market position as well, such
as education level, since not all workers are equally likely to have opportunities to interact
with robots at work. Finally, we control for two sociodemographic variables, gender and
age, which also influence the way individuals perceive robots (e.g. Nomura et al., 2006; Enz
et al., 2011; Heerink, 2011), and are likely correlated with education levels and with labor
market position. For example, men and women work in different types of jobs; and younger
workers are more likely to be highly educated.

3. Data and methodology

This article uses data from the Eurobarometer survey Public Attitudes towards Robots
(2012), which interviewed 26 751 people aged 15 years and over in 27 European countries8

(European Commission, 2014). In this survey, respondents were first provided with the fol-

coffee maker, are not robots.’ As our focus is on fear of robots in the workplace, we only in-
clude the labor force, consisting of those respondents who are self-employed, employed or
unemployed, and between 15 and 65 years old. Furthermore, our dataset is restricted by the
availability of country-level data needed to test our hypotheses.9

3.1 Individual-level variables
The dependent variable —fear of robots at work— is measured as the mean of scores for
five survey items listed in Table 110: this is inspired by a factor analysis,11 which reveals that
these five items have similar factor loadings. The resulting variable lies between 1 and 5,
where a higher number indicates a greater fear of robots at work, as for instance indicated
by higher agreement with the statement ‘Robots steal people’s jobs’ or higher disagreement
with the statement ‘Widespread use of robots can boost job opportunities in the EU’.

Notes: A total of 11 206 observations. The variable Fear of robots at work is constructed as the mean of these
five items at the individual level whenever at least three items were available, and where the score for ‘Having a
robot assist you at work’ was first rescaled to match the 1–4 scale of the other items. Finally, this summed score
was rescaled to lie between 1 and 5. Item scales reversed from the original Eurobarometer questionnaire to re-
flect fear of robots.

Two individual-level independent variables are used as indicators for economic position
to test our individual-level hypotheses: level of education and labor market position. Level
of education consists of three categories: (a) studied until the age of 15 years (including those
with no full-time education), (b) studied until the age of 16, 17, 18 or 19 years and (c) stud-
ied after the age of 20 years: we code these as three dummy variables and use respondents
who studied until after the age of 20 years as the reference category throughout. A higher
number of years of education indicates a higher skill level and, thus, a stronger labor market
position. Comparing levels of education, therefore, allows us to test Hypothesis 1a, which
predicts that workers with lower levels of education will be more fearful of robots at work.

Labor market position is a variable consisting of six categories. The first two are respon-
dents who categorize themselves as self-employed: (1) large business owners (‘Business pro-
prietors, owner (full or partner) of a company’), and (2) small business owners (‘Farmer’,
‘Fisherman’, ‘Professional (lawyer, medical practitioner, accountant, architect, etc.)’,
‘Owner of a shop, craftsmen, other self-employed person’). Although the number of em-
ployees needed for the respondents to self-categorize as business proprietors versus the other
self-employed categories is not explicitly mentioned in the questionnaire, we assume that, on
average, business proprietors will tend have more employees. Categories 3–5 are different
types of employees from an aggregate occupational indicator available in the data: (3) man-
agers and professionals (‘Employed professional (employed doctor, lawyer, accountant, ar-
chitect)’, ‘General management, director or top management (managing directors, director
general, other director)’, ‘Middle management, other management (department head, junior
manager, teacher, technician)’), (4) white-collar workers (‘Employed position, working
mainly at a desk’, ‘Employed position, not at a desk but travelling (salesmen, driver, etc.)’
and (5) manual workers (‘Employed position, not at a desk, but in a service job (hospital,
restaurant, police, fireman, etc.)’, ‘Supervisor’, ‘Skilled manual worker’, ‘Other (unskilled)
manual worker, servant’). The sixth and final category is (6) the unemployed.

These six categories allow us to compare the employed with the unemployed, where the
former are obviously in a stronger labor market position than the latter. Comparing the fear
of robots at work between these two categories informs on Hypothesis 1b. Furthermore, a
comparison of the fear of robots at work between those in occupations to some extent
threatened (manual workers and white-collar workers) with the fear of those in occupations
not threatened by robotics (managers and professionals) allows us to test Hypothesis 1c.
Lastly, as business owners may reap the benefits of increased productivity by means of ro-
botics more than employees, we test Hypothesis 1d by comparing the fear of robots of large
and small business owners on the one hand with that of managers and professionals, white-
collar workers and manual workers on the other.

In addition to the level of education and labor market position, the three individual-level
control variables outlined in Section 2.4 are added. Age is measured in the number of years
and female is a dummy for female gender. Previous experience with robots at work is cap-
tured by used robots at work, a dummy variable for having this experience.

Table 2 reports descriptive statistics for the dependent variable as well as all individual-
level regressors, calculated while applying the appropriate post-stratification weight factor
provided in the Eurobarometer dataset (W1). This shows that within the European labor
force, fear of robots at work is 2.66 on average (on a scale ranging between 1 and 5), with
an overall standard deviation of 0.77 (and, at the country level, a standard deviation of
0.27).12 Some 40% of all respondents have studied at least until the age of 20 years, whereas

10% studied until the age of 15 years only. Manual and white-collar workers make up, re-
spectively, 36 and 20% of the employed; 17% are managers and professionals; and the re-
mainder are small and large business owners. Furthermore, 14% of the labor force is
unemployed. Finally, only 9% of the labor force has experience with using robots at work.

3.2 Country-level variables
Seven country-level independent variables are used: two for measuring economic conditions,
four for measuring institutional conditions, and one as a control variable for measuring cul-
tural conditions. The two indicators for economic conditions are GDP growth rate, defined
as real GDP growth in the previous year (source: Eurostat), and unemployment rate, mea-
sured as the share of the unemployed within the labor force (source: Eurostat). Similar indi-
cators for economic conditions have previously been used by other authors with an interest
in the impact of these conditions on perceived economic insecurity (e.g. Mau et al., 2012),
which is similar to the type of fear considered here.

The first two institutional indicators measure the level of social protection regarding unem-
ployment risks (e.g. Van Vliet, 2011): unemployment replacement rate (the proportion of in-
come from work replaced by unemployment benefits) and unemployment benefits duration
(the number of weeks of unemployment benefit entitlement). Data on both are provided by the
Welfare State Entitlements Data Set (Scruggs et al., 2014). The third institutional indicator is
strictness of employment protection, and measures how difficult it is to dismiss employees
(source: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; OECD). The final
institutional indicator is trade union density, which measures the share of wage and salary
earners who are trade union members (source: OECD).

The cultural condition assumed to be relevant for understanding the fear of robots at
work is uncertainty avoidance. This is measured by the degree to which the members of a so-
ciety feel uncomfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity, and consists of an index based on

aggregated scores with respect to three survey items (provided by Hofstede et al., 2010).
These ask whether employees (a) feel ‘company rules should not be broken even when the
employee thinks it is in the company’s best interests’, and probe employees’ (b) self-
perceived job stability and (c) nervousness and strain at work. The index is scaled from 0 to
100, with higher scores indicating higher levels of uncertainty avoidance (Hofstede, 1991):
this index is widely used, and generally considered valid and reliable (Minkov and Hofstede,
2014).

Table 3 reports the country-level indicators used in our analyses. The variables measur-
ing economic conditions (GDP growth rate and unemployment rate) clearly reflect the after-
math of the 2008 financial crisis: many countries have negative growth rates and high
unemployment rates. These two economic indicators are negatively correlated.

Next to be considered are the institutional characteristics of countries, starting with the
two indicators covering decommodification by means of unemployment benefits. Here, the
UK and Poland can be seen to have the lowest unemployment replacement rates as well as
the lowest unemployment duration; whereas Portugal and Spain have the highest values for
these indicators. However, there are also countries that offer high unemployment replace-
ment rates but relatively low benefit durations, such as Slovakia and Slovenia. It also should
be noted that the extremely high score of Belgium for unemployment benefits duration (999)
reflects this country’s unlimited duration of benefit entitlement (Van Vliet, 2011; Scruggs
et al., 2014). For this reason, we will check the robustness of our results by removing
Belgium from the data when testing country-level hypotheses in our upcoming analyses.
Strictness of employment protection, the third institutional variable, is highest in Italy,
Germany and Belgium, but low for countries like the UK, Ireland and Finland. This measure
is positively correlated to both measures of the generosity of unemployment benefits, al-
though these correlations are not excessively high, indicating the multidimensional nature of
decommodification. The same conclusion can be drawn from the moderate to low relation-
ships between the fourth decommodification indicator, trade union density, and the first
three. In addition, the low to moderate relationship between the decommodification indica-
tors on the one hand and the economic condition indicators on the other underscore the fact
that economic and institutional conditions can largely operate independently from one an-
other. This may also be the case when it comes to understanding country-level differences in
terms of the fear of robots at work.

Turning to the last column in Table 3, uncertainty avoidance—our indicator for cultural
conditions—is lowest for Denmark, Sweden and the UK, whereas it is highest in Greece,
Portugal and Belgium. Furthermore, it is moderately related to both the economic indicators
and to the unemployment benefit duration and replacement rate. Its relationship with strict-
ness of employment protection and trade union density, on the other hand, is more substan-
tial, and in the direction that one would expect: populations characterized by high (low)
levels of uncertainty avoidance have high (low) trade union densities and the strictest (least
strict) employment protection.

3.3 Methodology
Given that our hypotheses are formulated at two levels of analysis (the individual and the
country), we apply a linear multilevel regression analysis to test them (DiPrete and Forristal,
1994; Hox, 2002). Multilevel models are a class of model recognizing that macro processes
may have an impact on the individual actor over and above the effects of any individual-

level variables. In particular, this type of regression analysis is sensitive to the nested struc-
ture of the data—in this case, individuals nested within countries—recognizing that
individual-level outcomes are correlated within macro-level units.13 These models are also
known as contextual models (since they recognize that individuals operate within a macro
context), hierarchical models or random coefficients models. Importantly, they disentangle
the variance of the dependent variable into its individual- and country-level components, al-
lowing us to test both individual- and country-level hypotheses.

Various types of linear multilevel models exist, depending on to what extent the
individual-level coefficients are assumed to depend on the macro-level context. Our baseline
specification allows random intercepts across countries, meaning that different countries
may have different baseline levels of fear of robots. In this model, slopes for the individual-
level variables are assumed fixed across countries, and, therefore, do not depend on context.
As a robustness test, we also estimate random slopes models, which represent a more flexible
specification in the sense that the effects of the individual-level variables may also vary by
country. Futhermore, we will consider results when alternatively using the ordinary least
squares (OLS) estimator, with and without country fixed effects.

4. Results

4.1 Main findings
Table 4 shows estimates from multilevel models that include a random intercept at the coun-
try level. In the first column, we estimate the null model to gauge the variance in the fear of
robots at work at the two levels of analysis. This indicates that some 10% [(0.064/
(0.536þ 0.064))*100] of the total variation in individuals’ fear of robots is due to cross-
country differences in fear of robots, and highlights the need for a multilevel model.
Furthermore, variance at both levels is a necessary condition for testing our hypotheses,
since we formulated them at both the individual (H1a–H1d) and country level (H2–H3).
Model 2 then adds all individual-level variables to the model, and model 3A additionally in-
cludes all country-level variables. Finally, model 3B reestimates model 3A while excluding
Belgium from the analysis.

The first two individual-level hypotheses—H1a and H1b—are corroborated. First, fear
of robots falls in the number of years in education as predicted by H1a. Second, the unem-
ployed are generally more fearful of robots at work than employed workers, consistent with
H1b. Indeed, this higher fear among the unemployed is statistically significant relative to all
employed groups except manual workers.14 The third individual-level hypothesis—H1c—is
also corroborated,15 although the level of fear among white-collar workers is significantly
lower than among manual workers.16 The fact that white-collar workers demonstrate higher
levels of fear of robots at work than managers and professionals suggests that, in line with
previous findings of falling relative demand for middle (routine) rungs of the occupational
ladder due to technological change (e.g. Goos and Manning, 2007; Autor and Dorn, 2013),
white-collar employees (such as office clerks), also feel threatened by the introduction of dig-
ital technologies such as robotics.

Finally, the findings reported in Table 4 with respect to the last individual-level hypothe-
sis, H1d, are mixed. On the one hand, manual workers fear robots at work more than both
large and small business owners, while white-collar workers fear robots at work more than
large business owners.17 On the other hand, the level of fear of robots among small business

owners does not differ significantly from that of white-collar workers, nor do managers and
professionals fear robots significantly more than either large or small business owners.
Indeed, managers and professionals are significantly less fearful than the two types of busi-
ness owners.

Our results at the individual level are robust across models 2, 3A and 3B. With regard to
the control factors, previous experience with robots has a significantly negative impact on
fear of robots as expected. Furthermore, women are more likely than men to fear robots.
Overall, at the individual level, most of the hypotheses derived from the notion of self-
interest are supported.

We now turn to testing the country-level hypotheses, using model 3A in Table 4: in this
model, the indicators for economic, institutional and cultural conditions (each standardized
to have a zero mean and unit standard deviation across countries) are all included simulta-
neously. Although several country-level indicators are individually statistically insignificant,
we keep them in our specification to avoid omitted variable bias. Model 3A shows that un-
employment rate and trade union density yield significant coefficients in the hypothesized di-
rection: respondents in countries with high unemployment rates (H2b) or lower trade union
densities (H3c) have a higher fear of robots at work. Other indicators such as GDP growth
rate, unemployment replacement rate and uncertainty avoidance have the expected sign, but
are not individually statistically significant. Finally, strictness of employment legislation does
not correlate with the fear of robots at work, and unemployment benefits duration has an
unexpected positive relationship with the fear of robots. Comparing model 3A with 3B,
where Belgium has been excluded, coefficients for all country-level indicators retain the
same sign and similar magnitudes, but significance levels are lower (with the exception of
trade union density), reflecting the reduced variation at the country level.

However, one may suspect that the zero average effect of EPL on the fear of robots is the
result of different effects across worker groups. Indeed, for the employed, such legislation
may lower fear of robots, whereas it could be neutral or even raise fear among business
owners and those out of a job. We tested this by including a set of interactions of all labor
market position categories with EPL in the specification of model 3A (results available on re-
quest). From this, we find that the effect of EPL on the fear of robots is almost zero (and sta-
tistically insignificant) for all worker groups except large business owners, where the effect is
indeed positive but only significant at the 13% level. This provides only modest support for
the idea that the impact of EPL in Table 4 goes undetected because of effect heterogeneity
across worker groups. Similarly, the effect of trade union density may be argued to differ
across worker groups: to the extent that trade unions protect the interests of employees
only, we would expect its fear-reducing effect to be driven by employees rather than business
owners or the unemployed. Here, when we add interactions between these three groups and
trade union density we do find that the effect is statistically significant for employees only,
and insignificant for business owners and the unemployed (results available on request).18

Summing up, one out of two indicators for a country’s economic conditions (the unem-
ployment rate) and one out of four indicators for a country’s institutional conditions (trade
union density) yield associations that are both statistically significant and in the expected di-
rection: the effect sizes are nonnegligible, such that one standard deviation increase in trade
union density or decrease in the unemployment rate reduces fear of robots at work by
around a quarter (¼ 0.07/0.27*100) of a standard deviation. As such, country-level
Hypotheses 2b and 3c are corroborated, whereas no statistically significant evidence is

found in favor of country-level hypotheses 2a, 3a and 3b. Tentatively, this implies that eco-
nomic and institutional conditions matter to some extent for understanding country-level
differences in the fear of robots at work. However, these results should be interpreted with
caution given the high number of insignificant estimates: this is likely the result of a relatively
low amount of variation at the country level combined with high correlations among several
country-level indicators. Especially, the control variable for cultural conditions (uncertainty
avoidance) is problematic in this respect, since it has a statistically significant effect on fear
of robots at work and is relatively strongly correlated with both economic and institutional
conditions. However, one might argue that this shared variation can nonetheless be mean-
ingful for identifying the effect of economic and institutional conditions. Indeed, when we
do not control for uncertainty avoidance, we find similarly sized but statistically significant
effects for four out of six macro-level indicators (all except the unemployment replacement
rate and EPL).

4.2 Robustness checks
Table 5 presents further robustness checks on our results by modifying our multilevel model
specification. By using the multi-item scale fear of robots, we have so far included a broad
set of questions related to robots in the workplace. To consider the item arguably most nar-
rowly in line with our research question, we also test our hypotheses on an alternative de-
pendent variable: the single item ‘robots steal people’s jobs’, which has four answer
categories [(1) totally disagree, (2) tend to disagree, (3) tend to agree and (4) totally agree].19

Model 1 in Table 5, therefore, uses this alternative dependent variable, while including the
full set of regressors at both the individual and country levels, as before.

The results for our individual-level hypotheses are robust to using this alternative depen-
dent variable: they are qualitatively identical to the results reported in Table 4. The only dif-
ference is that we find slightly more support for H1b, since manual workers are found to
have a lower fear than the unemployed. For the country-level hypotheses, we again confirm
the role of the unemployment rate in increasing fear of robots, but the effect of trade union
density is no longer present when considering this more narrowly defined dependent
variable.

As a further robustness check on our model specification, model 2 in Table 5 estimates a
multilevel model with fear of robots as the dependent variable (as in Table 4), but using ran-
dom slopes for the individual-level regressors. This is a more flexible model specification as
compared to our models from Table 4, since they allow coefficients of individual-level re-
gressors to vary across countries. A comparison with the random-intercept specifications in
model 3A from Table 4 reveals that the findings about our individual-level hypotheses are
not affected by allowing random slopes. The estimated variances of the slopes (results avail-
able on request) show that the coefficients of individual-level regressors do vary somewhat
across countries: in terms of our variables of interest, most variation is found for the coeffi-
cient for manual workers and the coefficient for small business owners (which have a vari-
ance of 0.007 and 0.005, respectively). Furthermore, the effects of country-level regressors
do change as compared to the random-intercept model: in particular, the effect of the unem-
ployment rate (H2b) disappears. On the other hand, the previously found effect of trade
union density (H3c) does remain present.

Finally, Table 6 presents robustness checks using the OLS estimator, while clustering
standard errors at the country level. Model 1 is consistent with results from Table 4 in terms

of both individual- and country-level hypotheses. Model 2 shows a fixed effect OLS model:
this does not have either random intercepts or slopes, but captures all macro-level variation
by means of a separate, fixed, intercept for each country. Since such fixed intercepts absorb
all variation in our macro-level regressors, this model does not allow testing our country-
level hypotheses. Our conclusions with respect to our individual-level hypotheses, however,
are again unaffected by using this estimator. Finally, model 3 reestimates the fixed effect
model but on the extended sample of all 27 European countries, including those for whom
we do not have data on the macro-level variables. None of the individual-level coefficients
are statistically significantly different across models 2 and 3, indicating that results for our
individual-level hypotheses do not depend on this sample restriction.

To sum up, the conclusions about our individual-level hypotheses described in Section
4.1 seem to be quite robust to model specification. However, specific results for the country-
level hypotheses are less stable: this sensitivity to modeling choices likely reflects the lower
amount of variation at this level as well as the high correlations among some country-level
regressors. However, we do still find some support for the overall hypothesis that country-
level economic and institutional conditions matter for the fear of robots at work.

5. Conclusion and discussion

By focusing on the question Can fear of robots at work be explained by economic self-interest?,
this article contributes to the public and academic debate on the perceived impact of robotics
on work-related issues. This debate has intensified during the ongoing Digital Revolution as de-
velopments in robotics have sped up and adoption rates have increased. Notwithstanding the
many benefits that can be gained in various domains by applying robotics, for some workers
such changes may be disruptive. As a consequence, the introduction of robots may result in
fear among those whose economic standing is likely to be adversely affected.

We find that a fear of robots at work can partly be understood along the lines of self-
interest. Managers, professionals and the highly educated—who hold positions in the labor
market that are unlikely to be affected negatively by the introduction of robotics—fear ro-
bots at work less than manual and white-collar workers and the less well educated. Results
for macro-level factors are more mixed, but do suggest that those living in countries where
economic conditions indicate better labor market prospects (through abundant job opportu-
nities or higher GDP growth rates) and insulating institutional conditions (particularly a
high trade union density) tend to be less fearful of robots in the workplace. Yet, as this study
is a first step to examine how individuals perceive robots in the workplace, some of these
conclusions may also result from limitations in our study design (cross-sectional data for a
limited number of countries).

Our findings of course do not imply that notions other than self-interest are irrelevant for
understanding the fear of robots at work, and some of our results may already point to this.
Indeed, we cannot rule out that cultural differences also provide a partial explanation for
differences in the fear of robots at work. One indication is that the level of education is
among the strongest predictors of the fear of robots. This is suggestive, as one’s education
level has various cultural corollaries in addition to the labor market position and cognitive
abilities it indicates. These cultural aspects are referred to as ‘cosmopolitanism’
(Hainmueller and Hiscox, 2006) or ‘cultural capital’ (Van der Waal and De Koster, 2015).
Irrespective of the label used, it has been demonstrated that these cultural aspects of

education account for the high levels of cultural discontent—also referred to as ‘anomie’
(Srole, 1956) or ‘cultural insecurity’ (Van der Waal et al., 2010)—among the less educated
in Western societies in recent decades (Margalit, 2012; Van der Waal and De Koster, 2015).
This discontent entails feeling threatened by the complexities of modern life, which is consid-
ered to be fickle and disorderly. The introduction of robots may add to that complexity, and
the high levels of fear of robots at work among the less educated might, therefore, not exclu-
sively reflect economic self-interest but also be part of their cultural discontent. In our analy-
ses, we strive to control for such cultural differences by including Hofstede’s (1991) and
Hofstede’s et al. (2010) country-level indicator for uncertainty avoidance. The estimated co-
efficient for this regressor is always positive and economically sizable—although not always
statistically significant— suggesting that countries with higher uncertainty avoidance are in-
deed more likely to be fearful of robots. This does not rule out, of course, that there are
other cultural dimensions of fear of robots which our model does not include, and which are
correlated with workers’ education level.

Turning from the academic to the societal relevance of what we identified, our findings
indicate that, for those interested in tempering the fear of robots at work, investment in edu-
cation and training could be one way forward. Here, training in nonroutine skills such as
creativity, problem-solving, and analytical thinking could be particularly relevant, since
these are not easy to automate (Smit, 2013). On the other hand, our results indicate that
those who have used robots at work fear them less, which tentatively suggests that a more
widespread use of robotics may lower such fears.

Finally, we must address some of the limitations of our study and make suggestions for
future research. First, the associations shown here are purely descriptive: they should be in-
terpreted as partial correlations rather than causal effects. For example, we cannot claim
that experience with robots causes workers to be less afraid, since workers who are less
afraid of robots may have self-selected into labor market positions exposing them to this
technology. Second, our analyses and conclusions at the country level are limited by the rela-
tively low amount of variation at this level. Third, due to data limitations, we were unable
to study industry-level differences, but it is to be expected that the fear of robots at work is
higher in industries where robots are most likely to replace human labor. Work in the auto-
mobile industry, for instance, is easier to automate than that in personal service industries
where most tasks involve human interaction.

An interesting avenue for future studies could be to try and investigate fears of various
types of robots: our analyses do not make this distinction. Although survey respondents
were provided with a broad definition of robotics (Section 3), it may be that today’s fears of
robots mostly refer to industrial and factory robots, since these are currently most predomi-
nant in the workplace. However, it is possible that service robots and cobots are less likely
to fully replace human workers. In particular, assistive technologies (such as cobots in
healthcare) are designed to complement labor, and still require human oversight and input.
A similar point can be made about robots embodying machine-learning technologies which
are likely to be more widely implemented in the future: since such technologies do not pro-
vide rule-based solutions but rather ‘best guesses’ based on statistical models, human judg-
ment is likely to remain both valuable and necessary. However, working with cobots or
other new robotic technologies does not rule out the possibility that people still perceive in-
security concerning the continuity of several aspects of their jobs (e.g. Hartley et al., 1991),
such as the level of autonomy and self-actualization (Carr, 2015). Furthermore, working

side to side with such robots may require different skills than the ones needed prior to their
implementation, and as such still prove a disruptive force from the perspective of workers.

Finally, more research on the cultural conditions that affect the fear of robots at work is
needed, as we were only able to consider the role of country-wide uncertainty avoidance.
For example, exposure to robots through cultural products such as movies may also play a
role in understanding the acceptability of robots in the workplace (cf. Katz et al., 2015).
Related to this, individual personality traits such as extraversion could also be included in
future studies directed at understanding the fear of robots at work, since these have been
found to affect the way humans interact with devices (cf. Luzack et al., 2003).

Notes
1. These labor market impacts are not the sole focus of the public debate about robotics:

other aspects, such as concerns about quality (e.g. the quality of care in the health sec-
tor), safety and privacy also play a role.

2. An example of cobots are care-giving robots (e.g. Hirsch et al., 2000; Sparrow and
Sparrow, 2006), designed to improve the quality of life of the elderly (e.g. Enz et al., 2011;
Dahl and Boulos, 2014).

3. New robotic technologies are being applied across a wide range of sectors, such as in
health care, cleaning and entertainment (Frey and Osborne, 2015). Also see Remus and
Levy (2015) for a careful consideration of the future automation potential of job tasks for
one particular occupation, lawyers.

4. Although some would argue that economic growth is not a primary goal of economic pol-
icy per se.

5. Graetz and Michaels (2015) estimate that the increased use of robots raised advanced
countries’ average growth rates by about 0.37 percentage points over 1993–2007.

6. For an overview of the literature on the effects of unemployment and the introduction of
new technologies on skill depreciation and obsolescence, see De Grip and Van Loo (2002).

7. We are aware that robotic technology may be introduced for other reasons than productiv-
ity gains: for example, robots can be used to improve the quality of work (i.e. improving
adverse and unsafe working conditions). Nevertheless, we assume that, on average, em-
ployers introduce robotic technology to increase productivity, and, therefore, expect that
their profits will rise as routine labor is replaced by robots.

Bulgaria, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta and Romania. As a robustness check,
we will test our individual-level hypotheses on the extended sample of all 27 countries,
also.

11. Factor analysis is a method of data reduction that considers to what extent variables ex-

hibit similar patterns of responses.

in Greece, Portugal and Spain, whereas workers in Denmark, Sweden and Slovakia are
the least fearful.

13. Multilevel models also have more power and produce less-biased standard errors (Hox,
2002) than OLS models even when clustering standard errors to address the Moulton
(1986) aggregation problem (Cheah, 2009).

14. The null hypothesis of equality of the coefficients is rejected for white-collar workers (P ¼ 0.00),
managers and professionals (P ¼ 0.00) and small business owners (P ¼ 0.00); but not for man-
ual workers (P ¼ 0.40).

15. The null hypothesis of equality of the coefficients is rejected with P ¼ 0.00 for both white-
collar workers and for manual workers.

16. The null hypothesis of equality of the coefficients is rejected, with P ¼ 0.00.
17. The null hypothesis of equality of the coefficients between white-collar workers and small

business owners is not rejected, with P ¼ 0.16.
18. The results for these interactions hold irrespective of whether the interactions with EPL

are also included.
19. Although we continue using a linear multilevel regression model for ease of interpretation

and comparability with Table 4, our results are robust to alternatively using an ordered
logit regression analysis in recognition of the ordered response nature of the outcome
variable.
