Key findings: \u0083 Automation will accelerate the shift in required workforce skills we have seen over the past 15 years. Our research finds that the strongest growth in demand will be for technological skills, the smallest category today, which will rise by 55 percent and by 2030 will represent 17 percent of hours worked, up from 11 percent in 2016. This surge will affect demand for basic digital skills as well as advanced technological skills such as programming.", "doc_id": "MGI-Skill-Shift-Automation-and-future-of-the-workforce-May-2018.txt", "para_id": 4, "score": 0.23407563455146901}, {"summary": "These survey results largely corroborate other barometers of company sentiment about concerns over workforce skills and their potentially negative impact on performance.66 50 McKinney Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce FIVE ACTIONS TO BUILD THE WORKFORCE SKILLS THAT MATTER IN THE FUTURE There are five main types of actions that companies will take to build the workforce of the future: retrain, redeploy, hire, contract, and release.", "context": "Their main concerns include employees who do not upgrade skills fast enough, are not sufficiently adaptable to move to new types of work, or lack requisite technical skills (Exhibit\u00a020).These survey results largely corroborate other barometers of company sentiment about concerns over workforce skills and their potentially negative impact on performance.66 50 McKinney Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce FIVE ACTIONS TO BUILD THE WORKFORCE SKILLS THAT MATTER IN THE FUTURE There are five main types of actions that companies will take to build the workforce of the future: retrain, redeploy, hire, contract, and release.The combination of options that firms adopt will depend to a significant degree on the automation potential for their businesses and their current workforce skills and dynamics.", "original_sentence": "These survey results largely corroborate other barometers of company sentiment about concerns over workforce skills and their potentially negative impact on performance.66 50 McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce FIVE ACTIONS TO BUILD THE WORKFORCE SKILLS THAT MATTER IN THE FUTURE There are five main types of actions that companies will take to build the workforce of the future: retrain, redeploy, hire, contract, and release.", "text": " If they cannot source the talent they need to deploy the new technologies, and if they cannot upgrade the skills of their workers fast enough, business leaders worry that this could hurt their financial performance, impede their growth, and lead to the departure of top-performing employees.

Automation and joblessness became such a huge issue that President Lyndon established the \u2018Blue-Ribbon National Commission on Technology, Automation and Economic Progress\u2019. The Commission studied the effects on productivity, labour, and automation and concluded that automation did not as such threaten employment and there were more important factors at stake: \u201cThus technological change (along with other forms of economic change) is an important determinant of the precise places, industries, and people affected by unemployment. But the general level of demand for goods and services is by far the most important factor determining how many are affected, how long they stay unemployed, and how hard it is for new entrants to the labour market to find jobs.
