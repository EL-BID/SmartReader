TECHNOLOGY AT WORK v2.0 
The Future Is Not What It Used to Be 
 
It is a pleasure to introduce Technology at Work v2.0: The Future Is Not What It 
Used To Be. This report is the third in a long-term series of Citi GPS reports co-
produced by Citi and the Oxford Martin School at the University of Oxford in order to 
explore some of the most pressing global challenges of the 21st century. The report 
further explores the concepts introduced in our February 2015 report, Technology at 
Work: The Future of Innovation and Employment, which marked the introduction of 
the Oxford Martin Programme on Technology and Employment, a long-term 
programme of research at the University of Oxford supported by Citi that will focus 
on the implications of a rapidly changing technological landscape for economies 
and societies.  

In this new report, Oxford Martin School academics; Dr. Carl Benedikt Frey, 
Associate Professor Michael Osborne and Dr. Craig Holmes expand their theories 
on the changing nature of innovation and work and the associated implications for 
the future of employment and society more widely. Based on their methodology that 
predicted 47 percent of US jobs were at risk from automation, the authors now look 
at the probabilities of jobs at risk across the world as well as the disparities of job 
risk between cities. 

To protect against jobs being eliminated due to automation, it is important to 
recognize which characteristics are most likely to be associated with a given job 
being automated — perception and manipulation, creative intelligence, and social 
intelligence are the three bottlenecks to automation. Cities and regions that have 
invested in skilled industries remain relatively safe from automation and 
technological dynamism will remain the best way to maximize employment and to 
benefit positively from new technologies. Education is also a very important tool that 
policymakers will need to leverage in preparation for the effects of accelerated 
technological change. 

Throughout this report, Citi Research analysts drill deeper into specific industries to 
highlight a number of sectors already feeling the effects of automation as well as 
areas where technology is helping to create new jobs. The Citi Research 
Economics team investigates whether traditional measurement tools are failing to 
capture the productivity and GDP improvements as well as the subsequent inflation 
effects that come from accelerated technological change. Finally, we look to identify 
adequate policy responses for the issues highlighted in this report. 

We hope that you enjoy this Citi GPS report. We look forward to sharing the results 
of the exciting collaboration between Citi and the Oxford Martin School in future 
reports.

The Oxford Martin Programme on Technology and Employment is a new 
research programme established in January 2015 with support from Citi. It has been 
created to investigate the implications of a rapidly changing technological landscape 
for economies and societies. The programme will provide an in-depth understanding 
of how technology is transforming the economy, to help leaders create a successful 
transition into new ways of working in the 21st century. The programme is part of a 
wider research partnership between the Oxford Martin School and Citi, analysing 
some of the most pressing global challenges of the 21st Century.

Executive Summary1 
The debate over the impact of automation has been going on for several centuries, 
from the Luddites in 1811 to John Maynard Keynes’ prediction of technological 
unemployment in the 1930's, to Stephen Hawking's recent warnings over Artificial 
Intelligence. Most recently, the topic has been chosen as the primary theme for the 
2016 World Economic Forum meeting in Davos and the Financial Times awarded 
their 2015 Business Book of the Year to Martin Ford’s ‘The Rise of the Robots’.  

In our February 2015 Citi GPS report Technology At Work we cited three primary 
reasons why we believed the impact of technology change on the economy was 
different this time: (1) the pace of change has accelerated; (2) the scope of 
technological change is increasing; and (3) unlike innovation in the past, the 
benefits of technological change are not being widely shared — real median wages 
have fallen behind growth in productivity and inequality has increased. In the report 
that follows, Citi again teams up with Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne from 
the Oxford Martin School to answer a number of the questions that were generated 
post the original report – on a range of topics from susceptibility to solutions.  

There seems little doubt that the pace of technology change has accelerated. 
Whereas it took on average 119 years for the spindle to diffuse outside of Europe, 
the Internet spread across the globe in only 7 years. Going forward, as argued in 
the Citi GPS Disruptive Innovations III report, the cost of innovation continues to fall 
as cheaper smartphones will help bring 4 billion more people online. The next stage 
of connectivity will move from people to 'things' with Cisco estimating 500 billion 
devices will be connected by 2030, up from 13 billion in 2013. Increasing digital 
connectivity is fuelling a data boom, with data volume estimated to be doubling 
every 18 months, and computers are likely far better able to handle this volume than 
people. In 2015, the Edelman Trust Barometer found that more than half of the 
global "informed public" believe that the pace of development and change in 
business today is “too fast" with 70% citing technology as the driver of change. Over 
96% of institutional clients who participated in Citi’s survey on technology and work 
believe that automation will accelerate over the next five years vs. the previous five 
years.  

Our work also suggests the scope of technology change is increasing. The big data 
revolution and improvements in machine learning algorithms means that more 
occupations can be replaced by technology, including tasks once thought 
quintessentially human such as navigating a car or deciphering handwriting. Carl 
Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne's original study on employment2 suggested 
47% of US jobs were at risk of computerisation. In the chapter ‘How Susceptible are 
Countries Worldwide?’, we use data from the World Bank to show that the risks of 
automation are actually higher in many other countries —- for example in the OECD 
the data shows on average 57% of jobs are susceptible to automation, this number 
rises to 69% in India and 77% in China.

framing this report, as well as to Anushya Devendra at the Oxford Martin School for 
advice and editorial support

Increased automation in low-wage countries, which have traditionally attracted 
manufacturing firms, could see them lose their cost advantage and potentially lose 
their ability of achieving rapid economic growth by shifting workers to factory jobs. In 
a survey that we conducted with institutional clients, 70% of our clients also believe 
that automation and the developments in 3D printing will encourage companies to 
move their manufacturing process closer to home — with North America gaining the 
biggest advantage from this development and China having the most to lose. A 
growing concern of ‘premature deindustrialisation’ in emerging and developing 
countries could require new growth models and a need to upskill the workforce.  

Historically, new technologies have not only transformed regions, industries and 
companies, but also cities. In the US, the computer revolution has shifted the 
fortunes of many cities with some, such as San Francisco, experiencing rapid 
growth while others spiral towards bankruptcy. Cities that specialised in cognitive 
work gained a comparative advantage in new job creation, mirroring trends in 
population and wage growth over the same period. The expanding scope of 
automation in the 21st century may shift the fortunes of US cities once more, 
affecting a different set of cities than the ones historically impacted by 
computerisation and offshoring. Berger, Frey and Osborne in their most recent 
analysis3 suggest that the exposure of cities in the US to future automation ranges 
from 54% in Fresno to 38% in Boston. The best way forward for cities to reduce 
their exposure to automation is to boost their technological dynamism and attract 
more skilled workers.  

The chapter ‘What Jobs do We See Ahead’ emphasises the importance of acquiring 
skills for future employment. The European Centre for the Development of 
Vocational Training (Cedefop) estimated that in the EU nearly half of the new job 
opportunities will require highly skilled workers. Today’s technology sectors have not 
provided the same opportunities, particularly for less educated workers, as the 
industries that preceded them.  

This downward trend in new job creation in new technology industries is particularly 
evident starting in the Computer Revolution of the 1980s. For example, a study by 
Jeffery Lin4 suggests that while about 8.2% of the US workforce shifted into new 
jobs during the 1980s which were associated with new technologies; during the 
1990s this figured declined to 4.4%. Estimates by Thor Berger and Carl Benedikt 
Frey further suggest that less than 0.5% of the US workforce shifted into technology 
industries that emerged throughout the 2000s, including new industries such as 
online auctions, video and audio streaming, and web design.5  

Despite these low numbers to date, a number of forecasts suggest good 
opportunities for future job creation in the information technology, industrial (i.e. 
robot engineers and technicians) and green sectors. In addition, the health sector is 
set to create the largest job openings, estimated at more than 4 million new jobs in 
the US from 2012 to 2022. This is not surprising given that many people in 
advanced countries are living for longer. This, together with a reduction in fertility 
rates, is changing the demographics in many advanced and some emerging nations

Statistics, May 2011, Vol. 93, No. 2, pp. 554-574. While the estimates by Lin are not 
necessarily directly comparable, they speak to further studies showing a downward trend 
in new job creation.

(e.g. Japan and China) as described in the chapter ‘Demography vs Automation: 
Will We Run Out of Workers or Out of Jobs?’ In these countries, automation is seen 
as a possible solution to the changing demographics, however we conclude that 
automation could pose more risks to jobs than demographic changes.  

Incremental productivity gains through automation should offset some of the 
demographic developments; however we are currently also facing a ‘productivity 
paradox’ as described in more detail in the chapter ‘Impact of Automation on 
Productivity’. If, as we believe, progress in technology is so rampant, we should see 
healthy productivity improvements. However across advanced economies, labour 
productivity growth has slowed from 4% in 1965-75, to about 2% from 1975-2005 
and further lower to 1% from 2005-2014. Rather than taking the view that the 'low-
hanging fruits' of innovation have been plucked, we see limitations in the current 
measurement of productivity, a lag effect in measurement and a wider distribution of 
productivity across firms and workers. We found that institutional clients agree — 
95% of clients in our survey expect automation and technology will drive an 
increase in productivity growth to some degree over time (60% to a significant 
degree and 35% to a minor degree).  

While we are positive on productivity, the chapter ‘Impact of Automation on Inflation’ 
argues that the rise in automation and technology is likely to reinforce the current 
low inflation environment due to increased uncertainty and the narrow distribution of 
productivity gains. There is also good reason to suspect that current price deflators 
and measures of inflation are overstated. We may already be observing some of 
these effects given the Phillips curve has flattened. To close output gaps, demand 
stimulus will continue to be needed, with monetary policy remaining accommodative 
and more creative in most advanced economies.  

Whilst the first half of the report discusses the effect that automation could have on 
countries and cities and on productivity and inflation, in the second half of the report 
we look at changes that are already occurring in a number of industries. We 
highlight a number of sectors such as the food industry, call centres and factories 
that are already automating a number of different processes which could ultimately 
affect (or are already affecting) a number of different jobs. In addition, with the cost 
of robots expected to decrease over time, economic barriers to the expansion of 
automation in different sectors are expected to fall. This is discussed in detail in the 
chapter ‘What are the Barriers to Automation?’ which shows that payback periods 
for some industrial robots would reduce to 1.2 and 2.6 years in China and Thailand 
respectively by 2017. Barriers still exist for small and medium-sized enterprises 
(SME’s) however the flexibility and affordability of co-bots could offer appropriate 
solutions for these companies.  

Looking at the macroeconomic and microeconomic effects of technological change, 
we find further evidence that the pace, scope and benefits of this change will be a 
challenge to societies. The remainder of the report focuses on potential policy 
options. The chapter ‘Response: Policy and Job Risk from Automation’ details 
active labour market policies which could help people find jobs: from training, to 
earned income tax credits (EITCs) or lowering tax wedges, to incentives to support 
self-employment. We believe EITCs are more appropriate than current moves to 
raise minimum wages given the latter could lead to higher unemployment. If self-
employment is becoming a new norm, this also has policy implications — 34% of 
the total US workforce, or 53 million people, are currently freelancers (see Figure 
34). Some argue a basic income or benefits (healthcare, housing, pensions) should 
be provided, yet we fear changes in taxation that may be required to pay for 
solutions will impede an effective policy response. At the same time, local, regional,

and state governments could face challenges in maintaining tax revenues from 
income disparities and from the difficulties in effectively taxing the digital economy.  

With technological change a key driver for the demand of both the level and type of 
skills needed ahead, it is no surprise that the number one policy suggestion in our 
client survey was for increased investment in education. Although it is clear that 
more information & communication technology (ICT) skills will be needed, 
significant differences currently exist in IT skills between countries, with the US and 
the UK lagging behind other countries on some measures. While many argue 
science, technology, engineering & math (STEM) skills are needed, intermediate 
level skills in STEM seem to be a riskier educational investment. Non-cognitive 
skills can be increasingly important, but malleability of these skills should not be 
assumed. These factors could complicate the ability of education to adapt to the 
pace and scope of technological change described above. 

With careers likely to be more disrupted than at any other point in the past, 
individuals should anticipate the need to retrain in the future. A talent mismatch 
already exists in many countries, with many well-educated workers finding 
employment in lower-skilled jobs. To combat this, greater coordination will be 
needed between the educational, training and employment sectors. 

One of the paths involving the least commitment for policy makers to adapt to 
accelerated technological change would be to look to shorter working weeks. This is 
starting to take place in some countries; for example Sweden is moving to a 
standard 6 hour week day with the aim of improving productivity. Annual hours 
worked per person have already fallen by 35% in France from 1950-2014 and by 
10% in the US. Leisure time in the US has increased by 6-8 hours per week 
between 1965-2003 for men and 4-8 hours for women. When we add in longer lives 
and retirements, cumulative lifetime leisure time has increased 26% from the 1930s. 
Could automation increase leisure time further whilst also maintaining a good 
standard of living for everyone? The risk is that this increased leisure time may only 
become a reality for the under-employed or unemployed.  

When we polled opinions on many of these issues in the third quarter of 2015, 85% 
of respondents felt automation posed a challenge to societies and policymakers, of 
which 64% said it was a major challenge. However, and encouragingly, 76% also 
said they were techno-optimists on the outlook for productivity and profits, with 
policy adapting to share increasing abundance. Only 21% were techno-pessimists 
on the outlook for growth, employment, inequality, and disruption of company profit 
pools. We agree with the optimists that the opportunities for increased innovation 
and productivity can be very beneficial, providing policy, education and workers can 
adapt to the challenges faced from accelerating technological change.

How Susceptible are Countries 
Worldwide? Jobs at Risk of 
Automation 
Highlights  

 Advances in technology are now making a broader range of non-routine tasks 
automatable, with computers mainly substituting for low-income low-skill workers 
over the next decades. 

 Building on Frey and Osborne's original work showing 47% of the US workforce 
is at risk of automation as a result of these trends, recent data from the World 
Bank suggests the risks are higher in many other countries. For example, their 
estimates suggest that the equivalent figures for China and India are 77% and 
69%, respectively. 

 Although there has been convergence in adoption lags of technology between 
rich and poor countries, divergence in long-run penetration rates once 
technologies have been adopted, explain divergent income patterns between the 
Western and non-Western world since the Industrial Revolution.  

 A growing concern of ‘premature industrialisation’ in emerging and developing 
countries could require new growth models and a need to upskill workforces.  

In the past, the comparative advantage of computers relative to human workers has 
been confined to routine rule-based activities that can easily be specified in 
computer code. Following recent advances in technology, however, a broader range 
of non-routine tasks are now equally automatable. The expanding scope of 
automation mainly relates to advances in Machine Learning technology, including 
Data Mining, Machine Vision, Computational Statistics and other sub-fields of 
Artificial Intelligence (AI), turning a wide range of knowledge work into well-defined 
problems. This is, in turn, made possible by the provision of relevant data. For 
example, companies such as Work Fusion sell software to automate non-routine 
tasks, previously performed by office workers. Specifically, the software divides the 
job into smaller tasks, automates the routine work and then recruits freelance 
workers through crowdsourcing platforms to perform the non-routine work. As the 
software monitors the workers it learns from them, meaning that over time it can 
automate more of the non-routine tasks. In other words, the freelance workers train 
the system to replace them. Similarly, a growing body of digitalised translated text 
allows sophisticated software, such as Google Translate, to benchmark and 
improve the performance of translation algorithms. In healthcare, IBM’s Watson 
computer now provides automated chronic care and cancer treatment diagnostics, 
drawing upon piles of data that a doctor would not be able to process, including 
information from more than 1.5 million patient records and clinical trials, as well as 2 
million pages of text from medical journals.  

Connected devices, advances in user interfaces, and cheaper and better sensors 
are all drivers of the big data revolution. For example, implantable monitors, such as 
pulmonary artery pressure measurement systems, enable significant reductions in 
heart failure hospitalisation. These devices rely upon sophisticated machine-to-
machine communication to spot and signal potential warning signs. Advances in 
speech recognition also allow computer-controlled technologies to respond directly 
to human actions and requests: SmartAction, a provider of call automation services 
is able to realise cost savings of 60 to 80 percent over a traditional call centre. Thus,

knowledge work than human workers. Although we do not know what the impact on 
labour markets of these developments will be, some estimates suggest that 
algorithms could displace around 140 million knowledge workers globally.6 

The big data provided by improved sensors also allow engineers to overcome a 
wide range of engineering bottlenecks that have hindered robotic development in 
the past. Three-dimensional maps of road networks, for example, have been a 
crucial enabler of autonomous vehicle navigation. This is not least illustrated by 
Google’s use of vast datasets for its driverless cars. Meanwhile, more advanced 
robots are gaining enhanced sensors and manipulators, allowing them to perform 
non-routine manual tasks. A well-known example is Baxter — a robot that requires 
no programming. Instead Baxter is able to memorise new working patterns as a 
human worker guides the robot arms through the motions needed to complete a 
task. Its physical flexibility is also enhanced by different attachments that can be 
installed on its arms, allowing Baxter to perform a much broader scope of work 
tasks.  

Similarly, surgical robots have become significantly more flexible and with a greater 
range of motion now perform more operations, while commercial service robots are 
now able to perform more complex tasks in elderly care, food preparation, and 
cleaning. In Japan, some hotels already use robots for check-in and to guide guests 
to their rooms. The robotic receptionist can also speak different languages 
depending on the preferences of the guest. Thus, in short, while sophisticated 
algorithms for big data can perform more knowledge work, the potential scope for 
the automation of physical labour is expanding in tandem. 

The Engineering Bottlenecks to Automation 
As the potential scope of automation is expanding, where will human workers still 
hold the comparative advantage? 

Importantly, the expanding scope of automation is not suggestive of the end of 
work, as has been proclaimed by several commentators and scholars. This is 
because despite significant advances in machine learning and mobile robotics, 
several engineering bottlenecks to automation remain. Specifically, Frey and 
Osborne identify three key bottlenecks: creative intelligence, social intelligence, as 
well as perception and manipulation. In this section, we briefly describe these 
bottlenecks, each in turn. 

Creative work, involving the development of novel ideas and artifacts — requiring 
the ability to achieve desired goals without explicit instruction — is difficult to 
automate by definition as computerisation usually requires some explicit instruction. 
To be sure, there are humanoid robots that can interpret music and make 
improvisations on the part of other performers, and drawing programs, such as 
AARON, have generated thousands of drawings being exhibited in galleries 
worldwide. Nevertheless, human workers still maintain the comparative advantage 
in creative work as replicating the kind of implicit reservoirs of knowledge and 
judgment drawn upon by human creators is extremely difficult, largely because we 
find it difficult to define creativity ourselves. Thus, although it is clearly possible to 
design an algorithm that can churn out an endless sequence of paintings, it is 
difficult to teach the algorithm to differentiate between the emotionally powerful and 
the rest.

The reason tasks requiring social intelligence are difficult to automate is largely 
similar: social intelligence requires a wealth of tacit knowledge, about social and 
cultural contexts, and thus involve a wider range of subtleties that are difficult to 
specify and often give rise to misinterpretations, even among humans. The state-of-
the-art of automation technology in the context of social interactions is best 
captured by Eugene Goostman, a software chatterbot, managing to convince a third 
of judges on a panel that it was human based on five minutes of text 
communication. Nevertheless, it did so by pretending to be a 13-year old boy using 
English as a second language. Thus, more challenging forms of social intelligence, 
including coordination, teaching, negotiation and mentoring, is today far from 
automatable. 

Which Skills Are Least Automatable? 

Technology is leading to increasing automation, but not all work skills are equally 
replaceable. In recent work (by Linda Perkio and Michael A Osborne), we make use 
of advanced machine learning techniques to highlight which job characteristics are 
most likely to be associated with that job being computerised. Our findings reinforce 
the conclusions found in the previous work of Frey & Osborne that originality and 
social intelligence are the most profound bottlenecks to automation. 

Our analysis is built on the 2010 edition of O⋆NET, a service developed for the US 
Department of Labor. O⋆NET provides a "standardised, measurable set of 
variables", comprising 277 quantitative descriptions of the skill requirements for 
each of 702 detailed occupations in the US. O⋆NET was originally collected by 
labour market analysts, but has been subsequently updated and revised with the 
use of surveys of both incumbent workers and experts, enabling it to reflect the 
changing nature of job tasks. We consider 67 of the 277 variables: we selected 
those that provide data for all or most occupations, and excluded other variables 
with much missing data. These variables capture a diverse range of different skills, 
and include examples that typify social and creative bottlenecks. We list the names 
and definitions of some pertinent example variables below. 

 Originality: "The ability to come up with unusual or clever ideas about a given 
topic or situation, or to develop creative ways to solve a problem." 

 Service Orientation: "Actively looking for ways to help people." 

 Manual Dexterity: "The ability to quickly move your hand, your hand together with 
your arm, or your two hands to grasp, manipulate, or assemble objects." 

 Gross Body Coordination: "The ability to coordinate the movement of your arms, 
legs, and torso together when the whole body is in motion." 

Each variable gives, for each occupation, an integer between 0 and 100, which 
quantifies the level at which a certain skill or ability is required. For example, for the 
attribute Manual Dexterity, a low level corresponds to "Screw a light bulb into a light 
socket"; medium level is exemplified by "Pack oranges in crates as quickly as 
possible"; high level is described as "Perform open-heart surgery with surgical 
instruments". 

To make the link to automatability, Frey and Osborne (2013) identified a training set 
of 70 occupations using these O⋆NET variables, along with O⋆NET's open-ended 
descriptions of the tasks performed by each occupation. This training set described 
the occupations that were most emblematically either automatable (e.g. Data Entry 
Keyers) or non-automatable (e.g. Clergy). Specifically, occupations were chosen for 
which the question: "Can the tasks of this job be sufficiently specified, conditional on

the availability of big data, to be performed by state of the art computer-controlled 
equipment?" could be most confidently answered. 

We next proceeded to use a probabilistic classification algorithm to learn the 
relationships between the labels of automatability and the O⋆NET variables. We 
additionally performed feature selection to choose the variables that were most 
informative in predicting the labels. Those labels that were chosen can be thought 
of as those that are most strongly correlated with automatability: high scores on 
these variables are likely to render an occupation secure from automation. Crucially, 
a variable's significance cannot be assessed in isolation: even if poor individually, it 
may contribute in conjunction with another. For example, it is clear that while Gross 
Body Coordination is relatively uninformative on its own, it can substantially assist 
classification if Originality is also available. For this reason, we used a non-linear 
classifier that is able to benefit from these correlations. Multiple methods of 
classification and feature selection were trialled: our confidence in our conclusions 
is reinforced by the consistency in their results. 

Firstly, Originality was by some way the most important individual feature. This 
supports the argument that human creativity is the most difficult human faculty to 
automate. It is certainly possible to design an algorithm that can churn out an 
endless sequence of paintings, but it is still difficult to teach such an algorithm the 
difference between the emotionally powerful and the dreck. In a study with UK 
charity Nesta, Frey and Osborne (2014) found, for both the UK and the US, that 
almost 90% of creative jobs are at low or no risk of automation. 

Secondly, the best pair of variables was the combination of Originality with Service 
Orientation. Recall that we listed social intelligence as the second bottleneck to 
automation. Social intelligence is such a bottleneck because subtle interactions with 
other people, such as the anticipation of others' needs that Service Orientation 
embodies, draw upon implicit reservoirs of knowledge and judgement that are 
difficult to represent explicitly in code. Our conclusion is hence that a job is 
particularly well-insulated from automation if it combines high originality with a high 
requirement for active interaction with other people. 

The challenge of automating tasks requiring perception and manipulation skills can 
more fully be described as the challenge of perceiving and interacting with 
unstructured physical environments. Consider, for example, the task of cleaning a 
home, and associated sub-tasks such as the identification of dirty objects. 
Understanding that a plant pot containing a plant is not dirty, while similar dirt on a 
floor needs to be cleaned is intuitive to most humans, but difficult to grasp for a 
robot. In addition to the challenge of perceiving and distinguishing between various 
objects, a generalist robot that is able to manipulate all sorts of irregular objects 
contained in a home is difficult. For example, manipulating an object with some 
understanding of its material characteristics, to make sure that it is not damaged in 
the process, requires a deep understanding which is difficult to reproduce within 
software. Thus, in time-varying, heterogeneous environments, the tacit knowledge 
and pliable hands possessed by humans are likely to remain superior to robotic 
labour for some time.

Impacts on the US Labour Market 
So how significant will these developments be in terms of their employment impact? 
According to research by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, 47 percent of 
the US workforce is at risk of automation as a result of these trends.7 This does not 
necessarily imply that all of these jobs in fact will be automated. A job is considered 
to be “exposed to automation” or “automatable” if the tasks it entails allows the work 
to be performed by a computer, even if a job is not actually automated. Although 
many cashiers have been displaced by self-service technology, for example, there 
are still more than 3 million cashiers in employment in the United States.  

A wide range of jobs are exposed to recent trends in technology. Jobs in 
transportation, logistics, as well as office and administrative support, are among the 
most susceptible. As autonomous vehicles are already being developed and 
augmenting cars with advanced sensors is becoming more cost-effective, this 
prediction is seemingly accurate. Algorithms for big data are similarly already 
capable of displacing human workers in most tasks that involve the storing or 
processing of information, making a substantial share of office and administrative 
support jobs automatable.  

In the light of the recent expansion of jobs in non-tradable services, however, the 
most interesting finding is perhaps that many service occupations, where the most 
job growth has occurred over the past decades, are now susceptible to 
computerisation. Yet there is already some evidence that this trend is underway. 
According to some estimates, the market for personal and household service robots 
is now experiencing annual growth rates of around 20 percent.8 As machines will 
get better at performing tasks involving mobility and dexterity over time, the pace of 
displacement in service occupations is likely to increase even further. 

Nevertheless, around 33% of US employment remains at low risk of automation, 
while another 19% is categorised at medium risk. Jobs at the low risk of automation 
consist of generalist occupations requiring knowledge of human heuristics, and 
occupations involving the development of novel ideas and artifacts. In other words, 
the common denominator for low risk jobs is that they are intensive in social and 
creative skills. Most management, business, and finance occupations, which are 
intensive in work requiring social skills, are largely confined to the low-risk category. 
This is also true of most occupations in arts and media, as well as jobs in education 
and healthcare. The low susceptibility of engineering and science occupations to 
computerisation, on the other hand, is largely due to the high degree of creativity 
skills they require. Finally, while there is plenty of anecdotal evidence about 
knowledge work becoming increasingly automated, low- skilled jobs are the ones 
that are most susceptible to automation. In other words, Frey and Osborne predict a 
shift from the computerisation of middle-income jobs to computers mainly 
substituting for low-income, low-skill workers over the next decades. 

Developing Countries at Risk 
As emerging technologies increasingly substitute for low-skilled workers, what are 
the impacts on developing economies likely to be?

Throughout the 20th century, the adoption of new technology has been an essential 
component of countries development strategies. The way the Industrial Revolution 
provided the foundation of sustained growth in the West, industrialisation has 
permitted a number of emerging economies to catch up, including Singapore, South 
Korea and Taiwan. These remarkable growth stories were achieved by shifting 
workers from labour-intensive production to more capital-intensive products such as 
motor vehicles, and more recently to human capital-intensive activities such as 
information and communication technology. China has similarly managed the 
transition to capital-intensive products, and with a per capita income of about 
$8,280, it has now become a middle-income country. Sometimes this phase is 
referred to as a middle-income trap, as history suggests that countries entering the 
middle-income bracket often come to experience stagnant growth. 

The Great Divergence 
Despite a number of non-Western economies having successfully managed the 
industrialisation process, income inequalities across the globe have grown 
significantly since the Industrial Revolution. In 1820, incomes in Western countries 
were 1.9 times the average of incomes in the non-Western world.9 Over the course 
of the next 180 years, the West experienced a “Great Divergence” from the rest: by 
2000, their per capita income was 7.2 times the average of non-Western countries. 
One of the main reasons for this divergence is that while emerging economies have 
become better at adopting new technologies, they are getting worse at putting them 
into widespread use. For example, in a recent study, Diego Comin and Martí 
Mestieri Ferrer asked the question: if technology has arrived everywhere, why has 
income diverged? Doing so, they show that lags in technology adoption across 
countries have declined significantly over the past two centuries, and this decline 
has recently accelerated: while it took 131 years for steam and motor ships to reach 
Indonesia, after their initial adoption in Britain, it took 11 years for the computer to 
diffuse from the United States to Vietnam. By contrast, however, the degree to 
which new technologies diffuse across the population after their initial adoption has 
widened over the same period. Thus, in short, although there has been 
convergence in adoption lags between rich and poor countries, there has also been 
divergence in long-run penetration rates once technologies are adopted, explaining 
divergent income patterns since the Industrial Revolution: the divergence in 
penetration rates can account for 82 percent of the increase in the income gap 
since 1820.10  

‘Premature Deindustrialisation’ 
Although a number of Asian economies have managed to catch up over recent 
decades, the developing world as a whole has shown little sign of closing the 
income gap. One exception, however, is in manufacturing industries, which have 
experienced unconditional convergence in labour productivity across countries.11 
Because manufacturing companies produce goods that are traded on international 
markets, and thus operate under constant competitive threat from abroad, these 
firms constantly need to improve production processes to remain competitive. 
Furthermore, since manufacturing processes are not subject to external conditions, 
such as soil and weather, in the same way as agriculture, they are easier to 
standardise and automate, and therefore more similar across geographies.

As a result, manufacturing is becoming less labour-intensive in the emerging and 
developing world also, contributing to a growing concern over “premature 
deindustrialisation.” For example, a recent study by Dani Rodrik has persuasively 
shown that over the course of the 20th century, peak manufacturing employment 
has declined among emerging economies.12 Manufacturing employment in the 
United Kingdom, for example, peaked at 45% of total employment just before World 
War I. Today’s emerging economies, in contrast, including Brazil and India, have 
already seen manufacturing employment peak at no more than 15% (See Figure 1). 
Furthermore, in Africa, a recent report by the UN’s Economic Commission for Africa 
(UNECA) estimates that between 1980 and 2013 the manufacturing sector’s 
contribution to total economic activity on the continent declined from 12% to 11%. In 
most of sub-Saharan Africa, the manufacturing share of output has persistently 
declined over the past 25 years. The share of jobs in manufacturing is even smaller: 
just over 6% of all jobs. This figure barely changed over the course of the three 
decades leading up to 2008, while manufacturing employment in Asia grew from 
11% to 16% over the same period.

The reason for this is that manufacturing processes, also in low- and middle-income 
countries, are more automated today than in the past. A recent report by Citi and the 
Oxford Martin School shows that China, has already replaced the US as the largest 
market for industrial automation. This is indeed part of the country’s development 
strategy: in China’s 12th Five Year Plan, workforce automation recently emerged as 
a strategic area, seen as essential to maintain the country’s competitiveness in 
manufacturing, and potentially prevent production from shifting to low-income 
destinations where labour is cheaper.  

Some emerging economies have, however, also experienced declines in 
manufacturing output which cannot be explained by production processes being 
increasingly automated. Rodrik (2015) thus argues that globalisation provides an 
alternative, albeit complementary, explanation for countries experiencing premature

deindustrialisation: as countries with a comparative disadvantage in manufacturing 
become exposed to international trade they start to import deindustrialisation. 
Crucially, while many 20th century technologies, including the telephone, the 
container ship, and the computer, contributed to the surge in international trade by 
allowing companies to shift production to locations with an abundance of cheap 
labour, recent developments in robotics and additive manufacturing now allow firms 
in advanced economies to locate production closer to domestic markets in 
automated factories. For example, despite a secular decline in its share of 
manufacturing employment, the US manufacturing output share has remained 
roughly constant. In other words, although the US has not produced many new jobs 
in production, as computer technologies provide an increasingly cheap substitute for 
workers, it remains a competitive manufacturing location. Even in middle-income 
countries, such as China, industrial automation provides an increasingly cheap 
substitute for labour. Recent estimates by Citi Research shows the payback period 
for industrial robots in China is now less than two years. (This is discussed in more 
detail in the chapter on barriers to automation.)  

In the light of these technological developments, industrialisation is likely to yield 
substantially less manufacturing employment in the next generation of emerging 
economies than in the countries preceding them. Hence, it will be increasingly 
difficult for African and South American manufacturing firms to create jobs in the 
same numbers that Asian companies have done. In other words, today’s low-
income countries will not have the same possibility of achieving rapid growth by 
shifting workers from farms to higher-paying factory jobs.  

In the absence of export-led manufacturing growth as a path to prosperity, 
developing countries will need to search for new growth models. Service-led growth 
constitutes one option, but many low-skill services are now becoming equally 
automatable. Building on the work of Frey and Osborne, a recent World Bank 
Report shows that developing countries are highly susceptible to the expanding 
scope of automation, even relative to advanced economies where labour costs are 
high. As shown in Figure 2, the susceptibility to automation across the developing 
world ranges from 55% in Uzbekistan, to 85% in Ethiopia, with a substantial share 
of the workforce being at high risk of automation in countries such as China and 
India (77 percent and 69 percent, respectively). These figures, in turn, can be 
compared to the OECD average, which the World Bank estimates at 57 percent. 
Furthermore, countries with a higher share of their workforce “at risk” typically 
exhibit lower levels of GDP per capita, as highlighted by Figure 3. Thus, there are 
reasons to be concerned about the future of income convergence, as low-income 
countries are relatively vulnerable to automation.  

Due to an increase in automation in 
manufacturing, low income countries will not 
achieve rapid growth by shifting workers 
from agriculture to factory jobs

A crucial reason why developing countries are more susceptible to automation 
relative to high-income countries however is that while many jobs are “automatable” 
in the developing world, automating them is not yet economically feasible due to the 
abundance of cheap labour. As shown by a number of studies, labour-saving 
inventions may only be adopted if the access to cheap labour is scarce or prices of 
capital are relatively high.13 For example, case study evidence suggests that 
mechanisation in 18th century cotton production initially only occurred in Britain 
because wage levels were much higher relative to prices of capital than in other 
countries.14 In addition, recent empirical research reveals a causal relationship 
between the access to cheap labour and mechanisation in agricultural production, in 
terms of sustained economic transition towards increased mechanisation in areas 
characterised by low-wage worker out-migration. 

Thus, in essence, while the potential labour market disruption associated with the 
expanding scope of automation is likely to affect the developing world later than 
advanced economies, it may be potentially more disruptive in countries with little 
consumer demand and limited social safety nets. Developing countries would thus 
do well to plan ahead of such an event. This means investing more in education and 
boosting domestic demand. Because skilled jobs are substantially less susceptible 
to automation, the best hope for developing and emerging economies alike is to 
upskill their workforce. That has indeed also been the lesson from regional 
development patterns in advanced economies. For example, while Ford and 
General Motors have some of the most advanced production facilities in the world, 
the city of Detroit has failed to create employment opportunities in new occupations 
and industries. By contrast, the cities that have successfully managed the renewal 
process, including New York, Boston and San Francisco, have done so by 
educating and attracting pools of talent. We examine the implications of the 
expanding scope of automation for regional development in a later chapter but first 
we look at how automation is changing the trend of offshoring to low cost regions.

Does Automation Change the Trend 
of Offshoring to Low Cost Regions?  
Highlights  

 After a period of Global Value Chain proliferation, there are clear signs that the 
pace of goods production fragmentation across borders is slowing.  

 Seventy percent of clients surveyed believe automation and the developments in 
3D printing will encourage companies to move their manufacturing closer to 
home. North America is seen as having the most to gain from this trend, while 
China has the most to lose.  

 As technology advances, emerging market (EM) countries need to diversify and 
find ways to move up the value-added chain to stay competitive. They must also 
boost service productivity growth. 

ICT Revolution and ‘Second Unbundling’ in Global Value 
Chains 
The scope and nature of globalisation have changed dramatically over human 
history. The first major wave of globalisation starting in the latter half of the 19th 
century was triggered by significant reduction in transportation costs (steam engine, 
railroads, ‘industrial revolution’), which facilitated the geographic separation 
between where goods are produced and where they are consumed, alongside the 
transfer of ideas. Further technological advancements in transport in the last 
century, including containerisation and air cargo, plus the entry of major economies 
like China and India into the global trading system, allowed this process to 
accelerate. This is what Baldwin (2006) calls the ‘first unbundling’.15  

However, a second and different type of ‘unbundling’ (overlapping with the 
first one) took place in recent decades with the ICT revolution that helped 
pave the way for proliferation of Global Value Chains (GVC), or the 
fragmentation of production across borders. Rapidly declining cost and increased 
power of computing and advances in communication technology have made it 
increasingly economical to unbundle various tasks depending on comparative 
advantages, with much improved ability to coordinate and monitor production 
across large distances. Goods production became increasingly fragmented into 
stages spread out across borders — but beyond this, even the ability to offshore 
services has risen rapidly over the last two decades. Global value chain linkages 
can be decomposed into two types: (1) ‘backward linkages’, wherein domestic firms 
use foreign intermediate value added as inputs for its exports; and,(2) ‘forward 
linkages’, wherein a country’s exports are inputs to other countries’ exports, the sum 
of which we use as a measure of GVC participation rate, shown on Figure 4.

GVC trade expanded significantly since the 1990s and we think advancing 
technology, plus trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) liberalisation and 
improved logistics infrastructure, facilitated this. Supply chain fragmentation will 
mean goods will cross borders many times to undergo various phases of 
‘processing’ until they reach their final destination. This helps explain why, in 
previous decades, (goods) trade elasticity was very high relative to income. East 
Asia as well as parts of Europe were very active in the global supply chain, as can 
be seen by their relatively high and rapidly increasing GVC participation rates from 
1995 to 2005 (Figure 4). We believe such trade engagement was a significant driver 
of productivity-driven growth, generating technology/knowledge transfer, 
employment and higher incomes in East Asia.   

However, there are now clear signs that the pace of goods production 
fragmentation across borders is slowing, a trend even preceding the Great 
Financial Crisis (GFC). We view this as an important structural factor compounded 
by cyclical weakness that explains why global trade growth has been so subdued 
relative to GDP growth. Constantinescu et al. (2015) estimate that the elasticity of 
trade to income in the 2000s halved relative to the 1990s.16 We think China is at the 
forefront of this dynamic, given that more of its supply chain is shifting domestically 
as seen by the declining share of processing trade to global trade (Figure 5). 
China's growing market size, technology upgrading, and more recently, significant 
excess capacity in many upstream industries, has enabled it to source more of its 
intermediate inputs onshore (i.e. 'backward linkages' has fallen more over the years 
and likely continues to do so; see Figure 6).

Thus, even if we see some global cyclical recovery, world trade growth may 
remain more subdued than previously. We look closely at how domestic value 
added (DVA) in 'manufactured goods' exports (to remove distortions from the 
commodities trade) have evolved in Figure 11. Unfortunately, data are released with 
a significant lag.17 In the last several years, DVA of manufactured goods exports 
have grown in China, the Philippines, Singapore, and Malaysia. For parts of 
industrialised Asia (KR, TW, JP), sadly even for mid-income Thailand, and parts of 
EM (Turkey), they are not only losing goods export market share (except for Korea) 
but also face diminishing DVA, which could be signs of growing competitiveness 
challenges.

We think it is also important to distinguish the supply chain dynamics of trade 
in goods vs. trade in services. While demand for goods and services should be 
correlated, we find that services trade growth has diverged relative to goods trade in 
some areas over the last few years (Figure 10). Perhaps the digital world may have 
shifted the trade in value added from physical to virtual goods over time, which may 
to a degree explain the weakness in goods trade. Or perhaps productivity gains 
from GVC trade in services has not yet reached its peak the way it has for goods, 
and improving technology plus growing efficiencies from 'economies of scale' 
remain conducive to further service offshoring. We think this will continue to benefit 
more the populous low-income English-speaking economies (notably India and 
Philippines), which look relatively competitive (Figure 9).

These rankings would also suggest China, Malaysia, and Vietnam could also 
benefit but, on net service trade balance of what we believe to be the more 
technology-induced tradable services — ICT and ‘Other Business Services’ — only 
the Philippines, India, Taiwan (though small relative to its weak goods trade), some 
Eastern European countries and marginally China (small relative to its GDP) seem 
to be making inroads (Figure 11). Meanwhile, Japan, Korea and others in ASEAN 
(except we have no data to validate Vietnam) look increasingly uncompetitive.

While the value of service trade is much smaller than goods trade for EM Asia, 
accounting for only an average of ~ 25% of its annual nominal value (China and 
Indonesia being low at 17% of goods trade, and the Philippines and India being high 
at 45% and 37% of goods trade, respectively), the domestic value added is so 
much higher in services (Figure 12) – averaging 82% versus 65% for 
manufactured goods. Thus, we should not underestimate the spillover impact of 
tradable services on the domestic economy and, among other things, this helps 
explain why India and Philippines growth have outperformed the region. Meanwhile, 
with relatively weak goods trade performance on top of already-weak services 
sector productivity and competitiveness, the growth prognosis remains more 
challenging for industrialised Asia, especially Singapore and Korea where services 
productivity growth is low,18 and even Thailand seems to have limited dynamism in 
services trade outside of tourism. 

Industrial Robotics Revolution – Conducive to ‘Re-
bundling’? 
Beyond advances in ICT, we think significant advances in the use of automation and 
industrial robotics to aid manufacturing processes in recent years will also have a 
significant impact on global supply chains. The use of robotics is at least a four-
decade phenomenon, but the process appears to have accelerated since the global 
financial crisis, seeing average robot sales rise on a compound average growth rate 
(CAGR) of 17% per year in 2010-14 (in fact, up almost 29% year-over-year in 2014 
alone!) versus only average CAGR 3% per year in 2004-08. This comes even while 
global growth, especially industrial production growth, had actually decelerated in 
recent years versus the pre-GFC period (Figure 13). We think there are three main

drivers of this record acceleration of robotic use. First, rapid wage gains (plus aging 
populations) in large manufacturing-producing countries – especially China – have 
induced demand for automation.19 Second, the prices of hardware and ‘enabling’ 
software have declined markedly, making it an increasingly attractive investment; 
and third, technological advances (everything from vision sensors, gripping 
systems, etc.) have increased the scope and usability of robotics, not only making 
robots smarter, safer and more applicable across a broader range of processes, but 
also delivering more consistent and better product quality. Thus, even relatively low-
wage countries, India and Indonesia, for example, have seen brisk robotic sales.

Nonetheless, not all industries can benefit equally from the developments of 
robotics. International Federation of Robotics (IFR) data shows that robotic usage 
is highly concentrated in three major industry groupings (all under SITC code 
7) — vehicles & transportation equipment, electronics & electrical equipment, and 
machinery (Figure 16). Interestingly, these are also the same industries that 
historically had been very susceptible to production fragmentation via GVC 
given the complexity of products and processes involved. Thus, rapid growth 
of automation/robotics will likely have significant implication on GVC trade in the 
future, on top of ability of other countries to benefit from participating in this GVC.

Given that robotics are historically expensive and more efficient when used at a 
large scale, robotic installations are very geographically concentrated — about 75% 
of industrial robots globally go to five countries — China, Germany, Japan, Korea, 
and the US. China is, by far, the fastest growing market (Figure 17) and its still 
relatively low robot density relative to peers leaves significant room for future growth 
(Figure 15). 

According to Boston Consulting Group projections, at least 85% of the production 
tasks in these robotic-intensive industries (under SITC code 7) can be automated. 
With wages in these industries also higher than the average for manufacturing given 
its higher skill requirements, they are ripe for continued automation over time. The 
impact on relative cost saving from automation is expected to be higher among 
those with relatively high labour costs to begin with. For example, BCG estimates 
that, as robotics systems cost around $10-$20 per hour, on average, to own and 
operate in the US in these sectors — already lower than US manufacturing wages 
— and are projected to decline further such that, in ten years, robots are estimated 
to eventually perform about 40-45% of production tasks versus <10% today. 20 The 
top suppliers for industrial robotics who can benefit from this growth are 
concentrated in developed markets — Japan (Yaskawa, Fanuc and Kawasaki), 
Germany (Kuka) and Switzerland (ABB) — though there are new entrants from 
China with government also backing the industry through its "Made in 2025" 
program, though for now, China is still, technology-wise, lagging significantly 
behind. 21

We can tangentially analyse this by looking at the export market share of the most 
robot-intensive industry, Road Vehicles & Transport Equipment — Germany 
continues to dominate, but even the US (alongside Mexico) is gaining ground 
(Figure 18). In the electronics/ electrical equipment industry where there are likely to 
be more diverse tasks (in some cases, dealing with very small components that can 
still be more cheaply handled by hand), East Asia continues to do well but, 
interestingly, production is increasingly concentrated in a few countries, notably 
China but, more recently, we see a catch-up in Vietnam (Figure 19).  

Scope for automation and industrial robotics will likely significantly alter 
manufacturing competitiveness, and we think could lead to some ‘rebundling’ or 
‘reshoring’ of some manufacturing supply chains in critical geographical hubs. Will 
automation and developments in 3D printing encourage companies to move their 
manufacturing closer to home? In a survey of 238 Citi institutional clients, 70% 
believe that this would actually happen with 20% believing it would be to a 
significant degree and 52% responding it would be to a minor degree (see Figure 20 
below).

If this is the case, then which countries/regions would have the most to gain or lose 
from automation? 22% of survey respondents stated that North America has the 
most to gain from automation, followed by Europe (17%) and Japan (16%). On the 
other hand the majority of the respondents stated that China (24% of replies), 
ASEAN (18%), and LatAm (15%) have the most to lose from automation (see 
Figure 21).

How is Global Competitiveness Going to Evolve with 
Greater Automation? 
Based on pace of robotic adoption (high in parts of East Asia and the Czech 
Republic, slower in Brazil and even higher wage economies like Australia or Spain) 
relative to trends in wage costs (low wage countries like Indonesia and India will see 
less impact on reducing costs), BCG estimates that manufacturing cost 
competitiveness by 2025 from robotics could tilt in favour of the existing industrial 
powerhouses. Sirkin et al (2015)22 estimate that Korea, Germany, China, Japan, 
and US are expected to be in a stronger position via larger cost competitiveness 
gains in the coming decade from the use of robotics, while select EM countries 
including Indonesia, India, and Mexico will be less so. EM economies could more 
than compensate for any robotic cost disadvantage via other means, such as 
improved logistics infrastructure. Nonetheless, depending on the speed at which 
robotic technology progresses, what may look like a small impact now could 
snowball to larger cost competitiveness shifts over time, and could disadvantage 
EM economies that do not keep up from a manufacturing cost-competitiveness 
standpoint.

Financial and technological hurdles for robotic/automation adoption are expected to 
decline over time, and more sectors could enter a “turning point” wherein adoption 
could accelerate in nonlinear ways. For now, a lot of the scope for automation and 
robotic use is relatively more limited in other industries and services, especially in 
EM where labour costs are still low and humans are still the most cost-efficient 
means for assembly. In the case of robots used for services, annual sales are only 
about 11% of those used for industry, according to the International Federation of 
Robotics, the bulk of which – 45% of total –are used in defence applications (e.g. 
drones). Nonetheless, with the rapid developments in big data analytics, advances 
in artificial intelligence and autonomous machines (e.g. self-driving cars, self-service 
kiosks), the scope for labour displacement would grow such that even many 
‘outsourced’ labour intensive-professional services, like data entry and medical 
transcription, could become increasingly automated. Thus, Asia needs to continue 
to find ways to move up the value-added chain to stay competitive, not just with 
other EM economies, but with advanced economies that may be increasingly 
equipped with technology. 

China seems to be following in the footsteps of other industrialised Asian economies 
in terms of spending more on R&D to upgrade technology, and we think they are in 
a relatively strong position to catch up in manufacturing from more advanced peers. 
A recent report from Citi Strategy highlighted that China’s R&D expenditure ranks 
globally at No.2, and R&D as a % of GDP has jumped fourfold in 20 years to 
2.1%.23 However, in a world where labour-substituting technology continues to 
expand, this means employment among EM economies, as in developed markets 
(DM), will remain highly skewed to the services sector, which may be less 
productive and, in the EM context, mired in informality and small-scale enterprises. 
The extent to which countries can boost service productivity growth comparable to 
manufacturing will be important and will depend on the ability to upgrade skills, 
provide a conducive regulatory environment, harness technology and tap into widely 
disseminated ‘global knowledge’ to catch up with the frontier. This is easier said 
than done. We next look at the susceptibility of automation within countries, 
focusing on US cities.

How Does Susceptibility Vary Within 
Countries? Cities at Risk  
Highlights  

 Historically, new technologies have not only transformed companies and 
industries, but cities and regions. The expanding scope of automation to low end 
service jobs may shift the fortunes of US cities once more, affecting a different 
set of cities than those impacted by offshoring.  

 Recent work by Berger, Frey and Osborne suggests major US cities exposure to 
future automation ranges from 54% in Fresno to 38% in Boston.  

 New jobs have emerged in locations different from the ones where old jobs are 
likely to disappear, potentially exacerbating income disparities between US cities.  

Why Have Some Cities and Regions Been Better Able to Adapt to the 
Arrival of New Computer Technologies than Others?  

Historically, new technologies have significantly transformed companies and 
industries. For example, Clayton Christensen has shown in some detail how 
disruptive technologies have reshaped a wide range of industries, from computer 
hardware to retail, causing leading companies to fail in the process.24 Notably, out 
of the 17 companies populating the disk drive industry in 1976, only IBM’s disk drive 
business had not failed or been acquired by 1995. Rapid technological progress 
had even caused the demise of relatively large, diversified corporations such as 
Ampex, Control Data, Diablo, EMM, and Memorex. Similarly, by the turn of the 20th 
century, rail transport and the mail order catalogue fundamentally changed the 
retailing business, making it possible for companies like Sears Roebuck to compete 
in local markets across the United States. Following this disruption, Sears was 
regarded as the leading retailing corporation in the world for decades. Yet, the 
emergence of the online retail market changed the nature of the retailing business 
once more, causing Sears to lose market share as they lagged behind more 
adaptive companies such as Amazon.  

Such technological upheaval can sometimes shift the fortunes of entire cities, 
causing some to prosper and others to decay. For example in 1879, when George 
Eastman invented the emulsion-coating machine in Rochester, New York City was 
the centre of the photographic industry. The Eastman Kodak company soon took 
over the market for photographic film and Rochester replaced New York as the 
leading city in film production. In the 1960s, Kodak was still the largest employer in 
Rochester with over 60,000 employees. Yet, as with many other companies, Kodak 
did not manage the transition to digital photography. When the company finally shut 
down its largest research and production facility in Rochester, known as Kodak 
Park, the population of Rochester had not just witnessed the decline of an industrial 
giant, but the decline of an entire city. As Kodak's workforce dropped by almost 80 
percent between 1993 and 2006, Rochester rapidly lost population. Similarly, the 
arrival of steel mini mills did not only result in a restructuring of the steel industry, 
but significantly contributed to the decline of leading steel cities, such as Pittsburgh 
and Youngstown.25 In other words, cities that have remained locked into old jobs,

that are gradually made redundant by a new technology, have eventually become 
subject to urban decline.  

The Computer Revolution and the Shifting Fortunes of US 
Cities 
The Computer Revolution has perhaps shifted the fortunes of US cities even more 
significantly than technologies of the past. Indeed, although computers have arrived 
everywhere, US cities have fared very differently over recent decades — while 
some cities have experienced rapid growth, others have virtually disappeared. In a 
recent study, Thor Berger and Carl Benedikt Frey show how the arrival of the 
personal computer (PC) in the early 1980s changed the types of jobs that were 
created in the US labour market, in turn leading to a shift in the fortunes of US 
cities. Throughout the 1970s, when technological change mainly created routine 
jobs, human capital abundant cities had a comparative disadvantage in new job 
creation, as these jobs mainly emerged in routine task-intensive industries — jobs 
that have since been automated away. By contrast, since the Computer Revolution 
of the 1980s, cities specialised in cognitive work, gained a comparative advantage 
in new job creation that has persisted since, mirroring trends in population and 
wage growth across cities over the same period. 

Thus, in tandem with the US labour market experiencing a secular decline in jobs 
intensive in routine tasks, which can easily be expressed in computer code and 
readily automated, cities have adjusted differently to the Computer Revolution of the 
1980s. While places historically specialised in routine work have adopted computers 
to substitute for labour, human capital abundant cities that have a comparative 
advantage in using skill-intensive computer technologies have created new types of 
jobs. This is indeed also consistent with popular perceptions of urban success and 
decline in the US, emphasising the relative decline of old manufacturing cities such 
as Buffalo, Cleveland or Detroit — cities that all historically specialised in routine 
work. At the heart of the decline of these cities was their failure to create new 
employment opportunities as old ones were being eroded. Having nearly filed for 
bankruptcy in 1975, New York has become a primary example of how to adapt to 
technological change. While average wages in Detroit were slightly higher than in 
New York in 1977, they are now less than 60 percent of average New York 
incomes.26 At a time when Detroit successfully adopted computers and industrial 
robots to substitute for labour, New York adapted by creating new employment 
opportunities in professional services, computer programming and software 
engineering.  

Emerging Technologies and their Impacts on Cities 
The expanding scope of automation may shift the fortunes of US cities once more. 
Recent developments in Data Mining, Machine Vision, Computational Statistics and 
other sub-fields of AI, are widely being regarded as the beginning of a ‘Second 
Machine Age’. In a recent study, Thor Berger, Carl Benedikt Frey, and Michael 
Osborne, analysed how these technologies may impact on US cities, relative to 
computer technologies of the past. Importantly, they find that cities with a low 
exposure to the automation of routine work will for the first time find a significant 
share of their workforce exposed to computerisation. The potential impact of future 
automation is also distinct from the labour market impacts of globalisation, 
suggested by the fact that there is no significant overlap with the susceptibility of

cities to offshoring. In other words, workforce automation in the 21st century will 
potentially affect a different set of cities than the ones that have historically seen 
workers made redundant by computerisation and offshoring.  

The exposure of US cities to future automation ranges from 54% in Fresno, to 38% 
percent in Boston (see Figure 24). Notably, the cities with the highest share of their 
workforce exposed to automation (with the exception of Grand Rapids), do not 
include any Rust Belt manufacturing cities, such as Buffalo, Cleveland, and Detroit. 
Instead, some of the cities most at risk, include places in the Sun Belt that have 
recently faded: both Fresno and Las Vegas suffered some of the steepest drops in 
housing prices during the Great Financial Crisis, becoming plentiful in empty homes 
and office buildings. The cities that are least susceptible to automation, in contrast, 
include well-known examples of skilled cities, such as Boston, New York, San 
Francisco and Washington D.C.

Toms River is the largest of many towns that people commute between.  

 
Explaining the Exposure of Cities to Automation 
The variation in the exposure of cities to the expanding scope of automation can at 
least partly be explained by industry specialisation patterns. In general, more 
specialised cities have a larger share of jobs at ‘high risk’ of automation, while 
diversified cities are more resilient to the expanding scope of automation. In other 
words, industrial diversification can make cities more resilient to negative demand 
shocks in any specific industry.

The type of industries cities have specialised in also matter. For example, cities 
specialised in manufacturing continue to be relatively exposed to automation, and 
without efforts to create new industries, manufacturing cities are likely to experience 
continued decline. In addition, cities specialised in service jobs are now, for the first 
time, exposed to automation. This contrasts with the experience of the past 
decades, when most US job growth occurred in service occupations.27 Cities that 
remain relatively safe from automation are the ones that have specialised in 
relatively skilled industries, including information, finance, insurance & real estate 
(FIRE), education, and professional services, or creative industries, such as the 
arts.

The research by Berger, Frey, and Osborne further suggests that the best way 
forward for cities looking to reduce their exposure to automation is to boost their 
technological dynamism and attract more skilled workers. The cities that are least 
exposed to automation have been substantially more innovative in terms of patent 
output, have created more new businesses and managed to shift their workforce 
into new and emerging industries, over the past decade. Examples of such 
industries include video and audio streaming, online auctions and web design. 
Because technological change has recently been skill-biased, attracting skilled 
workers is also increasingly crucial. As shown by Berger and Frey, new industries 
that emerged throughout the 2000s are substantially more skill-intensive than other 
industries. Furthermore, workers in industries that experienced rapid technological 
change earn much higher wages: the average wage for workers in new industries is 
more than twice the US median wage. In other words, initially skilled cities have 
created even more jobs for skilled workers.  

Crucially, these new industries have mainly appeared in urban locations. In 
particular, cities that were already dense in college-educated workers experienced 
substantially more additions of new industries (Figure 27). It is also noteworthy that 
many cities with high fractions of new industries are well-known for their 
specialisation in information technology. The highest employment shares in new 
industries, for example, are exhibited by San Jose and Santa Fe, incorporating 
Silicon Valley and the Info Mesa cluster respectively. Other cities where new 
industries are prominent include Washington, D.C. and San Francisco, where 
Instagram, Dropbox, Uber, Internet Archive and Twitter are all located or began.

The Great Divergence of US Cities 
In tandem with the polarisation of labour markets, prosperity has already 
become increasingly unevenly distributed across locations within the United 
States. According to Enrico Moretti the Great Divergence of cities in the 
United States has its origins in the 1980s, when skills started to dictate the 
fortunes of US cities. Thor Berger and Carl Benedikt Frey further show that 
this tendency is intimately associated with the Computer Revolution of the 
1980s, as new computer-related jobs overwhelmingly concentrated to 
initially human capital abundant cities. Over the forthcoming decades this 
trend is likely to continue. As shown by Thor Berger, Carl Benedikt Frey, 
and Michael Osborne, over the course of the 2000s, new jobs have 
emerged in places that are relatively safe from automation, while cities with 
a larger share of their workforce exposed to the expanding scope of 
automation have failed to create new jobs. 

The expanding scope of automation is likely to further exacerbate income disparities 
between US cities. Cities that exhibited both higher average levels of income in 
2000 as well as the average income growth between 2000 and 2010, are less 
exposed to recent trends in automation. Thus, cities with higher incomes, and the 
ones experiencing more rapid income growth, have fewer jobs that are amenable to 
automation. Similarly, cities with a higher share of top-1% income earners are less 
susceptible to automation, implying that inequality between the 1 percent and the 99 
percent may widen as workforce automation continues. In contrast, cities with a 
larger share of middle class workers also are more at risk of computerisation.  

Hence, new jobs have emerged in different locations from the ones where old jobs 
are likely to disappear, potentially exacerbating the ongoing divergence between US 
cities. Looking forward, this trend will require workers to relocate from contracting to 
expanding cities. Supporting such relocation is particularly important since the 
arrival of new technology jobs creates additional demand for local services. For

example, Enrico Moretti has estimated that one additional job in the technology 
sector — including Machinery and Computing Equipment, Electrical Machinery and 
Professional Equipment — generates about 4.9 new jobs in the same city as new 
jobs create additional demand for local services. Thus, while technology does 
perhaps not create as many jobs directly as in the past, its indirect impact on 
service employment is substantial. Nevertheless, because new technology jobs 
overwhelmingly cluster in highly skilled cities, low skilled workers will inevitably have 
to follow, making economic activity even more concentrated.

What New Jobs do We See Ahead? 
New Jobs in a New Economy 
Highlights  

 This chapter highlights the new and emerging job openings over the next decade 
in a number of different sectors.  

 In the EU, it is estimated that there will be job openings in all sectors with 
additional jobs estimated at over 9.5 million and replacement jobs at 98 million 
between 2013 and 2025.  

 In the US the largest number of job openings is predicted to be in the health 
sector (> 4 million). New jobs are also needed in the green sector and industrial 
sector. 

 The IT sector should continue to create new employment opportunities including: 
security analysts; data scientists; cloud architects; and the implementation and 
analysis of the Internet of Things. Robots will replace jobs but also generate new 
jobs for engineers and technicians.  

 The new types of jobs that will be created will require people to be highly skilled; 
in fact it is forecasted that nearly half of the new opportunities in the EU will 
require high skilled workers.  

In 1961, Time magazine published a story called “The Automation Jobless” which 
stated that “The number of jobs lost to more efficient machines is only part of the 
problem. What worries many job experts more is that automation may prevent the 
economy from creating enough jobs.”  

Two years later Life Magazine held up a picture of a device called the Milwaukee-
Matic, an innovative industrial machining tool, surrounded by the 18 workers that it 
could replace. Automation and joblessness became such a huge issue that 
President Lyndon established the ‘Blue-Ribbon National Commission on 
Technology, Automation and Economic Progress’. The Commission studied the 
effects on productivity, labour, and automation and concluded that automation did 
not as such threaten employment and there were more important factors at stake: 
“Thus technological change (along with other forms of economic change) is an 
important determinant of the precise places, industries, and people affected by 
unemployment. But the general level of demand for goods and services is by far the 
most important factor determining how many are affected, how long they stay 
unemployed, and how hard it is for new entrants to the labour market to find jobs. 
The basic fact is that technology eliminates jobs, not work”.28  

Clearly in the past, automation and technological progress have not made human 
labour obsolete, in fact we have managed to adapt by creating new jobs to 
compensate for the loss of labour. In 1900, 41% of the US workforce was employed 
in agriculture; however by the year 2000, that share had fallen to 2%, mostly due to 
mechanisation of the sector. In the developed world, industrialisation moved people 
into factories and then moved them out again into services. Throughout these 
changes the number of jobs has always increased. US employment increased from 
1950 to 2014, and the unemployment rate in 2015 (5%) is returning back to its 
average after the financial recession of 2008/2009 (Figure 30 below).

Meanwhile, today’s newer technology sectors have not provided the same 
opportunities, particularly for less educated workers, as the industries that preceded 
them. This downward trend in new job creation in technology industries is 
particularly evident since the Computer Revolution of the 1980s. A study by Jeffery 
Lin suggests that while about 8.2% of the US workforce shifted into new jobs — 
associated with the arrival of new technologies throughout the 1980s — the 
equivalent number for the 1990s was 4.4%. Using updates of official industry 
classifications, Thor Berger and Carl Benedikt Frey further document that less than 
0.5% of the US workforce shifted into technology industries that emerged 
throughout the 2000s, including digital industries such as online auctions, video and 
audio streaming, and web design. Fifty-one of the 71 new industries that emerged 
during this period were directly related to digital technologies.29

What is clear is that technology has already changed the way we work and will 
continue to do so. Whether it will create more jobs than it will replace is another 
question in itself. What we are interested in answering in this chapter is the 
following question: ‘What types of new jobs are emerging and will be created over 
time?’ What we find is that is that there are a number of new and emerging job 
openings in different sectors including the IT, industrial, and health sector. At all skill 
levels, most jobs in demand will be characterised by non-routine tasks which are not 
easily replaced by technology or organisational change. Nearly half of the new job 
opportunities in the EU are estimated to require highly skilled workers, therefore 
acquiring these skills is extremely important for future employment and could affect 
the susceptibility of automation at both a country and city level.   

Jobs of the Future 
Predicting the types of jobs and skills that will be in demand in the future is 
challenging and often uncertain, but various detailed data sets are helping us 
observe such evolving trends. The European Centre for the Development of 
Vocational Training (Cedefop) estimates that in the EU there will be job openings in 
all sectors with additional jobs estimated at over 9.5 million and replacement jobs 
estimated at 98 million from 2013 to 2025. However their results indicate some risk 
of job polarisation as the new jobs (replacement and expansion) will be created on 
the top or the bottom of the job sector. At all skill levels, most jobs in demand will be

The O⋆NET programme collects information on 974 different occupations in the US. 
One key feature that it has is the compilation of a list of ‘bright outlook’ occupations, 
where new job opportunities are likely to be in the future or at least until 2022. It 
categorises these occupations as: (1) those that are projected to grow much faster 
than the average (employment increase of 22% or more); (2) those that are 
projected to have a large number of openings; and (3) new and emerging 
occupations which include new workforce requirements, including changes in 
technology, society, law or business practices and are leading to new and emerging 
occupations in the US.30 The data show that the information technology career 
cluster has the highest percentage of occupations (62%) considered to have a 
‘bright outlook’, followed by marketing, sales, and service (50%) and health science 
(45%).31 If we just look at the new and emerging occupations, the largest number of 
job opportunities in the US are estimated to be in the health sector (>4 million job 
openings). Other new and emerging occupations with large job opportunities include 
green jobs such as wind energy operations managers, automotive engineers and 
others. (For a full list of bright outlook jobs refer to the O⋆NET website).

The Digital Economy: New Jobs Created by the IT Sector 
Over the years, computers and their applications have changed the way businesses 
function and the way we work. The Internet today is considered a fundamental 
infrastructure in most countries and has over the years and it has created jobs 
either directly related to technology such as Internet engineers and hardware 
specialists or jobs directly related to its eco-system — such as the creation of apps 
and the analysis of data.  

Employment in the computer and IT sector is expected to increase as applications 
such as the Internet of Things, Big Data, AI and others expand over time. In fact the 
top job trends on indeed.com’s website are all related to the computer and IT sector 
including HTML5 Developer jobs which grew by over 350,000 % from January 2010 
to January 2015, MongoDB specialists (database technology), IOS, Android, 
Hadoop (open software that enables distributed processing of large data sets), 
cloud architects and others.32 According to Indeed’s industry employment trends, 
information technology job postings have increased by 8% in the US since 
September 2014 with a total of 329,244 job postings during this period.  

According to Cisco, by 2020 there will be a staggering 50 billion devices around the 
globe connected to the Internet and collecting data, and as the number of 
connected devices explodes, the number of developers around the world 
contributing to the Internet of Things (IoT) would increase from 500,000 to 4.5

million people.33 In this expanded digital economy, private enterprises connected to 
the Internet of Things can use Big Data and analytics to develop algorithms and 
speed up efficiency, productivity, and lower the marginal cost of producing and 
distributing products.34 Big Data is also being used in a number of other 
applications from e-commerce, marketing, medical, AI, and others. For every Big 
Data problem, the solution often rests with a data scientist. The Harvard Business 
Review dubbed Data Scientist as the ‘sexiest job of the 21st century.’ According to 
Dr. Tara Sinclair, Indeed.com’s Chief Economist, the number of job openings for 
Data Scientists grew 73.5% in the first quarter of 2015.35 As of January 2016 there 
are currently over 30,000 Data Specialist job openings on Linkedln’s job site in the 
US alone.36  

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics has made forecasts of future job opportunities in 
2022 for IT and computer-related work (Figure 33 below). It is difficult to divide 
these jobs into the different applications, however it is interesting to see that the 
largest percent increase between 2012 and 2022 is in Information Security Analysts 
(37% increase), Computer System Analysts (25%) and Software Development 
(22%) with total job openings in the IT sector estimated at 650,000 in the same 
period. However, this seems to be quite low when compared to Indeed’s analysis 
where over 329,000 jobs in IT have opened from September 2014 to present. The 
difference could be in definition: the Bureau of Labor Statistics defines occupations 
differently than job websites, and therefore IT jobs required in certain sectors such 
as Data Scientists in the healthcare and medical sectors could be counted within 
the health sector occupational analysis. Even though IT jobs are estimated to grow 
over almost 18% to 2022, they only form a small part (<3%) of the overall 
employment in the US, estimated at 160 million in 2022.

The Digital Economy: New Jobs for SMEs 
The digital economy and the Internet are also helping small and medium sized firms 
(SMEs) grow their businesses more effectively by procuring inputs and selling 
globally directly over the Internet, often resulting in the demand for more workers. 
The Internet has also helped open up markets for home-based business; in fact

there are currently 53 million Americans that are working as freelancers, equivalent 
to approximately 34% of the total US workforce. Forty percent of these freelancers 
are independent contractors, 27% are moonlighters —professionals who have a 
traditional job but also freelance — and 18% are people with multiple sources of 
income (see Figure 34).

In the UK there has also been a sharp increase in self-employment, accounting for 
two-thirds of the job growth since 2008. Self-employed individuals now account for 
one in seven of the British workforce.38 This increase is driven by new infrastructure 
such as freelancer support, plus good communication platforms such as Skype, and 
an increase in available funds through schemes such as peer-to-peer lending and 
through start-ups such as Uber, Task Rabbit and Handy (part of the sharing 
economy), which are transforming the way consumers access goods and services.  

While we lack the data to examine the net employment effects of the sharing 
economy, it is clear that it facilitates a new range of jobs. The sharing economy 
allows individuals to share products and services such as renting a room in one’s 
house (Airbnb), driving passengers to destinations (Lyft), and finding a number of 
tasks that one can do through apps such as Task Rabbit or Handy. The industry is 
growing and providing a number of jobs to freelancers and other individuals. For 
example Handy, which is a market for online and mobile cleaning and home repair 
booking services, has received over $1 million in bookings per week in the last year. 
Lyft, an app which matches drivers with passengers who request rides, states that 
some drivers can make more than $800 just driving weekends. Task Rabbit- a web 
based platform that allows you to outsource errands that you don’t want to do and 
connects you with qualified people who are available to help, has over 30,000 
people signed up. Taskers set their own rates and according to Jamie Viggiano, vice 
president of marketing for the company, 10-15% of the subscribers can earn $6,000 
to $7,000 a month.39

Could the future of work lie in self-employment, multiple job holdings, short duration 
and temporary employees? This theory has been questioned as today the majority 
of workers have full time jobs and full time jobs bring stability and other perks such 
as private pensions etc. However as stated in our previously Citi GPS report 
Technology at Work, as the economy becomes even more digitised, self-
employment may become the new norm. The sharing economy is expected to grow 
over time; with PwC estimating that the five main sharing sectors (peer-to-peer 
financing, online staffing, peer-to-peer accommodation, car sharing and music video 
sharing) have the potential to increase global revenues from around $15 billion to 
$335 billion by 2025.40  

Is Technology Creating New Jobs in the Industrial Sector? 
As robots become smarter, faster and cheaper they will be doing tasks that go 
beyond repetitive, dull, and dangerous and will be used in other industrial sectors 
besides the auto industry (where today’s majority of industrial robots are used).41 
Although robots will replace a number of jobs, they will also generate a number of 
new job positions. The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) estimate that 
growth in robot use over the next five years would result in the creation of one 
million high quality jobs.  
 
In 2012, there were 133,000 robot engineers who research, design, develop, and 
test robotic applications and 17,000 robotics technicians that build, install, test or 
maintain robot equipment or related automated production systems in the US.42 The 
numbers for these jobs are expected to increase by an estimated 30,000 for robot 
engineers and over 4,000 for robot technicians from 2012 to 2022 in the US. Figure 
35 below shows the estimated direct jobs that are related to the increase in robotics 
including computer controlled machine operators and mechanical engineering 
technicians. There are also indirect jobs that could be created through the 
expansion of robotics including software programmers and data analysts; these are 
discussed in more detail in the section on information technology.

The auto industry has been using industrial robots in its manufacturing process for 
many years. However, job opportunities in the auto sector are expected to increase 
over time and new jobs are also emerging in this sector because of new 
technologies that are available. Automotive engineers who develop new or 
improved designs for vehicles and automotive engineer technicians who assist 
engineers in determining the practicality of the proposed design are both new job 
types in the auto industry and are expected to grow on average between 3% and 
7% in the US from 2012 to 2022, with new job openings estimated at nearly 
100,000 and 12,000, respectively. The skills required for these jobs have changed 
over time and now include analytical software design, computer aided 
manufacturing, development of environmental software, and others which reflect the 
effect that technology and regulation is having on the auto sector.  

Driverless cars, directly or indirectly can also create new jobs (even though they 
would definitely replace others). These cars could free up as much as 50 minutes a 
day for users, who instead of driving will be able to spend time working, relaxing or 
accessing entertainment. According to McKinsey, driverless cars could generate 
global digital-media revenues of €5 billion ($5.5bn) per year for every additional 
minute people spend on mobile Internet while in a car.43 This will undoubtedly 
create some jobs, in fact KPMG estimate that connected and autonomous vehicles 
could create an additional 320,000 jobs in the UK by 2030, 25,000 of which would 
be in automotive manufacturing.44 Most of the job creation would occur indirectly 
because of improvements to productivity and greater mobility of workers and in 
adjacent sectors such as telecoms and digital media as new markets will be created 
by connected and autonomous vehicles.

The use of drones and/or unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) is expected to increase 
over the years. In fact a company called Measure has just recently been given 
permission for 324 commercial drones to be used for a number of applications. The 
Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International has stated that precision 
agriculture and public safety are the most promising commercial and civil markets 
for drones. They estimate that the economic impact of the integration of UAS into 
the National Airspace System will total more than $13.6 billion in 2017 and will 
create more than 34,000 and 50,000 new manufacturing jobs in 2017 and 2025 
respectively with a total job creation estimated at 103,776 by 2025 (this includes 
both direct and indirect jobs). However unmanned aircraft systems will replace other 
jobs such as some farming jobs (even though the agriculture sector in the US has 
automated the majority of its processes), surveillance of oil and gas pipelines, 
construction site monitoring etc. and if Amazon succeeds in using drones for its 
delivery services, some delivery driver jobs could also be lost.  

New Jobs that are ‘Needed’ in Society 
There are many other new and emerging jobs that are being created and will 
continue to be created over time. In this section we focus on two particular 
industries which are growing — the health sector and the environmental/green 
sector. Both industries are experiencing growth because there is a particular need 
or ‘requirement’ for them in today’s society.  

The health sector is expected to add more than 4 million new jobs in the US from 
2012 to 2022 and is projected to become one of the fastest growing industries in the 
US economy (Figure 36). Health care job openings in the US have increased by 
23% from September 2014 to September 2015, reaching a staggering 852,200 job 
openings in that time period.45 In the EU it is estimated that the health care sector 
accounts for about 17 million of all jobs and is predicted to continue growing with an 
estimate of 8 million openings between 2010 and 2020.46 A number of factors are 
expected to lead to the growth in this sector and therefore job opportunities 
including: (1) a growing population; (2) an increase in life expectancy; (3) chronic 
conditions such as obesity and diabetes which increase the demand for health care 
to prevent, manage and/or treat such conditions; (4) improvement in medicine and 
technology which is expected to increase the demand for health care services; and 
(5) more people getting health care insurance (especially in the US).

According to the World Health Organization there is currently a global health 
workforce shortage estimated at 7.2 million professionals and forecast to increase 
to 12.9 million people by 2035.48 In the US it is predicted that there will be a 
shortage of at least 124,000 physicians and 500,000 nurses by 2025.49 The health 
systems in most EU Member States are also coming under pressure as a result of 
people living longer, while its health workforce itself is aging. The European 
Commission projects a shortage of around 1 million health professionals in the EU 
in 2020 (590,000 nurses, 230,000 medical doctors and 150,000 dentists, 
pharmacists and physiotherapists), if no measures are taken to encourage people 
to work in this sector. In Japan the situation is not much better; it is estimated that 
an additional 800,000 more health workers would be needed in nursing care in the 
coming decade, with a shortage of workers estimated at 380,000.50 The Japanese 
government is taking steps to secure enough nursing care workers to meet this 
growing demand, including increasing compensation, providing incentives to lure 
back staff who have left the industry, and encouraging robot technology to be 
developed to assist the elderly. 

The increase in digital healthcare is also fuelling demand for specialised skills which 
range from managing electronic records to analysing the data generated by remote 
patient monitoring devices. For example doctors can now remotely monitor one’s 
heart beat or levels of sugar for diabetes. This generates a mountain of data that 
needs to be analysed, stored, and acted upon. Technological changes will call for a 
different type of healthcare worker. In fact the O⋆NET have identified a number of 
new and emerging jobs in this sector, including bioinformatic technicians, informatic 
nurse specialists and clinical data managers, which are all estimated to grow well 
above average.

The Green Economy: The Creation and Expansion of Jobs 
in this Sector 
Over the years the ‘green movement’ has gained public support and new markets 
and opportunities have opened up in this sector. In the UK, the Office for National 
Statistics estimated that in 2012 the green economy added £26.3 billion ($37.5 
billion) to the UK economy and contributed 357,200 full time equivalent jobs, an 
increase of 5.3% since 2010. Wastewater and waste management services 
contributed to the largest value added and employment at £9.4 billion ($13.4 billion) 
and over 120,000 full time jobs. However other sectors such as renewable energy 
are also growing.  

According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), global 
renewable energy jobs reached an estimated 7.7 million globally in 2014 (excluding 
large hydropower), which is an 18% increase from the previous year51 with the 
majority of the jobs (over 3 million) found in China. The Citi GPS report Energy 
Darwinism II estimated that the use of renewable energy in the power sector under 
Citi’s ‘Action’ scenario would increase from 6% in 2012 to 34% by 2040 which will 
undoubtedly create new jobs in this sector.   

In the US, there are currently 2.1 million people working in the renewable sector 
(solar, wind and geothermal). This is number is estimated to increase to 2.8 million 
by 2022 (Figure 37). These figures could increase even further following the deal 
being reached on climate change at the UN COP21 meeting in Paris at the end of 
2015. 

Figure 37. Solar and Wind Jobs

It is not just wind turbine engineers and solar panel installers who can look forward 
to more work, new careers in this sector will spring up across many areas. Most 
companies today are either measuring or thinking about measuring their 
greenhouse gas emissions, their water use, and how to make their supply chains 
more sustainable. Other new and emerging jobs in the US mentioned on the O*NET 
website include energy auditors (+202,000 jobs in 2022), climate change analysts 
(+39,700 jobs in 2022), and fuel cell technicians (+99,700 jobs in 2022).

Skills and Qualifications Needed: The Knowledge Driven 
Economy 
“Technology seems to be changing life in a fundamental way and what it’s leaving 
people thinking is ‘where will I be in 30 years?’ Look how fast everything is changing 
now. Where will my children be? I want to leave something for them because they 
could be in terrible straits”. This quote by economics professor and Nobel Laureate 
Robert Shiller sums up the fears that people are having on the advancement and 
acceleration of technology, be it at work, in everyday life, or in the choices that they 
make. 

How can we better prepare ourselves for such a change and ensure that we have 
the adequate skills to ensure future employment? The new types of jobs that are 
being created over the next decade will require people to be highly skilled with the 
know-how required to create the next generation of products and services. The 
increasing use of technology and the drive for productivity will raise the demand for 
high skilled workers, while in some cases depressing growth for low skilled workers. 
Cedefop estimate that of the 107 million job opportunities in the EU projected from 
2013-2025, about 46 million will be for jobs requiring high-level qualifications, 43 
million for medium-level qualifications and 10 million for low- or no-level 
qualifications- mostly due to replacement demands (refer to Figure 38). In terms of 
absolute numbers, in 2025 the proportion of people with high, medium and low 
qualifications is forecast to be 39%, 44%, and 15%, respectively (Figure 39). The 
US shows a similar picture with occupations that typically require a Master’s degree 
for entry predicted to grow the fastest (18.4%) from 2012 to 2022, however the 
majority of the job openings from 2012 to 2022 are projected to be in occupations 
that typically can be entered with a high school diploma (4.6 million jobs). These 
occupations include retail salespersons, combined food preparation and serving 
workers, and secretaries and administration assistants. If economists and IT experts 
are correct some of these jobs and others could be automated.

Are we prepared for such a change? A charity called Go.On.UK has stated that 
currently in the UK, over 12 million people and a million small businesses do not 
have the skills to prosper in the digital era. The organisation produced a digital 
exclusion heat map showing the areas in the UK that are most likely to miss out on 
the digital revolution. McKinsey estimate that by 2020, there will likely be a shortage 
globally of 40 million high skilled workers unless adequate training and education is 
given.52 They state that technological innovation will demand a new set of skills in 
the workforce; it will change work tasks, automate jobs and also increase the skills 
gap for the jobs that remain.  

However, this is not something new. We have already seen this happen and we 
have managed to cope with such changes even though our work and skills have 
changed. Autor and Price (2013) analysed the change in job tasks in the US from 
1960 to 2009 (Figure 40). They argue that the share of non-routine analytical and 
interactive job tasks (tasks that require expert thinking and complex communication 
skills) performed by American workers has increased steadily since 1960, whilst the 
share of routine cognitive and manual tasks began to decline in the early 1970’s 
and 1980’s — coinciding with the introduction of computers and automated 
production processes. The share of non-routine tasks also declined over the years 
but stabilised in the 1990’s, possibly due to the fact that some of these tasks could 
not be computerised.

During this period the US economy changed from a manufacturing to a service 
economy. Beginning in the 1970s and continuing to pick up speed in the 1990s with 
the opening up of trade with China, India and Eastern Europe, competition from 
foreign imports forced US firms to outsource or automate their manufacturing 
process. This led to a reduction in manufacturing jobs in the US, estimated at 2.6 
million between 1960 and 2013 and 7 million between 1978 (when manufacturing 
was at its highest) and 2014.54 However, during this period the unemployment rate 
in the US remained at an average level, even though different US states were 
affected by this change. As manufacturing jobs declined, retail jobs took over, 
increasing from 5.5 million in 1960 to 15.5 million in 2014 (Figure 41 below). This 
parallel shift from manufacturing to a service economy also led to the parallel shift 
from a high school to a college economy. This prepared the workforce for an 
attainment of higher skills and enabled other industries to expand, such as business 
and financial services. Skill sets did change over time with highly analytical and 
managerial skills increasing over this period but the US workforce had time to 
prepare and was ready for such changes.

So is it different this time? One of the differences lies in the speed of change, with 
technology already affecting the type of tasks that we are required to do in today’s 
workplace. This means that we have to adapt quickly and enhance our current skills 
to reflect what is needed; not a simple task. In the past moving from a 
manufacturing job to a retail sales job demanded a change in skills, albeit a set of 
skills — interpersonal skills, customer services and sales skills — that could be 
easily obtained through training. This training was usually provided on site and 
could last from a few days to a few months depending on the type of business. 
However, training to become, for example, a data scientist requires an advanced 
quantitative degree in mathematics and statistics, computer science or engineering 
(88% of the people applying for data scientist roles have at least a Master’s degree 
and 46% have a PhD).55 Acquiring such high skills is not an easy task, and requires 
an investment in education and training for a number of years.

Outside of skills related to data scientists, what skills should individuals obtain to 
ensure that they have a good job in the future? Citi asked its institutional clients this 
question, and over 52% of the respondents thought that one should definitely have 
some sort of IT/computer skills, whilst 17% mentioned other STEM subjects such as 
mathematics and physics (Figure 42 below). Surprisingly (or maybe not) over 14% 
also mentioned the importance of creativity and soft skills and 7% mentioned that 
we need to be constantly re-learning and be flexible in our job choices. One quote 
by a respondent captures the spirit and importance of creativity skills and constant 
re-learning brilliantly: 

“Focus less on pure academics, and more on creativity and presentation 
skills. The enormous likelihood is that however good you are at STEM 
subjects, there are likely to be people in the world who are infinitely better 
than you — this is to say nothing of the computers that will eventually 
take over all STEM related roles. Communication skills, creativity and the 
ability to adapt to change are hugely more valuable and a much better 
differentiator medium-term”.

Other studies have highlighted the importance of adapting our current skills for 
future employment. One such study is the work that has been done by the Institute 
for Future Work, which identified ten skills as being important and most relevant to 
the workforce of the future. These include:  

 Sense-making - the ability to determine the deeper meaning of significance of 
what is being expressed,  

 Social intelligence 

 Novel and adapting thinking 

 Cross-cultural competency 

 Computational thinking 

 New Media Literacy 

 Transdisciplinarity - literacy in and the ability to understand concepts across 
multiple disciplines 

The respondents to our survey believe that 
IT skills and STEM subjects are important 
for future work 



Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions January 2016

52 

 Design mindset - ability to represent and develop tasks and work processes for
desired outcomes

 Cognitive load management- ability to discriminate and filter information for
importance

 Virtual collaboration – the ability to work productively, drive engagement, and
demonstrate presence as a member of a virtual team

Geoff Colvin in his book ‘Humans are Underrated: What High Achievers Know That 
Brilliant Machines Never Will’ states that our inbuilt propensity for social interaction, 
communication, and empathy is what makes people special — something that 
machines can never replace. According to the author, these are the qualities that 
women are exceptional at, putting them in the driving seat. In our Citi GPS report 
‘Women in the Economy’, we highlighted the importance of women in the labour 
market, where even just a 50% reduction in the gender gap in the labour market can 
lead to a 5% increase in global GDP. With an even more important role to play in 
the digital economy, women can become an even greater asset in the labour 
market.  

Predicting what future jobs and skills might be available or needed in the future is 
extremely difficult. O*NET uses the US Bureau of Labor Statistics data that 
analyses future employment for approximately 300 detailed industries and 800 
occupations. The accuracy of projections of these individual occupations is subject 
to error because of the many unknown factors that may affect the US economy over 
the time period studied. Other jobs that the data highlight as ‘bright outlook’ jobs 
include traditional jobs such as baristas (268,000 job openings from 2012-2022), 
child care workers (570,000 job openings), and lawyers (197,000 job openings) 
which are all estimated to increase over the time period.  

Innovations in technology are likely to continue to reduce the need for labour to do 
routine work and cognitive work in the near future; however this is not to say that 
labour markets would not absorb the impact, as technology has been making 
inroads into labour for a number of decades. The nature of work will likely change 
and the new jobs that will be created will require a different skill set to the ones that 
we currently have or are training for. We therefore need to be better prepared, and 
aim to achieve skills that will allow us to work with machines rather than compete 
against them. Government, lawyers and educational boards should be better 
prepared to handle such changes. What is clear is that the largest job openings are 
expected in the health sector, this is not surprising given that we are living longer- 
demographic change is occurring in advanced and some emerging countries, this is 
discussed in more detail in the next chapter.

Demography vs Automation: Will We 
Run Out of Workers or Out of Jobs?  
Highlights 

 The working age population in industrial countries peaked in 2011 at 388 million
and is expected to decline by 30 million by 2030. Growth in working age
populations for industrial countries has slowed from 1% per year in 1970-90 to
0.4% per year in 1990-2010 and is expected to fall by 0.3% per year over the
next 20 years. Growth in human capital may also slow.

 We calculate that the change in demographics could impact living standards by
about -0.2% per year over the next 20 years, or the equivalent of 26 million
workers.

 Incremental productivity gains through automation could plausibly offset the
demographic developments in a number of countries. However automation could
pose more risks to jobs than demographic changes.

The long-running decline in fertility rates in industrial countries over the last few 
decades — the average number of children per woman has fallen from 2.8 in 1960 
to 1.7 recently — is leading to some major demographic changes. According to UN 
data, the working age population (defined as the population ages15 to 64) in 
industrial countries peaked in 2011 at 388 million people and is expected to decline 
by roughly 30 million people by 2030. In Japan, the working-age population (WAP) 
already peaked in 1995 and in Germany in 1998 (even though most recently, high 
inward migration is leading to some growth in the working-age population); while in 
the US the peak is projected to occur in 2026. 

The recent decline in working-age populations and its projected continuation, stand 
in sharp contrast to previous decades. Between 1995 and 2011, the working-age 
population in industrial countries increased by roughly 50 million, after increasing by 
roughly 70 million between 1980 and 1995. Even though globally the working-age 
population is still growing (and indeed foreseen by the UN to continue to grow for 
the rest of this century), declining working-age populations are not exclusively an 
industrial country phenomenon: for instance, working-age populations in Eastern 
Europe peaked in 2008 and in China in 2014. In general, the peak in total 
populations is expected to follow the peak in working-age populations with some 
delay (e.g. for the industrial country age, the total population is expected to start 
falling in 2041). Meanwhile, as fertility rates have fallen and life expectancy risen, 
median population ages have been rising in most industrial countries, from 29.5 
years in 1960 to 34.4 in 1990 in the industrial country average, reaching 41.0 years 
in 2014. By 2030, the median age will probably have gone up by another 3-4 years 
(Harper, 2014).56

The fall in working-age populations and the projected continued decline has been 
cited as a major drag on future growth — indeed, a slowdown in population growth 
was at the heart of the original ‘secular stagnation’ hypothesis of Alvin Hansen in 
the 1930s. The question is therefore whether, far from being a challenge that needs 
to be addressed by policy, technological change, including automation, could be the 
answer to the challenges that demographic developments pose.  

Demographics and Economic Growth 
Demographic developments can have a very significant effect on economic growth 
prospects. In a stylised way, economists think of potential growth as reflecting the 
contributions of growth in the size of the labour force, investments in capital and 
improvements in the efficiency of using the factors of production (labour and 
capital), including through technological innovation. Demographics can have an 
effect on all three. 

The most direct effect of demographics on growth may be through its effect on the 
labour supply. Growth in working-age populations for industrial countries has indeed 
slowed down substantially, from around 1% per year in 1970-90 to 0.4% per year in 
1990-2010. Over the next 20 years, the UN predicts the average working-age 
population in the advanced economies to fall by 0.3% per year. In addition to the 
slowdown in the growth of the working-age population, the growth in ‘human capital’ 
may be slower than previously, as a lot of the low-hanging fruit as regards 
educational improvements may have been plucked: primary- and secondary-school 
attendance in industrial countries is nearly universal and improvements in tertiary 
education may not be equivalent to the overall improvements in educational 
coverage in previous decades. But abstracting from changes in educational quality, 
the labour-supply effect alone may imply that demographics would slow down 
average growth prospects in industrial countries in the order of around 0.5%pa over 
the next 20 years relative to the 1990-2010 period.57 

 

                                                           
57 As noted above the difference in average growth of the WAP is around 0.7% per year. 
To arrive at the rough effect on growth, this difference needs to be multiplied by the 
share of labour in production, which we assume to be two thirds.

The effect of falling WAPs on GDP growth is not limited to its effect on the labour 
supply. There are good reasons to believe that slower population growth and older 
populations may weigh on investment and perhaps efficiency, too, even though in 
principle the effects could go either way. For investment, smaller populations (or at 
least slower population growth) may mean that existing capacities may suffice for 
longer and therefore lower investment needs. Or falling WAPs may push up wages 
and therefore increase the incentive to substitute capital for labour. Similarly, older 
populations may have bias political economy incentives against production and 
therefore hurt efficiency. Or a shortage of workers may stimulate labour-saving 
technology — after all, the drive to install robots in Japan has been linked to its poor 
demographic prospects.

Overall, slower population growth is, other things equal, likely to be associated with 
slower GDP growth. However, when it comes to standards of living, it is mostly GDP 
growth per capita rather than GDP growth that is of interest. But GDP growth per 
capita is also likely to be dampened by lower population growth. The reason is that, 
at least for some time, lower working-age population growth is likely to be 
associated with rising dependency ratios (the ratio of those of working-age 
population relative to those too young or too old to work). The average dependency 
ratio (specifically the number of people aged up to 15 and above 64 divided by the 
number of people aged 15-64) in industrial countries fell from 58 per 100 people in 
1960 until it troughed in 2005 at 47.5. In 2014, it stood at 50.8 and continues to rise 
quickly. By 2030, the UN estimates the average dependency ratio to be 64, with the 
dependency ratio to be around or above 70 in Germany, Italy or Japan (the 
dependency ratio in the US and UK is forecast to be close to the industrial country 
average). 

In China, the rise in dependency ratios is also likely to be quite dramatic, in part due 
to its ill-fated one-child policy: China’s working-age population is expected to 
decrease from 1 billion people in 2015 to 960 billion in 2030 and 800 billion people 
in 2050, whilst its population aged 65 and over is projected to increase by 240 
million people by 2050 (Figure 45 and Figure 46). Its dependency ratio is set for a 
steep rise: from 36 in 2014 to 47 in 2030 and 70 by 2050.

Figure 47. Comparison of Population by Age Group in Japan, China, and the US Under a 
Medium Fertility Scenario (%)

Another way to illustrate the rise in dependency ratios in various countries is to plot 
the change in the population shares of those below and above working-age, as in 
Figure 47. There we see in particular how the share of those above 65 years of age 
is set to rise strongly in China and Japan in coming decades (and somewhat less so 
in the US).58 Therefore it is not a surprise that we many job openings in the health 
sector as described in the previous chapter.  

Similar to our basic calculations above, we can quantify the direct effect of changing 
demographics on the growth of GDP per capita: above we highlighted that the 
estimated slowdown in GDP growth due to slower growth in WAPs in the industrial 
country average would be around 0.5% per year. Meanwhile, the slowdown in 
population growth between say 1990-2010 and the next twenty years is estimated 
to be in the order of 0.3% per year. These basic calculations therefore suggest that 
the direct cost to living standards due to demographics may be around 0.2% per 
year. Another way to illustrate the demographic effects is that to keep the WAP ratio 
in industrial countries constant in 2035 at estimated 2015 levels, we would need 26 
million additional workers.

These are simplistic calculations, of course. Various indirect effects are likely to 
apply. We mention two: (1) congestion and depopulation effects and (2) political 
economy effects.  

 Congestion and depopulation. Above we noted that GDP growth may be less 
relevant than GDP growth per capita. But economies or diseconomies of scale 
may apply. The former are particularly relevant when there are fixed costs of 
production or operation. For instance, a road or a school may be economic when 
there are sufficient users and prohibitively expensive when there are too few. 
Conversely, a congested road may increase travel times substantially. The net 
overall effects of these non-linearities for economic growth are difficult to sign, let 
alone quantify. 

 Political economy. Political economy factors are highly likely to have a 
significant impact. As we noted above, median population ages are rising across 
the advanced economies (and many emerging markets). Meanwhile, turnout 
rates tend to be higher for older people. For instance, in the 2012 US election, 
the voter turnout rate for those 60 years and above was roughly 70%, compared 
to 40% for those between 18-29 years and around 55% for those 30-44.59 Unless 
these patterns reverse dramatically, population aging is therefore likely to put 
more political power into the hands of the old.

Those 16-35 Years Old 

 
Source: OECD60, Citi Research 

 
What effects such shifts in the demographic balance of political power can have is 
difficult to predict, but the presumption should be that, given that a rising share of 
the electorate will be in retirement, these shifts may be growth-unfriendly, other 
things equal.

However, there are likely to be some mitigants for the demographic effects on 
growth, including longer (and often healthier) working lives (and higher participation 
rates for the old), policies to boost fertility and increased scope for migration to 
advanced economies.  

 Labour force participation. In the Eurozone, the labour force participation rate 
for those aged 65-69 rose from 7% in 2005 to 10% in 2015. In the UK, the 
increase was from 15% to 22%, while average participation rates for the old have 
also increased in Japan and the US. Policies to increase labour force 
participation rates are increasingly prominent, including to tighten benefit 
eligibility for the inactive (e.g. in the UK) and policies that would boost 
participation rates for women (e.g. in Japan).61 However, on average older 
workers tend to work less hours and are somewhat less productive than the 
average workforce: one study suggests that the combination of the two implies 
that a worker above 65 will tend to add just below 80% of the productive potential 
of the average worker below 65.62 

 Migration. Migration rates could potentially pick up, even though for now there 
seems little political appetite to allow large-scale migration (which, given that the 
demographic challenges affect a large number of advanced economies, would 
mainly have to be migration from EMs to advanced economies). The UN 
estimates that total migration to ‘more developed regions’, which include all of 
Europe, North America, Australia/New Zealand and Japan, is expected to amount 
to less than 12 million people over the 2010 period, or roughly 0.2% per year. 
The future projections imply a roughly stable flow of net immigrants (which is 
already incorporated into the projections for the total and working-age population 
cited above). 

 Fertility. Some countries are also trying to boost fertility rates. For instance, 
China’s recent decision to formally scrap its one-child policy should be seen in 
that context, even though it remains unclear how effective this move will be in 
raising birth rates and any effect on working-age populations will be many years 
in coming. 

Despite these mitigants, the economic effects of demographic change could well be 
significant, even though these effects may also differ quite widely across countries. 
The economic effects of demographic change are not limited to those on growth 
only. For instance, demographic changes may have distributional effects, too. As 
noted above, a shortage of workers could lead to higher growth in average wages 
and rising labour shares and therefore potentially reverse some long-standing 
distributional trends in many advanced economies, including in income and wealth 
inequality — and those distributional effects may be more welcome than the 
dampening effect of falling WAPs on average growth rates. In addition, shrinking 
and aging populations would, other things equal, likely have significant implications 
for interest rates and inflation, too.

Can Automation Offset Demographics? 
A central thesis of our ongoing work on technological change and innovation has 
been that these changes are significant in both a micro and a macro sense. Pinning 
down the precise effects remains difficult, but the above rules of thumb at least give 
us a sense of how significant technological innovation needs to be to offset some of 
the economic effects of demographic change.  

Above we derived simple estimates of the economic effect of demographic change 
on the workforce, which suggested that those effects could be in the order of 0.2% 
per year or 26 million additional workers over 20 years. Could innovation therefore 
offset the (macro) effects of demographic change? Indeed, embracing automation 
has been among the strategies being pursued by various countries, including China 
and Japan, to address demographic developments.  

Even though forecasting the contribution of demographic change remains extremely 
uncertain, we suspect that the answer is therefore quite conceivably yes. For 
instance, a previous Citi GPS report highlighted that up to 47% of current US 
employment is at risk of being automated, a report by Deloitte and Frey and 
Osborne (2014) suggested 35% of UK jobs are similarly at risk and a Nomura and 
Oxford Martin School study put the share of Japan’s workforce at risk at 49%.63 
Even though these shares are not to be interpreted as productivity gains, they 
suggest to us that the incremental productivity gains are potentially very significant 
and could plausibly offset the demographic developments. However when we 
compare the effect that automation could have on the labour force itself we could 
potentially see a different picture. For example Japan faces a large demographic 
challenge ahead with 8 million additional workers (12% of working age cohort in 
2030) needed in 2030, if they are to maintain the same working age ratio as 2015. 
This is below the potential jobs that could be susceptible to automation (49%). So 
ultimately automation could pose more risks to jobs than demographic changes. 

However, we caution against seeing the race between demography and automation 
as purely one-dimensional. Both developments are multi-faceted and the effects of 
each are unlikely to always be offsetting. For instance, above we noted that 
demographic change is likely to have a number of political economy consequences, 
including through the rising political power of the old. Those are unlikely to be 
significantly altered by automation (unless the robots rapidly acquire voting rights) 
and are likely to have significant economic, social and political consequences, even 
if they are hard to predict for now. 

In general, the effects of demography and innovation are unlikely to offset each 
other exactly at the individual or sectoral level, even if they happened to do so in the 
aggregate. That is, those losing their job to a robot, will not necessarily land an 
equivalent job of someone who just retired. And those benefiting from technological 
innovations will not necessarily see their benefit withered away by increasing prices 
of other goods they demand. In general, the supply and demand effects of 
demographic change on the one hand and automation on the other may only in part 
overlap, if at all, for individuals and sectors. 

At the policy level, that means that rather than offsetting the challenges from 
shrinking and aging populations, rapid technological change may offer another layer 
of growing challenges, potentially complicating the necessary policy response and 
possibly magnifying it.

At the industry level, that means there will be opportunities as well as challenges, 
too. Demographic effects in each sector reflect the fact that spending levels change 
dramatically over the consumer’s life cycle. Figure 50 below illustrates this point for 
seven sectors in the US. Each sector with the exception of healthcare exhibits an 
inverted-U shape; this shows how consumers increase spending through their mid-
life years and reduce spending when they get older. The demand for health care is 
likely to rise substantially as populations age, and in particular countries, such as 
China, where healthcare remains underdeveloped. Meanwhile, it remains to be 
seen how well technologies can progress to satisfy the increased demand. On the 
other hand, transport services are among those that may be less in demand as 
populations age, while innovation in transport, including driverless cars, is likely to 
be rapid. In fact per capita spending in the US on transport declines by 48% going 
from the 45-54 to 75+ age group. In total it is estimated that cumulatively through 
2030, the evolution of demographics in the US will subtract $360 billion from 
personal consumption expenditure to the current demography to growth.64

In conclusion demographic change is likely to have a number of consequences to 
an economy. Automation could offset some of the macro effects of demographic 
change - however this will depend on a number of factors as described above. 
Automation is seen in a number of countries as a solution to demographic 
challenges in lieu of the fact that it could ultimately increase productivity- however 
we are currently facing a productivity paradox- this is described in more detail in the 
next chapter.

Impact of Automation on 
Productivity: Are Traditional 
Measurement Tools Failing to 
Capture Productivity and GDP 
Improvements?  
Highlights  

 We face a productivity paradox - if technological progress and innovation are so 
rampant, why do we not see it in the productivity statistics? Across advanced 
economies, labour productivity growth has slowed from 4% in 1965-75, to about 
2% from 1975-2005 and 1% from 2005-2014.  

 Rather than a view that the 'low-hanging fruit' of innovation has been plucked we 
see limitations in the current measurement of productivity, a lag effect in 
measurement and a wider distribution of productivity across firms and workers 

 In our client survey 81% responded that technological developments are 
inadequately reflected in productivity statistics and 95% expect automation and 
technology will drive some kind of an increase in productivity growth over time.  

 The New Productivity Paradox 
If technological progress and innovation are so rampant, should we not expect to 
see it in productivity statistics? Yet, across the advanced economies (and many 
EMs), measured productivity growth is low in historical comparison (see Figure 51). 
Across the advanced economies, labour productivity (LP) growth has on average 
slowed significantly, from around 4% in 1965-75 to roughly 2% from 1975-2005 and 
1% from 2005-14, with no sign of a pickup in the most recent data (see Figure 
52).66

One interpretation of the low growth in measured productivity is that it refutes the 
narrative that innovation is vibrant. Indeed, some have argued that the ‘low-hanging 
fruit’ of innovation have been picked, as the benefits of previous transformative 
innovations (such as electrification or indoor plumbing) have been exhausted and 
that recent innovations have been much less significant than innovations in the 
past.67  

In our view, three alternative explanations are more relevant. First, we point to 
several limitations in the measurement of productivity. Second, even though 
productivity may not be mis-measured in a strict sense, changes in the composition 
of production have taken place that imply a wider distribution of productivities 
across firms and workers. In addition, it is likely, in our view, that sometimes the 
drastic changes in technology we see today require significant adaptation and 
learning to develop their full productive potential and there is reason to believe that 
the progress in various technologies seen to date will spawn even more significant 
innovations in the future.68 

Measurement Issues 
The view that current national account statistics are increasingly inadequate for 
modern economies and are therefore in need of some overhaul is gaining currency 
and has e.g. in the case of the UK led to an official review to suggest improvements 
in the statistics.69  

There is indeed evidence that current national account statistics probably 
understate quality improvements in a number of areas. Such understatements of 
quality improvement seem to be particularly evident for IT-related activity, such as 
the production of software (see Figure 53), where Copeland (2013) found that the 
US national account statistics probably understate the improvements in the quality 
of pre-packaged software by a factor of two.70 Other areas where quality 
improvements are probably insufficiently reflected are healthcare, education, 
government services, R&D and transportation.71 Note that for such mis-
measurement to account for even part of the slowdown in measured productivity; its 
scope must have grown over time. However, in our view, there is good reason to 
believe so, as the share of the sectors most likely to be affected by such biases has 
grown over time.  

                                                           
67 See e.g. Tyler Cowen (2011), “The Great Stagnation.” Also, Robert Gordon (2014), 
“The Demise of U.S. Economic Growth: Restatement, Rebuttal, and Reflections,” NBER 
Working Paper No. 19895. 
68 Our clients are also skeptical that a slowdown in innovation is to blame for the 
productivity slowdown in advanced economies, with a slowdown in investment and 
measurement problems the most widely cited factors. 
69 See https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-economic-statistics-call-
for-evidence/press-notice-charles-bean-kicks-off-review-to-future-proof-uk-statistics 
70 See Copeland (2013), “Seasonality, Consumer Heterogeneity and Price Indices: The 
Case of Pre-Packaged Software”, Journal of Productivity Analysis, February 2013. 
Quality improvements for non-prepackaged software (custom and own-account software) 
are likely to be even more understated, as the methodology used for those product types 
does not incorporate much scope to reflect improvements in quality. 
71 To potentially explain the slowdown in measured productivity, it is not sufficient that 
quality improvements may be understated, but rather they would need to be increasingly 
so. Even though an increase in the size of the bias for these products is often hard to 
establish, the growing size of the relevant sectors would suggest that a stable bias per 
sector indeed suggests an increasing overall bias in understating quality improvements. 

We offer three explanations for the low 
growth in measured productivity 

National accounts statistics are 
underestimating quality improvements in 
several areas

to 2013. 
Source: BEA, Copeland (2013) and Citi Research 

 
The measurement of productivity may also suffer from the fact that some types of 
activity do not appear at all in national account statistics. These include many 
activities that are usually not explicitly remunerated (such as the unremunerated 
services usually provided in the home referred to as ‘household production’, such as 
child-rearing, cleaning, cooking, tending the garden, etc.), and activities that are not 
categorised as value-added in national account statistics (e.g. some types of 
investment in intangibles, such as in brands). Current surveys may miss some of 
the production that is now more fragmented and produced by individuals (e.g. as 
part of the ‘app economy’), while other innovations that increase the ability to use 
existing capacity (such as ways to survey available capacities in real-time) are also 
often not included in GDP and productivity statistics. Improvements that save time 
but are not readily converted into monetary equivalents may also only be 
insufficiently reflected in national accounts. 

However, it is worth noting that the fact that some of these activities are not 
reflected adequately in GDP and productivity statistics does not necessarily imply 
that productivity growth is currently understated relative to the past. GDP statistics 
have always omitted a significant share of economic activity – e.g. a BEA study 
noted in 2012 that accounting for non-market household production would have 
raised nominal GDP in the US by 26% in 2010. One significant source of omitted 
activity, household production, has probably fallen over time relative to the size of 
the formal economy (the BEA notes that average weekly hours spent by women on 
home production fell from 40 hours in 1965 to 26 hours in 2010). And the shift from 
household production to formal work probably biased down the measurement of 
productivity in the past. 

In general, our clients seem to share the view that there are significant 
measurement difficulties- 81% think that recent technological developments are 
inadequately reflected in productivity statistics, and 36% think that this inadequacy 
is significant (see Figure 55 below).

Growing Polarisation in Productivity 
But in our view, true measurement errors are unlikely to account for all of the 
decline in measured productivity growth. In addition, compositional factors are likely 
to play a major role. One factor that may well be important is that there is some 
evidence that the dispersion of productivities across firms and workers has 
increased over time, a phenomenon we call ‘rising polarisation’ in productivity. 

For instance, a recent OECD study showed that productivity growth of the globally 
leading firms did not slow in the 2000s (the data run from 2000-2009) and was still 
3½% per year on average in the manufacturing sector. But productivity growth 
slowed for the ‘laggard’ firms to a mere 0.5% per year, and the discrepancy 
between productivity growth for the leading firms and the laggards has been 
growing. 72 The divergence between the productivity growth of leading firms and the 
remainder was even larger for firms in the service sector (Figure 56).

The dispersion of incomes across workers has also grown.73 This may be because 
some workers lack the skills needed to be very productive, they may lack the funds 
to invest in the required training or indeed in job search for more suitable and 
higher-productivity jobs. For example, a paper by the New York Fed recently noted 
that the share of recent college graduates that have low quality (low-paid or part-
time) jobs has risen over time. Compositional changes in the labour force (e.g. due 
to more migration, due to higher labour force participation in general or of women 
and older people) may also have contributed to lower measured productivity growth.  

The nature of recent innovation may also have played a part, as various of our 
studies have argued, i.e. recent innovation may well have become more disruptive 
and recent technological developments are increasingly of a ‘winner take all’ nature.  

This could be because recent innovations are less complementary (and more 
substitutive) to widely available skills than in the past and could therefore potentially 
replace and destroy a large(r) number of jobs. For instance, there is recent — and 
increasing — evidence of growing labour market polarisation. For example, the 
employment shares of both high- and low-skill workers have recently risen at the 
expense of the ‘squeezed middle’ in many advanced economies (see Figure 57).74 
Autor (2015) notes that in the US out of seven broad occupational categories 
ranked by pay (as a proxy for skill) employment shares of the higher-skilled/higher-
pay occupations generally expanded between 1940 and 1980. Since 1980, 
however, the employment shares of low-pay and high-pay jobs have expanded, 
while the number of middle-pay jobs has fallen and a similar pattern holds across a 
range of other advanced economies, too.  

The winner-take all nature of competition in some sectors is also likely to be 
relevant here. Furman and Orszag (2015) note that the share of firms earning very 
high returns in the US has risen over time (with the bulk of these firms residing in 
the technology or healthcare sectors).  

Some of These Shifts are Likely Temporary  
It is possible, indeed plausible, that some of the developments we discuss will fade 
over time. The measurement of activity is likely to improve and to in part catch up 
with the changes in the economy. Recent years have already seen a number of 
changes in national account statistics, including widening the scope of intangible 
investment included in GDP statistics. In this context, it is worth noting that 
measures of GDP and productivity growth in the mid-1990s were revised up, 
sometimes substantially, as time went on. For instance, Figure 58 shows that LP 
growth for 1996 was revised up from roughly 1% originally to close to 3% 
eventually.75

Review, May/June 2006, pp. 181-202. A notable revision occurred in 1999, when 
software purchased by firms was reclassified as business fixed investment rather than as 
an intermediate expense. The 1999 revisions boosted real GDP growth from 1987-1998

improve over time

On a substantive level, it is possible that for some of the recent technological 
changes to translate into meaningful increases in actual productivity, changes to 
skills, processes and capital are required. This adaptation takes both time and 
resources. That is, it may not be that current productivity is just mis-measured, but 
that actual productivity is subdued as the economy reorganises and retools to take 
full advantage of the opportunities that new technology has created.  

Indeed, the academic literature on general purpose technologies (GPTs) suggests 
the possibility of a temporary productivity slowdown, as the required adaptation 
takes place to use the new technology before productivity growth takes off.76 For 
instance, Brynjolfsson and Hitt77 highlight that in the 1990s it required 
complementary investments in organisational capital and new processes for IT-
related innovations to deliver productivity gains, which eventually materialised, while 
Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2011) note that electrification took 30 years in the US to 
produce major productivity gains.78  

Systematic empirical evidence of such effects associated with GPTs is very limited, 
in part because there are so few observations of these big technological changes.79 
Nevertheless, we certainly regard it as plausible that we are in the adaptation stage 
for some of the more recent innovations and that the productivity benefits of some 
of the recent innovations are yet to be reaped. In addition, there are good reasons 
to believe that the interaction of progress in the various technologies that are 
currently enjoying major (often exponential) progress will lead to additional major 

                                                                                                                                      
by an average of 0.4pp per year. The notable revisions prior to 1999 mainly reflect better 
measurement of source data, particularly in the durable goods manufacturing sector.

innovations in the future.80 A recent study by the Boston Consulting Group indeed 
forecasts that the economics for automation and robotics is nearing an inflection 
point, where the adoption rate of robotics and the resulting productivity gains, would 
pick up sharply – the study estimates that labour productivity per worker in the 
manufacturing sector could be boosted by 10-30% over the next ten years by 
improvements in automation alone.81 Our clients are also somewhat optimistic 
about future productivity growth, with a whopping 95% expecting that automation 
and technology will drive an increase in productivity growth over time (see figure 
below).

Productivity ≠ Innovation or Living Standards 
It is also worth keeping in mind that the translation of productivity into the issues we 
truly care about (such as changes in living standards or the capacity to supply, 
which, given demand, determines the path for inflation and interest rates) is far from 
perfect. In particular, GDP and productivity are based on spending, which implies 
that they are not automatically good reflections of consumer surplus (the value 
consumers’ capture over and above what they pay for). The fact that GDP and 
productivity statistics are based on expenditure weights also implies that fast-
improving sectors are likely to have increasingly smaller shares in consumption 
(unless the elasticity of demand in those sectors is very large). 

The discrepancy between GDP statistics and living standards may well be 
increasing. This is because in the world that is populated increasingly by products 
with very low (sometimes zero) marginal cost, the consumer surplus is often very 
high relative to the price paid, and it is only the latter that is counted in GDP and 
productivity statistics. 

Similarly, when it comes to increases in potential activity, measured productivity may 
not be the best guide. For instance, the sharing economy (including Uber, Airbnb, 
etc.) increases effective supply without finding their way into measured productivity 
statistics.

Impact of Automation on Inflation: 
What Does this Point Imply for 
Economic and Interest Rate Cycles?  
Highlights  

 The rise in automation and technology is likely to reinforce the current low 
inflation environment, due to increased uncertainty and the narrow distribution of 
productivity gains. There is also good reason to suspect that current price 
deflators and measures of inflation are overstated.  

 We may already be observing some of these effects given the Phillips curve has 
flattened. To close output gaps, demand stimulus will continue to be needed, with 
monetary policy remaining accommodative and more creative in most advanced 
economies.  

In recent years low inflation – sometimes referred to as ‘low-flation’ – has been 
common across most advanced economies (see Figure 61). Anecdotally, the 
technological changes we describe seem to be pushing down prices in a growing 
number of industries – and even beyond the digital ones into those where 
innovations are inputs. The rapid advances in technology therefore raise the 
question of whether they may put even more downward pressure on prices and 
therefore either prolong this low-flation scenario or push inflation down even further.

The implications of a relentless rise in automation on inflation and interest rates are 
likely to be complex. Ultimately we think that the major rise in automation will 
probably reinforce the low inflation environment that we have observed in at least 
the advanced economies in recent years and probably also low (nominal and real) 
interest rates, but whether it does so will depend both on the predictability of the 
‘Rise of the Robots’ as well as the distribution of the gains in productivity. However, 
the reasoning does not quite follow the conventional logic that current productivity 
gains are per se disinflationary, but owe much to their unpredictability and the 
narrow distribution of productivity gains.

Why High Productivity Growth Could Boost Rather Than 
Lower Inflationary Pressure 
In modern economies, central banks tend to be tasked to keep inflation close to an 
explicitly or implicitly defined target. As Milton Friedman famously remarked, 
inflation tends to be a monetary phenomenon. In general (or under the assumption 
that monetary policy is effective), monetary policy can steer inflation towards its 
desired range by varying demand through adjusting the various instruments at its 
disposal. Our exposition of the impact of innovation on inflation here proceeds 
under the assumption that monetary policy is either ineffective or indeed simply 
assumed to be invariant for expositional purposes to trace out the effects of 
automation and other types of innovation in the absence of an effective monetary 
policy reaction.  

In market economies, prices are the main tool to guide production decisions: prices 
are there to equilibrate supply and demand. If supply exceeds demand, prices 
should fall and if supply falls short of demand, prices should rise. To find out 
whether prices and inflation will rise or fall therefore depends on the effect of 
innovation on the balance of supply and demand (again, taking policy to be 
constant). The direct impact of the increase in productivity is an increase in potential 
supply. Other things equal, we would therefore expect inflation to fall, i.e. innovation 
would have a disinflationary impact.  

But usually there is an indirect impact too: as Say’s law indicates supply usually 
creates its own demand. So even abstracting from monetary policy, it is not 
automatically true that productivity increases will be disinflationary, and indeed they 
have not been so as a general rule.  

But increases in productivity may well be expected to continue in the future. In that 
case, the future would be even better than the — already improved — situation 
today. Households anticipating such a bright future would in general then be 
inclined to try to take advantage of some of those future gains and smooth their 
consumption by increasing consumption already today – for instance by borrowing. 
Companies would be tempted to invest today in anticipation of high returns (and, 
again, potentially try to borrow to do so). The expectation of persistent productivity 
gains could therefore on balance raise demand today even relative to the increase 
in supply. In this scenario, where productivity increases are expected to continue in 
the future and their spoils are likely to be distributed fairly evenly across the 
population, both real interest rates and, other things equal, inflation would rise, and 
therefore imply that nominal interest rates would rise even more.  

Such implications are not just theoretical, but can be observed fairly regularly (and 
at least locally) in the face of positive productivity shocks. For instance, major 
discoveries of natural resource deposits usually boost investment, consumption and 
the prices of nearly all products in its vicinity and sometimes for a country as a 
whole. The big boom in IT productivity in recent years in the Silicon Valley has also 
pushed prices of many other products (notably rents and house prices) up rather 
than down. Far from having a disinflationary impact, predictable and widely shared 
future productivity gains would therefore likely lead to higher inflation and higher 
real and nominal interest rates, not lower ones.

The Predictability and Distribution of Productivity Gains 
Matters 
Ultimately, the question of how productivity changes will impact inflation and interest 
rates will hinge on whether demand will rise faster than supply. For innovation to be 
disinflationary, demand must rise less than supply. What could hold back demand? 
The main candidates are uncertainty or a very unequal distribution of the spoils of 
innovation. If the technological changes spur increases in uncertainty – uncertainty 
about the trajectory of innovation or more generally – desired saving rates may rise 
for everyone.  

If the spoils of the innovations are highly concentrated, the saving rates of the 
techno-entrepreneurs may well fall and their demand rise. But meanwhile, the 
desired saving rates of those negatively affected or at least at risk of being 
negatively affected may well rise. If the number of people in the latter category is 
much larger than in the former category, the result could be an increase in the 
average desired saving rate in the economy – which would be disinflationary.  

Innovation Will Likely Reinforce Low-flation 
In our view, both conditions for demand to be held back are likely to be satisfied.  

First, forecasting the future is always uncertain, but for now, the lively debate about 
whether innovation even today is fast or lacking suggests that current uncertainty 
about future progress and innovation is unusually large. This is not only the 
uncertainty about the path that the technologies will take, but also what impact they 
will have on economies and societies. The pervasive increase in uncertainty will 
most likely boost precautionary saving motives for many households that consider 
themselves at risk from some of these potential changes, while the fear of disruption 
may weigh on the desire of many firms to invest. 

Absent significant changes in policy, the gains from these innovations are also likely 
to be very highly concentrated. As noted above, there is already some evidence of a 
‘winner take all’ nature of some recent innovations, with large between-firm 
differences in returns and income growth. There is, of course, also plenty of 
evidence by now that income and wealth inequalities have risen across most 
economies. It is therefore quite likely, in our view, that – absent an effective policy 
response – inequalities in wealth and income will widen further and that those 
increases in inequality in turn will boost average desired saving rates. Taken 
together, we therefore expect that even the prospect of persistent technological 
advances will probably boost supply today in the near future more than it will boost 
demand, which should reinforce the low-inflation outlook. 

In addition, the starting points are likely to be off. As we noted above, there are 
good reasons to suspect that current economic statistics understate quality 
improvements in many products. This would imply that many current price deflators 
— and current measures of inflation — would be overstated, as these price indices 
are mostly calculated on a quality-adjusted or ‘constant-quality’ basis. If much of the 
bias of understanding quality improvements in the statistics originates in investment 
spending, the investment goods deflator is likely to be most biased upwards and to 
a lesser extent that would also apply to the overall GDP deflator or the personal 
consumption expenditure (PCE).  

 

 

The question of how productivity changes 
will impact inflation depends on whether 
demand will rise faster than supply 

Absent an effective policy response, wealth 
inequality will increase and this will boost 
saving rates. Taken together technological 
advances will increase supply more than 
demand – this will reinforce the low-inflation 
outlook

Interestingly, our clients seem to be split on the effects of automation and innovation 
on job prospects: 51% of respondents in our client survey expect that innovation will 
create fewer jobs than it destroys, while 48% think that jobs created will exceed 
those lost. On inflation, the verdict seems clearer, with 66% expecting disinflationary 
effects to some degree (see figure below).

An interesting question is whether we may already be observing some of these 
effects. After all, unemployment rates in a range of advanced economies, including 
Japan, the UK, and the US are relatively low by historical standards and yet inflation 
is even lower (relative to historical norms). Indeed, there is plenty of literature by 
now on the observation that so-called Phillips curves (the usually negative 
relationship between inflation rates and the amounts of slack in the economy) have 
flattened. Put differently, there are signs that lower measured slack in the economy 
now puts less upward pressure on inflation than it used to in the past.

Monetary Policy Rates Will Likely Have to Remain Lower 
for Longer 
Inflation rates across the advanced economies are already far below central bank 
targets in most countries and not expected to reach them even over the next 1-2 
years (see Figure 64). As noted above, there is some evidence that even these very 
low inflation rates are still overstated and we think that the rapid advances in 
technology will likely reinforce the current low-flation trend, due to the uncertainty 
associated with them and the narrow distribution of the productivity gains.

It is therefore likely that the current gaps between supply and demand – which 
according to most estimates are large – will remain ample or possibly even widen. 
To close the gap, some type of demand stimulus will therefore continue to be 
needed. Even though fiscal policy probably has a major – and growing – role to 
play, as we discuss below, the use of fiscal policy in most advanced economies will 
probably continue to face major challenges and constraints. It is therefore highly 
likely, in our view, that monetary policy will continue to be and have to be very 
accommodative in most advanced economies.  

In the first place, that implies that policy interest rates are likely to remain low across 
most advanced economies for a long time. This is not to say that we will never see 
rate hikes, but we suspect that rate increases will be few and far between, often 
short-lived and sometimes reversed. Indeed, we expect that the historical lows for 
policy interest rates will be tested in more and more countries and that negative 
policy interest rates will become increasingly common.  

In addition, asset purchases — fast becoming the most conventional of the so-
called ‘unconventional’ monetary policy tools will continue to be used widely. But 
since even the more conventional of the unconventional tools of monetary policy 
(both on the interest rate side and on the asset purchase side) are already fairly 
stretched it is likely that monetary policy will become even more creative over time, 
including through buying an even wider range of assets than to date, more negative 
policy rates or explicit targets for certain asset prices (including the exchange 
rate).82

Sector Analysis: How is Automation 
Impacting Jobs in the Near Term?  
Highlights  

 Robots are extending their functions in manufacturing and are increasingly being 
used across supply chains, warehouses and transportation. 3D Printing could 
alter both manufacturing and supply chains.  

 We find increasing examples that technology is increasingly impacting lower-end 
service jobs. Restaurant automation of both ordering and paying, via tablets in 
store or mobiles out of store, is starting to impact labour. 

 Natural Language Processing could impact jobs in call centres and report writing, 
while automated decision support systems can impact tasks.  

 Technological change is expected to further impact employment in the media and 
telecom sectors, while Cloud computing could have a significant impact on IT 
employment.  

In the previous chapters we analysed the susceptibility of automation in countries 
and US cities and the effect on productivity and inflation. In this section our analysts 
report on the changes that they are already see happening in various different 
industries. Much of the work around the risks of jobs from automation looks at 
susceptibility over the next couple of decades. A natural follow on question has 
been- which areas look at higher risk in the near to medium term (3-5 years). Citi 
analysts highlighted a wide number of areas in the first Technology At Work GPS 
report and in this chapter we narrow in on several sectors including the food sector, 
journalism and business, call centres, factories and others impacted both by 
technological change and employing a large number of people.  

Figure 68 shows the ten most endangered jobs in the US in 2015, as listed on a 
website called Career Cast who used data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to 
estimate the jobs that have a negative growth outlook from 2012 to 2022. For 
comparison we have added the results on automation probabilities from Frey and 
Osborne’s Oxford Martin School study.  

Technology and computerisation is directly affecting at least four of these jobs 
including mail carriers and meter reader jobs which are expected to lose around 
28% and 19% respectively of their workforce by 2022, logging workers (-9%) and 
drill press operators (-6%). Most of these also have a high probability score of being 
automated. For example it was estimated that meter readers and mail carriers have 
a 0.85 and 0.66 probability of being automated (Figure 68). 83

Automation in the Restaurant Industry  
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates that in 2012 4.4 million people 
were working in the US as food and beverage workers and over 2.3 million were 
employed as waiters/waitresses. We previously noted in our first Technology At 
Work report highlighted that 86.7% of US Accommodation and Food Services jobs 
could be susceptible to automation. In the restaurant sector, technology influences 
are being seen across three main areas: digital ordering, loyalty, and labour. While 
most operators play down the near-term opportunity for tech-related labour savings, 
rising minimum wages and growing competition for staff might force automation into 
focus sooner than initially expected.  

While many restaurant chains have some sort of mobile or digital capability, quick 
service restaurants (QSRs) such as coffee shops and pizza parlours remain 
particularly well positioned to benefit from the increased adoption of technology, 
notably smartphones. Millennials are particularly prone to online ordering with 18% 
citing convenient ordering options as one of the top three reasons they order from 
their primary pizza location.

QSR coffee operators have also benefitted from the proliferation of smartphones 
and an uptick in mobile spending trends. In the fiscal third quarter of 2015 
Starbucks reported that roughly one in five transactions at US company-owned 
stores took place using the mobile app, up from 8% in the same quarter of 2013. 
Starbucks ‘Recall, Mobile Order & Pay’ allows customers to choose a store from a 
map view, browse, select, and customise beverage and food items, view the 
estimated timeframe the order will be ready, and pre-pay for his or her order. By 
September 2015 the company had completed the national rollout across its more 
than 7,400 stores. 

Casual dining operators have also increased automation efforts in recent years 
through the use of table-top tablet systems. Darden, Chili's and Buffalo Wild Wings 
have all implemented tablet-based solutions. These systems typically enable guests 
to see menu items, play games, view news, order food/beverages, and pay their bill 
at their table. One of the largest third-party restaurant tablet operators is Ziosk, 
which is currently installed at over 1,400 restaurants across the country (including 
Chili's and Olive Garden). Ziosk’s tablets enable restaurants to increase table turns 
and grow the average check. Additionally, the technology drives higher guest 
frequency, improves guest satisfaction, and increases the amount of guest feedback 
a restaurant receives. While there is a potential opportunity to save on labour, most 
companies who have deployed Ziosk to-date are focused on driving increased 
traffic and table turns, though we believe the potential labour savings could be a 
larger benefit moving forward.  

Industry commentators have frequently pointed towards increased labour 
competition as one of the most significant challenges facing today's restaurant 
operators. With numerous concepts expanding domestic unit counts, along with an 
overall improving employment picture in the US labour market, hiring and retaining 
workers has been a front-of-mind concern for operators for most of 2015. 
Restaurant wages have been steadily rising over the past several years and recent 
comments from Wendy's management suggest that the combination of rising 
minimum wages and increased competition is having a meaningful impact on 
operations. Given the changing environment the company could look to offset rising 
costs through self-service technologies.

"We continue to see pressure on wages on two fronts, one is minimum 
wages at the state level continue to increase, and as there is a war on 
talent to make sure that we're competitive in certain markets. So we've 
made some adjustments to that starting wage in certain markets. The 
impact hasn't been material at the moment, but we continue to look at 
initiatives on how we do work to offset any impact to future wage inflation 
through technology initiatives, whether that's customer self-order kiosks, 
whether that's automating more in the back of the house in the restaurant, 
and you'll see a lot more coming on that front later this year from us." 

   Todd Penegor, Wendy's CFO (2Q EPS 8/5/15)  

Recent comments from Domino's management have also noted labour savings as 
an increasing portion of overall orders come through digital channels, although 
meaningful savings took longer than initially anticipated: 

"When we were first getting digital ordering going, I will tell you that we 
expected labour efficiency faster than we saw it. We didn't really start 
seeing a lot of labour efficiency in the stores until we got to kind of the 15% 
to 20% digital order range….And the reality is that you've got a fixed 
amount of labour in stores to cover shift, to cover the basic functions in the 
store. And when it was a relatively low level of digital orders, your ability to 
offset labour was pretty minimal. As it's gotten higher, we started to see 
more impact from that. And we're in the range now with digital sales 
around 50% that we clearly can see some savings in the store." 

Patrick Doyle, Domino's CEO (3Q EPS 10/8/15)86. 

Natural Language Processing To Impact Call Centres  
Interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has grown by leaps and bounds 
over the past few years, thanks to IBM’s Watson (on the Jeopardy! show in the US) 
and Apple’s Siri. NLP is the ability of a computer program (machine) to understand 
and interpret human speech. Ideally, the human should not have to radically change 
the natural way they speak. While this sounds simple, it is mathematically intensive 
as it requires algorithms that perform word and sentence tokenisation, text 
classification and sentiment analysis, spelling correction, information extraction, 
parsing, meaning extraction, and question answering. 

There are a number of examples of NLP usage in our everyday lives. Obviously 
Apple’s Siri was mentioned above. Similarly, Google has an advanced NLP 
application that is used in searches. The Human-Machine Interface (HMI) of an 
advanced car can recognise and interpret over 5,000 words — this is often used in 
a car’s entertainment system to change channels or to call a person from a list. But 
when one considers productivity enhancing corporate applications, the use of NLP 
in call centres likely tops the list. In fact, when you call a live call centre agent and 
hear “this conversation may be recorded for training purposes”, it is most likely the 
NLP algorithms that are being trained! 

Simple voice recognition techniques have been used in call centres for over a 
decade. We are all familiar with IVR (interactive voice response) systems, which 
employ a combination of voice recognition and DTMF (dual-tone multi-frequency) 
tones input via the phone pad. IVR systems help improve call centre efficiency and 
reduce costs. They are now widely used in call centres to direct the flow of calls and 
answer simple questions. However, they are fairly primitive deployments of voice

techniques that tend to use key words and scripts that prompt the caller with 
specific questions and options. 

The leap forward is to understand context so that the machine-based speech 
interaction is as close to human interaction as possible. To be an effective service, 
NLP-based systems have to rely on open-ended questions — for example, “How 
may I help you?” — and understand not just the specific words a caller says, but 
also what that caller means.  

There are a couple of different impacts from such technology advancements.  

 There is already a loss of billable hours – this can either be outright job loss or 
fewer available hours for humans. This does not happen in every part of the call 
centre industry but has started to occur in both the telemarketing and the medical 
transcription areas of the broader call centre industry. 

 The “human” focus has shifted higher up in the stack of available jobs. In 
other words, simpler “Level 1” and “Level 2” jobs — those that involve simple 
information gathering, basic product knowledge and form-based trouble-shooting 
— can be automated. This implies that the average call handling time goes up 
since the remaining work is necessarily more complex. 

The three largest call centre destinations are the US, the Philippines and India. The 
US has over 2 million call centre jobs (this includes both in-house and outsourced 
jobs) while the Philippines is the largest outsourced call centre destination with over 
1 million call centre jobs. While the above-mentioned impacts are difficult to quantify 
(especially the part where technology causes a job to change from full-time to part-
time status), we believe that the trend will continue to be towards fewer but higher-
value and higher-paid call centre jobs.  

Natural Language Processing in Journalism & Business 
The production of language is notably easier than the complexities of interpreting 
language. The Associated Press (AP) is already producing thousands of financial 
stories through its joint venture with Automated Insights, a company that specialises 
in automated writing. They produce primarily fact reporting pieces currently. 
However, with the increase in computing capacity and machine expertise the 
complexity and number of fields automated writing can handle is increasing rapidly.  

The AP has also started sports reporting where articles were either unwritten or 
written by employed people. Similarly, companies such as Arria offer combined 
automated data analysis and report writing. These products combine statistics and 
pattern recognition-based data analysis with natural language reporting. As 
computers increase in speed and algorithms improve the analysis, automated report 
writing will only improve. 

The amount of written content produced daily is extraordinary, and the number of 
people involved in writing content is also high. In the United States in 2012, there 
were 129,100 writers and authors, 49,500 technical writers, 57,600 reporters and 
correspondents, and 63,600 interpreters and translators according to the BLS for a 
total of 299,800 jobs. These jobs cover most of the externally generated writing 
about companies, sports, local news, and other topics produced daily. Writers that 
focus on fact reporting are already under pressure in some areas, with others at risk 
through combining data analysis and automated report writing.

largest destinations for call centres

Internal reports by banks and other corporations about their financial condition, 
risks, credit reporting, and other topics are numerous, often produced daily, weekly, 
monthly, and quarterly. Management, audit, regulators, and investors all require 
analysis and reporting. In 2012, according to the US BLS there were 61,700 budget 
analysts, 253,000 financial analysts, 29,200 financial examiners, and 1,275,400 
accountants and auditors employed in the United States for a total of 1,620,000 
jobs. While not all of these jobs are gathering data in Excel, doing analysis or 
review, and then writing about the results, many of them are.  

Corporations are under extreme pressure to improve data collection and 
management due to regulatory requirements, management analytics, control 
processes, investor analytics, and the associated costs. While requirements for 
corporations to improve data collection and reporting could lead to increases in 
investment, the mechanical processing and reporting of information will likely 
experience greater disruption going forward.  

Technology Is Impacting Media Employment 
While technological change is everywhere, the pace of change seems particularly 
brisk within the media and telco sectors. Indeed, over the last decade, we’ve seen 
dramatic changes: 

 In 2004, Blockbuster Entertainment employed 60,000 people across the globe. 
With the rise of Netflix, the firm filed for bankruptcy in 2013. 

 In 2002, over 700,000 Americans worked in the newspaper, book and directory 
publishing business. With the rise of the Internet, employment in this sector of the 
economy dropped to just 450,000 by 2012. And, the US Labor Department 
expects further job losses. Physical publishing will employ just under 350,000 
people by 2022. 

 In 2002, over 840,000 Americans worked for the US Postal Service (USPS). With 
the rise of email and social media, USPS employment dropped to 610,000 in 
2012. The US Labor Department expects employment at the USPS to drop to 
below 350,000 by 2022. 

 In 2000, US consumers purchased over 1 billion CDs. With the rise of iTunes, 
Spotify and Pandora, US consumers purchase fewer than 200 million albums 
today. And, with the collapse of the physical music market retailers like HMV, 
FYE, Sam Goody and Tower Records all but disappeared. 

 With the rise of mobile phone services, US consumers are increasingly 
terminating their landline phone service. In 2002, nearly every US household had 
a landline connection. By 2015, only 50% of US households paid for a home 
phone. In tandem, employment in the telecommunications sector has fallen from 
1.28 million in 2002 to just 860,000 in 2012. The US Labor Department expects 
telecommunications employment to keep falling reaching just 807,000 by 2022. 

While you might think that the lost employment in areas like publishing, 
telecommunications and the US Postal Service would migrate to newer industries 
like web hosting or software publishing, job gains in these digital sectors are scant. 
In 2002, software publishing and web hosting services employed 680,000 people. 
By 2022, just over 810,000 people will work in these two sectors. Indeed, between 
2002 and 2012, 33 legacy jobs were lost for every new digital job that was created.

Decision Support Systems in Medicine 
Decision support systems have a long history in computer science. Some of the 
attempts at modern artificial intelligence were simple rules engines, but the origins 
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) go back much further, perhaps as far back as Aristotle’s 
syllogism. Some of the core mathematical concepts of AI were already in 
development by the time of Thomas Bayes (1702-1761) and Pierre-Simon Laplace 
(1749-1827). Bayesian methods are still one of the primary techniques for machine 
learning, and implementation of the probabilistic models they create are a 
fundamental technique of AI. Given a set of data, Bayesian methods calculate the 
conditional probability of an outcome.  

Many fields require deductive reasoning, and one of the most common of those is 
medicine, and particularly diagnostic medicine, which gathers symptoms and test 
data to form an opinion on a particular case. Fifty years ago there were far fewer 
blood and tissue tests available, and the accuracy of those tests had a large error 
term. For example, the resolution of the X-ray wasn’t very clear, and magnetic 
resonance imaging didn’t exist. Doctors had severely limited amounts of 
information, and often no information until the condition became acute. Medicine, 
like many fields, has become a field of both hard data, i.e. number of white blood 
cells of different types in a patient’s bloodstream, and soft data from the patient, i.e. 
“it hurts over here”. Most patients aren’t able to identify when their spleen hurts, so 
data from the patient might be understandably vague. With the refinement of 
biomarker tests, genetic testing, high-resolution X-rays, MRIs, PET scans, dual x-
ray bone densitometers and countless other technologies, the practice of diagnostic 
medicine is changing. Diagnostic medicine is becoming a mechanical process of 
ordering tests, reviewing automatically generated results and drawing a data-driven 
conclusion. Testing laboratories typically provide acceptable ranges for results along 
with the result itself, making it even easier for doctors to focus on a subset of data 
most relevant to the case.

Proactive scanning for potential issues would allow significantly earlier diagnosis, 
and in some cases determines successful or unsuccessful outcomes. Increased 
automation can help reduce the cost of testing, and how much human time it would 
take to review all the data. Moving to a higher level, systems such as IBM’s Watson 
for Medicine can be described as “cognitive diagnostic engines”. By accessing 
patient data, prior diagnoses, journal articles, and using data and natural language 
processing to form patterns of diagnosis, a machine with a large amount of data and 
the right algorithms can perform diagnoses that approach or exceed the 
performance of an experienced doctor. Most medical diagnoses “fit” within a 
recognised pattern with constraints, exactly what machines do well. Unlike humans, 
machines will not make mistakes because it is tired or be blinded by false bias or 
pre-judge a situation. Cognitive diagnostic engines will also be assimilating new 
information, and can near instantly share that information across all machines like it. 

A frequent complaint about decision support systems from human practitioners in 
medicine is that machine decisions are typically difficult to understand or in some 
cases interrogable. When implementing AI systems in finance we hear exactly the 
same complaint. One of the critical areas of development needed in these systems 
is to provide AI with a method to explain why it arrived at a particular conclusion. 
The natural language production methods described above are an important 
component of that. When decision support systems improve their ability to provide 
insight into their decision, greater acceptance is likely to come next. 

Functions employed in the medical industry will shift towards more technology and 
the industry will attract engineers, data scientists, and researchers. Non-specialised 
family physicians may find themselves marginalised by health centres staffed with a 
team of nurse practitioners armed with Watson Health and overseen by a single 
doctor. One example of commoditisation of medicine is evident with eye doctor 
offices in chain eyeglass stores. The impact on employment in medicine will likely 
be greater specialisation, more technical and engineering staff, and reduction in the 
number and compensation of mid-skilled participants 

Impact of Cloud Computing on IT Employment  
Technology overall is about driving automation, human productivity, and process 
efficiency and thus for many years has been at odds with employment growth. 
Examples here are countless. The manual phone operator was replaced with 
automated switchboards and PBX systems. Forms processing (highly people 
intensive) has been replaced by an end-to-end digital process (IT-based), reducing 
employment in areas such as claims processing in insurance and new customer 
activation in telecommunications. Floor brokers in stock exchanges and clerks in 
clearinghouses have been replaced with computer systems that automatically 
match up and clear trades. The majority of these gains that have come from 
adoption of IT have been in non-IT areas. IT has used technology itself to drive 
increased automation, productivity, and efficiencies. Over time, the incremental 
demand for IT, driven by price elasticity, has usurped the efficiency gains IT has 
found in its own organisation. Over the last 12 years, IT headcount has grown by 
4% (~6x overall employment growth) in the US with total employment of 
approximately 4 million people (3% of workforce).  

Machines like IBM’s Watson can perform 
diagnoses that exceed the performance of 
an experienced doctor 

The medical industry will shift towards more 
technology attracting more data scientists, 
engineers etc.

The mainstream adoption of cloud computing has the potential to change this 
dynamic. The disruptive trend here, in our view, is the advent of utility-like public 
cloud services from the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. These providers 
have assembled IT capacity that is several orders of magnitude greater than what 
the largest corporate buyers of IT run in house (banks, telecoms, and government 
agencies), not to mention exponentially dwarfing the scale of the average IT shop. 
As customers adopt Amazon’s AWS, they no longer need to manage their own 
servers and employ as many systems administrators to perform these duties. The 
public cloud players employ scale and automation that enables a very low ratio of 
headcount to IT capacity. For example, we believe a well-run enterprise IT 
organisation has “server to admin” ratio of 40:1. In the technology industry, where 
companies are running businesses primarily off their servers, we hear of ratios of 
~150:1. We believe highly automated public cloud services are able to run 5,000+:1 
ratios. Here, some quick math would suggest that 124 system administrators or 
support personnel could be eliminated for each 5,000 servers that move to the 
public cloud. Also, over time, as internal IT groups are pressured by the economics, 
they will be forced to run their operations more efficiently. This indirect pressure will 
likely lead to further automation and an increase in the server to admin ratio.

Our analysis of US IT employment suggests that nearly 50% of the 4 million jobs 
(above coloured dark blue) could ultimately be at risk if IT operations move 
substantially to the public cloud. This would include job titles such as systems 
administrator, database administrators and IT support professional. 

The potential counterpoint here is whether the general efficiencies of cloud 
computing drive enough elasticity of demand that there is an acceleration in job 
creation in areas such as software programmers and generally in the technology, 
telecom and Internet industries. These fields/industries employ 5-6% of the US 
population and will likely to continue to see secular growth despite potential 
pressures in other areas of IT.  

The Increased Use of Robots in Warehouses 
Amazon continues to take share within retail and automate the processes within the 
120 giant warehouses that it has worldwide. Since acquiring Kiva Systems (now 
Amazon Robotics) in 2012 for $775 million, Amazon employs about 30,000 Kiva 
robots in 13 fulfilment centres (as of Oct 2015), up from 1,400 at the end of 2013. In 
total it is estimated in 2015 that over 780,000 people in the US were employed in 
warehousing and storage centres.87 

Amazon’s workers used to roam around in the warehouses searching for the 
products needed to fulfil each order. Now, with the help from Kiva robots, the 
shelves themselves glide across the floor to the workers, who then pick and pack 
the goods. According to Amazon, Kiva robots have significantly reduced the order 
processing time from 1.5 hours to as fast as 13 minutes. 

While the mobile shelves are faster and more efficient, having workers pick the 
items off the shelves by hand is still an expensive and tedious task. This inspired 
the Amazon Picking Challenge in 2015, to find ways to replace the human stock 
picker with robots. The winning team came from the Technical University of Berlin.

Beyond robotic shelves, items in Amazon warehouses are also tracked from arrival 
to dispatch from a computer system. Upon arrival, items are recognised by a 
sophisticated computer vision system after they are unpacked. At the packing side, 
computers allocate the right box for each order with its knowledge of the dimensions 
of each product. The computer even allocates the right amount of packing tape.

Moreover, before boxes are sent to trucks for dispatching, they are weighed to 
make sure no mistakes have been made in packing. 

While Amazon may be at the forefront of bringing the savings and scalability of 
robots into warehouses, logistics and distribution, we believe Alibaba and other e-
commerce makers in China are also keen to develop their own robot logistic 
systems.  

In China, the warehouse gross floor area (GFA) per capita is only 1/10 that of US. 
Given strong ecommerce momentum, at a CAGR of 21% in 2014-17E, demand for 
warehouses should be strong, especially for modern warehouses equipped with 
automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS). In 2012, there were ~1,200 
warehouses with ASRS in China and ~130 units were under construction. CLTA 
forecasts that the market size of ASRS could deliver a CAGR of 17% in 2011-15E, 
to Rmb32 billion ($4.9 billion). 

The adoption of ASRS should significantly reduce labour for transporting items into 
and out of inventory, allowing more accurate tracking of inventory and reducing 
inventory levels. However, it is the surging land price that is driving the application 
of ASRS in China, allowing for more storage space due to high-density storage with 
narrower aisles. On the same piece of land, warehouse with ASRS could be built as 
high as ~50 metres, to house more than 10 times the volume of a traditional 
warehouse.  

ASRS also ushers in Just-In-Time production, which requires sub-pallet level 
availability of production inputs. ASRS is a much faster way of organising the 
storage of smaller items next to production lines. This enables a seamless link to 
order processing and logistics management in order to pick, pack, and ship product 
out of the facility. By tracking and analysing the data of raw materials through 
finished goods, companies can control inventory levels, maximise the use of 
warehouse space, and are more prepared for the demands and supplies of the 
market, especially during special circumstances such as a peak season. 
Accordingly, the advanced production mode would require various hardware and 
software suppliers to complete the production process, creating jobs in smart 
equipment manufacturing, system design & integration, installation & maintenance, 
as well as customised transportation & delivery.  

Visual & Environment Processing and Cargo 
Transportation 
Many different fields use visual processing, where the extraordinary rise in the 
quality of optical sensors, significant reduction in their cost, and exponential 
increase in computing and algorithm capability is driving rapid improvements and 
expanded capability. Visual processing is typically used to map an environment and 
recognise objects. Other technologies such as LIDAR perform related tasks, also 
mapping the physical environment. One of the highest profile examples of visual 
and environment processing is in autonomous vehicles. Unlike humans, machines 
don't get tired, get distracted, have road rage, drink or text and drive, and they can 
monitor 360 degrees of visual field continuously rather than the typical human limit 
of about 200 degrees, not to mention the optical nerve's blind spot. While 
components might fail, sensors and machines are often developed to alert for a 
failure condition, and can be made redundant. On October 9th, 2015, the California 
Department of Motor Vehicles released its conclusions on the nine accidents to date 
involving self-driving cars in that State. All were determined to be human error.88

The adoption rate of autonomous vehicles will accelerate over the next decade due 
to the impact on human safety and also financial impacts through insurance industry 
changes. 

Multiple articles have described the potential economic impact of autonomous 
vehicles. “A World Without Work” by Derek Thompson89 cites driving as the single 
most common occupation for American men. Away from the more obvious jobs, taxi 
driving and trucking, there are other potential economic impacts as well. Computer 
vision and the development of autonomous vehicles could lead to fully autonomous 
transportation of goods from factory to end consumer, and disruption of the trucking, 
shipping, retail, and insurance industries.  

There are about 20,000 general cargo ships and 5,000 container ships operational 
at any given time in the world. Machines guided by humans already do most of the 
loading, transporting, unloading, and delivery of standardised units of trade due to 
the size and weight of the objects involved. With autonomous trucking, robotic 
warehouses, and self-driving delivery on the horizon there might be near zero or 
zero human work needed from the point of factory straight through to consumer 
delivery. The technology for all these functions already exists and the components 
are either partially or fully deployed or being tested. Daimler-Benz is testing 
autonomous trucks in its Future Truck 2025 program. Amazon repeatedly shows its 
brilliance and flexibility in logistics, and Bombardier's automated people movers 
(Bombardier.com) are one of the leaders in automated trains with over 40 years of 
operation. With machine vision and environmental processing as critical 
components the transport and shipping industries may change radically and employ 
far fewer people in the years ahead.  

Automation in Supply Chains  
With raw material prices stable or on the decline, labour inflation continues to be the 
biggest challenge to apparel & footwear manufacturers’ input costs (~15% growth 
year-on-year), and the industry is not seeing any meaningful offset from recent 
currency devaluation/a stronger US dollar. Nevertheless, the industry has been 
effectively mitigating higher wage costs with increased supply chain efficiencies, 
notably lean manufacturing, automation, and improved technology. New 
technologies include: (1) the use of 3D printing for creating rapid prototypes, 
drastically reducing production cycle times; and (2) systems integrating real-time 
POS data to inform the production process and thus reduce inventory risk.  

While currently only utilised by a small percentage of the industry, over time 
automation should enable vendors to bring manufacturing to local markets, thus 
drastically reducing shipping times (for example from 4+ weeks from Asia to days). 
Automation will also benefit the consumer by enabling new opportunities for 
customer personalisation/customisation. However, the majority of the industry is still 
several years away from investing in the systems, staff training, and adjusting their 
organisational structure in order to leverage these newer advances, with an 
estimated 85% of retail companies still operating as they did 15 years ago on 
manual spreadsheets and lack of real time data. 

Nike remains at the forefront of supply chain innovation in the industry with early 
automation used in its Flyknit platform. Management highlighted opportunities to 
eventually lower overhead and increase quality in more than 50% of Nike’s current 
production through automation. The company recently completed pilot testing on

automated stitching, reducing production on a typical size run of its iconic Air Force 
1 shoe from over 500 components across multiple factories to just a single machine 
and operator (savings of $0.18 per pair of shoes). The company is also in the early 
stages of a new partnership with Grabit to automate material adhesion, logistics, 
and distribution process. 

The Increased Use of Robots in Factories  
Henry Ford II (president of Ford): Walter, how are you going to get those robots to 
pay your union dues? 

Walter Reuther (leader of the automobile workers union): Henry, how are you going 
to get them to buy your cars?90 

The above conversation allegedly took place in the early 1950s, yet seventy years 
later assembly line workers still exist, especially in small parts assembly where 
humans have tended to trump robots on flexibility, adaptability, and the ability to 
visually identify and select small components hidden amongst an assortment of 
other parts.  

Is that about to change? Earlier this year, numerous press reports picked up on the 
rise of robots to replace production assembly workers in China. Guangdong 
Everwin Precision Technology commented that “by using 60 industrial robots, an 
assembly line that would have needed about 600 workers in the past now needs 
just 100.” The investment was seemingly made to counter labour shortages in the 
region, but still evoked fears in the popular press that robots could finally replace 
labour on the assembly line. The rise of co-bots — collaborative robots that can 
work alongside human labour on a factory floor (rather than in a segregated area for 
safety reasons, as is common on an auto assembly line) — has stoked this 
argument further. Lights-out factories (factories that require no human presence 
onsite) already exist — Fanuc, a robot manufacturer, famously already has factories 
that can run without human intervention.  

Small parts assembly has (so far) been relatively more immune to robotics than in 
the auto industry. Human hands are more adaptable (so can switch tasks) than 
most robots, and small parts assembly is different to the predictive and repetitive 
process of welding or painting in an auto plant. Features like dexterous grippers, 
sensitive force control feedback, and visual identification software are changing this. 
This year’s Hannover Messe in Germany saw the commercial launch of ABB’s Yumi 
co-bot — as well as several from other manufacturers — with small parts assembly 
a key target market. 

A couple of recent visits to factories in southern Japan highlighted not just the scale 
of automation at some plants but, more importantly, the scope for more work to be 
automated. In northern Kyushu we visited a Unipres facility which mainly supplies 
pressed parts to Nissan. This plant employs 365 full-time employees but has more 
than 500 Fanuc robots. These robots are picking up random parts from bins 
delivered to their cells (taking advantage of Fanuc's 3D vision systems) and then 
literally handing them over to the next robot which sets them in place to be welded 
(again by robots), before being assembled by more robots. Some processes like 
loading sheet metal into the magazine of a press are still labour intensive but it 
seems likely that this kind of job could be easily automated. This plant does have 
one co-bot supplied by Yaskawa, and its name is Kathleen.

manger representative of Ford.

At THK's main linear guide assembly plant in Yamaguchi prefecture there are nearly 
700 full-time employees. As the products being assembled are smaller, with more 
customisation, the level of automation was much less. We counted less than 30 
small-sized, compact robots including a number of Fanuc's parallel-link robots, 
Fanuc's arm sized LR mate robots and Nachi's M-207 high speed assembly robot. 
However, what literally stood out were the five Nextage humanoid robots supplied 
by Kawada. With bi-lateral vision, these robots are employed at two places 
assembling linear guides, working outside of a cage with no safety curtain. These 
robots have name tags and we were impressed to hear that one robot called 
"Katunori" is at least 30% more efficient than his human counterparts. THK said that 
this plant has been visited by three large Japanese auto OEMs recently who all 
want to see these guys at work. THK plans to increase the number of robot workers 
but recognises the need to balance the concerns of full-time employers in a rural 
area with limited alternative job opportunities. 

In Aichi Prefecture, we also recently toured OSG's largest cutting tool plant, which 
employs 450 people. With an average lot size of only 130 pieces (and monthly 
capacity of 1.5 million pieces) the manufacturing process is largely already 
automated but most of the inspection is still done visually. This is slowly changing 
as advancements in high-spec vision inspection systems means that this process 
can now also be automated with workers moved over to packaging and loading. 
However, with companies like Daifuku now collaborating with robot supplier 
Yaskawa to automate these very unique steps in the value chain, we wonder if this 
is the next process to be automated.  

Automation 2016: 3D Printing 
Additive manufacturing, also known to many as 3D printing, has the long term 
potential to revolutionise the manufacturing landscape. The technology combined 
with innovations in computer design software (CAD) will digitise production and 
enable deeper levels of automation across the manufacturing workflow. We believe 
the digital factory floor has the potential to expand the limits of product design, form, 
and function. More importantly, at-scale additive manufacturing could drive 
manufacturing to new levels of efficiency by automating the human elements of 
production (both design and operations).  

Today’s 3D printers have yet to achieve the speed, capacity, and most importantly 
the price to rival traditional manufacturing processes such as injection moulding and 
milling. However our visits to 3D printing service bureaus revealed that a factory 
floor with north of a hundred machines could be operated by shifts of no more than 
a dozen workers. While some engineers were on site to monitor and manage the 
builds, a majority of the staff were simply emptying build boxes and replenishing 
print materials.  

There are several markets where 3D printing has or will make an immediate impact. 
We believe the medical implants market will be one of the first to convert to a fully 
digital manufacturing process. In one sub segment of this, the manual process of 
creating dental moulds and implants has begun shifting to 3D labs. With small 
commercial machines falling below the $10,000 price range we have even seen a 
shift towards dentists bringing those capabilities in-house and cutting out the service 
centre completely. Special effects departments have also shifted a lot of prop 
making capabilities to 3D printing. The props are more realistic and cheaper to 
make with 3D printing.

Lastly we have seen the slow demise of the traditional model makers and job 
shops. This is a very broad category, but many larger manufacturers employ 
regional workshops to create one off jigs, fixtures, prototypes, and other products. 
We believe this lesser known craftsman has seen the most immediate impact from 
3D printing and has made some headlines with unions in Detroit calling out that 3D 
printing has driven down the value of these jobs. Some job shops have adapted by 
rebuilding their businesses by incorporating the 3D technology. 

The next big step of the 3D printing revolution will require CAD software vendors 
like Autodesk, PTC and Dassault to get more involved in additive manufacturing. By 
more tightly integrating the hardware with software, the digital production workflow 
process from design to production would be completely automated. Given 3D 
printing allows for complete freedom of design, it could enable the creation of 
structures previously unbuildable, including moving components within parts. The 
ability to print moving parts within a single build could potentially eliminate the need 
for factory workers to assemble the finished product.  

At this time, 3D printing is not completely absent human involvement; technicians 
are still needed to periodically monitor the fabrication process, empty build boxes, 
replenish consumables, and perform some post processing (remove excess build 
material and in some instances polish items). However, even these basic manual 
processes are likely to be eliminated as printer original equipment manufacturers 
(OEMs) are already trying to incorporate monitoring and continuous printing 
capabilities into systems.  

In conclusion we see a number of industries that are already computerising and 
automating a number of their tasks. The technology is improving at a fast pace, as 
shown in our discussion on natural language processing and decision support 
systems. Costs of automation are also expected to decrease over time as 
highlighted in the next chapter, removing the economic barriers over time and 
therefore encouraging new industries which have traditionally kept away from 
automation to introduce such systems.

What are the Barriers to 
Automation? 
Highlights  

 As technology improves, one of the biggest barriers to adoption should be the 
economic cost of investment. However payback periods for robots are falling fast: 
1.7 years for the most popular auto robot used in China; less than half a year in 
metal manufacturing in Germany; less than 2 years for hospital co-bots; or 195 
days for Universal Robot’s co-bot. This is positive for companies and consumers, 
but not for workers.  

 However there remain some barriers especially in SME’s which pride themselves 
on their fixed to variable ratio, and have additional burdens such as high 
installation costs for bespoke systems. 

 Other barriers besides costs remain such as finding the right skills for the jobs 
available and systems lock in with proprietary systems, even though robots using 
open platforms are increasing. 

As robots become faster and cheaper they will revolutionise the manufacturing and 
service industry. The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) have estimated that 
global sales of industrial robots are expected to grow 15% year on year with the 
number of units expected to double to around 400,000 units in 2018.91 Service 
robots are also expected to increase to around 35 million units with a sales value 
upwards of $12 billion from 2015 to 2018.  

Despite strong potential growth, there nevertheless still exist barriers to the 
widespread adoption of automation and robotics in various sectors. These include 
the initial capital investment required, a shortage of skills and expertise, and a lack 
of understanding of how companies, especially small and medium firms can 
produce an attractive return on their investment.92 As we will see from this chapter 
the costs of industrial robots are decreasing, therefore reducing the economic 
barriers to their adoption. Collaboration robots are also becoming an affordable 
solution for SMEs that address both the costs and flexibility needs of these 
companies.  

Industrial Robots: Manufacturing 
Industrial robots are not new and have been in operation since the 1960’s. They are 
primarily used in just four industrial sectors: (1) the auto industry, (2) computers and 
electronics, (3) electrical equipment and appliances; and (4) machinery. Robots are 
used for a number of different applications including spot and arc welding in the 
auto and metal manufacturing industry, material handling, palletising and various 
operations for metal machining and plastic moulding, assembly, and pick and place, 
product inspection; all accomplished with high endurance, speed, and precision. 
Historically they have been quite expensive to own and operate and therefore are 
mainly found in large factories owned by large corporations with large budgets.93

But robots are getting cheaper and the economic and technical barriers to their 
adoption are beginning to fall. In fact the Boston Consulting Group has estimated 
that the cost of a typical spot welding robot used in the U.S automotive industry will 
decrease from $133,000 in 2014 to $103,000 in 2035.  

Even though the cost of robots is an important factor in a company’s decision to 
automate, issues such as the cost of labour, labour shortages, productivity gains 
and quality improvements are also important. Figure 78 below shows the average 
manufacturing wages in the US, UK, Japan and China. Despite China currently 
having among the lowest manufacturing wages, it is currently ramping up 
automation and is becoming the largest and fastest growing robotics market in the 
world. This push towards automation is in response to the rising labour wages 
which have risen by over 40% between 2010 and 2013 and are predicted to 
continue to increase over time (Figure 79).

Due to the decreasing costs of robots and increasing labour wages over time, the 
payback period of a typical 165kg spot welding articulated robot used in the auto 
industry is expected to decrease in China from 2.5 years in 2013 to 1.3 years in 
2017 (see table below). The costs of the automation could decrease even further if 
components are built in China itself, rather than imported.

Similar results are seen for a typical arc welder robot system which is traditionally 
used in the metal industry. Based on an ABB ARC flex 250R robot system and using 
current wages in the metal manufacturing industry, current payback periods in the 
US, UK, Germany, and Japan for this particular system are estimated at less than 
half a year and over 2 and 5 years in China and Thailand respectively (refer to 
Figure 81). The cost of the robot system is estimated at $80,000 and operational 
costs for the system are calculated at one person per robot as stated by ABB on 
their website. The ARC welder robot system replaces 3 people per shift as it is 
assumed to work continuously for 2 shifts replacing 6 people in total. If we assume 
a 6% decrease in the cost of the robot arm every year, and an increase in China’s 
and Thailand’s labour wages (based on wage increases in the previous years) then 
the payback period for this particular system would reduce to 1.2 and 2.6 years 
respectively in 2017. 

Figure 81. Current Payback Periods for a Typical Arc Welder  Figure 82. Payback Period Decreases Over Time  

 

 

 
Source: Citi Research 

The payback period is based on the cost of the robot system, average wages for metal manufacturing (for China and Thailand average manufacturing wages were used) and 
replacement labour based on 2 shifts. The costs also take into account a 5% additional potential savings through reduced staff welfare costs, optimised energy consumption, 
increased throughput and reduced wages.  

 
Manufacturers, especially SMEs, pride themselves on their fixed to variable cost 
ratio. But even though the payback time of a robot is falling, the robot is still a fixed 
cost. During a recession period, factories will typically reduce shifts by laying off 
some workers to reduce expenses. If instead of workers, they borrowed money to 
buy a robot they, would still be paying interest on the loan even though the robot 
would temporarily be left idle. The good news is that there is a second hand robot 
market, so companies can claw back some of their investment if they determine that 
it is not feasible to keep the robotic system in place. 

There is also however an additional cost burden — that of installation costs, 
especially for bespoke systems. The costs in our payback analysis only include 
robot systems (including tooling) and operational costs but do not include any 
installation and/or programming costs. These costs could be quite high, and are 
estimated at approximately 35-45% of the total costs of the automation.96 In the 
case of large firms, these costs can be avoided if the firm has adequate skills on 
site and therefore has the capacity to install these systems themselves. For others 
this would mean hiring a number of engineers to undertake such a task or paying

programming fees. But the installation for certain robot systems are becoming a lot 
easier. This is where collaboration robots come in to play — they are cheaper, less 
complex, and work directly with humans; however they are considered to be slower 
when compared to traditional industrial robots.  

Collaboration robots (Co-Bots) 
What makes collaboration robots different from regular industrial robots is that they 
work next to a person and there is no need for safety cages or other equipment or 
guards normally used with industrial robots. They also don’t need to be 
programmed to do one specific task and can easily be taught to do new tasks for 
different applications. This is especially helpful for SMEs as one of their concerns is 
that their orders change from time to time requiring changes to be made to their 
manufacturing process. A quote from Chip Gear the president of Technology House 
who has a 72-employee manufacturing firm which produces medical devices and 
currently automates parts of this manufacturing process, highlights such issues: 
“Robots can work 24 hours a day. You set up the raw material and take off a 
finished part…But what scares a lot of smaller manufacturers like us is that you 
have repetitive work and when orders change or the parts mix changes it requires 
reprogramming or even a new robot.”97  

Collaboration robots are affordable and are not overly complex to set up; therefore 
there is no need for specialist knowledge to operate them. Examples of co-bots 
include Baxter and Sawyer made by Rethink Robotics and UR5 and UR10 made by 
Universal Robots. Sawyer is currently marketed at a base price of $29,000 and can 
be used for kitting, packaging, loading and unloading, machine tending, material 
handling, and electrochemical machining (ECM) automation. The price includes a 
one year warranty and a one-year subscription to software capability and additional 
tools and subscription packages are available. The UR5 robot is used for 
applications such as pick and place, injection moulding, packaging and palletising, 
and quality testing, it is currently marketed at a base price $34,000. Universal 
Robots claims that the average payback period for their UR-robot is 195 days.98

The relatively cheap cost of collaboration robots could ultimately change the 
manufacturing platform of SMEs. One of the barriers to the wide-adoption of co-bots 
is convincing clients of the benefits of collaborative solutions. The technology is also 
expected to improve over the coming years, so SMEs and other companies are 
worried about getting locked into a particular system when the technology is still at 
an early stage. They are however priced at less than an average person’s salary in 
developed countries which means that the return on investment would be relatively 
quick, and they allow more flexible manufacturing practices when compared to the 
traditional industrial robots — something that SMEs typically require. To date, the 
sale of co-bots are only a small proportion of the total industrial robots sold per year 
with Universal Robots selling about 3,500 units of its co-bots since 2008 and only a 
few hundred Baxter’s have been sold since its launch in 2012.99 We do not believe 
these figures illustrate the future potential of the co-bot market. 

Competing Robotic Warehouse Systems: The Increase in 
E-Commerce and Automation 
Packing and palletising industrial robots have been used for many years to prepare 
products for their end-use. Now large warehouse systems are installing 
robots/automated systems to also fetch and pack. These automated warehouse 
workers, the most well-known of which are Amazon’s Kiva robots, typically use 
barcodes and other identifiers to find products stored in a warehouse and move 
them to a shipping queue. Other robots that are being used in this sector include the 
Carrypick system by Swisslog, GreyOrange and Fetch Robotics. Swisslog states 
that that their click and pick system which includes conveyer and lifting technology, 
warehouse management software, and preconfigured systems such as carry pick 
has a payback period of 2.4 years. This assumes a labour cost of $20/hour, average 
inventory value of $1,000,000 and building costs estimated at $11/square 
foot/month. The payback period increases to 3.6 years with labour costs estimated 
at $10/hour and inventory value at $500,000. Therefore low wage countries would 
see payback periods for warehouse automation to be much longer.

Health Care Robots 
The health care sector has been using robotics and technology for many years, 
most notably the Da Vinci system a $1.5 million robot that assists in surgery. It was 
given approval by the FDA in 2000 and since then the system has performed 
minimally invasive surgery on more than 2.5 million patients worldwide.100 It has 
also paved the way for new robotic advancements in health care including 
telemedicine which improves efficiency, and other important robots that are used for 
collecting, preparing and sorting medications, collecting and analysing laboratory 
samples, and caring, supporting and helping elderly and disabled people. Given 
estimates of a health care worker shortage in the robots/automation will likely play a 
very important role in making the health care sector more efficient and effective. 

An example of a robot that can help improve efficiency in hospitals is the TUG 
robots developed by Pittsburgh-based Aethon. These robots move around the halls 
delivering medical supplies, blood, meals and more, and use lasers to avoid 
obstacles and humans, wirelessly open doors, and call for elevators. The University 
of California, San Francisco Medical Center purchased 25 of the TUG robots for 
$3.5 million and spent another $2.5 million retrofitting the robots and the hospital. 
Brian Herriot, Director of Operations Planning at the Medical Center stated that 
based on current employee pay and benefits he estimates the hospital will break 
even within two years.101 It is difficult to say whether TUG robots will replace any 
workers as they are meant to allow staff to spend time on issues such as direct 
contact with patients, and are expected to improve the efficiency in hospitals. 
Because of their high price, however, they are currently only an option for larger 
hospital systems as they are too expensive for small hospitals and medical centres.

Other Barriers 
Toyota has stated that it is finding it hard to employ advanced manufacturing 
technicians. One of the reasons Toyota is able to manufacture autos so quickly is 
that robots do a lot of the work, but like all machines they break down, and 
advanced manufacturing technicians are needed to fix and maintain the robots that 
help build cars. This is not only a Toyota problem, in fact according to Deloitte 
(2012) there were a total of 600,000 skilled manufacturing jobs which went unfilled. 
Governments and companies are launching campaigns and investing in new

education programmes to encourage more students to take science, technology, 
engineering and maths subjects. A lack of skills in these areas could provide an 
additional barrier to the robotics industry and the expansion of automation in 
different industries.   

Whether robots should operate on proprietary systems or open platforms such as 
Robot Operating System (ROS) developed by Willow Garage is also up for debate. 
Proprietary robot systems have traditionally been the norm in robotics. These 
systems lock in customers to a particular robot, brand etc., and ultimately limit 
competitors entering the market due to the heavy investment and learning curve 
that is required to break-in. For example when a factory adds a robot to its 
operations, it is typically set up with proprietary software that comes with the robot 
hardware. Some such software offers modules that let robots adapt to dynamic 
environments such as changeable motions to manipulate objects but adaptive 
functionality is often limited. Some argue that proprietary systems ultimately raise 
the price for goods and services. Open platforms such as ROS offer more flexibility 
for customers and was created to help developers build robot systems at a faster 
rate, by allowing them to spend time on new applications and better functions rather 
than on getting robots to move between A and B, something which the industry has 
already addressed. Rethink and Universal Robotics both use ROS for software 
development but not for their control systems, whilst industrial robot manufacturers 
such as ABB Robotics are beginning to provide ROS-like capabilities in the form of 
updated software and simulation suites.102 Open source robotics systems 
encourage innovation to happen at a faster rate and provide the opportunity for 
multiple companies to operate in the same space, increasing competition and 
therefore reducing the costs for consumers.  

In conclusion, as robots become faster, smarter, cheaper, and develop advanced 
capabilities, industrial manufacturers across different industries will be looking to 
advanced robotics to gain a competitive advantage. We can already see that 
payback periods are decreasing over time and robots will become more affordable 
in countries like China and Thailand where labour wages are expected to increase. 

However, there are still a number of barriers for small and medium manufacturers, 
including not only cost but the adaptation of robots to different tasks as their 
operations change from one order to the next. Collaboration robots offer a solution 
for SMEs as they are cheaper, flexible, and less complex than other industrial 
robots. Price is one consideration that SMEs look at, however they also take into 
consideration their complex manufacturing needs and requirements. Steve Somes, 
President of Force Robots in Cleveland has stated that ‘The challenge facing robot 
companies is that today’s manufacturers run lean, have stringent quality standards, 
and have complex needs. If your system is rugged and cannot perform the needed 
work reliably, it does not matter how inexpensive it is…Of the new robots available 
now, not all of them will succeed.”103 

What is definitely clear is that industrial robots, service robots, and other automation 
processes such as 3D printing will change the manufacturing and working platforms 
in many industries. Barriers still exist for small SMEs but we believe these will 
reduce over time.

Response: Policy and Job Risk from 
Automation  
Highlights  

 Active labour market policies (ALMPs) are a broad term to cover policies that 
either reduce the cost of labour, or that help people find jobs. We suspect the 
extent of public spending on ALMPs will need to rise substantially as the effects 
of automation and advanced technological change become increasingly clear. 

 Some argue a basic income or benefit (healthcare, housing, pensions, etc.) 
should be provided to offset job loss.  

 Changes in taxation are a material risk for investors, but likely also impede an 
effective policy response to challenges from technological change.  

It should stand to reason that a world in which innovation is fast and abundant 
should be preferred to a world in which innovation is lacking. But this report and our 
original report on the potentially disruptive nature of automation and other 
potentially transformative technological developments show that, if unmanaged or 
poorly managed, these changes have the potential to create significant disruption, 
so much so that their overall impact may not even be benign.  

In our recent Citi GPS report called ‘Global Political Risk’ we highlighted that more 
than half of the global ‘informed public’104 believed that the pace of development 
and change in business today was too fast (Figure 86), and over 70% believed that 
technology was the largest driver of change in business (Figure 87). They also 
stated that there is not enough government regulation in a number of industries.

The first step to identifying what an adequate policy response to automation should 
be is to define the problem. In the case of the disruptive technological changes, the 
issues we are likely to encounter include the potential loss of jobs in many 
industries, the inadequacy of skills of some of the workforce to find equally good 
jobs, and the winner-take-all nature of much competition. Some of these issues may 
manifest themselves in high unemployment and are likely to be associated with 
even greater inequality of income and wealth than we see today. According to a 
survey undertaken by the European Parliament Eurobarometer, concerns about 
unemployment, social inequalities, and access to jobs for young people are 
considered some of the main challenges facing the EU and its Member States (see 
Figure 88). Unemployment is seen as being more of a challenge when compared to 
other pressing EU issues such as immigration and public debt.

Note: Question asked: In your opinion, what are the main challenges facing the EU and its Member States in order 
to face the future? Firstly? And secondly? And thirdly? Max 3 answers 

 
Part of the solution will clearly lie in revamping education, which Dr. Craig Holmes 
discusses in a later chapter in this publication. This is also the number one 
suggestion to address the challenges from innovation on the distribution of income, 
according to our client survey. But even successfully managing to change our 
educational system is unlikely to be sufficient to tame the destructive elements of 
major technological change. For one thing, there is increasing evidence that 
competition in the digital economy is increasingly ‘winner takes all’. For instance, 
Furman and Orszag (2015) highlight that a substantial amount of the increase in 
income inequality in the US derives from income inequality between firms and 
therefore is presumably not dependent only on the skill and productivity of the 
individual. Policy responses will therefore need to be crafted to address negative 
consequences ex-post in addition to any effort to provide the workforce with the 
necessary skills and capabilities. Figure 89 below shows how our clients have 
responded with regards to important policies that will be most effective to offset the 
risk of automation impacting labour and wealth distribution.

Active Labour Market Policies 
‘Active labour market policies’ (ALMPs) are a broad term to cover policies that 
should help people find jobs. Training and re-training can be thought of as types of 
ALMPs. Beyond those, ALMPs can be divided into policies that either reduce the 
cost of labour (or, increase labour income relative to the wage paid) or policies that 
make it easier to find jobs.

A crucial — and increasingly prominent — element of effective ALMPs is likely to be 
the widespread use of schemes that are similar to the Earned Income Tax Credit 
(EITC) in the US. Under such a scheme, workers receive a tax credit or refund at 
low levels of income. In the US, the credit is for up to around $6,000 for families with 
three or more children. The EITC therefore provide valuable income support for low-
wage workers, while maintaining the incentive to find paid work. 

There is plenty of room for EITCs, in our view. So-called tax wedges — the 
difference between gross labour costs and ‘take-home pay’ — are often very large, 
particularly in a number of European countries. The tax wedge is composed of 
employers’ and employees’ social security contributions and personal income taxes. 
In Belgium, France or Hungary it amounts to a staggering 50% of total labour costs 
for low-wage earners (i.e. those earning 67% of the average wage) according to 
OECD data. That is, a worker receives only about half of what the employer pays in 
total labour costs. Automation and some of the other ongoing technological changes 
imply that it is possible that the labour costs employers will be ready to pay may 
continue to stagnate or even fall. If that is the case, 50% of those labour costs is 
unlikely to amount to a ‘living wage.’ 

Significantly lowering tax wedges can be an effective way to boost take-home pay 
(for unchanged gross labour costs) or raise employment (if gross labour costs fall) 
and likely a combination of the two. This is consistent with evidence in the UK, 
where the tax wedge was lowered substantially in the post-crisis period and the 
decline in the tax wedge along with a number or other measures (such as tightening 
benefit eligibility) likely contributed to rapid job growth in recent years. By contrast, 
in roughly half the OECD countries, the tax wedge rose in 2007-13, including in 
some of the fiscally challenged countries such as Spain, Greece, and Italy, but also 
in Japan and the US, which probably hindered job growth in those countries.

In our view, it is likely that schemes such as the EITC will need to be extended 
significantly, including by raising the level of the subsidy and by changing its 
structure (e.g. currently the EITC in the US is only considered/paid once a year at 
the time of tax filing/refunds).105

In addition to EITC and other fiscal incentives for employment, active labour market 
policies also include job placement services and special labour market programmes 
that are aimed at helping the unemployed to find gainful employment. Such policies 
are particularly prominent in the Scandinavian countries, where these are 
sometimes credited as part of the reason why those countries can maintain 
generous social benefits with low unemployment rates.106 A particular role among 
ALMPs is likely to be incentives and support for self-employment and 
entrepreneurship. ALMPs and support for entrepreneurship are among the policy 
responses most favoured in our client survey. 

We suspect that the extent of public spending on ALMPs (which currently varies 
quite widely across countries) will need to rise substantially, as the effects of 
automation and other technological changes on the labour market become 
increasingly clear.  

Boosting Volunteerism 
Taking the idea of the EITC to an extreme, in some cases governments could 
decide to essentially sponsor volunteer work, i.e. reward workers that are not 
otherwise remunerated at all. Such work may be more or less coordinated by the 
state, which could draw up eligibility criteria. Since such work does not generate any 
direct income for the volunteer, the state would either directly (by paying stipends to 
volunteers) or indirectly (by subsidising those that fund the volunteers, including by 
giving them tax credits) need to bear the burden of the cost of the increased level of 
volunteering. 

Minimum Wage 
Minimum wages are sometimes considered as alternatives to EITCs and several 
countries have recently either increased the minimum wage (such as the UK or the 
US) or introduced a binding minimum wage for the first time (Germany). Supporters 
of a minimum wage stress that it does not create a direct fiscal cost and that, unlike 
EITCs, it does not let companies ‘get away’ with paying low wages.  

However, in our view, EITCs are more appropriate to deal with the likely 
consequences of technological change on the labour market than minimum wages: 
the rationale for minimum wages mainly derives from employers having too much 
bargaining power. But even though the innovations we describe imply that 
employers’ bargaining power increases, we see the problem more that the marginal 
product of labour will be relatively low, which would require a lower wage for 
employers to create jobs. Put differently: in the world we describe, minimum wages 
would probably lead to higher unemployment rather than higher demand. 

Basic Income and Benefits 
In a world where full-time employment may be less common and more uncertain, 
the case to provide a minimum standard of living for those outside of full-time 
employment becomes stronger.

106 See e.g. European Commission (2006), “Employment in Europe” and Boone, J. and 
J.C. van Ours, “Effective Active Labour Market Policies”. 

Job placement services and special market 
programmes could also form part of the 
solution 

We see EITCs as more appropriate versus 
minimum wages to deal with consequences

In some countries, e.g. the US, many benefits (including healthcare benefits and 
housing benefits) are linked to minimum requirements for paid work and 
contributions. Pension benefits are similarly dependent on consistent full-time work, 
with additional penalties for extended periods without full-time employment. 
Meanwhile, the self-employed are often exempted (and often excluded) from such 
arrangements for benefits and are expected to rely on their own provisions. 

One answer could be the idea of a ‘basic income’ that is sufficient to guarantee a 
minimum standard of living. Indeed, such a basic income has been advocated by a 
growing number of observers, including a number of prominent ‘technologists.’107 It 
has also been the subject of a popular referendum in Switzerland (where it was 
rejected). 

The two main downsides of a basic income are (1) that it may blunt incentives to 
contribute productively to society and (2) that it may be an inadequate substitute for 
gainful employment even for the recipient. Proposed solutions to these two issues 
include lowering the gap between the basic income and/or introducing a scheme of 
extensive active labour market policies, supplemented by programs for volunteer 
work, similar to the Works Progress Administration in the US in the 1930s. 

How to Pay for It 
Most of the policy responses to the effects of technological innovations on the 
labour market that we can think of involve greater public spending, including greater 
public spending on education and training, on benefits (including earned income tax 
credits) and on helping the unemployed find jobs. The need for public spending may 
be even larger because such spending may need to be higher on a structural basis, 
rather than only during downturns.  

The problem is how to pay for this, particular at a time when public purses feel 
rather stretched.  

In principle, this problem may seem easy to solve. After all, if productivity growth is 
likely to be high, as our assessment suggests, someone should be benefiting from 
these developments. One possibility would therefore be to tax those who are better-
off. This could be through an increase in top marginal income tax rates, increasing 
capital income tax rates, raising corporate income taxes, some form of wealth taxes 
or taxing goods or services more heavily that are consumed primarily by the 
wealthy.108  

Such changes in taxation would seem sensible to us, but they would also be a 
reversal of the trends of the last few decades. The OECD notes that top statutory 
personal income tax rates have fallen significantly in each of the three decades 
between 1980 and 2010.109 In 2010, the OECD average top statutory personal 
income tax rate was 41.7%. In 1981, it was 65.7%. Corporate income taxes have 
also fallen in recent decades, from 49% in 1981 to 32.5% in 2013.  

                                                           
107 See Brynjolfsson et al (2015), “Open Letter on the Digital Economy”, 
http://www.technologyreview.com/view/538091/open-letter-on-the-digital-economy/ 
108 Another direction would be to reduce other government expenditures. Given 
historically high ratios of government expenditure to GDP in many countries, this route 
strikes us as eminently sensible, but is outside the scope of this section. Governments 
should also in principle be able to take advantage of some of the improvements in 
technology to make government spending more efficient.  
109 See OECD (2011), “Taxing Wages”. 

The idea of a basic income could also be 
sufficient to guarantee a minimum standard 
of living 

How will we pay for such incentives given 
that the public coffers are stretched? Could 
an increase in income tax and wealth taxes 
be a solution?

However, some of these trends may already be reversing. A number of countries 
have already increased their top personal income tax rates in recent years but there 
is no sign of headline corporate income tax rates rising systematically across 
countries. Significant efforts are under way to close loopholes in the current fiscal 
arrangements for corporates, to make life harder for tax havens and to tackle tax 
evasion and avoidance more effectively. 

Could wealth taxes be the solution? Thomas Piketty, whose book ‘Capital in the 21st 
Century’ made headlines in 2014, has famously called for global wealth taxes as 
one of the main policy responses to rising (income and wealth) inequality (Piketty 
called for a tax of 1% on wealth of between €1m and €5m, 2% on wealth of greater 
than €5m and a much higher tax on fortunes significantly higher than €5m) and 
even the IMF has noted that a wealth tax may be appropriate in some 
circumstances. Yet outside of extreme circumstances there have been few (and 
usually only timid) attempts to increase the taxation of financial or real property in 
recent years (and they are quite rare in history). Similarly, the taxation of capital 
income has become increasingly prominent in policy discussions and speeches, 
notably the special treatment offered to particular types of capital income (such as 
for ‘carried interest’ of private equity owners). In his recent State of the Union 
address, US President Obama once more called for increases in capital income 
taxes and for abolishing some of these privileges. Yet we have seen very little in the 
way of an effective increase in the taxation of capital income anywhere.  

One of the reasons why wealth taxes have not been raised more widely is that they 
are difficult to design, costly to administer, and often relatively easy to avoid. For ad-
hoc wealth taxes, the risk is that households would fear that such taxes could be 
imposed again in the future. For financial assets, a major risk is that the capital will 
simply find a home elsewhere — a growing issue in a world of global financial 
mobility and still-increasing financial interdependence. Wealth taxes would therefore 
be much more likely to be effective if they were imposed globally (as Piketty 
argues). The same applies for corporate income and capital income taxation, but we 
see little scope for such an initiative in a world where global leadership is rare in any 
area, especially against what would likely be fierce lobbying.  

The feasibility and effectiveness of even well-designed plans to raise taxes to 
address distributional implications of innovation are a key challenge. It is likely to be 
harder for governments to tax households and in particular businesses when the 
digital economy becomes an increasingly large part of the overall economy, as the 
digital economy has proven quite adept at escaping effective taxation.  

Nevertheless, in light of the social, political and economic challenges that job 
polarisation creates, unexpected – and sometimes abrupt – changes in taxation are 
therefore a material risk for investors in the future. But equally worrying, the lack of 
an effective fiscal response implies that the strain on public finances will probably 
impede an effective policy response to those challenges. There is also another 
issue — whether governments are willing or able to make reforms and make difficult 
decisions. In democracies, countries with majority governments are able to push 
through reforms more easily than divided and multiparty governments. Other factors 
in determining reform capacity include high approval ratings, as Figure 92 
highlights. How few elected leaders have approval ratings of over 65%, and how the 
majority languish in the bottom two segments, illustrate how limited the prospects 
for reform in the current political environment may be. For companies and investors, 
weak and divided governments can be a source of erratic policy-making and a more 
uncertain operating environment. Cohesive governments with sufficient political 
capital and legislative energy can be a source of policies that can drive growth, 
particularly through reforms.

What Are the Challenges for State 
and Local Governments from 
Technological Change?  
Highlights  

 Local, regional and state governments face challenges in maintaining tax 
revenues from income disparities and from the difficulties in effectively taxing the 
digital economy. 

 While the inflation and interest rate outlook should remain benign and 
technological change should help bend the healthcare cost curve down, several 
municipal costs face an upward bias, such as pensions and infrastructure.  

 Technological change is likely to make economic growth increasingly uneven. To 
counter this there is a growing focus by some state and local governments on 
advanced industries.  

 While we are confident a growing number of leaders are cognizant of the growing 
challenges of technological change, we are far less confident that leaders are 
willing to make this complex set of issues part of their political agendas.  

What We Have Discussed So Far 
We have been tracking the issues generated by accelerating technological change 
(ATC) for state and local governments and the municipal bond market for roughly  2 
½ years now. Our first goal at this point is to incorporate here the patterns we had 
identified, as a jumping off point for additional policy discussions below.  

 The inflation and interest rate outlook should remain benign. These factors 
are covered in much greater detail elsewhere in this report. Suffice it to say that, 
for the purposes of this section, we expect inflation to stay extremely low and 
long-term interest rates to remain near current levels for an extended period of 
time. There is clearly a “good news” component in this for state and local 
governments, in the sense that their borrowing costs should remain low, and that 
the cost of capital facilities, in particular, should grow at a slowing rate in 
particular as energy costs remain low by recent historical standards 
(infrastructure building tends to be very energy-intensive). In addition, long, 
persistent benign periods for inflation will likely lead to longer, less volatile 
economic cycles, as central banks face reduced need to “take away the cookie 
jar” by raising short-term policy rates. 

 Another potential positive for costs is likely to occur in the health care 
sector. Health benefits from technological change are likely to be dramatic, and 
methods for the delivery of health care will change dramatically. This is a highly 
complex and challenging topic in and of itself. Suffice it to say for now that many 
individuals in the health sector have noted a strong belief that over the 
intermediate term, technological change will help bend the health care cost curve 
downward, by making delivery of healthcare cheaper and easier to access, and 
by giving consumers much stronger access to choices. Given the large role of 
state and local governments in health care delivery and in paying employees for 
health care benefits, any downward bend in the cost curve should help 
ameliorate pressure on their budgets.

 Need for widespread additional policy responses. Nevertheless, we believe 
that there is a growing body of evidence that policy responses at the Federal, 
state and local level beyond just accommodative monetary policy will be needed 
to respond to the changes and challenges currently under way. These changes 
include: (1) downward pressures on compensation for labour, and (2) potentially 
weakening demand — in the face of impressive output growth.  

 A key role for state and local governments as changes emerge and 
accelerate. In our view, state and local governments will have to play a key role 
in identifying and implementing policy responses as the global and US 
economies adjust to a set of daunting new challenges. Particular challenges for 
state and local governments are likely to include: 

Challenges for State and Local Governments 
 There is a high likelihood that local, regional, and state economic growth 

will become increasingly uneven as some communities benefit from access to 
high-quality jobs, while others come under increasing pressure from competition 
from automated solutions. The implications of these patterns were discussed 
earlier in the section ‘Cities at Risk’. Of course, in the United States specifically, 
the distinctions between governments and credits will occur at a much wider 
variety of levels than just cities — states, counties, special districts, and revenue-
supported projects will also be exposed to increasing credit quality differentiation 
as some Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA) benefit from high 
availability of advanced industry jobs, while others do not.  
 
Bloomberg’s “State Innovation Index” helps rank the 50 US states based on six 
factors: R&D intensity; productivity; high-tech density; STEM concentrations; 
science and engineering degree concentrations; and patent activity. 
Massachusetts, California and Washington were clustered at the top, with 17 
states in a second tier.111 Clearly in many states there will tend to be vast 
differences in the level of innovation. For example New York State ranks 17th, 
near the lower end of the second tier, but the New York City SMSA would likely 
rank highly if measured independently. On the other extreme the State of 
Arkansas ranks 47th in the survey, even as the city of Little Rock is working 
aggressively to grow its technology park, in a plan approved by the Little Rock 
Tech Park Authority in 2014. Be that as it may, we believe that this type of 
ranking may be useful for states, in the sense that it establishes targets and 
methodologies for lower-ranking states to incorporate into long-term plans.  

 The challenge is keeping state and local costs from growing at historical 
rates, even as overall private sector cost growth in the US economy is 
dampened by a growing output gap and downward pressures on the price of 
labour. In our view, one of the greatest challenges for state and local 
governments is that it will be extremely difficult for these governments to respond 
to the likely declining cost structure in the consumer market, and challenges on 
taxation in an increasingly digitised economy because many of their costs are 
contractually fixed or have a structural upward bias, such as pension funding. 
The result, we expect, will be an increase in “real” costs as inflation remains 
extremely low. Undoubtedly, these cost pressures will run full square into the 
need to respond to the growing and massive void in major maintenance and 
replacement of existing infrastructure, and legal limits on cost efficiencies in the 
construction and maintenance of such facilities.

 Challenges are likely to emerge in maintaining tax revenues as aspects of 
the economy soften, and as income disparities widen over time in response to 
technological change, as the digital economy becomes more difficult to tax 
effectively. There will assuredly be pressures on the income tax revenue side as 
more types of jobs come under pressure from automated solutions, while many 
costs tend to be fixed or have an upward bias, particularly for pensions, 
employee compensation and infrastructure. And, at the same time, tax avoidance 
in sales tax-based revenue streams is likely to become a growing concern. And 
finally, as noted many aspects of the digital economy are exceedingly difficult to 
tax. (See “The Challenges in Taxing the Digital Economy,” below.) 

 Undoubtedly, there will be a variety of challenges for state and local 
pension funds, including in particular: (1) continuing low returns on the fixed 
income component of pension investments, and (2) growing post-retirement life-
expectancies. The news isn’t all negative, of course: to the extent that pension 
funds function as “owners” through the stock market and private equity, they will 
benefit from the increasing share of national income that is accruing to owners 
rather than labour. On the other hand, it remains an open question as to the 
extent to which the owner-side benefits will show up in portfolios consisting of 
publicly traded securities. A number of observers have suggested that large 
increases in the value of ownership shares may be: (1) limited to a relative 
handful of companies; and (2) particularly conducive to a venture capital-type 
model that does not fully accrue to the benefit of publicly traded companies such 
as those heavily owned by pension funds.  

 Infrastructure funding needs will compete with pensions and OPEB over 
time. It is also important to note that a significant subset of the muni market is 
beginning to view the growing infrastructure shortfall as yet another unfunded 
“liability” along with pensions and unfunded healthcare benefits (OPEB). The 
logic is that over time, if a given state or local government does not begin to 
budget for and fund infrastructure needs, four patterns will occur that, in effect, 
compete with unfunded pension liabilities as a dollar amount due. First, quality of 
life, capacity to support economic activity, and attractiveness as a magnet for 
new economic activity, will begin to erode reducing the economic value of the 
state or local government as a creator of economic activity. Second, some types 
of infrastructure will simply give out, requiring nearly immediate funding out of 
budgets or through newly borrowed funds. Structural deficiencies of highways, 
roads, bridges and tunnels are likely to accelerate as more and more facilities 
remain in use well past their expected life cycle.  
 
Third, certain types of infrastructure spending will simply be needed to meet 
environmental laws such as the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. And fourth, 
governments in certain areas of the country are likely to become increasingly 
exposed to the effects of climate change, including increased flooding and storm 
damage, and increased exposure to droughts that tax water supply capacity. All 
of this becomes particularly important in the context of the need to attract 
advanced industries as state and local governments compete with each other for 
this type of economic activity—the impact of falling behind in the race to provide 
governmental services at a satisfactory level and reasonable cost is likely to be 
to fall behind in the race to become a centre for advanced industrial activity. . 

 Pressure on the cost side as more workers who come under these 
additional pressures require governmental assistance (refer to the section 
below called “Growing Recognition of The Need for Policy Responses”).

Preparing for Policy Responses 
Identification of economic threats over the near to intermediate term (and beyond) 
that will require a policy response at the state and local level. There appears to be 
growing recognition of the potential threats to labour/economic strength, in the form 
of reduced demand for labour as described herein, growing pressure on middle-
class jobs, and growing income/wealth disparities from the trends generated by 
ATC. In an “Open Letter on the Digital Economy” 112 to the public, a large number of 
renowned technologists led by an MIT team pointed to the economic and policy 
challenges that will be generated by ATC. The policy component of the letter was 
limited, but we believe that the goal was to initiate a dialogue, not reach detailed 
conclusions. A vast amount of additional work will be needed in this area. Futurists 
and technologists talk excitedly about growing “abundance,” as the marginal cost of 
producing a wide range of goods and services collapses under momentum from 
these automated solutions. The challenge, as we discuss below, will be to bridge 
the gap between the availability of low-cost supply — “abundance” — and a 
demand side — consumers — that will come under increasing pressure from limits 
on wages and employability, long before the benefits of growing abundance kick in.  

Policy and political battles will be dramatic and important 

Futurists are optimists about the implications of declining marginal costs for living 
standards—but how do we get there as more and more types of jobs come under 
pressure and income/wealth disparities continue to grow? These issues, we 
suspect, will play out in vastly different ways from one local government to the next, 
and one state to the next, based upon a variety of factors, including relative 
economic strength to be sure, but also based heavily upon willingness to fund 
responses through taxation and through income supports as needed. 

A growing focus by some state and local governments on ‘advanced 
industries’ 

In addition to the discussion on cities above, we note that Brookings Institute, in 
particular, has done considerable work on the extent to which the economic outlook 
for geographic entities will differ, based upon the extent to which they are successful 
in attracting “advanced industries.” In a report in February, 2015, Brookings 
asserted: - “the special importance to America’s future of what the paper calls 
America’s “advanced industries” sector. Characterised by its deep involvement with 
technology research and development (R&D) and STEM (science, technology, 
engineering, and math) workers, the sector encompasses 50 industries ranging 
from manufacturing industries such as automaking and aerospace to energy 
industries such as oil and gas extraction to high-tech services such as computer 
software and computer system design, including for health applications. These 
industries encompass the nation’s “tech” sector at its broadest and most 
consequential. Their dynamism is going to be a central component of any future 
revitalised U.S. economy.” 

Some state and local government officials are beginning to align with public policy 
experts in an attempt to respond to these changes by identifying and attracting 
industry sectors with potential for continued strong growth. Brookings continues to 
expand its work on Advanced Industries, most recently entering into an agreement 
with the state of Rhode Island to help identify ways to bring such industries to the 
state to an increasing degree. Brookings has already worked with local 
governments in Buffalo, New York City, and Chicago on similar projects.

between the availability of low-cost supply 
and a demand side

In addition, Brookings has been doing substantial work on a related topic: 
“Innovation Districts.” As they have noted in a series of articles, innovation districts 
can be an important way for cities to generate a critical mass of advanced industry 
jobs that are likely to maintain their value as an economic anchor for an extended 
period of time. In a recent article113 they noted two different models for innovation 
districts: Cambridge Mass., and Chattanooga, Tenn. In the former case, Cambridge 
is simply able to leverage the benefits of being close-on to high-tech universities, 
including, of course, MIT and a large additional network of universities and colleges 
that attract the tech sector. The latter case of Chattanooga is more challenging, and 
perhaps more impressive, in a sense, generated in large part by an initiative 
initiated by the Electric Power Board of Chattanooga (“EPB”), the city’s public utility. 
The Board employed $228 million in local revenue bonds and $111.6 million in 
funding from the Department of Energy’s Smart Grid Investment, to build one of the 
world’s most extensive municipal and cheapest high-speed internet networks, 
helping attract tech entrepreneurs and generate work on “smart grids” that attract 
partners on climate change and extreme weather analysis.   

As Brookings notes, “Chattanooga’s innovation district is the product of genuine, 
enthusiastic collaboration—not often seen in bigger cities—between public, private, 
and civic institutions and leaders.” We note both the Cambridge and Chattanooga 
models for a simple reason: in our view, as technological change progresses, 
capacity to respond by maintaining a large proportion of advanced industry jobs is 
going to become a significant credit factor.  

Lack of a Federal agenda  

One of the greatest concerns from ATC for state and local governments, in our view, 
is the fact that Federal level notice of these concerns, let alone agendas to generate 
responses, has been virtually non-existent. Clearly, there has been considerable 
recognition and discussion of the facts that: the US economy is growing slowly; 
wages aren’t growing as expected at this phase of an economic rebound; middle 
class income and especially after-tax disposable income has been under pressure; 
and income and wealth disparities for the top rung versus everyone else continue to 
increase. 

What has been utterly lacking in the discussion so far are the clear concerns 
that: (1) a significant and growing component of these patterns relate to 
technological change; (2) consequently, they are likely to get worse over time, not 
better; and (3) traditional responses that do not take into account the unique nature 
of the current environment and its roots in technology are doomed to fail. 

This is, clearly, a pattern that is going to have to change. Without a policy initiative 
at the Federal level, state and local responses are almost certain to be erratic, 
uneven, limited, and in many cases, set to fail. We will only begin to deal with 
governmental policy responses herein. We note, however a brief excerpt from an 
Op-Ed in The London Times on Friday, 16 October, 2015: 

“In manufacturing, experts believe the proportion of tasks carried out 
by robots could quintuple by 2025. The benefits to economies that 
embrace them fastest will include higher wages in the skilled jobs that 
remain the preserve of humans — such as the 50 engineering posts 
that Amazon will create to maintain its new robots — and medium-
term productivity gains of up to 30 percent.

Innovation districts could be an important 
way for cities to generate advanced industry 
jobs 

Lacking from discussion are concerns that 
technological change exists, that it will likely 
get worse over time and that traditional 
responses don’t take in the unique nature of 
the problem

“Britain should be one of these economies. Our flexible labour market 
allows quicker adoption of new technologies than in much of Europe. 
Our universities are already producing the computer scientists who 
will program the next generation of robots. But for the whole 
workforce to thrive, computer science must be as deeply embedded 
in our curriculum as reading. The time is rapidly approaching when 
the choice for blue and white collar workers alike is to know how to 
manipulate technology, or be manipulated by it.” 

In terms of policy responses, it would be extremely easy to replace “Britain,” in the 
previous statement and substitute with “The United States.” This will of course only 
become possible once our leaders: (a) admit there is a challenge from ATC; (b) 
begin to craft responses that apply across the entire nation; and (c) become willing 
to spend as needed on adaptations, including education, R&D, retraining, etc. 

In other words, this discussion needs to become a part of the political process, so 
that our leaders can then begin to craft policy responses. At this point, we are not 
even having a dialogue. And, of course, if there aren’t any Federal policy responses, 
state and local governments will often be unable to man the breech. 

Another Issue Where the Need for a US Federal Response 
Is Becoming Imminent: Taxation 
Interestingly, there is another segment of the economy where the need for a 
governmental response is becoming evident, and where Europe generally is 
pushing ahead much more rapidly than the US has done. That is in the area of 
responding the rapidly changing tax structures which will become essential in a 
highly digitised global society. There is, in Europe specifically, a growing recognition 
of the fact that value and income generation is simply different in a digitised society. 
On 16 September 2014, the OECD released a report on Action 1 of the OECD/G20 
Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (also known as the “BEPS” project) titled 
“Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy.” These challenges are 
manifold, and will inevitably lead to very similar challenges in the US to those that 
are being identified in Europe. 

For example, an enterprise may generate significant value by gathering data in a 
jurisdiction, even though the factors for allocating taxable income — i.e., functions, 
assets, and risks — are located outside of that jurisdiction. If so, it becomes easier 
to transfer income to tax havens well removed from the source of economic activity. 
In addition, in the “modern” tech-related corporation, capital generation often 
happens in ways that create no taxable income — i.e., are reinvested back into the 
firm, and create value in the form of capital gains that are not taxed unless a change 
in ownership takes place. As has been noted recently in the press, many new tech 
companies with high theoretical value are avoiding the sale of shares to the market 
for specifically this reason.114 In addition, functions and operations may have less 
physical permanence that become easy to identify, and thus to tax in the country of 
origin.

The discussion on ATC needs to become

The Digital Economy Report also identifies several segments of the digital economy 
that raise issues as to the appropriate characterisation of income. For example the 
report notes that the character of payments for cloud computing is not addressed in 
the existing commentary to the OECD Model Tax Convention, and that it is unclear 
whether such payments should be treated as royalties, fees for technical services, 
service fees, rent, or business profits. In addition, the Digital Economy Report notes 
that 3D printing may raise character questions in the case of design licenses for 
remote printing by a purchaser. 

Our key points in the above are threefold. First, that identifying and ring-fencing 
economic activity that can be taxed is a growing challenge as larger portions of 
economic activity take place in digital forms that are not easily differentiated, priced 
and localized — and in a growing number of cases, provide revenues to the owner 
indirectly (think YouTube, for example). Second, that the US appears to be well 
behind the curve in identifying and responding to these challenges. And third, that to 
the extent we do not respond effectively, tax revenues will erode, just at the time 
when economic pressures — and needed policy responses —- generated by the 
Digital Economy are accelerating.  

The next factor, of course relates to the potential impact on state and local 
governments. We return to the tax issues briefly at the end of the next section.  

State and Local Governments at Risk of Falling Behind the 
Curve 
There will be, we expect, considerable — and complex — implications for state and 
local creditworthiness. 

Back on the plus side, there are likely to be significant positives for the cost of 
higher education, as more students begin to take advantage of online educational 
opportunities. Thus far, online delivery systems such as “MOOCs” (Massively Open 
Online Courses) have not been particularly successful, but we believe that their 
potential and use will grow over time. At the same time, the role of the Digital 
Economy in helping provide more effective K-12 education is likely to expand as 
well. Nevertheless, for a variety of reasons that we only begin to discuss below, the 
pressures on state and local governments will be substantial, we expect.  

 The likelihood of increasing income/wealth disparities, and downward pressure 
on aggregate demand, if additional fiscal policies are not identified and 
implemented as well. 

 The need for policymakers to respond to these challenging new patterns. 

 Complex challenges in maintaining tax levels as more of the economy becomes 
digital as noted above. 

 Potential spillovers to credit ratings/borrowing costs.  

Rating concerns 

This, of course, is an essential issue that we can only note briefly here, in the sense 
that there is as yet no evidence that rating agencies are beginning to react to the 
rapidly changing environment within which municipal issuers function through 
concrete changes in rating standards. . This is unsurprising, in the sense that there 
is as yet little to no tangible evidence that technological change is affecting state or 
local issuers in terms of employment patterns, taxation cost growth vs. revenue 
growth, income disparities, benefits and risks from advanced industry migration, etc. 

Identifying and ring-fencing economic 
activity that can be taxed is a challenge. The 
US seems to be behind the curve which 
risks erosion of tax revenues 

A dialogue related to the potential 
implications for creditworthiness needs to be 
part of the response

111 

One of our goals here is to suggest that a dialogue related to potential implications 
for creditworthiness needs to be part of the response to these rapidly changing 
patterns. That dialogue would begin to identify potential new risks, but could also 
act as an impetus for additional responses from state and local governments, and 
help provide the “red flag” at the Federal level that something new here is going on 
that will require a combined Federal/state/local response as changes emerge.  

In our view, the limited number of policy responses noted here in the fields of 
education, business planning and related activities is no more than the beginning of 
the need for a much more broad-based policy discussion. And, indeed, we believe 
that state and local governments will have to be at the forefront of any such 
discussions, given the likelihood of increasing income/wealth disparities, differing 
outcomes from one geographic sector to the next, and the relatively limited potential 
for education in a vacuum to solve the challenges generated by these changes. 

Indeed, in an environment of potential disinflation, high and growing fixed costs from 
pensions and the like, high unmet infrastructure needs, and built-in upward pressure 
on total governmental compensation, state and local governments will be hard 
pressed to keep up with these rapidly changing patterns. On the other hand, there 
will certainly be some good news in the form of growing “abundance” over the long 
run. The test will be for state and local officials to plan how to get past the 
challenges in order to take advantage of the longer run benefits. This will be no 
easy task given: the ongoing underinvestment in infrastructure; the likely lack of 
support from the Federal level; and compensation and benefit pressures that will not 
easily give way, relative to the disinflation we expect to see occurring elsewhere in 
the US economy. 

State and local tax/revenue issues 

As we discuss above, concerns regarding taxation of the digital economy are 
already being examined as a threat to the revenue side of Federal governments, 
with the OECD leading the way in providing analysis of the impending changes. 
With respect to state and local governments in the US, we note several issues. 

 First, the impact of changes related to taxation of the digital economy will not be 
uniform, by any means. Corporate income taxes would appear to be under the 
greatest potential pressure. Transitions of corporate income from one Federal 
jurisdiction to another will put pressure on states (and a handful of cities) that 
have historically relied on corporate taxes as a significant portion of their 
aggregate budget. 

 Second, one of the key concerns in the OECD analysis relates to capture of 
consumption taxes—in this country, state and local sales taxes. The growing 
proportion of retail activity that is done on-line and/or offshore will tend to reduce 
the sales tax base, and make collection of sales taxes more difficult. 

 Third, potential changes in corporate structures in an increasingly digitised 
economy are likely to lead to more income/wealth among the highest earners 
coming in the form of unrealised capital gains and/or reinvestment back into 
owned companies, rather than as taxable ordinary income.  

 Finally, to the extent that these issues create downward pressure on Federal 
revenues, they will, of course, also continue the downtrend in Federal support for 
state and local activities. These transitions will not happen overnight, but they are 
likely to occur, and we expect that not all states and cities will be well prepared 
for these transitions as they arise.

Pressures for Policy Responses Will Likely Have to Move 
Upward from the State and Local Level towards the 
Federal Level, Rather than the Reverse 
We are confident that a growing number of Federal leaders are cognizant of the 
challenges for all levels of government that are likely to be created by accelerating 
technological change. However, we are far from confident that many of these 
leaders will be willing to make this complex set of issues part of their political 
agenda for some time to come. The sheer complexity of the issues, the challenges 
they create, and the magnitude for ongoing potential bad news coming out of the 
labour side of the equation are simply not the types of issues that make for 
attractive sound bites in a Federal political campaign. Consequently, we anticipate 
that a large proportion of the leadership in responding to these issues is likely to 
have come from governors and mayors.  

As noted above, a number of states and cities have already begun to work to 
identify sources of advanced industry jobs, and to plan to attract such jobs, working 
in part with organisations such as the Brookings Institute. Indeed, the co-chair of 
one of Brookings’ conferences on advanced industries was Governor McAuliffe of 
Virginia, and we are aware that a number of other state officials have begun to 
undertake initiatives in these areas. We are also aware of planning in a wider 
number of cities to create an environment conducive to advanced industries. For 
example, numerous large and small cities are beginning to plan or populate 
advanced industrial parks in order to attract the types of businesses likely to thrive 
in this new environment. Among their other tasks, however, will be the need to 
pressure Federal lawmakers and policy officials to (1) recognise the magnitude of 
the challenges, and (2) begin to develop agendas. In other words, they will need to 
insist that the Federal government play a visible leadership role in responding to the 
changes and challenges that will inevitably be wrought by technological acceleration 
and digitisation. As noted above, the current presidential campaign remains devoid 
of even the slightest discussion of the role these changes are playing in generating 
economic pressures. Given the void, it is the states, large cities and public interest 
group organisations that will have to take the lead.  

Another Key Area for Adaptation: Outsourcing/PPPs 
In January 2016, Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority introduced plans to greatly accelerate the completion of 
massive technology improvements on the New York City Subways and other parts 
of the MTA system. Enhancements are projected to include WiFi on all stations in 
2016, followed by cell phone service the following year, MetroCards will mostly be 
replaced by digital payments by 2017, followed by USB charging stations in 600 
subway cars and 1,500 buses by 2018. According to published reports, “The MTA’s 
board of directors said last year that replacing the MetroCard would take at least 
five years. Under the governor’s accelerated time schedule, installing a new 
payment system will happen by the end of 2018 — and even sooner for the region’s 
two commuter rail systems, the Long Island Rail Road and Metro North, which will 
get mobile payments in just six months."115  

According to the Governor, the MTA is saving time and money by completely 
outsourcing a large proportion of the work to private sources .In our view, this, 
rather than just the nature of the upgrades, will become a key source of potential 
enhancements for state and local governments. A key set of challenges is going to

be for state and local governments to take advantage of massive technology 
improvements that affect capital and operating costs, while dealing with potential 
resistance from public sector employees and unions and other sources of 
entrenched behaviours. A portion of this transition is likely to come in the form of 
public/private partnerships (“PPPs”), which historically have only had a modest 
aggregate effect on governments. As technological enhancements affect costs in 
the private sector for all of the reasons described herein, they will inevitably begin to 
have similar effects on activities that compete directly with public sector employees. 
We do not suggest that transitions in the public sector are likely to be as smooth or 
as rapid as on the private side, but as state and local governments come under 
additional pressures for all of the reasons described above, we believe that there 
will be increased pressures to effectuate cost saving in the public sector as well, by: 

– reducing the use of human labour that is repetitive and cost-ineffective relative 
to automated solutions (just as in the private sector); and 

– Accelerating modernisation of public sector infrastructure utilizing PPPs in 
combination with technological changes that reduce marginal costs. That, we 
note, is exactly what is being planned in New York State for the MTA. Other 
such transitions are likely to follow in fairly short order.  

Indeed, just as in the case of innovation cities and high-tech states described 
above, we anticipate that state and local governments that are able to make these 
transitions effectively will achieve a number of competitive advantages that will 
impact quality of life, cost structures, and — in relatively short order — rating trends.  

Policies for New Job Creation in Cities 
While new technologies have arrived everywhere, cities and regions have fared 
very differently over recent decades. As highlighted in the “How Does Susceptibility 
Vary Within Countries? - Cities at Risk” chapter, the expanding scope of automation 
is likely to exacerbate income disparities between US cities over the forthcoming 
decades, as new jobs have recently emerged in different locations from the ones 
where old ones are likely to disappear. As a result, workers will need to relocate 
from contracting cities to expanding ones. Supporting such relocation is particularly 
important since the arrival of new technology jobs creates additional demand for 
local services: estimates by Moretti (2010) shows that one additional job in the 
technology sector generates about 4.9 additional jobs due to increased demand for 
local services. Thus, because new technology jobs overwhelmingly cluster in cities 
that are already dense in skilled workers, demand for local services is relatively high 
in skilled cities, meaning that low-skilled workers in service occupations will have to 
follow. 

However, as more workers are seeking to move to skilled cities, house prices have 
surged as a result. This has implications for unemployed and low-income workers, 
who often do not have the financial means to relocate to places where new jobs are 
available. The relatively low mobility of such workers, which has been extensively 
documented in various studies, also has implications for economic growth. 
According to estimates by Hsieh and Moretti (2015), for example, growing wage 
inequality across cities has reduced aggregate GDP in the United States by some 
13.5% between 1964 and 2009. This, in turn, is largely a result of housing 
constraints in cities specialized in skilled activities, such as professional services 
and technology industries, including New York, San Francisco, and San Jose.

The research by Hsieh and Moretti (2015) has clear implications for policy: lowering 
regulatory constraints on housing in skilled cities (to the median level) would not 
only expand their labour force, but also increase GDP in the United States by 
around 9.5 percent. To facilitate job creation and growth, policy-makers should thus 
focus on reducing regulatory constraints to support the construction of cheaper 
housing. In addition, they should support workers seeking to relocate to cities where 
new jobs emerge. For example, Moretti (2013) has persuasively argued that 
relocation vouchers would incentivise workers to move to expanding cities, 
increasing the mobility of particularly low-income workers. For example, if a worker 
moves from Fresno (with an unemployment rate of 9.9 percent, and 53.8 percent of 
their workforce susceptible to automation) to get a job in Boston (with an 
unemployment rate of 4.1 percent, and 38.4 percent of their workforce susceptible 
to automation), then that worker will need fewer transfer payments and pay more 
taxes. Because such relocation generates positive externalities, there is a 
compelling case for the introduction of relocation vouchers. 

Nevertheless, while relocation vouchers would help workers move from declining 
cities to expanding ones, there is a risk that the most capable unemployed will be 
the most likely to leave, leading to a brain drain of lagging cities. The introduction of 
relocation vouchers would thus need to be accompanied by investments to boost 
the competitiveness of declining cities and regions. Although studies show that new 
jobs have clustered in skilled cities since the advent of the computer, these jobs 
tend to migrate as they gradually become old jobs. Following this observation, 
Duranton and Puga (2001) introduced the concept of nursery cities, suggesting that 
entrepreneurs and innovators that experiment with new technologies benefit from 
knowledge spillovers facilitated by the density of cities during the early stages of 
business formation. In other words, skilled places constitute “nursery cities” for new 
job creation. Only after production processes have become more standardized do 
they tend to diffuse to less skilled places, leading to convergence across locations 
unless skilled cities produce new jobs at a faster pace than old ones diffuse. 
Facilitating the diffusion of work, however, does require increased investment in 
transport connectivity between cities. 

In addition, because knowledge spillovers exist, improving education in lagging 
regions should increase social welfare, while making the local labour force more 
resilient to technological change. The importance of human capital for industrial 
renewal is highlighted by the case of Boston (the city that is least exposed to future 
automation) which has reinvented itself from being a seaport, to a factory town, to 
becoming a centre for information technology. This transition required the formation 
of new types of knowledge and skills throughout the process. In a similar manner, 
today’s lagging manufacturing cities, such as Buffalo, Cleveland and Detroit, will 
need to adapt their skills. To do so successfully, investments in local schools and 
universities will be essential, as well as increasing the supply of technical and 
entrepreneurial skills.

How Should Education Adapt In the 
Race Between Education and 
Technology?  
Highlights  

 Technological change is a key driver for the demand of both the level and the 
type of skills needed ahead. Careers are likely to be more disrupted than at any 
other point in the past, so people should anticipate the need to retrain in the 
future. Greater co-ordination will be needed between the educational, training 
and employment sectors.  

 A talent mismatch exists in many countries and many well educated workers 
have found employment in lower-skilled employment.  

 ICT skills will be needed, but significant differences currently exist in IT skills 
between countries, with USA and UK lagging other countries on some measures. 
While many argue STEM skills are needed, intermediate level skills in STEM 
seem to be a less safe educational investment. Non-cognitive skills can be 
increasingly important, but malleability of these skills should not be assumed.  

 Education has typically been a low productivity growth sector as the teaching 
methods are typically labour intensive, but technology could drive down costs 
and raise productivity.  

Skill Demand and the Education System: The Context 
Technological change is a key driver of the demand for skills, both in terms of level 
and type. In the developed world in the 20th century, innovations in both products 
and processes raised, on average, the skill requirements of the workforce. It also 
lead to a different mix of skills being required as technology drives down the need 
for labour engaged in certain tasks and their associated occupations: process 
operatives in manufacturing or clerical administration, for example. On the other 
hand, as well as there being an increase in demand for high skill non-routine tasks 
such as creativity or problem-solving, we have also observed increased importance 
of various lower skill service occupations like in retail or care sectors.  
 
Investment into education has been highlighted by a survey of Citi’s clients as being 
one of the most effective policies to offset the risk of automation impacting labour 
and wealth distribution. The challenge for the education and training sector has 
been producing skills at the right level and in the relevant areas for the needs of the 
labour market and the economy more broadly. Many countries have long-standing 
problems along both dimensions.

To illustrate, Figure 93 shows the extent of tertiary education graduate over-
education across Europe using data from the European Working Conditions Survey

highly educated workers feel they could take on a more demanding role relative to

116 Overeducation here is captured by self-reported skill utilisation levels. This is only one 
way in which overeducation can be measured, all of which face various problems (see 
Holmes and Mayhew, 2015). For example, more objective measures i.e. ones that do not 
rely on self-reports, typically make strong assumptions about the required level of 
education in a job over time that, absent of detail job and task evaluations, may bias 
findings in either direction.

Figure 94. Skill Shortages and Mismatch  

 
Source: Hays Global Talent Index (2015). Notes: Each element of the index scored out of 10. ‘Talent Mismatch’ 
measures the gap between the skills that businesses are looking for and the skills available in the labour market. A 
higher score indicates that businesses are facing a serious problem in matching available candidates with unfilled 
jobs. For ‘Education inflexibility’, lower scores indicate there is a better chance that the education system is flexible 
enough to meet labour market needs. ‘Wage pressure in a high skill industry’ measures the rate at which wages in 
high-skill industries are growing relative to those in low-skill industries relative to the past – a high score is 
indicative of the emergence of sector-specific skills shortages in areas like engineering or technology. 

 
At the same time, many employers feel that they face difficulties recruiting people 
with the right types of skills. Figure 94 draws on data from the Hays Global Skill 
Index (2015): here, the most relevant measure is the indicator on talent mismatch, 
which is complemented by the indices for educational inflexibility and wage 
pressures in high-skill industries.117 In these data, skills shortages are observed in 
the UK, the US, Scandinavian countries and across Southern Europe, and are 
rather less notable in Northern European countries like the Netherlands and 
Germany, and in Australia. 

The overall combination suggests that in many countries there is not currently 
sufficient demand for the higher skills that are available, leading to many well 
educated workers finding employment in lower-skilled employment, while at the 
same time the sectors or occupations which do have high skill requirements are 
unable to find the correct types of skills. What is not clear is how much the former 
could be dealt with by improvements made to the latter. 

Predicting the Future Demand for Skills 
Ensuring the education system of a given country produces both the necessary 
level and mix of skills will continue to be a major challenge in the coming decades. A 
necessary requirement to address this challenge is to make the best possible 
predictions about the future demand for skills. 

 

                                                           
117 Wage pressures in high skill industries is meant to indicate where relative demand for 
high skills (compared to low skills) is increasing faster than its supply, suggesting skills 
mismatch. In reality, such a measure is affected by other factors outside of relative skill 
demand. For example, the coverage and degree of centralisation in collective bargaining 
arrangements will have an impact, as in the case of Denmark, as will labour market 
reforms that reduce protection for lower skilled workers, as might arguably be the case in 
Germany.

At present, however, predictions about the future of the occupational structure vary. 
Governmental estimates typically suggest a continuation of the above trends which 
is not unexpected given that the forecast models use past data to help predict the 
future. On the other hand, studies which suggest that recent technological advances 
represent a structural break in the relationship between technology and labour 
demand are, at times, at odds with such forecasts. Figure 95 shows a comparison 
between the expected changes in employment of occupational groups in the UK 
between 2012 and 2022 defined at the SOC2010 sub-major group level (UKCES,

and Osborne (2013).119 The second column gives the net change in demand for 
workers in different occupations, so does not include replacement demand from 
workers leaving the labour market.

The main areas of disagreement come in the lower parts of the occupational 
structure: in particular, several customer and personal service occupations are 
forecast to continue to grow despite being at a high risk of automation by Frey and 
Osborne’s measure. Moreover, while some occupations are forecast to experience 
a decline in the total number of workers employed, these drops appear to be quite 
small compared to the estimated risk of computerisation. For example, if Frey and 
Osborne’s estimates are correct, then the three occupational groups at the greatest

operatives — are predicted to experience a decline of, respectively, 5.7%, 10.0% 
and 26.1% of existing employment, which is far less disruptive than those high 
automation probabilities would suggest. 

However, there are some examples further up the occupational hierarchy. The most 
striking example is for business and public service professionals, which includes 
associated professionals in law, finance, sales and a variety of public services, 
where computerisation risk is relatively high yet official forecasts predict the need 
for an additional 400,000 workers to fill newly created jobs in additional to the 
replacement demand. Therefore, in the higher skilled occupations, there are still 
some issues about the skill mix. Technician or intermediate level skills in STEM 
would certainly seem to be a less safe educational investment. 

Beyond Occupational Forecasts 
If the existing forecasts are wrong and the type of technological progress we will 
experience in the coming years leads to greater job losses in lower skilled 
occupation, then this would not be immediately unwelcome from a policymaker’s 
perspective: a challenge in recent years has been the persistence of low-skilled jobs 
and the inability to fully shift towards the high-skill economy championed by many 
policymakers. Attempts to increase the use of skill in such occupations in order to 
improve both the individual outcomes of those who find work in such jobs and 
macroeconomic outcomes such as productivity have been largely unsuccessful. 
The computerisation of such jobs could therefore finally push an economy toward 
the high-skill vision, on the assumption that sufficient high-skill jobs became 
available at the same time.  

One challenge for the education and training system is therefore to anticipate where 
technological innovations may lead to job creation. Figure 95 illustrates the 
probability of jobs being replaced by computerised machinery, but it is not 
necessarily true that we would expect to see huge growth in job opportunities for 
jobs with a low risk of computerisation if these occupations are no more 
complemented by technology than they can be substituted by it. For example, while 
Frey and Osborne predict little risk of automation for health and educational 
professionals, these have typically been thought of as sectors of the economy with 
low productivity growth and limited complementarity with new technology (Baumol, 
2012).120 Instead, demographics are more relevant predictors for the demand for 
skills required in these sectors, particularly with respect to an ageing population.  

On the other hand, technological progress should lead to job creation in some 
areas. In part, this will affect occupations already being recorded, where 
improvements in technology raise the productivity of such jobs and encourage more 
of them to be created. Other jobs may be entirely new and only exist due to recent 
innovations. Looking at the creation of new industrial categories gives some insights 
into where new demand is already beginning to emerge, such as in Internet 
publishing, broadcasting and search, electronic shopping and auctions, and data 
processing and hosting (Berger and Frey, forthcoming)121. However, this growth has 
been relatively limited compared to the magnitude of the threat to employment in 
other sectors and occupations.

Moreover, it is important to recognise that technological progress does not just 
affect the occupational structure in terms of numbers of different types of jobs, but 
can also change the nature of work within those occupations. In the past decade, 
there is evidence that some occupations have already experienced what Brown et 
al (2011)122 label ‘Digital Taylorism’, where knowledge work of many occupations is 
codified and routinised such that their respective labour-input has been deskilled — 
although typically performed by increasingly well-educated employees — while the 
high value part of these services is performed by computer algorithms. Examples in 
their research included bank managers and paralegals: in terms of a headcount, we 
would not conclude the demand for such occupations has reduced, but we certainly 
would when the nature of the work is examined. This may be increasingly relevant if 
technology begins to make it possible to automate more and more high-skilled 
tasks: the number of surgeons or engineers might not drop, but the value of their 
skills could be marginalised if their work begins to resemble more machine 
operative than highly skilled professionals.123124

One issue is how young people will need to prepare for entry into this labour 
market. Careers are likely to be more disrupted than at any other point in the past, 
with the possibility that any occupationally-specific skill could lose a great deal of 
value if the occupation in question becomes automated. People should anticipate 
the need to retrain in the future, which places a greater emphasis on general skills 
such as literacy and numeracy. Moreover, it seems likely that there will be a need 
for particular ICT skills. For example, if jobs are going to be replaced by rapid 
computerisation and if new jobs are to emerge, there needs to be sufficient 
individuals able to create and programme these new technologies. This is indeed 
the general perception of Citi clients, suggesting that more focus on STEM skills is 
needed, followed by an increase in soft skills and a move away from rote to active 
learning (Figure 96). 

Using data from the OECD’s Programme for International Assessment of Adult 
Competences (PIAAC) suggests that significant differences currently exist between 
countries in terms of IT relevant skills. Figure 97 compares for a subsample of the 
countries assessed the percentage of adults achieving the top two highest levels in 
tests of problem solving in technology rich environments. For the most recent cohort 
(aged 16-24 at the time of the survey in 2012), the outcome ranges from below 45% 
for the US, UK, Ireland, and Poland to over 60% for Sweden, Finland, and Korea. 
Moreover, while all countries have better performing young people than older 
workers as might be expected, there is significant variation in how rapidly these 
skills are growing between cohorts — for example, based on its older workers (aged 
45-55) Korea is ranked almost lowest out of all the OECD countries. Similar rapid 
increases are observed in the Czech Republic, while at the other end of the scale, 
the UK, US, and Japan have largely plateaued.

What explains this divergence requires further investigation, however, simple cross-
country comparisons suggest that it is not easily explained by resources or teaching 
proficiency. Figure 98 shows there is a positive correlation between computers per 
student and the PIAAC score: - that is, a negative correlation between resources 
and performance. Of course, such a relationship could be endogenous – perhaps 
some countries, finding that their students to have poor ICT skills, have invested

heavily in ICT resources. That said, countries like the UK and the US are reaching a 
point of having one computer per student and yet still fall behind, so even if 
resources do have a positive effect, clearly something else is needed.  

Similarly, the countries scoring highest for ICT skills on PIACC are also those where 
secondary school teachers tend to report they have a need for professional 
development in IT (Figure 99). This could point towards differences in curriculum: - 
low performing countries for ICT skills might have teachers who believe they have 
sufficient ICT skills because what they are being asked to teach is at a basic level. 

Just as important are non-cognitive skills — that is, the behavioural traits and 
characteristics that young people possess, such as motivation, perseverance and 
self-control (see Gutman and Schoon, 2013125, for an in-depth survey of these skills 
and evidence on the success of interventions). To take one specific example, coping 
— that is, an individual’s purposeful response to stress — is a valuable skill to 
possess in a labour market with high probabilities of automation.

In terms of the implications for the education system, early childhood interventions 
to raise non-cognitive skills appear to lead to higher returns from educational 
investments made later on (Heckman, 2007),126 although remedial investment in 
non-cognitive skills in young adults does seem to be more effective than remedial 
investment in cognitive skills like numeracy. However, malleability of non-cognitive 
skills is a key issue and it should not be assumed that education can significantly 
and causally improve all personality traits. For example, while there is evidence that 
something like coping or the ability to socially interact can be taught, there is rather 
less evidence at present for such a conclusion when it comes to a trait like creativity 
or leadership skills. 

As well as more general skills and competences, there will still be a need for job-
specific vocational skills, from high skilled professions down to lower-skill service 
sector occupations: - however, such investments will necessarily become riskier 
given the potential for unforeseeable automation of many labour processes. Moving 
this risk away from individuals towards employers and the state would be more 
efficient, but there are two potential problems.

Remedial investment in non-cognitive skills

On the one hand, employers have greater information about the required skills 
given their knowledge of sector or occupational specific technology and future 
investments. However, firms may worry about free-riding by rivals who can ‘poach’ 
newly trained workers without incurring the costs of producing those skills. On the 
other hand, the state faces significant informational constraints in seeking to 
subsidise skill development. For example, a long-standing problem in the UK is the 
inability of policymakers to distinguish between underinvestment due to a market 
failure and low investment in workplace skills that is in fact a rational decision made 
by employers in relation to their optimal product strategy and necessary work 
processes.  

Consequently, government subsidies often go towards training that would have 
taken place anyway, or towards certifying existing skills, or to generating new skills 
which are not utilised, rather than towards encouraging firms to utilise higher levels 
of existing skills. Following this, a lesson for education policy for the future is that 
observing falling levels of training in any traditionally higher status occupations that 
become “digitally Taylorised” (as described before) and deskilled does not 
necessarily imply state intervention on the supply side of the market is sufficient, or 
even necessary. In order to be effective, education policy to raise skill supply would 
need to be coupled with other policies that raise the demand for, and utilisation of, 
skills within workplaces.127 The route to achieving this may mean the development 
of a coherent industrial policy (see Keep and Mayhew, 2014),128 or at the very least 
facilitating greater co-ordination between the education and training sectors on one 
hand, employers and the demand side of the labour market on the other and the 
state somewhere in between. 

Of course, the effect of technology not only changes what the education sector 
needs to do in order to supply the labour market with necessary skills, it has the 
potential to also change the way this education and training is delivered. There are 
many reasons why costs of education have risen across many countries, but one is 
due to relative productivity growth. Education has typically been a low productivity 
growth sector as teaching methods are typically labour intensive and use limited 
technology – labour costs are liable to rise when wages in such sectors have to 
compete with those in other sectors where technology is raising productivity. In one 
sense, the rising share of national incomes spent on education is not a huge 
problem – the rising productivity and wages in other sectors allows societies to 
afford it (Baumol, 2011). On the other hand, it could be that there will soon be 
technologies which could be incorporated in the education system that could drive 
down costs and raise productivity. For example, digital technology allows for the 
costless replication of a single lecture to an unlimited number of students, and 
online teaching modules reduce the overheads incurred by schools, colleges and 
universities in physical locations.129  

                                                           
127 This supposes that a more skill-intensive production process than would exist without 
direct intervention is, in fact, something that should be aspired to. It may be in terms of a 
number of social objectives, but may not be the case in terms of productivity. New 
technologies may in fact be superior to skilled labour as an input, suggesting a trade-off 
between the level of output and the way it is distributed as income. 
128 Keep and Mayhew, (2014), Industrial strategy and the future of skills policy: the high 
road to sustainable growth, London: CIPD. 
129 A different explanation for the rise of the cost of education is the huge increase in 
educational administrators and administration cost. It is striking that such administration 
costs in colleges and universities have grown at a time when many other sectors have 
automated many administrative functions. New technologies may eventually have the 

Technology can also affect the way 
education and training is given. This is 
already seen in platforms such as MOOCs

Various models exist, from incorporating such technologies into a traditional 
education setting to moving entirely out of the classroom through massive open 
online courses (MOOCs) and similar. At this stage, the biggest unanswered issue is 
whether the use of new technology offers a genuine like-for-like substitute in terms 
of educational quality, or whether the development of certain skills or aspects of 
knowledge require face-to-face interaction, demonstration and feedback. 

                                                                                                                                      
same effect here, although of course such reforms may need to be implemented by the 
same administrators whose jobs would be under threat.

Will Robot Laws Slow the Pace of 
Change? Privacy, Ethics and 
Liability Issues 
Highlights  

 Robots in the past have been separated from humans with the use of safety 
cages, however this is about to change, robots will be entering our home, 
controlling our cars and expanding into the military sector. Ethics, privacy and 
liability issues are at the forefront of this debate 

 Ethical ramifications of robots used for elder care include a loss of privacy, 
potential reduction in human contact and the control of the robots themselves. 
Guidelines should be developed to guard against misuse 

 Privacy issues from the use of drones and the collection of data when robots 
enter our home are also important issues that are being highlighted. 

 Safety issues from the use of robots have been in place since robots have 
entered the workplace. However, now that robots will be working closely with 
humans, these need to be extended further. Liability issues with regards to who 
is responsible for mistakes or errors are highlighted especially in light of 
technology that could control our cars. 

 Some guidelines/laws are already responding to the issues above such as the 
development of a Robot Ethics Charter, guidelines on regulating robots, ISO 
standards and establishing ethics committees in companies. 

Regulation on the implementation of automation is one of the policy responses that 
could potentially offset some of the risks of automation. Robot laws are not new: in 
fact Isaac Asimov proposed the ‘Three Laws of Robotics’ in his short story 
‘Runaround’. Although fictional, these laws (1) a robot should not harm a human 
being; (2) a robot should always obey a human being; and (3) a robot should defend 
itself so long as it did not go against the first two laws, are currently being quoted in 
many articles such that they could actually be applied to today’s world. Although 
these provide a useful departure point for discussion, they are, however, fictional 
and were not written to be used in real life.   

The expansion of robots over the years has mainly been limited to tasks that are 
dull, dirty, dangerous or repetitive. Robots in many of these jobs have been 
separated from humans with the use of safety cages (Figure 100). This is about to 
change with the advancement of robots in military, service and health care sectors, 
where robots undoubtedly will have more direct contact with humans. This direct 
contact has led many researchers, technologists, philosophers, lawyers, 
governments, and others to discuss the important issues of ethics, privacy, liability, 
and safety issues surrounding the expansion of robots in different sectors. This 
chapter aims to highlight the main issues using examples from different areas, and 
discusses the principles, laws, and certifications that are being proposed that could 
help form some guidelines to the advancement of the use of robots in many sectors.

Robot Ethics 
Robot ethics is a growing interdisciplinary research effort trying to understanding the 
ethical implications and consequences of robotic technology. Many areas of robotics 
are impacted, especially those robots that interact with humans, ranging from elder 
care and medical robotics, to military robots and to all kinds of service robots.130 We 
focus our discussion on the ethics of robots in the caring and military sectors, 
however similar issues arise in other sectors such as medicine and other service 
robots.  

Robot Ethics and Ageing Populations 
As described in the demographics chapter, the proportions of elderly people are 
increasing in many countries due to an increase in life expectancy and a decrease 
in fertility rates. This, together with a reduction in the number of caregivers in 
society has led several governments to consider the use of robots as caregivers, 
companions, and healthcare assistants. Japan is at the forefront of such 
technology; this is due to the fact that they are already feeling the effects of an 
ageing population. An example of such a robot is Robobear, which uses advanced 
technology to power its intelligent vision, has flexible movement, and has arms 
strong enough to lift a human off the ground (Figure 101) and is designed primarily 
to provide care to the sick and elderly. Robobear is the brainchild of Toshharu 
Mukai, a scientist who has been leading the Robot Sensor System Research Team 
at the Riken-SRK Collaboration Centre for Human Interactive Robot Research. The 
cost of the Robobear prototype is estimated at $168,000 to $252,000; however the 
manufacturers are hoping that the price will come down.131 Other care robots 
include Paro, a therapeutic robot that helps relieve stress for the elderly and Care-
Bot, developed by Genko Systems, which is programmed to assist senior care in a 
variety of real-life situations.

Whilst robots can bring benefits to elder care and the institutions that provide it, 
scholars have expressed concern about the ethical ramifications including: (1) the 
invasion of privacy (for example remote electronic surveillance of elderly people 
bathing or changing); (2) feelings of a loss of control; (3) potential reduction in the 
amount of human contact; and (4) the circumstances in which the elderly would be 
allowed to control robots. There are especially strong objections to robots being 
used as a replacement to humans and some have argued that robots should only 
be used as assistants. However, in certain countries there is a worry that there will 
not be enough young people to take care of the elderly and therefore robots can 
form part of the solution and provide an important service. They can be used to 
assist the elderly in their daily tasks, to help monitor their health and to provide 
companionship.132 Sharkey and Sharkey in their article called ‘Granny and the 
Robots: Ethical Issues in Robot Care for the Elderly’ state that “it is not the use of 
robots in elder care per se that should concern us, but the ways in which they are 
used”. They conclude that identifying ethical concerns regarding robots in elder care 
is a first step in ensuring that their introduction would not result in a deterioration of 
welfare of people exposed to them. Therefore developing appropriate guidelines on 
ways in which robots could be deployed in this sector could help guard against 
misuse.

Robot Ethics and Military 
The issue of automated and autonomous weapons has been debated intensively 
over the years. In fact the use of aerial drones by the US in a range of different 
operations has increasingly been scrutinised133 especially with regards to: (1) 
targeting killing; (2) the moral implications of injuries to non-combatants resulting 
from the extensive deployment of drones against terrorists; and (3) the fact that 
such weapons are unmanned and decisions are taken thousands of miles away 
from the action. In the UK the debate was ignited when it was announced in April 
2013 that drones would operate from the RAF base in Lincolnshire. Since then they 
have been heavily debated especially with regards to targeted killing as shown in 
media reports when two radicalised British citizens were killed by a MQ- Reaper 
Drone in Syria.

Even though the US government has stated that the use of force and individual 
targeting will be kept under human control, there is enormous pressure to use 
autonomous robots in warfare to reduce or eliminate the risk to human soldiers and 
to obtain better intelligence through surveillance operations. According to Prof 
Stuart Russell, the development of lethal autonomous weapon systems known as 
‘LAWS’ have reached a point where the deployment of such systems could be 
feasible within years and not decades. These systems have been described as the 
‘third revolution in warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear arms.’134  

Fast Lightweight Autonomy (FLA) and Collaborative Operations in Denied 
Environment (CODE) are two autonomous military projects that are being 
researched in the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The FLA 
project will programme tiny rotorcraft to manoeuvre unaided at high speed in urban 
areas and inside buildings, which could be an ideal drone for hostage situations. 
CODE aims to develop teams of autonomous aerial vehicles carrying out strike 
missions in a situation in which energy signal-jamming makes communication with a 
human commander impossible.135

There are several ethical questions that arise from the deployment of autonomous 
military robots including: (1) Who will be accountable if any errors are committed?; 
(2) Will autonomous robots be able to follow established guidelines of the Laws and 
Rules of Engagement as specified by the Geneva Convention?; (3) Will robots 
recognise the difference between military and civilians?; (4) Will they refrain from 
shooting if someone is wounded or retires from combat?136 The potential lethal 
consequence of deploying certain military robots clearly illustrates the importance of 
the ethical dimensions of robotics. It is however important to distinguish between 
robots used as defensive weapons or other functions such as bomb disposal or 
landmine removal robots which perform life- saving operations, and robots that can 
be considered lethal. 

The United Nations has had a series of meetings on LAWS; within a few years the 
process could lead to banning such autonomous weapons or else it could leave in 
place the status quo, leading inevitably to an arms race. In July 2015, an open letter 
was signed by approximately 20,000 AI and robotic researchers and other 
endorsers condemning the use of such weapons and suggesting that a ban could 
ultimately prevent such a military AI arms race.137   

So Are We Living in 1984? Privacy Issues and Robotics 
Robots by definition are equipped with the ability to sense (including vision 
capabilities), process and record the world around them138 and therefore it is not 
hard to see how privacy could be an issue. The effects of robots on privacy could be 
divided into three main categories: (1) direct surveillance; (2) increased access; and 
(3) social meaning. Direct surveillance is already being used in the deployment of 
drones in the military as part of surveillance missions; however this new technology 
is presenting corporations and individuals with new tools of observation in different 
sectors such as marketing, e-commerce and security. The Federal Aviation 
Administration has recently given approval to a Washington DC-based company 
called ‘Measure’, to fly 324 commercial drones to collect data for a number of 
applications.139 It provides its services to companies in several industries including 
agriculture, disaster relief and insurance, infrastructure and energy. Amazon is also 
planning to use drones for its delivery service by tracking the location of the person 
it is delivering to by pulling data from their smart phone.  

The issue of privacy and drones in our public space is clearly demonstrated by a 
number of stories that have surfaced in the media, of people shooting down drones 
that fly over their property.140 Whether this is legal or not is an issue for the US 
courts, however the question arises as to whether there is a loss of privacy and how 
do we feel about drones with long-ranging listening devices or drones that are 
hovering outside our property and taking pictures?

Ethical issues on the use of military robots 
include accountability, following of 
established war guidelines and others

Regulators also worry that low cost drones, which are widely available for purchase, 
could ultimately pose a threat to commercial aviation and vital infrastructure. For 
example helicopters that were used for fire-fighting efforts in San Bernardino had to 
temporarily halt operations for fears of colliding with the drones that were hovering 
over the flames.141  However companies such as Thales SA are working on a 
system that would use radar to spot the drone, a camera to identify it and 
sophisticated jamming tools that could take control of the system.

When talking about privacy one cannot help but mention the issues that Google has 
and is currently facing. Many countries across the world have launched 
investigations into Google Street View. At the beginning of the debate, the 
arguments focused exclusively on the capturing, storing and displaying of images 
obtained by Google Street View cars. One example is the law suit that Aaron and 
Christine Boring filed against Google to remove photos of their Pennsylvania home 
which appeared on Street View. Google removed the photos of the Boring’s 
residency, however since then it has also surfaced that through its Street View cars 
the company also obtained a huge amount of WiFi data including SSID information 
(the Wi-Fi network name) and MAC addresses (the Wi-Fi router unique number) 
from receivers in its vehicles. Google has stopped its collection of WiFi data; 
however this led to investigations in several countries, and several law suits have 
been filed against the company. In one case, Google agreed to pay $7 million to 38 
states and the District of Columbia to settle the matter.

Visible drones manning a city, whether it is to provide a commercial service, for 
surveillance purposes or for other issues, or cars driving around taking pictures and 
collecting data, invoke George Orwell’s 1984, where surveillance was at the 
forefront of the world described in the book. In its court documents against the 
Borings, Google stated that ‘Today’s satellite-image technology means that even in 
today’s desert, complete privacy does not exist’.142 This statement opens up 
another debate into whether privacy can actually be maintained or still exists in 
today’s world.  

Other issues relating to privacy include access to private spaces and activities such 
as our home. With the internet of things coming into force and connecting our 
appliances and devices together it will permit guesses about the interior life of a 
household such as what time a person gets home and what habits they may have 
such as playing video games or watching television. The issue of robots entering 
our home is a different matter. With costs decreasing, personal or home robots are 
rapidly expanding, in fact 28% more service robots were sold in 2013 when 
compared to 2012 (this includes vacuum and floor cleaning, lawn-mowing and 
entertainment and leisure robots).143 Applications for home or service robots are 
potentially infinite and can occur in areas such as elder care (described above), 
education, entertainment, and home security. Home robots can come equipped with 
sensors, GPS systems and cameras and in some cases they can also connect 
wirelessly to the Internet to either relay messages or images or sometimes to 
update their programming. The mere fact that a machine is making extensive, 
unguided record of events in a home could represent a privacy risk.  

The question also arises as to who will have access to this data and what will 
become of some information. Recently a US consumer rights group called Epic has 
claimed that Samsung breached the privacy of its users by allowing its smart TVs to 
record private conversations without informing its users. This campaign will 
definitely not end here, and such discussions demonstrate the complexity of this 
technology entering the home and the lack of consumer understanding of what it is 
doing and how it works.  

Hacking (and viruses) is also a concern especially when millions if not billions are 
spent by companies on cyber security every year. Robots could be particularly at 
risk especially when they rely on communications over public networks.144 It can 
affect privacy issues, for example in the case of personal and home robots and can 
also be a safety concern. For example Stuxnet, a 500-kilobyte computer worm, 
infected software of at least 14 industrial sites in Iran including a uranium-
enrichment plant. It targeted Microsoft Windows machines and networks and then 
sought out Siemens Step 7 software and used it to program industrial control 
systems that operate equipment. Whilst a human operator of an oil rig, nuclear plant 
and other industrial processes can be susceptible to coercion, influence, bribery 
etc., it is unlikely to be as dangerous or as scalable as a virus affecting a robot that 
is controlling the industrial process.

Google believes that with today’s satellite 
image technology complete privacy does not 
exist. However with robots entering our 
home the issue of privacy becomes an 
important issue 

Cyber security is also another issue which 
should be taken seriously

Safety, Errors, and Liability Issues  
A number of workplace fatalities related to robotics have taken place over the years, 
however many of the incidents were related to either repairing the robot and/or 
entering a controlled space such as a safety cage. The latest episode occurred at a 
Volkswagen plant in Germany in which a robot unfortunately crashed a technician 
against a metal plate. The incident occurred during installation and involved a fast 
moving first generation robot designed to operate inside a cage, away from 
humans. The VW case was a factory accident rather than a fault in the robotic 
system; however, in a world where people will be interacting with robots on a daily 
basis, safety and liability issues must be even more at the forefront of the 
advancement of robotics. Collaborative robots or co-bots such as Baxter or Sawyer 
are designed to work with humans in manufacturing without safety-fencing. No 
fatalities have been reported from the use of co-bots, however they have only 
started to infiltrate the market; the co-bots have been programmed with safety 
features that let them detect and react to nearby humans.

With robots, the safety issue is with their software and design, and for anyone 
whom has written any software code, one would know that somewhere in the 
millions of lines of code sometimes written by a team of people, there could be 
mistakes or errors. However in robots, particularly robots that interact directly with 
humans, a tiny software flaw could potentially be fatal. Currently there is a safety 
standard for industrial robots called ISO 10218-1 ‘Robots and robotic devices- 
safety requirements for industrial robots’ which provides specific requirements and 
guidance for the assurance of safety in the design and construction of the robot 
itself. Recently a new standard was issued for safety in personal care robots, in 
particular for three types of personal robots -a mobile servant robot, physical 
assistant robot and personal carrier robot called ISO 13482.

Linked to the risk of mistakes or errors is the problem of liability — who is 
responsible if something goes wrong? The responsibility question is particularly 
pertinent to military robots as anyone across the supply chain could be made 
responsible including the manufacturer, programmer, the military procurement 
officer, the robot’s handler and even the President of the United States.145 There 
have been several liability cases that have been filed in court relating to accidents 
involving industrial robots. The case of Jones vs Automation Inc. showed the 
complexities of such issues. The court stated that GM was at fault for the injury to 
the plaintiff when he was struck by a robot gantry loading system used in the auto 
plant. GM’s modification to the system was the apparent cause of the accident and 
not the manufacturers of the robot as there was no evidence of a defect to the 
system.  

Another interesting case on liability involved a driver who hit a pedestrian while 
making a left hand turn in his car. The lawsuit against the driver was dismissed as 
he (the driver) did not have a chance to avoid the accident. Even though this case 
had nothing to do with robots or automation systems, the court in its judgement 
stated that ‘A human being, no matter how efficient, is not a mechanical robot and 
does not possess the ability of a radar machine to discover danger before it 
becomes manifest’. Could this decision raise the possibility that once we have 
autonomous cars, the courts might raise the standard of care for manufacturers to 
avoid collisions, since robots can act more accurately than humans? 146 In the 
coming years autonomous vehicle liability (the question of who is responsible if 
something goes wrong) is certain to be a topic of continuing interest in the legal 
community and among companies working to develop the technology. Sixteen 
states in the US have already passed some legislation related to autonomous 
vehicles mostly related to safety, testing and licensing. There is some mention of 
liability in some states such as Colorado, where it retains liability for damages with 
the driver who may or may not use autonomous ‘guidance technology’ while other 
states such as Hawaii absolve manufacturers of liability where a car has been 
retrofitted by a third party.147 However, there is no clear legislation as to who is 
responsible when something bad happens (whether it is the driver, manufacturer 
etc.). The discussions in this field will definitely continue and specific legislation for 
liability with regards to autonomous cars and other autonomous robots might need 
to be enacted if it is deemed that the current legislation available is not appropriate.  

Principles, Standards, Certification, Rules of Robots 
Some laws are already responding to the issues mentioned above. Several US 
states have laws governing autonomous cars, whilst others have laws concerning 
drones. The Food and Drug Administration is actively monitoring robotic surgery, 
whilst the Federal Aviation Authority is currently responsible for drone permits. 
However some argue that since robotics and automation are changing very quickly 
and these organisations that are in charge or partially in charge are not talking to 
one another, a new federal robotics agency should be set up. This agency could 
help the law catch up, serve as a place of expertise in new technology, and help the 
public, law makers and others understand such transformative change.148

Liability is also at the forefront of the 
discussion, this is particularly relevant to

agency could help the law catch up with the 
rapid advancement of robotics

Other governments are also discussing these issues. The South Korean 
Government has published the Robots Ethics Charter149 which sets ethical 
guidelines concerning robot functions, a move which anticipates a time when 
service robots are part of daily life. The Japanese Government in its Robot Strategy 
has emphasised the importance of establishing internationally compatible 
regulations and standardisation. The EU has also funded a project through its FP7 
Framework programme called RoboLaw which produced guidelines on regulating 
robots using case-studies in different sectors. This is particularly important for the 
EU legal system but some of these guidelines could be implemented in other 
countries. The UK’s research council EPSRC has together with different academics 
also produced five principles of robotics mainly focused for designers, builders and 
users of robots which aim to provide modern rules for robotics that capture issues 
such as privacy, liability and ethics as described in this chapter. Companies are also 
getting on board; in fact according to Google Deepmind’s CEO, Google is also 
setting up an ethics committee.150  

There have been some interesting debates over the last few years on these issues 
and several ethics committees and organisations have been set up. Further 
international standards are also being proposed including a standard for 
cooperating robots, a safety standard for robot devices and nursing care and a 
modularisation of software and hardware that move on wheels.151 However in a 
digital, globalised world, important issues such as ethics, privacy, liability and safety 
need designed institutions, incentives, laws about what information flows should be 
permitted or prevented,152 international guidelines on how to operate in homes, 
standardisation for safety issues and laws on ethical and legal consideration of 
autonomous weapons. The quicker such standards are developed, the quicker the 
advancement and adoption of robots will happen in different sectors, however such 
standards may indeed arrest, rather than accelerate, the advancement and 
adoption of robots. Whether you agree with this expansion or not is another matter, 
however at least we will have some sort of protection. What is definitely clear is that 
in an age when the discussion on automation and the loss of jobs has reached sky 
high, and technology is moving at such a fast rate, the people who might gain from 
all this (besides the people working in AI) are lawyers who will be needed more than 
ever to cover issues such as privacy, liability, safety and ethics in a world deemed 
by two MIT Professors the ‘Second Machine Age’.153 

AI and robotics are not actually the problem — it is the way we use them that is the 
issue. Demis Hassabis, the head of Google’s $565 million machine learning 
programme states that "Artificial intelligence is the science of making machines 
smart,"…. "If we're able to imbue machines with intelligence then they might be able 
to help us as a society to solve all kinds of big problems that we would like to have a 
better mastery of — all the way from things like disease and healthcare, to big 
questions we have in science like climate change and physics, where having the 
ability for machines to understand and find insights in large amounts of data could 
be very helpful to the human scientists and doctors."154

Yanis Varoufakis (the former finance minister of Greece) views technology and 
automation in a different way to Hassabis. In an interesting discussion with the 
music producer Brian Eno, he stated that the issue with automation is ownership, 
and whether the ownership of the machinery will get even more unequal: “The way I 
try to express my own fear of, and hope for, the future is that we have our choice, 
which is between Star Trek and the Matrix. Star Trek is this: we’re all sitting around 
having philosophical conversations like in the ancient Agora in Athens and the 
slaves are not human. There are holes in the walls on the Starship Enterprise; you 
ask for something and it comes up. Fantastic. So then you can explore the universe 
and talk to Klingons. That’s one choice — the utopia. The dystopia is The Matrix, 
where the machines are being fed by our own energy. We are plugged into a false 
consciousness that the machines have been created to keep us happy. We think we 
are leading a perfectly normal life, but all along we are the slaves of the machines. 
So these are the two extremes. And the choice whether we go to Star Trek or The 
Matrix is ours. It’s a political choice.”155

Will Keynes Prediction of a World of 
Leisure Prove Correct? 
Highlights  

 Keynes predicted that technology was an opportunity for us to enjoy more leisure 
time. Technology has reduced the cost of leisure, from travel to TVs. It also 
allows people to work flexibly.  

 Evidence shows that the number of working hours has decreased over time 
whilst wages have also increased. There are however differences between 
countries with people in Nigeria working the longest hours, and people in 
Australia working the shortest number of hours per week. 

 Average leisure time has increased when compared to the 1960’s; however this 
differs between countries. A case study in the US shows that leisure time also 
differs between people who have different educational attainment and earnings, 
with professionals working more than 50 hours per week. 

 Technology has also changed our leisure activities, and also our work practices. 
Millennials would like to shift their work hours, while countries like China are 
reducing their working weekly hours to increase spending in leisure, whilst 
Sweden is moving to a 6 hour work day to increase productivity in the workplace. 

 One of the least commitment paths for policy makers to deal with the expansion 
of automation in the workplace could be to follow Keynes suggestion; however, 
work creates additional benefits such as personal worth and social attachment. 

 The worry is that the 15 hour week that Keynes referred to would become a 
reality for people who are under-employed or un-employed, squeezed out by 
machines. However, if leisure time does increase for all, then the ultimate 
winners would be the media and leisure sectors. 

Living in a Star Trek world, as described in the previous chapter, could lead to a 
world with more leisure time. Keynes in 1930 had already predicted that ongoing 
technological advances could displace workers. He viewed this as a huge 
opportunity rather than a concern. He looked at technological unemployment as a 
way of mankind solving its economic problem and in his essay called ‘Economic 
Possibilities for our Grandchildren’156 predicted that by 2030 the average work week 
would shrink to 15 hours per week allowing humans to enjoy more leisure time. 
“Thus for the first time since his creation man will be faced with his real, his 
permanent problem-how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to 
occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to 
live wisely and agreeably and well.” 

Could automation allow us all more leisure time whilst also keeping a good standard 
of living?

How Long are We Currently Working and How Much 
Leisure Time do We Currently Have? 
Evidence from the OECD shows that the annual hours actually worked per year per 
person has decreased over time (Figure 105). This is calculated by dividing the 
number of hours worked per year by the average number of people in employment 
per year. They include actual regular work hours of full-time, part time and part-year 
workers and exclude time taken off because of public holidays, annual leave, sick 
leave etc. The data is intended for comparisons of trends over time, rather than the 
level of average annual hours of work for a given year. The results show that for 
example in France and in the US the average annual hours worked per person has 
reduced by 35% and 10% respectively in 2014 when compared to 1950. Real 
wages have increased over the same period (Figure 106).

 If we look at an average working week, we see that that in 2014, people in Nigeria 
worked the most hours (48.2 hours/week), followed by people in Ghana who worked 
on average 47.8 hours/week. People in the US worked on average 44.5 hours per 
week (8.9 hours/day); this is based on employed persons aged 25-54, who live in 
households with children under 18.

How Much Leisure Time Do We Have?  
It is estimated that on average in the US, leisure time for men increased by 6-8 
hours per week (driven by a decline in market work hours) and for women by 4-8 
hours per week (driven by a decline in home production work hours) from 1965 to 
2003.159 Valerie Ramey provides lower figures when compared to the Aguiar and 
Hurst analysis; she estimates that leisure time has increased by 1-4 hours for men 
and 3-5 hours for women over the same period. The technological revolution in the 
home such as the introduction of washing machines, electric or gas cookers, 
vacuum cleaners etc. have reduced the amount of time that needs to be spent on 
cleaning the household and this amongst other things has enabled women to enter 
the workforce. In fact it is estimated that the introduction of household appliances 
accounted for 40% of the observed increase in married women’s labour force 
participation rates during the 1960s.160 A study done by Tiago et al. (2008)161 has 
estimated that in the UK the decline in the price of home appliances accounts alone 
for about 10 to 15% of the increase in female labour participation rates from 1975 to 
1999. However even though women did replace time spent on household chores 
with labour, their leisure time also increased. Aguiar and Hurst estimate that home 
appliances reduced time spent on home production by roughly 11 hours per week 
between 1965 and 2003 — this more than offset women’s 5 hour per week increase 
in the labour market.

Data from the OECD provides a different picture. Figure 108 below indicates that 
over the past 40 years, different countries have experienced different evolutions in 
terms of shares of time dedicated to leisure. The share of time dedicated to leisure 
in the Netherlands seems to have fallen from the mid-1970s to 2003, with a similar 
pattern of decline in leisure in the UK. In the US and Canada rising amounts of 
leisure are seen over time albeit at a lower base (especially in the US) than 
European countries. This raises the discussion of whether a decrease in hours 
worked over time necessarily means a symmetrical upsurge of available leisure 
time. The OECD believes that it doesn’t. For this analysis the OECD used a narrow 
definition of leisure, by extending the definition to include a % of personal care 
(defined as sleeping, eating and drinking and personal services) this extends the 
time spent on leisure activities in different countries. This shows the complexity in 
measuring time spent on leisure activities. Figure 109 below compares the leisure 
time in different countries, with Mexico having the lowest time dedicated to leisure 
and Belgium the highest.

The American Time Use Survey estimates that in 2014 on an average weekday, 
men and women spent 5.1 hours and 4.5 hours, respectively, on leisure and sports 
activities. This reduces to 3.3 hours for full time employees and 4.7 hours for part-
time employees. The majority of this time is spent watching TV (average of 1.8 
hours for full time employees), followed by socializing (0.5 hours). For more

Higher earners and people that have a higher education have less leisure time 
available when compared with lower earners and people that have a high school 
diploma or less (see Figure 111 and Figure 112 below). There are many factors that 
account for this leisure time-gap. Part of this has to do with the structure changes to 
the labour market, where low-skilled jobs are often poorly paid and unsatisfying. So 
the value of working more hours amongst the under-educated is fairly low and 
therefore the rise in leisure increases. Also many well-educated people like what 
they do, so the reward of working extra hours goes beyond the financial incentives. 
A Harvard Business survey of 1,000 professionals in the US has found that 94% of 
the respondents work at least 50 hours per week and almost half work more than 65 
hours a week, which is above the global average of 41 hours per week. A more 
recent survey undertaken by the Centre for Creative Leadership163 has found that 
60% (out of 483 professionals, managers and executives surveyed) who use a 
smartphone for business, work between 13.5 to 18.5 hours/day. The analysis does 
state however that smart phones allow flexibility, where managers are able to leave 
early, for example for family related events, all while being able to keep abreast of 
what is going on at work. Many high earners would potentially like to work less for 
somewhat (proportionally) less pay and would like more flexibility allowing them to 
work remotely and have more of a work/life balance (see a discussion on the PwC 
employee survey found in the next section).

However, even if in some high earning occupations the amount of hours worked is 
above the global average as described above and leisure time available is less than 
the average worker, the cumulative time that people spend on leisure has increased 
over the years. This is due to many factors, but one in particular is that we are living 
longer and spending more time in retirement. Figure 113 below shows that on 
average men and women spend an additional 7.1 and 7.9 years in retirement in 
2012 when compared to 1970. Figure 114 shows the average time spent in 
retirement in 2012 in different countries. Average time spent on leisure activities in 
the US in 2014 for people aged 65 to 74 years and 75 years and over is 6.6 hours 
and 7.9 hours respectively, which is more than double the amount of time spent in 
leisure during employment; coupling this with the extra time in retirement, and one 
can see that cumulative leisure time has actually increased over the years. Ramey 
and Francis (2009) in fact estimate that a person who was born in the 1930’s had a 
cumulative leisure time of 113,000 hours, this increased to 143,000 hours for 
someone who was born in the year 2000.164

Since we are living longer the cumulative 
time that people spend on leisure has 
increased over the years

How has Technology Affected our Leisure Activities? 
Over the last decade we have seen extraordinary changes in technology. It has 
changed the type of leisure activities that we value today and also decreased the 
costs over time. For example the cost of airline tickets has decreased over 50% in 
the last 30 years.165 There are many factors that contribute to this such as 
deregulation; however technology also played a part. From fuel saving technologies 
that reduce costs for airline companies, to computers that are used to move prices 
around and enable us to shop for the lowest prices, to purchasing tickets directly 
from the Internet rather than the airline itself or a travel agency; all of these 
developments have encouraged more people to fly over the years and reduce the 
costs in the process. The cost of a TV has also declined over the years. The first 
compatible colour TV set sold for $1,000 in 1953 (or $8,480 adjusted on today’s 
terms), the price decreased in the 1970s when a 25 inch colour TV cost $530 (or 
$1,840 adjusted), and in 2011 one could purchase a colour TV for as little as 
$320166 (see Figure 115 below). Today you don’t even need a TV; you can 
streamline television programmes just by using your computer through services 
such as Netflix, BBC I-player and others. Technology has changed the way we 
socialise, the way we read books, watch TV, play video games etc.

Can Automation/Technology Reduce Working Hours 
Further and Increase Leisure Time Without Compromising 
the Standard of Living for All? 
The eight hour day hasn’t changed very much since Henry Ford first adopted a five-
day, 40-hour week for his workers in his factories. He reduced the work week from 6 
to 5 days arguing that every man needs more than one day a week for rest and 
recreation. He stated that “It is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for 
workmen is either ‘lost time’ or a class privilege.”167 He however did admit that the 
five-day work week was instituted in order to increase productivity as even though 
workers hours decreased, they were expected to expend more effort when they 
were at work. He also stated that people need to have more leisure time available to 
find uses for consumer products, including automobiles.  

However, could the 40-hour week (traditionally worked between 9am and 5pm) be 
coming to an end? PwC together with the University of Southern California and 
London Business School have surveyed tens of thousands of employees of PwC 
firms around the world to explore the thinking and mind set among its younger 
employees (Millennials born between 1980 and 1995). They found that 64% of 
Millennials would like to occasionally work from home and 66% of respondents 
would like to shift their work hours.168 They believe that productivity should not be 
measured by the number of hours worked at the office but by the output of work 
performed. In our previous chapter on jobs we also highlighted that 53 million 
people in the US were working in some sort of freelance capacity. According to the 
Freelancers Union the two most common reasons for going freelance were (1) to 
earn extra money and (2) to have flexibility in their schedule. Workers especially 
young workers would like to see more flexibility in their working hours, enabling then 
to achieve a better work/life balance.  

We are also seeing such policies being implemented on a national scale. The 
Province of Chongqing in China which is home to 30 million people has begun 
implementing an official policy for a 4.5-day working week as part of an effort to 
increase domestic consumption and leisure spending. Other provinces such as 
Hebei and Jiangxi are also considering implementing such a policy measure. 
Domestic tourism generated nearly half a trillion (US$) for China’s economy in 
2014, and the extended weekend will give workers more opportunities to travel and 
spend more within China.169 Sweden on the other hand is moving to a standard 6-
hour work day with the aim of increasing productivity in the work place, with 
businesses across the country already implementing the change. It is too early to 
determine whether such measures will be successful in improving productivity, 
however there are many studies that have discussed how an 8-hour day is not as 
effective as one would think and to stay focused on one particular task for 8 hours is 
a huge challenge.   

With the rapid increase in automation and technology, could it be that the working 
hour week would reduce even further when some of our work tasks become 
automated which could possibly increase our leisure time in the process? Could 
Keynes theory of working a 15-hour week actually become a reality?

169 World Economic Forum (2015), Is China heading towards a 4.5 day week? 

64% of Millennials would like to change the 
way they work 

Policies regarding the working hour week 
are also changing in China and Sweden 

Could technology change the working hour 
week further?

Andy Haldane from the Bank of England in a recent speech did argue that that one 
of the paths requiring the least commitment from policy makers to deal with 
automation in the workforce would be to relax and follow the path Keynes charted in 
the 1930 — ‘a world of progressively shorter working weeks, where mini-breaks 
become maxi-breaks’. However, Haldane states that work delivers other benefits 
besides money- it creates a sense of personal worth and social attachment. Keynes 
does address this and states that “Yet there is no country and no people, I think, 
who can look forward to the age of leisure and abundance without dread. For we 
have trained too long to strive and not to enjoy.” He argues that a 15-hour week 
would be sufficient to satisfy our need for work. So the question arises whether 
people would actually enjoy more leisure time or consider this as being idle or 
feeling useless. 

Automation could improve productivity and allow the opportunity (or not, depending 
how you view work) for people to work less hours. Working shorter weeks could be 
a potential solution to alleviate some of the negative effects that automation could 
have on the labour market and increase our leisure time in the process. The worry 
is that the 15 hours a week that Keynes refers to, would become a reality for people 
who are under-employed or unemployed, squeezed out by machines replacing their 
job tasks and made to work shorter hours, reducing their wages in the process. 
Maybe automation and technology would enable us to work less whilst also 
maintaining a good standard of living. History has shown us that average working 
hours have decreased over the years (at least for some professions and some 
countries) whilst average wages have also increased over time. If this happens, 
then the media and leisure sector would be the ultimate winner, benefiting from a 
huge increase in leisure time available. However, you never know: with time on our 
hands, we could actually start enjoying science, painting, writing and reading, 
leisure activities that were valued in the 1930s.  

 

Working shorter weeks could be a potential 
solution to the negative effects of 
automation on the labour market. The worry 
is that this would become a reality for the 
under-employed

Conclusion 
In the words of the famous author Elbert Hubbard —- “One machine can do the 
work of fifty ordinary men, No machine can do the work of one extraordinary man.” 
With technology advancing at a rapid pace, could Hubbard be right? Do we need to 
be extraordinary for technology not to take our job?  

Over the last few years there have been many academics, industrialists and others 
that have highlighted, analysed and debated the rapid expansion of automation in 
the workplace. In our previous Citi GPS report Technology at Work, we concluded 
that 47% of the jobs in the US are susceptible to automation. In this publication we 
extend this analysis to other countries and regions and conclude that jobs in 
developing countries are also susceptible to automation. Due to technological 
advancement low-wage regions which have traditionally attracted manufacturing 
firms will not have the same possibility of achieving rapid growth by shifting workers 
from farms to higher-paying factory jobs -therefore they would need to find a 
different path to prosperity.  

Our analysis also extends to cities, and we conclude that in the US, cities that are 
more specialised in a certain industry are at high risk of automation, whilst others 
that have a more diversified industry are more resilient to the expanding scope of 
automation. Work by Oxford Martin School researchers shows that the cities most 
at risk include Fresno and Las Vegas, whilst cities least at risk include Boston, 
Washington D.C and New York. The best way for cities to reduce their exposure to 
automation is to upskill their workforce.  

New jobs are also emerging with forecasts suggesting that there will be 9.5 million 
new job openings and 98 million replacement jobs in the EU from 2013 to 2025. 
However our analysis shows that roughly half of the jobs available in the EU would 
need highly skilled workers, something which is emphasized in both the previous 
chapters.  

In the US, the digital economy is also creating some new jobs, whilst other sectors 
such as the green economy and industrial sectors are also increasing their job 
openings. Over 4 million jobs are expected to be created in the health sector alone. 
This is not surprising given that we are living longer. In fact it is estimated that in 
advanced economies, the population over 65 years old is expected to increase, 
whilst at the same time the working age population is expected to decrease — 26 
million additional workers would be needed over the next 20 years. Could 
automation and innovation help offset these macro-effects of demographic change? 
Embracing automation has been amongst the strategies being pursued in a number 
of countries including Japan and China. Incremental productivity gains through 
automation could plausibly offset the demographic developments in a number of 
countries.  

Automation should lead to productivity improvements. However this is not yet 
evident. Across the advanced economies and in many emerging markets, 
measured productivity growth is low in historical comparison. We offer three 
explanations for this: (1) productivity is not measured correctly, (2) changes in 
composition of production have taken place that imply a wider distribution of 
productivities amongst different companies and workers; and (3) rapid changes in 
technology will require significant adaptation to develop their full productive 
potential. We also conclude that technological change is re-enforcing a low-inflation 
environment and consequently interest rates are likely to remain lower for longer.

While most studies have focused on long-term susceptibility to automation, Citi’s 
analysts have already seen automation and computerisation occur in a number of 
different sectors such as the food industry, call centres, warehouses and others. 
With robots getting cheaper and wages increasing in certain countries like China, 
other sectors which have traditionally been slow at integrating robots into their 
manufacturing process are now changing. There remain some barriers, especially 
to SMEs which pride themselves on their fixed to variable ratio, however with the 
introduction of co-bots these barriers could decrease over time.   

It should be evident that a world in which innovation is accelerating and abundant is 
preferred to a world in which it is lacking. But this report highlights the potential 
disruption that technological changes could cause for jobs in different regions and 
cities. If technological advancement is left unmanaged or poorly managed these 
changes could create significant disruptions to society. In fact 85% (64% by a 
significant degree, 21% to a minor degree) of the respondents to our survey believe 
this to be true (see figure below). 

Figure 116. 85% of Respondents Believe that Automation will Lead to Major Challenges for Societies and Policy Makers

In the last part of the report we highlight a number of different measures that could 
be taken to reduce this disruption. These include policy responses such as Earned 
Income Tax Credits, job placement services, regulations, investment in education 
etc. We also highlight the importance of principles, standards, certification, 
guidelines and laws that should be developed to ensure some sort of protection for 
society. In the last chapter we discuss the least commitment path that policymakers 
could take, which is to reduce working hours and increase leisure time. The 
question is whether an increase in leisure time would become a reality for people 
who are under-employed or unemployed, squeezed out by machines replacing their 
job tasks. However, you never know: using the words of Varoufakis, we could live in 
a Star Trek world, where machines will enable us to have time to sit around and 
have philosophical conversations, where you ask for something and it appears, and 
where we have time to explore the universe and talk to Klingons. Maybe it is not all 
doom and gloom — 76% of respondents to our survey state that they are techno-
optimists and only 21% are techno-pessimists.
