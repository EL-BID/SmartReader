DEBUG:root:VideoAre the robots coming for government jobs According to Bill Eggers the answer is yes sort of Eggers who runs Deloitte s Center for Government Insights said at a Nov 29 FCW event on government modernization that 20 to 30 percent of all work activities will soon be automatable thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence He pointed to a Deloitte study of the federal workforce that found 4 3 billion hours are spent each year on a wide range of task and activities A huge share of those hours is devoted to essentially moving paper he said while relatively little time goes to coaching and other sorts of human activities But the study also found that four out of five of the most labor intensive activities have either a medium or high automation potential Eggers said That could allow for reductions in certain parts of the workforce he noted but it also frees up time for critical higher value work and the chance to deliver better service by giving the human workforce AI powered support Studies have repeatedly shown Eggers said that it s the human machine pairing that gives the best results he said The full video of Eggers half hour talk which explores the larger implications for government as AI becomes the new electricity is available below Note This dual screen video recording is best viewed when expanded to the full browser window For more

publication has been defining and informing the senior management agenda since 1964 Our learning programs help organizations accelerate growth by unlocking their people s potential Automation and artificial intelligence AI are transforming businesses and will contribute to economic growth via contributions to productivity They will also help address moonshot societal challenges in areas from health to climate change At the same time these technologies will transform the nature of work and the workplace itself Machines will be able to carry out more of the tasks done by humans complement the work that humans do and even perform some tasks that go beyond what humans can do As a result some occupations will decline others will grow and many more will change While we believe there will be enough work to go around barring extreme scenarios society will need to grapple with significant workforce transitions and dislocation Workers will need to acquire new skills and adapt to the increasingly capable machines alongside them in the workplace They may have to move from declining occupations to growing and in some cases new occupations This executive briefing which draws on the latest research from the McKinsey Global Institute examines both the promise and the challenge of automation and AI in the workplace and outlines some of the critical issues that policy makers companies and individuals will need to solve for Automation and AI are not new but recent technological progress is pushing the frontier of what machines can do Our research suggests that society needs these improvements to provide value for businesses contribute to economic growth and make once unimaginable progress on some of our most difficult societal challenges In summary Beyond traditional industrial automation and advanced robots new generations of more capable autonomous systems are appearing in environments ranging from autonomous vehicles on roads to automated check outs in grocery stores Much of this progress has been driven by improvements in systems and components including mechanics sensors and software AI has made especially large strides in recent years as machine learning algorithms have become more sophisticated and made use of huge increases in computing power and of the exponential growth in data available to train them Spectacular breakthroughs are making headlines many involving beyond human capabilities in computer vision natural language processing and complex games such as Go These technologies are already generating value in various products and services and companies across sectors use them in an array of processes to personalize product recommendations find anomalies in production identify fraudulent transactions and more The latest generation of AI advances including techniques that address classification estimation and clustering problems promises significantly more value still An analysis we conducted of several hundred AI use cases found that the most advanced deep learning techniques deploying artificial neural networks could account for as much as 3 5 trillion to 5 8 trillion in annual value or 40 percent of the value created by all analytics techniques Exhibit 1 Deployment of AI and automation technologies can do much to lift the global economy and increase global prosperity at a time when aging and falling birth rates are acting as a drag on growth Labor productivity growth a key driver of economic growth has slowed in many economies dropping to an average of 0 5 percent in 2010 2014 from 2 4 percent a decade earlier in the United States and major European economies in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis after a previous productivity boom had waned AI and automation have the potential to reverse that decline productivity growth could potentially reach 2 percent annually over the next decade with 60 percent of this increase from digital opportunities AI is also being used in areas ranging from material science to medical research and climate science Application of the technologies in these and other disciplines could help tackle societal moonshot challenges For example researchers at Geisinger have developed an algorithm that could reduce diagnostic times for intracranial hemorrhaging by up to 96 percent Researchers at George Washington University meanwhile are using machine learning to more accurately weight the climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AI and automation still face challenges The limitations are partly technical such as the need for massive training data and difficulties generalizing algorithms across use cases Recent innovations are just starting to address these issues Other challenges are in the use of AI techniques For example explaining decisions made by machine learning algorithms is technically challenging which particularly matters for use cases involving financial lending or legal applications Potential bias in the training data and algorithms as well as data privacy malicious use and security are all issues that must be addressed Europe is leading with the new General Data Protection Regulation which codifies more rights for users over data collection and usage A different sort of challenge concerns the ability of organizations to adopt these technologies where people data availability technology and process readiness often make it difficult Adoption is already uneven across sectors and countries The finance automotive and telecommunications sectors lead AI adoption Among countries US investment in AI ranked first at 15 billion to 23 billion in 2016 followed by Asia s investments of 8 billion to 12 billion with Europe lagging behind at 3 billion to 4 billion Even as AI and automation bring benefits to business and society we will need to prepare for major disruptions to work Our analysis of more than 2000 work activities across more than 800 occupations shows that certain categories of activities are more easily automatable than others They include physical activities in highly predictable and structured environments as well as data collection and data processing These account for roughly half of the activities that people do across all sectors The least susceptible categories include managing others providing expertise and interfacing with stakeholders Nearly all occupations will be affected by automation but only about 5 percent of occupations could be fully automated by currently demonstrated technologies Many more occupations have portions of their constituent activities that are automatable we find that about 30 percent of the activities in 60 percent of all occupations could be automated This means that most workers from welders to mortgage brokers to CEOs will work alongside rapidly evolving machines The nature of these occupations will likely change as a result Automation will displace some workers We have found that around 15 percent of the global workforce or about 400 million workers could be displaced by automation in the period 2016 2030 This reflects our midpoint scenario in projecting the pace and scope of adoption Under the fastest scenario we have modeled that figure rises to 30 percent or 800 million workers In our slowest adoption scenario only about 10 million people would be displaced close to zero percent of the global workforce Exhibit 2 The wide range underscores the multiple factors that will impact the pace and scope of AI and automation adoption Technical feasibility of automation is only the first influencing factor Other factors include the cost of deployment labor market dynamics including labor supply quantity quality and the associated wages the benefits beyond labor substitution that contribute to business cases for adoption and finally social norms and acceptance Adoption will continue to vary significantly across countries and sectors because of differences in the above factors especially labor market dynamics in advanced economies with relatively high wage levels such as France Japan and the United States automation could displace 20 to 25 percent of the workforce by 2030 in a midpoint adoption scenario more than double the rate in India Even as workers are displaced there will be growth in demand for work and consequently jobs We developed scenarios for labor demand to 2030 from several catalysts of demand for work including rising incomes increased spending on healthcare and continuing or stepped up investment in infrastructure energy and technology development and deployment These scenarios showed a range of additional labor demand of between 21 percent to 33 percent of the global workforce 555 million and 890 million jobs to 2030 more than offsetting the numbers of jobs lost Some of the largest gains will be in emerging economies such as India where the working age population is already growing rapidly Additional economic growth including from business dynamism and rising productivity growth will also continue to create jobs Many other new occupations that we cannot currently imagine will also emerge and may account for as much as 10 percent of jobs created by 2030 if history is a guide Moreover technology itself has historically been a net job creator For example the introduction of the personal computer in the 1970s and 1980s created millions of jobs not just for semiconductor makers but also for software and app developers of all types customer service representatives and information analysts Partial automation will become more prevalent as machines complement human labor For example AI algorithms that can read diagnostic scans with a high degree of accuracy will help doctors diagnose patient cases and identify suitable treatment In other fields jobs with repetitive tasks could shift toward a model of managing and troubleshooting automated systems At retailer Amazon employees who previously lifted and stacked objects are becoming robot operators monitoring the automated arms and resolving issues such as an interruption in the flow of objects While we expect there will be enough work to ensure full employment in 2030 based on most of our scenarios the transitions that will accompany automation and AI adoption will be significant The mix of occupations will change as will skill and educational requirements Work will need to be redesigned to ensure that humans work alongside machines most effectively Automation will accelerate the shift in required workforce skills we have seen over the past 15 years Demand for advanced technological skills such as programming will grow rapidly Social emotional and higher cognitive skills such as creativity critical thinking and complex information processing will also see growing demand Basic digital skills demand has been increasing and that trend will continue and accelerate Demand for physical and manual skills will decline but will remain the single largest category of workforce skills in 2030 in many countries Exhibit 3 This will put additional pressure on the already existing workforce skills challenge as well as the need for new credentialing systems While some innovative solutions are emerging solutions that can match the scale of the challenge will be needed Our research suggests that in a midpoint scenario around 3 percent of the global workforce will need to change occupational categories by 2030 though scenarios range from about 0 to 14 percent Some of these shifts will happen within companies and sectors but many will occur across sectors and even geographies Occupations made up of physical activities in highly structured environments or in data processing or collection will see declines Growing occupations will include those with difficult to automate activities such as managers and those in unpredictable physical environments such as plumbers Other occupations that will see increasing demand for work include teachers nursing aides and tech and other professionals As intelligent machines and software are integrated more deeply into the workplace workflows and workspaces will continue to evolve to enable humans and machines to work together As self checkout machines are introduced in stores for example cashiers can become checkout assistance helpers who can help answer questions or troubleshoot the machines More system level solutions will prompt rethinking of the entire workflow and workspace Warehouse design may change significantly as some portions are designed to accommodate primarily robots and others to facilitate safe human machine interaction The occupational mix shifts will likely put pressure on wages Many of the current middle wage jobs in advanced economies are dominated by highly automatable activities such as in manufacturing or in accounting which are likely to decline High wage jobs will grow significantly especially for high skill medical and tech or other professionals but a large portion of jobs expected to be created including teachers and nursing aides typically have lower wage structures The risk is that automation could exacerbate wage polarization income inequality and the lack of income advancement that has characterized the past decade across advanced economies stoking social and political tensions Most countries already face the challenge of adequately educating and training their workforces to meet the current requirements of employers Across the OECD spending on worker education and training has been declining over the last two decades Spending on worker transition and dislocation assistance has also continued to shrink as a percentage of GDP One lesson of the past decade is that while globalization may have benefited economic growth and people as consumers the wage and dislocation effects on workers were not adequately addressed Most analyses including our own suggest that the scale of these issues is likely to grow in the coming decades We have also seen in the past that large scale workforce transitions can have a lasting effect on wages during the 19th century Industrial Revolution wages in the United Kingdom remained stagnant for about half a century despite rising productivity a phenomenon known as Engels Pause PDF 690KB after the German philosopher who identified it In the search for appropriate measures and policies to address these challenges we should not seek to roll back or slow diffusion of the technologies Companies and governments should harness automation and AI to benefit from the enhanced performance and productivity contributions as well as the societal benefits These technologies will create the economic surpluses that will help societies manage workforce transitions Rather the focus should be on ways to ensure that the workforce transitions are as smooth as possible This is likely to require actionable and scalable solutions in several key areas There is work for everyone today and there will be work for everyone tomorrow even in a future with automation Yet that work will be different requiring new skills and a far greater adaptability of the workforce than we have seen Training and retraining both midcareer workers and new generations for the coming challenges will be an imperative Government private sector leaders and innovators all need to work together to better coordinate public and private initiatives including creating the right incentives to invest more in human capital The future with automation and AI will be challenging but a much richer one if we harness the technologies with aplomb and mitigate the negative effects James Manyika is chairman and

trapped in a room with its mate looks uncannily like a dog well maybe a mutant dog with a canary yellow body and a proboscis sticking out where its head should be The robot confidently scurries to the door raises itself to the perfect height and then uses its appendage to press down the handle Pulling open the door the robot allows its mate to be first across the threshold before the two of them make their dash for freedom Such is the content of a short video by Boston Dynamics that has gone viral since it was released in February Reactions to it on social media have ranged from amusement soon they ll be opening our fridges and stealing our beer to alarm this is how we die It is the latest evidence of recent remarkable advances in robotics and artificial intelligence robots can now perform backflips and ride bicycles and machines empowered by AI are able to analyze X ray images better than expert radiologists and to teach themselves to play the ancient game of Go better than world champions Yet the dog clip is also powerful because it conjures up a more worrisome vision of robots on the loose beyond the control of us humans Thus it plays into a powerful angst laden contemporary narrative about technology and the future of work and maybe even of mankind itself What really are the risks from this new wave of technology And will the opportunities these advances bring with them outweigh those risks To address such questions about the future it is useful indeed necessary to look to the past Technology has for centuries both excited the human imagination and prompted fears about the effects Back in 1589 Queen Elizabeth I of England refused to grant a patent to a stocking frame invented by one William Lee because Her Majesty was concerned about the effect of the contraption on the livelihoods of those who knitted stockings by hand The Luddite weavers in Britain and silk workers in Lyons France famously staged revolts in the early 19th century against new automated looms that threatened their skilled and well paid jobs And in the realm of fiction imagination has run riot since the Czech writer Karel Capek coined the word robot from a Slavic word for work in his 1920 play Rossum s Universal Robots a k a RUR which ends with the destruction of mankind As one of Capek s characters explains Robots are not people Mechanically they are more perfect than we are they have an enormously developed intelligence but they have no soul For 100 percent of continuous 10 year periods in the United States technologically driven productivity gains have gone hand in hand with rising employment Almost a century later that same concern about soulless hyper intelligence infuses not just movies like The Matrix and mind bending video series like Philip K Dick s Electric Dreams but also warnings about AI and its potential consequences expressed by Elon Musk and the late Stephen Hawking among others Back in the 1950s the German philosopher Martin Heidegger fretted about the risk that humans would become enslaved by the technologies we rely on With the rise of machines able to mimic many human traits from speech albeit still falteringly to facial recognition already significantly more accurately than humans that time appears to be much closer Yet when we switch from philosophy to economics we find a very different story a long historical record of innovation that shows technological change has been overwhelmingly positive for productivity and surprisingly benign when it comes to employment Job displacement has occurred in waves first with the structural shift from agriculture to manufacturing and then with the move from manufacturing to services Throughout productivity gains generated by new technology have been reinvested and the GDP bounce from that productivity eventually raises consumption and on balance increases the demand for labor In McKinsey s research we have sought to quantify this trend and its net impact in several ways For example we looked at the very big picture what happened to employment as productivity grew over the past 50 years We found no tradeoff between the two for 100 percent of continuous 10 year periods in the United States technologically driven productivity gains have gone hand in hand with rising employment Even when measured in one year snapshots productivity and employment have risen together four years in five The personal computer provides an iconic case to support the compatibility of technological progress with job growth We measured how many jobs were lost and how many gained in the United States between 1980 and 2015 as a result of the diffusion of computer technology Several hundred thousand bookkeepers and auditing clerks secretaries and typists did lose their jobs But the overall balance was strongly positive the desktop laptop computer created more than 19 million jobs in industries ranging from computer hardware to enterprise software to online retail sales against the loss of about 3 5 million jobs a net gain of 15 7 million That figure amounts to 18 percent of all the net U S employment created in the period almost one in five jobs Something similar happened with the invention of the automobile which destroyed the horse and buggy business but gave rise to a wealth of new sometimes unimagined products from petroleum based synthetic rubber to motels That said we ignore those left along the way at our peril For the many workers who are displaced painful transitions are a reality In Britain during the industrial revolution starting in about 1800 wages of the masses stagnated for almost a half century despite a strong surge in productivity that enriched the owners of capital a phenomenon often referred to as Engels pause because it was first noted by the German philosopher who co authored with Karl Marx The Communist Manifesto Wages picked up again as the fruits of productivity gains eventually trickled down to workers But eventually can be a long time the Luddites fears were not entirely unfounded And once again today the link between productivity gains and wage growth seems bent if not broken U S median hourly compensation rose only 11 percent from 1973 to 2016 even as hourly labor productivity grew by 75 percent While it is natural to focus on labor displacement through technology one element often overlooked in the discussion of the future of work is the number of jobs that are neither lost nor gained but fundamentally changed for reasons that are hard to predict History again provides some examples When ATMs became as common as vending machines in the 1970s the number of bank tellers actually increased That s because the new technology reduced the costs of processing individual transactions giving the banks incentives to open more branches to meet local demand for other financial services The tellers primary tasks changed from cashing checks and taking deposits to providing advice and selling securities mortgages and the like To be sure this tale is not yet complete with the rise of online banking the demand for tellers has again waned and so their numbers have thinned especially after the 2008 financial crisis But modern economies are nothing if not dynamic and the only certainty is change There s a similar story to be told about jobs and information technology Thanks to the internet and some ingenious software anyone can now dig up information at the blink of a cursor Yet the need for data analysis has exploded even as the need for data gathering clerks and the like has plummeted And so the number of information analysts of the genus homo sapiens has quintupled since 1980 to about two million today This largely comforting history isn t much help in determining whether this time will be different To the point the rise of ever more sophisticated technologies especially artificial intelligence that can be brought to bear on any number of tasks is likely to usher in a new age of rapid workforce transitions The McKinsey Global Institute recently estimated that in our fastest automation adoption scenario as many as 375 million workers worldwide or about 14 percent of the global workforce will need to switch occupational categories by 2030 in order to avoid obsolescence Even if the pace of adoption is slower as in our midpoint scenario some 75 million workers will need to switch occupational categories in the next 10 to 15 years Among the work most vulnerable to automation jobs that require routinized physical activity in a predictable setting and collecting and processing data Some aspects of the current technological transformation seem in line with that of previous eras the rise of computers for example and earlier epochs of technical change such as the diffusion of the steam engine that transformed work across multiple sectors of the economy simultaneously Every new wave of automation seems remarkable at the time and AI is not the first technology to chip away at cognitive tasks Since the birth of computerized spreadsheets in the 1980s machines have tackled ever more sophisticated problems that previously required human brainpower Still other aspects of the new technologies do seem qualitatively different from previous waves of innovation The rate of technological change today is strikingly rapid and while hard to measure appears to be accelerating Consider in this regard the development of deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques based on neural networks the exponential increase in computing capacity made available through the cloud and the sheer volume of data that can be generated These advances are driving AI for example enabling the development of autonomous vehicles but also heralding breakthrough applications such as a heightened ability to diagnose disease with non invasive techniques Accordingly the share of jobs that could be automated could also be larger than historical precedents suggest The future of work looks set to be not a tale of machines replacing humans but of machines complementing humans in the workplace That said we see no evidence to date suggesting that the time it takes for new technologies to be diffused throughout the economy is shrinking Looking at a range of high value technologies over the past 60 years from airbags to MRI machines to smartphones we find that the pace of adoption hasn t changed It still takes between 5 and 16 years to reach 50 percent adoption and 5 to 28 years to reach 80 percent adoption Even highly popular social media applications do not beat this clock Facebook for example was begun in 2004 and had attracted more than 2 2 billion followers 13 years later but the untapped market remains vast Consider too that new technology is rarely applied to a blank canvas a variety of economic and social factors play a big role in determining the pace of adoption They include the cost of developing and deploying the hardware and software labor market dynamics the regulatory environment and social acceptance Computer algorithms in state of the art technology aircraft can do just about anything asked of them without a helping hand but we still insist on humans in the cockpit for peace of mind And who wants to be cared for in a hospital solely by a robot We remain disconcerted by the uncanny valley the term coined by the Japanese robotics guru Masahiro Mori to characterize that unsettling feeling people may experience when facing humanoid robots Indeed for tech luminaries ranging from the MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson to the former Google chairman Eric Schmidt the future of work looks set to be not a tale of machines replacing humans but of machines complementing humans in the workplace The rise of AI and the ascendance of self learned algorithms whose logic can be hard to explain pose some arguably unique problems A recent report from a who s who of experts on the malicious use of AI lists a number of the darkest scenarios from political manipulation through hyper personalized disinformation campaigns to a major increase in sophisticated computer hacking attacks For now AI pioneers including Google DeepMind s chief executive Demis Hassabis are clear that while machines are proving formidable in specific areas such as games we remain a long way away from the time when they will have mastered a general artificial intelligence enabling them to think and act like humans And a number of groups including Stanford University s AI100 with which I am associated are trying to look ahead to study and anticipate how AI will affect the way people live work and play long into the future The challenges here for policymakers and business leaders worldwide are significant We will need to institute retraining of workers on a scale we have not seen for generations We will need to rethink and adapt our social systems to help hundreds of millions of workers affected by the new technologies hopefully handling it better than we have handled globalization in providing both new forms of income and job transition support We will need to find ways to tame the wilder unpredictable side of AI For their part CEOs will need to rethink their organizational structures and processes to take advantage of the technologies and the performance enhancing effects they can have or risk ending up in the recycle bin of business history While all of this may seem intimidating it is still the best way forward We should embrace automation technologies for the productivity benefits they bring even as we deal proactively with the workforce transitions that will accompany adoption Given that demographic trends increased longevity low birth rates are rapidly increasing the dependent population our societies really need that productivity boost Beyond the prosperity and employment these technologies will create there will be other societal benefits new moonshots as we use the power of AI to tackle daunting problems from cancer to climate change We can already see one of the key challenges that of worker retraining or reskilling as some like to call it advancing to the top of the corporate agenda and in some countries also receiving renewed political attention In our recent work on the skills that will be needed by the workforce we found that demand will rise sharply not just for technological skills of all kinds but also for social and emotional skills that is leadership and empathy with customers as well as for higher cognitive skills linked to creativity and complex information processing Business leaders tell us that they believe finding the right talent to help implement automation is critical to their future financial performance and they expect companies to take the lead in the skills upgrade that is required Some firms are already putting in place large scale retraining initiatives AT T is using external education providers including for example Udacity At SAP the German enterprise software company the focus is on in house efforts to create learning journeys for thousands of employees including engineers who need to acquire softer skills as their roles change to service customers directly Walmart has set up more than 100 academies in the United States that provide hands on training for positions that include customer service managers and online grocery pickup While welcome these disparate retraining efforts are barely a start Given the scale of the occupational and skill shifts that we see coming in the next decade much more will need to be done and not just by business Governments and educational establishments working together with philanthropic foundations will of necessity be part of the mix Foundations have the advantage of being able to test innovative programs as pilots and will not face the disadvantage of concern that workers with new skills will subsequently jump ship for a new employer As a starter governments will need to reverse the 20 plus year decline in spending on labor related services no small task in light of tight government budgets and in the United States reflexive opposition to government intervention They will also need to be more flexible in order to adapt to the rapidly changing workplace Mobility is one key yet labor markets have become markedly less dynamic in recent years In the United States for example job reallocation rates have declined by 25 percent since 1990 This is the time to test ideas such as portable benefits that are owned by workers and not tied to particular jobs or companies Technology itself can help facilitate greater mobility especially digital platforms turbocharged by AI that enable matching of people to jobs But we also need to rethink some basic assumptions In order for changing jobs across sectors to become a common practice companies will need to agree on definitions and qualifications for specific skills And a major debate is overdue about credentialing Today higher education encourages the world to judge graduates by their subject knowledge rather than by their skills in problem solving and creative thinking skills that will be especially valuable in an AI enhanced workplace More than anything we need to prepare for this new era in which humans must work alongside smart machines far more intensively President Lyndon Johnson was prescient in this regard writing a half a century ago Automation is not our enemy Our enemies are ignorance indifference and inertia Automation can be the ally of our prosperity if we will just look ahead if we will understand what is to come and if we will set our course wisely after proper planning Back then nobody other than science fiction writers could have imagined robot dogs opening doors and escaping to wherever those androids from Blade Runner found refuge But LBJ s words resonate planning for change has never been

freshly minted college graduate joins the government as a clerk Jane s work consists largely of entering information into databases and creating reports which requires her to spend the better part of her work day seated at a terminal near a mainframe computer that fills an entire room Jane and her colleagues are expected to be at their desks from 9 a m to 5 p m five days a week Jane is grateful to have a steady 9 to 5 job and plans to spend her entire career with her agency Flash forward 40 years and meet Jane s grandson Ian He carries a slim tablet wherever he goes which has more computing power than the mainframe with which Jane worked Ian is constantly tethered to the Internet and works 24 7 from wherever he is Ian expects to switch from project to project and office to office as his career develops and his interests evolve If he feels he has reached the limit of his ability to learn or grow in one role he will look elsewhere for a new opportunity What if the government could give Ian the opportunities and experiences he seeks The GovCloud concept proposed in this paper would restructure government workforces in a way that takes advantage of the talents and preferences of workers like Ian who are entering the workforce today The model is based on a large body of research from interviews with public and private sector experts to best practices from innovative organizations both public and private This is the first generation of people that work play think and learn differently than their parents They are the first generation to not be afraid of technology It s like the air to them Don Tapscott author of Grown Up DigitalThis report details trends in work and technology that offer significant opportunities for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the government workforce It lays out the GovCloud model explaining how governments could be organized to take advantage of its flexibility It examines how work would be performed in the new model and discusses potential changes to government HR programs to support GovCloud Other sections provide resources for executives including a tool to help determine cloud eligibility steps they can take to pilot the cloud concept and future scenarios illustrating the cloud in action The GovCloud model represents a dramatic departure from the status quo It is bound to be greeted with some skepticism Without such innovation however governments will be left to confront the challenges of tomorrow with the workforce structure of yesterday The details of the GovCloud model are open for debate The purpose of this paper is to jumpstart that debate Forty years ago more than half of employed American adults worked in either blue collar or clerical jobs Today less than 40 percent work in these same categories and the share continues to shrink 1 Jobs requiring routine or manual tasks are disappearing while those requiring complex communication skills and expert thinking are becoming the norm 2 Increasingly employers seek workers capable of creative and knowledge based work We should ask ourselves whether we re truly satisfied with the status quo Are our workday lives so fulfilling and our organizations so boundlessly capable that it s now pointless to long for something better Gary Hamel author of The Future of ManagementThe next generation of creative knowledge workers has already entered the job market These Millennials came of age in a rapidly and radically changing world They are the first true digital natives They have grown up with instant access to information through technology As such Millennials have considerably different expectations for the kind of work they do and the information they use The pursuit for variety in work has led Millennials to cite simply needing a change as their top reason for switching jobs 3Advances in technology have also changed the actual ways in which people perform work The ability to crowdsource tasks is one example of this change Since its founding in 2001 volunteers have produced and contributed to over 19 million articles in 281 languages on Wikipedia 4 Built around this concept a burgeoning industry is developing around microtasking dividing work up into small tasks that can be farmed out to workers Amazon s Mechanical Turk rolled out in 2005 allows users to post tasks to a platform where registered workers can accept and complete them for a small fee When this paper was written more than 195 000 tasks were available on Mechanical Turk 5Such technologies may offer suitable possibilities for the public sector Microtask a Finnish cloud labor company maintains Digitalkoot a program that helps the Finnish National Library convert its image archives into digital text and correct existing errors It does so with volunteered labor participants simply play a game in which they are shown the image of a word and then must type it out to help a cartoon character cross a bridge In doing so they are turning scanned images into searchable text greatly improving the search accuracy of old manuscripts 6 At present more than 100 000 people have completed over 6 million microtasks associated with this project 7As the pace of computing power and machine learning increases professors Frank Levy and Richard Murnane contend that more tasks will move from human to computer processing 8 Skeptics need look no further than IBM s Watson a computer that can answer questions posed in natural language In February 2011 Watson defeated two all time champions of the quiz show Jeopardy This was not solely a publicity stunt IBM hopes to sell Watson to hospitals and call centers to help them answer questions from the public 9Around the globe more and more governments are looking to increase telework among employees In 2010 the U S government passed legislation calling for more telework opportunities for government employees Likewise the Australian government in order to attract and retain information and communications technology workers instituted a teleworking policy in 2009 requiring agencies to implement flexible work plans 10 Other countries including Norway and Germany are also focusing on flexible work arrangements to improve public sector recruiting 11 In Canada the government has an official telework policy that recognizes changes are occurring in the public service workforce with a

government based on team collaboration whereby workforce resources can be surged to provide services to government agencies on demand GovLabSource Frank Levy and Richard J Murnane The New Division of Labor How Computers are Creating the Next Job Market Princeton Princeton University Press 2004 p 50 Figure 1 Trends in routine and non routine tasks in the U S 1960 200213These are all powerful steps in the right direction for employees whose natural work rhythms are not locked into 9 to 5 Some companies have taken telework one step further British Telecom is pushing the concept of agile working through its Workstyle Project where employees decide what work arrangements best suit them rather than a rigid definition by location and hours BT Workstyle is one of the largest flexible working projects in Europe with over 11 000 home based workers BT has found that its home enabled employees are on average 20 percent more productive than their office based colleagues 14Similarly U S electronics retailer Best Buy experimented with a Results Only Work Environment ROWE In a ROWE what matters is not whether employees are in their office but rather that they complete their work and achieve measurable outcomes In a ROWE salaried employees must put in as much time as is actually needed to do their work no more no less The decline in routine and manual tasks and the rise of new ways of working is not isolated to the private sector In 1950 the U S federal workforce largely comprised clerks performing repetitive tasks About 62 percent performed these tasks while only 11 percent performed more white collar work By 2000 those relationships were reversed Fifteen percent performed repetitive tasks compared to 56 percent in the white collar categories 16 Similarly in 1944 the number of workers in the UK civil service considered industrial totaled 505 000 By 2003 this number fell to 18 200 with non industrial workers reaching 538 000 in 2004 17 And in Canada in 2006 knowledge based workers represented 58 percent of federal workers in the Core Public Administration up from 41 percent 11 years earlier 18The swelling ranks of non industrial government workers indicate a shift in public sector jobs toward creative collaborative and complex work The workforce structure however designed for clerks of the last century remains largely the same With limited flexibility to distribute resources governments often address change by creating new agencies and programs This can be seen following major events like the outbreaks of the Avian flu and SARs in the past decade 9 11 and the financial crisis of 2008 Source United States Office of Personnel Management A Fresh Start for Federal Pay A Case for Modernization April 2002 p 5 http www opm gov strategiccomp whtpaper pdfFigure 2 The changing U S federal workforce 1950 200015Given increasing budgetary pressures and burgeoning national debts the conventional model of creating new agencies or permanent structures in response to new challenges is unsustainable This is exacerbated by our inability to accurately predict future needs and trends Consider a 1968 Business Week article proclaiming that the Japanese auto industry isn t likely to carve out a big share of the market for itself or the president of Digital Equipment Corporation who in 1977 said t here is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home 19The world is full of experts who attempt to predict the future and fail 20Instead of endeavoring to predict the future governments can choose to create a flexible workforce that can quickly adapt to future work requirements To accomplish this the government can learn from a game changing concept in the technology world cloud computing Major organizations and small startups alike increase their flexibility by sharing storage space information and resources in a cloud allowing them to quickly scale resources up and down as needed Why not apply the cloud model to people The creation of a government wide human cloud could provide significant benefits including A cloud based government workforce or GovCloud could include workers who perform a range of creative problem focused work Rather than being slotted into any single government agency cloud workers would be true government wide employees This section outlines the organizational structure of the GovCloud model which rests on three main pillars a cloud of government workers thin executive agencies and shared services Most government workforce models tend to constrain workers by isolating them in separate agencies Consider the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom and the subsequent slaughter of more than 6 million pigs sheep and cattle The problem of an impacted food supply is complicated In most countries multiple agencies focus on agriculture food production and public health In the United Kingdom the army and even tourism ministries were impacted by the outbreak as agencies became overwhelmed by the number of animals in need of disposal and by the cordoning off of tourist areas to prevent the spread of the disease Yet the structure of government agencies often confines employees to work in information silos creating inherent operational inefficiencies In a cloud workforce model experts in each area could be pulled together to support remedies and propose coordinated corrective measures I want someone saying Did you know that the Ministry of Justice is doing that or could you piggy back on what the communities department is doing or had you thought about doing it in this way You ve got to get away from thinking about centralized command and control Dame Helen Ghosh Permanent Secretary UK Home Office 21The FedCloud modelThe GovCloud model could become a new pillar of government comprising permanent employees who undertake a wide variety of creative problem focused work As needed the GovCloud model could also take advantage of those outside government including citizens looking for extra part time work full time contractors and individual consultants Cloud workers would vary in background and expertise but would exhibit traits of free agent workers self sufficient self motivated employees who exhibit a strong loyalty to teams colleagues and clients Daniel Pink author of Drive The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us argues that 33 million Americans one quarter of the workforce already operate as free agents 22According to the white paper Lessons of the Great Recession from Swiss staffing company Adecco contingent workers those who chose non traditional employment arrangements23 are expected to eventually make up about 25 percent of the global workforce 24These more autonomous workers according to Pink are better suited to 21st century work and are more productive even without traditional monetary incentives 25The fluid nature of the cloud can provide significant benefits The nature of the cloud teams forming and dissolving as their tasks require encourages workers to focus on specific project outcomes rather than ongoing operations Thin agency structures could lead to Greater use of shared services could allow the federal government to The need to support some ongoing missions will remain of course These missions will be carried out by thin agencies Under the cloud concept federal agencies would remain focused on specific missions and ongoing oversight These agencies however would become thinner as many of their knowledge workers transfer into the cloud Thin agencies could also create opportunities to streamline organizations with overlapping missions Employees working in thin agencies could fall into two main categories GovCloud could change the highest levels of public sector workers as we know them today The Senior Executive Service in the United States Permanent Secretaries and Directors General in the United Kingdom and Australia all such senior officials could rotate between agencies shared services and the cloud which would reflect the original intent behind many of these high level offices giving executives a breadth of experience in roles across government to help develop shared values and a broad perspective An important benefit of rotation would be the ability to tap into cloud networks to assemble high performing teams To further focus agencies on specific missions many of their back office support functions could be pulled into government wide shared service arrangements The use of shared services in government has come and gone in waves usually dictated by fiscal necessity Most countries in Europe as part of their e government strategies have placed increased focus of late on developing shared services whether through an executive agency or a CIO as well as working with EU coordination activities And while the decentralized governments of some EU countries such as Germany make shared services more difficult these countries are using states and agencies to pilot innovative approaches 27Other efforts around the world include the U S e Government Act of 2002 which examined how technology could be used to cut costs and improve services More recently the New Zealand government appointed an advisory group in May 2011 to explore public sector reform to improve services and provide better value In their report Better Public Services the advisory group recommended the use of shared services to improve effectiveness in a variety of government settings including policy advice and real estate 29 Following up on this three New Zealand agencies the Department of the Prime Minister the State Services Commission and the Treasury announced in December 2011 that they would share such corporate functions as human resources and information technology 30 And though shared services in Western Australia were shut down other projects in South Australia are moving ahead and already showing savings 31In August 2011 the government of Canada announced the launch of Shared Services Canada a program that seeks to streamline and identify savings in information technology Among its first targets is something as mundane as email But with more than 100 different email systems being used by government employees the potential savings and boost to efficiency could be significant Not only do these incompatible systems cost money by requiring individual departments to negotiate and maintain separate licenses and technical support it also makes it difficult for government employees to communicate with one another and with the public And with no single standard ensuring the security of information transmitted over email becomes more challenging Shared Services Canada will move the government to one email system as well as consolidate data centers and networks ultimately looking for anticipated savings of between CA 100 million and CA 200 million annually 28While the idea of using shared services is not a novel one it is central to the GovCloud model The GovCloud model envisions building upon effective practices and those shared services already in operation to deliver services like human resources information technology finance and acquisitions government wide Workers in these shared services would include subject matter experts in areas like human resources and information technology as well as generalists who support routine business functions The potential for shared services continues to grow As seen with IBM s Watson and Microtask s Digitalkoot new technologies provide an opportunity to accelerate the automated delivery of basic services Some agencies already have begun capitalizing on these trends For example NASA has moved its shared service center website to a secure government cloud facilitating greater employee self service and helping to reduce demand on finite call center resources 32This decision tool is designed to help leaders determine which employees are appropriate for each of the three structures in the GovCloud model the cloud thin agencies and shared services To the cloud GovCloud Project LifecycleManaging employees in the cloud will require governments to reinvent human resource management Individual and team performance evaluations career development pay structures and benefits and pensions would need to change to support GovCloud This section examines possibilities for HR reinvention including performance management career development workplace flexibility and benefits Employees working in the cloud would require an alternative to determine pay and career advancement The government could take its cues from the gaming world and evaluate cloud workers with a point system The manager as we know it will disappear to be replaced by a new sort of business operative whose expertise is assembling the right people for particular projects Daniel Pink author of Free Agent Nation 33An HR management system that incorporates the accumulation of experience points XP through effective work on cloud projects training education and professional certifications could replace the tenure centric models for cloud employees As employees accumulate XP they could level up and take on additional responsibilities in future projects Workers in the cloud could earn XP in four ways After some high profile incidents slow responses to outbreaks of foot and mouth disease flooding that may have been preventable and a farming subsidy system that seemed to result in more chaos than aid the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs DEFRA was looking to reinvent itself In 2006 the department launched DEFRA Renew One of its key goals was to bring the department s policymaking closer to actual delivery to create more responsive processes Organized mainly by policy with fixed teams DEFRA had been unable to redeploy resources as needed in response to a crisis As part of DEFRA Renew a new operating model was implemented that used flexible resourcing where staff were assigned to specific projects for fixed periods This allowed management to measure and build the required capabilities and competencies needed and to allocate resources efficiently to improve overall service quality New roles were also created to support sustainable staff development and resource management in the new model To create buy in for such a fundamental culture shift within the department a facilitative approach to decision making was employed Change management programs and mentoring were extended to all levels of the department including leadership New mechanisms such as approval panels for resources and the use of business cases also worked to push changes among staff and promote collaborative behavior DEFRA Renew was widely recognized as a key enabler in the department meeting required efficiency improvement targets set by the UK government DEFRA moved to a more project based approach with fewer staff in core teams According to Dame Helen Ghosh former Permanent Secretary of DEFRA they could be more responsive now that the management board won t be made up of director generals with individual policy silos 34Just as XP could be gained through learning new skills it could be lost in the following three ways Any serious discussion about creating a new class of government employees requires a fresh look at employee benefits and compensation For example XP could be used to help determine workers salaries but additional research into alternative pension and benefit programs is needed While any discussion on compensation could be contentious a healthy debate among stakeholders from across the government should be welcomed As new roles emerge in the cloud so too could new career paths Career emphasis could move away from time served in a particular pay grade and toward milestones that are meaningful for employee development Each worker may have different career aspirations For instance not all workers aspire to management some may seek to master a particular subject area instead Career advancement in the cloud would not equate to moving up a ladder but rather moving along a lattice Lattice GovCloud ModelHere s how the lattice could work for Ian who we met in the introduction Think of the lattice as a jungle gym The best opportunities to broaden your experience may be lateral or even down Look every which way and swing to opportunities Pattie Sellers Fortune editor at largeCathleen Benko and Molly Anderson the authors of The Corporate Lattice argue that the corporate ladder is giving way to a lattice that accommodates flatter more networked organizations improves the integration of career and life focuses on competencies rather than tenure and helps increase workforce loyalty 35 The lattice metaphor allows employees to choose many ways to get ahead It is unlikely that all workers will thrive in the new GovCloud environment right out of the gate As such it would be important to assess a worker s readiness before placing her in GovCloud and providing training on core competencies critical to cloud success There could also be opportunities to start workers especially those at earlier stages of a career within an agency or shared service to build up expertise in some area before graduating to the cloud Once in the cloud new workers could be paired with mentors who are more experienced to help navigate the cloud experience itself There should be an emphasis on continuous learning in the cloud It would be important for cloud workers to continue to refine their skills develop additional expertise and adapt to new ways of working Not only could continuous learning affect workers career mobility by increasing the depth and breadth of their skills but it could also impact their salary and level by increasing their XP Learning and development in the cloud could take on many themes of next learning Next learning focuses on creating personalized learning experiences that leverage the latest technologies and collaborative communities to deliver education and learning programs that build knowledge bases and promote learning as a focus and passion not just a checkbox in a career 36To broaden cloud worker skills and the ability to handle multiple tasks and work on a variety of projects cloud learning could include the following principles 37In the cloud careers and expertise will be built in new ways and work will be something we do rather than a place we go to As such the cloud will give workers more control over their schedules and workloads By creating a flexible workplace governments could shed a significant amount of physical infrastructure and create shared workspaces Many buildings could be converted into co located spaces teams could use collaboration spaces or videoconferencing centers Some workers might rarely set foot in a government building instead conducting cloud tasks at home and interacting with project teams virtually With advancing communications and mobile technology distance no longer hinders collaboration It no longer matters whether all workers are at an office between 9 a m and 5 p m what matters is whether project teams produce results and whether everyone contributes A more flexible workplace could also take advantage of resources governments might not otherwise have access to Some retiring workers may not want to quit working altogether and a flexible model could be an enticing way to keep their expertise on retainer Alternatively the model could take advantage of would be government employees unwilling to relocate or unable to work a regular schedule By increasing flexibility governments could increase their available resource pool allowing agencies to access the skills and knowledge they need when they need it For an example of how a retiree could interact with the cloud see Appendix C National Security Case Study Don t think governments will ever take to the cloud At the U S Department of State the idea could soon be a reality The Office of eDiplomacy is preparing to pilot a cloud component to its e internship model for American students as part of the Virtual Student Foreign Service VSFS beginning this year The VSFS currently offers e internships to U S university students of multiple month duration By using a new micro volunteering platform State Department offices and embassies around the world will be able to create non classified tasks that take anywhere from a couple of minutes to a couple of days to complete Each task will be tagged by region and or issue and will automatically populate the profiles of students who have indicated those interests Students can then select the tasks that interest them the most or that fit into their schedule To see that the most pressing work is performed first offices and embassies will be able to prioritize their tasks so critical items appear at the top of the queue Imagine a small embassy preparing for a high profile multilateral meeting The preparations for such an event could be daunting for a small staff The power of the cloud could augment an individual embassy s capacity to prepare for a major event and ensure that related items are performed ahead of those that are less critical While there are plenty of incentives for participating in the VSFS micro volunteering platform from an impressive line on a student s resume to the chance to make a difference by working on topics of interest thought is being put into how to creatively incent high performance One idea is to simply invoke students competitive spirit Competition could be encouraged by a monthly leader board which results in bragging rights and potentially even a low cost but high impact reward Transparency is also key to competition with ratings available to State Department staff and other cloud interns and the ability to make short thank you notes from embassies publicly available interns would be keen to make a good impression The potential applications of this type of program are significant Imagine if offices throughout the State Department could tap into the language and cultural expertise of the thousands of foreign national staff members around the globe Providing a platform for those employees to contribute even a small amount of time to discreet tasks that require their expertise could unlock a world of knowledge 38Creating the GovCloud model will require bold leadership and the ideas and initiatives of entrepreneurial executives While a GovCloud model may be years in the making agencies can begin adopting cloud concepts today The GovCloud concept is designed to be versatile as well as applicable to a wide range of entities Depending on your organization government executives wishing to employ GovCloud may choose to apply the concept first to a unit before expanding to other branches or divisions entire agencies or the whole of government Often GovCloud principles are most effectively implemented as part of a larger reform program within a particular agency as with the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs Renew program as described earlier in this report On a smaller scale the UK Cabinet Office used flexible resourcing FR in its Economic Reform Group ERG with a staff of about 400 as part of its cost reduction plans Using a simple database that it had developed and a strong program of communications FR is now used and embraced by all core ERG employees with strong clear ownership from the top another key implementation factor Says Ian Watmore the UK Cabinet Office s former permanent secretary FR means we are able to deploy people much more quickly to priority projects 40Figure 3 outlines how GovCloud can apply to a variety of organizations Most government workforces haven t undergone a broad restructuring in decades In that time the world has been transformed by computers the Internet and mobile communications To respond to a variety of challenges governments have created scores of new organizations However in today s world of budget cuts and increased fiscal scrutiny the constant creation of new permanent structures is not sustainable The GovCloud model could offer a new way to use government resources A cloud of government wide workers could coalesce into project based teams to solve problems and separate when their work is done This could allow governments to concentrate resources when and where they are needed By using this model in conjunction with thinner agencies and shared services governments can reduce back office redundancies and let agencies focus on their core missions This model capitalizes on the work preferences of Millennials the future government workforce who value career growth over job security or compensation 41 The GovCloud model allows employees to gain a variety of experiences in a shorter amount of time and to self select their career direction To support GovCloud governments could establish the processes by which cloud teams would form work and dissolve New ways to evaluate performance and help workers gain skills and build careers should be considered Today s employee classification system stresses job descriptions and time in service this could be transformed with an XP model that emphasizes the individual s ownership of his or her career The GovCloud model will undoubtedly be controversial Many stakeholders from governing bodies to public employee unions must weigh in to shape the future government workforce The transition to a cloud model will not happen overnight or maybe even in the next five years but the conversation starts today Charlie Tierney is a Manager in Deloitte Consulting LLP s Federal Human

Monthly Group All Rights Reserved New studies shed light on the job security of certain government jobs in an increasingly digital age Automation has already altered several industries and it s only a matter of time before it transforms more of them Given that many governments continue to grapple with tight budgets and suppressed staffing levels it s worth considering whether they might one day rely more on automation and technology to carry out tasks performed by humans Recent studies have shed some light on what this might look like particularly in the public sector Automation has already made some forays into government Kirke Everson a KPMG intelligent automation consultant cited chatbots utilized in call centers as an example He suggested that automation could soon replace personnel who perform repetitive back office tasks such as eligibility checks and other procedures following a defined set of rules Government is ripe for automation Everson says But if it requires a large amount of judgments or human interaction maybe you don t start there In the U K an estimated 861 000 public sector jobs could be automated by 2030 according to an analysis by Deloitte and Oxford University Administrative and operative roles which account for 27 percent of the public workforce were identified as having the highest probability of being automated These types of jobs are already declining and the report projects their numbers in the U K to fall further from 87 000 in 2015 to only 4 000 by 2030 A separate Oxford University study examined U S job occupations deeming about 47 percent of total employment in both government and the private sector to be at risk of computerization Some public sector roles considered most vulnerable included library workers postal service clerks and transportation inspectors all positions with highly repetitive tasks Many of the other occupations researchers identified were especially common in transportation These included bus drivers and subway or streetcar operators as well as highway maintenance workers tablecaption font size 11px margin bottom 30px line height 1 2em important The probability of computerization ranges from 0 to 1 with higher values representing more tasks potentially completed by computers Numbers shown for predominately public sector occupations Source The Future of Employment How Susceptible are Jobs to Computerisation by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A Osborne But does this mean large numbers of public employees will one day be out of work Historically industrialization and improvements in technology haven t caused higher long term unemployment It s unknown whether this time will be any different though with economists offering different predictions for automation s effects Neil Reichenberg who heads the International Public Management Association for Human Resources views it more as a shift It s not so much cutting staff as it is moving people to more strategic higher level work he says While technology has already reshaped countless occupations across just about every segment of the economy it hasn t yet prompted the complete elimination of many types of jobs Consider teachers who employ greater use of educational software programs in classrooms These and other types of public employee positions haven t vanished but they do require greater tech skills than in years past Although some might associate automation with armies of robots it s computers that are most responsible for redefining work these days A recent Brookings Institution report assessed digitization or the degree of computer skills and related knowledge typically required of various occupations Several public sector jobs that required few digital skills in 2002 now mandate at least mid level proficiency of computers or other devices Parking enforcement workers and compliance officers for example might have relied entirely on paper records not long ago Today the Brookings data suggests digital skills for these occupations have jumped considerably over the past decade Source Brookings analysis of O Net OES and Moody s data In some ways automating various aspects of jobs could prove to be more difficult in the public sector than in the private sector Unions Reichenberg says will likely oppose efforts expected to result in job losses Last year the union membership rate for government workers was more than five times that of the private sector Still if automation offers governments ways to cut costs without sacrificing quality of services they ll likely consider it Resources remain limited Revenues aren t expected to grow much and total state and local government employment is still below levels reached a decade ago In some jurisdictions automated processes or technologies could enable governments to provide services that otherwise wouldn t be available It s inevitable Reichenberg says If you look at the way we do work today technology is going to play a

Demographic TrendsBy Kim Parker Rich Morin and Juliana Menasce HorowitzThe American workplace is changing rapidly as technology and automation transform the nature of work Even with the economy at or near full employment the public is skeptical that the future will bring more job security and they are wary about the long term impact of technological innovation on workers Only 14 of adults say by the year 2050 the average working person in the U S will have more job security About half 49 say workers will have less job security and 36 say jobs will be about as secure as they are now Men are somewhat more pessimistic than women about future job security and those who attended or graduated from college have a more negative outlook than those who did not continue their education beyond high school In addition Democrats are more likely than Republicans to predict that workers will have less job security in the future While pluralities across racial and ethnic groups anticipate less job security in the future blacks and Hispanics are about twice as likely as whites to say workers will have more job security 24 of blacks and Hispanics say this compared with 9 of whites When asked more specifically about employee benefits in the future public views again skew negative Roughly one in five adults 22 say by 2050 the average working person in the U S will have better employee benefits than they do now About twice that share 41 say benefits will be worse than they are now and 36 say they will be about the same Views on benefits follow similar patterns to those on job security Men are more pessimistic than women and Democrats more downbeat than Republicans And again blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to say things will be better in the future Relatively few adults see an upside for workers from automation and new workplace technologies Roughly half 48 say these advances have mostly hurt American workers while only 22 say they have generally helped About three in ten 28 say automation through new technology has neither helped nor hurt There is a notable age gap in opinions on these changes in the workplace Adults 50 and older are more likely than their younger counterparts to say that automation has mostly hurt workers 55 vs 43 respectively In addition those with a high school degree or less education are more likely than those who attended college to see negative repercussions from new workplace technologies while blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to say these changes have helped workers Looking forward most Americans think automation will reshape the workplace but not necessarily for the better A large majority say 30 years from now robots and computers will do much of the work currently done by humans with 30 saying this will definitely happen and 52 saying it will probably happen Among those who say robots and computers will do much of the work currently done by humans in the future most think this will be a bad thing for the country 40 say this will be somewhat bad thing and 29 say it will be a very bad thing In spite of these negative predictions most workers do not believe that the type of work they currently do will be done by robots or computers in the future 24 say this will definitely not happen and 38 say it probably won t Still a quarter of workers say this probably will happen and 11 say it definitely will Workers with no college experience are among those most likely to say the kind of work they do will be done by robots or computers in the next 30 years 47 of those with a high school diploma or less education say this will happen compared with 38 of those with some college experience and 27 of those with a bachelor s or higher degree Lower income workers also are more likely to say their current work will be done by robots or computers 52 of those with an annual family income of less than 30 000 say this will happen in the future compared with 37 of those with family incomes between 30 000 and 74 999 and 26 among those with incomes of 75 000 or higher Americans have a negative view of the broader impact that automation will have on society Roughly three quarters of adults 76 say inequality between the rich and the poor will increase if robots and computers perform most of the jobs currently being done by humans This sentiment is widely held across most demographic groups Democrats 82 are somewhat more likely than Republicans to say that inequality will increase But even among Republicans 72 say this change is likely The public is also skeptical that more good jobs will be created if robots and computers play a bigger role in the workplace About two thirds of adults 66 doubt that the economy will generate many new better paying jobs if robots and computers mostly replace human labor twice the share that say better jobs will follow widespread implementation of these technologies Higher income adults and those with a bachelor s degree or more education are somewhat more optimistic that new technology will create better jobs But even among these groups majorities say greater automation in the workplace isn t likely to lead to an improved job picture in 30 years Previous research has shown that the vast majority of American workers believe it will be important if not essential for them to get training and develop new skills throughout their work life in order to keep up with changes in the workplace Most adults say the primary responsibility for providing workers with the necessary skills and training resides with the education system and individuals themselves rather than with government or employers When asked who should be most responsible over the next 30 years for making sure American workers have the right skills and training to get a good job about four in ten adults 39 point to the education system An additional 34 say the education system should be second most responsible Similar shares say individuals themselves bear the primary 39 or secondary 30 responsibility for ensuring that workers have the necessary training to get a good job By comparison the public is much less likely to say employers or government should play this role Only 11 of adults say employers should be most responsible for ensuring workers have the right skills and training and the same share say government should be most responsible Some 25 and 11 respectively say employers and government should have secondary responsibility in this area The public sees education playing an even bigger role when it comes to ensuring young adults have the skills and training they need to get a good job Roughly half 53 say the education system should be most responsible for providing young people with the necessary tools to succeed in the labor force while 32 say it should be up to young adults themselves Overall more than eight in ten adults look to the education system to play a primary or secondary role in preparing young people for the workforce About seven in ten say the onus should be on individuals themselves Again a relatively small share of the public says employers 5 or government 10 should bear the most responsibility for providing young adults with the skills and training they need About one in five say either government or employers should be mainly or secondarily responsible for training younger workers Blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to say government should be most responsible for making sure that workers have the right skills and training About one in five blacks 20 and Hispanics 19 look to government to play this role compared with 7 of whites And young adults are significantly more likely than their older counterparts to say the education system should be primarily responsible for this 50 of those ages 18 to 29 say this compared with four in ten or fewer among older age groups There are significant gaps by party on this measure A majority of Republicans 59 say individuals should have the most responsibility to ensure they are prepared for the workplace only 23 of Democrats say the same For their part Democrats are twice as likely as

Miguel Castilla Leave a CommentThe uncertainty of the future of work naturally raises a number of questions It is no wonder Argentina put it on the agenda as one of three priorities to be discussed at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires Will its impact be the same across the globe What jobs will be most affected What new skillsets will be required But above all how can governments prepare and what role can Multilateral Development Banks play All four leading regional development banks recently came together in Washington to present some key perspectives regarding the jobs of the future which can be found in the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives Here are a few worth considering On the one hand Emerging Europe Developing Asia Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean are witnessing how robotics automation and artificial intelligence are lowering costs and increasing productivity providing an opportunity for accelerated growth Countries like Estonia have taken the lead in digital technology youth in Nigeria and Ethiopia are harnessing technology to boost yields in agriculture in Vietnam and Bangladesh Information and Communication Technologies ICT is boosting the service industry and across Latin America and the Caribbean smartphone adoption is expected to reach beyond 70 by 2020 On the other hand as a result of this new wave of technological advances known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution a series of myths emerge that it is important to clarify Myth 1 All regions will be impacted in the same way The truth is that technology will be adopted at varying speeds depending on the region s economic development and demographic trends An aging population in Emerging Europe will face different challenges than Africa where 12 to 15 million young people enter the job market each year Myth 2 Mass unemployment is unavoidable The truth is that the jobless rate will be lower than originally expected Mass unemployment is unlikely to become a reality But the shifts in job opportunities will certainly require flexibility and access to new training tools which may in turn be provided by technology itself Myth 3 Automation will replace all human jobs and tasks The truth is that automation only takes place where it is both technically and economically feasible A human workforce will still be required in most sectors particularly those such as health and education At the same time it would be foolish to ignore the genuine threats of unemployment and increased income inequality that the rapid expansion of new technology will generate Above all as Multilateral Development Banks the question we need to be asking is how can governments ease the transition What can governments do to ensure that the largest number of people possible benefit from this transition Policymakers can take four actions to ease the adoption of technology while mitigating potentially adverse effects on jobs and incomes Multilateral Development Banks certainly have their own role to play not only by acting as think tanks for initiatives on how to capitalize on new technologies and mitigate their negative effects but also in coordinating global or regional policy responses strengthening partnerships between policymakers and employers to jointly identify and address challenges Our products and services will need to adapt A recent IDB health project in the Dominican Republic which uses drones to link remote rural clinics with hospital laboratories is a prime example of this Change will also take place within our workforce Outsourcing the IDB s human resources department from Washington to Costa Rica to ensure efficiency and reduce costs was certainly a step in the right direction It is important that we take the time to seriously identify the opportunities and risks the 21st century global job market presents so that together we can help shape the future of work In the meantime we must also remain relevant for our customer base and at the forefront of innovation Whether we succeed or not is up to all of us Downlaod the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives hereFiled Under Beyond development effectiveness Tagged With labor

confidently scurries to the door raises itself to the perfect height and then uses its appendage to press down the handle Pulling open the door the robot allows its mate to be first across the threshold before the two of them make their dash for freedom Such is the content of a short video by Boston Dynamics that has gone viral since it was released in February Reactions to it on social media have ranged from amusement soon they ll be opening our fridges and stealing our beer to alarm this is how we die It is the latest evidence of recent remarkable advances in robotics and artificial intelligence robots can now perform backflips and ride bicycles and machines empowered by AI are able to analyze X ray images better than expert radiologists and to teach themselves to play the ancient game of Go better than world champions Yet the dog clip is also powerful because it conjures up a more worrisome vision of robots on the loose beyond the control of us humans Thus it plays into a powerful angst laden contemporary narrative about technology and the future of work and maybe even of mankind itself What really are the risks from this new wave of technology And will the opportunities these advances bring with them outweigh those risks To address such questions about the future it is useful indeed necessary to look to the past Technology has for centuries both excited the human imagination and prompted fears about the effects Back in 1589 Queen Elizabeth I of England refused to grant a patent to a stocking frame invented by one William Lee because Her Majesty was concerned about the effect of the contraption on the livelihoods of those who knitted stockings by hand The Luddite weavers in Britain and silk workers in Lyons France famously staged revolts in the early 19th century against new automated looms that threatened their skilled and well paid jobs And in the realm of fiction imagination has run riot since the Czech writer Karel Capek coined the word robot from a Slavic word for work in his 1920 play Rossum s Universal Robots a k a RUR which ends with the destruction of mankind As one of Capek s characters explains Robots are not people Mechanically they are more perfect than we are they have an enormously developed intelligence but they have no soul Almost a century later that same concern about soulless hyper intelligence infuses not just movies like The Matrix and mind bending video series like Philip K Dick s Electric Dreams but also warnings about AI and its potential consequences expressed by Elon Musk and the late Stephen Hawking among others Back in the 1950s the German philosopher Martin Heidegger fretted about the risk that humans would become enslaved by the technologies we rely on With the rise of machines able to mimic many human traits from speech albeit still falteringly to facial recognition already significantly more accurately than humans that time appears to be much closer Yet when we switch from philosophy to economics we find a very different story a long historical record of innovation that shows technological change has been overwhelmingly positive for productivity and surprisingly benign when it comes to employment Job displacement has occurred in waves first with the structural shift from agriculture to manufacturing and then with the move from manufacturing to services Throughout productivity gains generated by new technology have been reinvested and the GDP bounce from that productivity eventually raises consumption and on balance increases the demand for labor In McKinsey s research we have sought to quantify this trend and its net impact in several ways For example we looked at the very big picture what happened to employment as productivity grew over the past 50 years We found no tradeoff between the two for 100 percent of continuous 10 year periods in the United States technologically driven productivity gains have gone hand in hand with rising employment Even when measured in one year snapshots productivity and employment have risen together four years in five The personal computer provides an iconic case to support the compatibility of technological progress with job growth We measured how many jobs were lost and how many gained in the United States between 1980 and 2015 as a result of the diffusion of computer technology Several hundred thousand bookkeepers and auditing clerks secretaries and typists did lose their jobs But the overall balance was strongly positive the desktop laptop computer created more than 19 million jobs in industries ranging from computer hardware to enterprise software to online retail sales against the loss of about 3 5 million jobs a net gain of 15 7 million That figure amounts to 18 percent of all the net U S employment created in the period almost one in five jobs Something similar happened with the invention of the automobile which destroyed the horse and buggy business but gave rise to a wealth of new sometimes unimagined products from petroleum based synthetic rubber to motels That said we ignore those left along the way at our peril For the many workers who are displaced painful transitions are a reality In Britain during the industrial revolution starting in about 1800 wages of the masses stagnated for almost a half century despite a strong surge in productivity that enriched the owners of capital a phenomenon often referred to as Engels pause because it was first noted by the German philosopher who co authored with Karl Marx The Communist Manifesto Wages picked up again as the fruits of productivity gains eventually trickled down to workers But eventually can be a long time the Luddites fears were not entirely unfounded And once again today the link between productivity gains and wage growth seems bent if not broken U S median hourly compensation rose only 11 percent from 1973 to 2016 even as hourly labor productivity grew by 75 percent While it is natural to focus on labor displacement through technology one element often overlooked in the discussion of the future of work is the number of jobs that are neither lost nor gained but fundamentally changed for reasons that are hard to predict History again provides some examples When ATMs became as common as vending machines in the 1970s the number of bank tellers actually increased That s because the new technology reduced the costs of processing individual transactions giving the banks incentives to open more branches to meet local demand for other financial services The tellers primary tasks changed from cashing checks and taking deposits to providing advice and selling securities mortgages and the like To be sure this tale is not yet complete with the rise of online banking the demand for tellers has again waned and so their numbers have thinned especially after the 2008 financial crisis But modern economies are nothing if not dynamic and the only certainty is change There s a similar story to be told about jobs and information technology Thanks to the internet and some ingenious software anyone can now dig up information at the blink of a cursor Yet the need for data analysis has exploded even as the need for data gathering clerks and the like has plummeted And so the number of information analysts of the genus homo sapiens has quintupled since 1980 to about two million today This largely comforting history isn t much help in determining whether this time will be different To the point the rise of ever more sophisticated technologies especially artificial intelligence that can be brought to bear on any number of tasks is likely to usher in a new age of rapid workforce transitions The McKinsey Global Institute recently estimated that in our fastest automation adoption scenario as many as 375 million workers worldwide or about 14 percent of the global workforce will need to switch occupational categories by 2030 in order to avoid obsolescence Even if the pace of adoption is slower as in our midpoint scenario some 75 million workers will need to switch occupational categories in the next 10 to 15 years Among the work most vulnerable to automation jobs that require routinized physical activity in a predictable setting and collecting and processing data Some aspects of the current technological transformation seem in line with that of previous eras the rise of computers for example and earlier epochs of technical change such as the diffusion of the steam engine that transformed work across multiple sectors of the economy simultaneously Every new wave of automation seems remarkable at the time and AI is not the first technology to chip away at cognitive tasks Since the birth of computerized spreadsheets in the 1980s machines have tackled ever more sophisticated problems that previously required human brainpower Still other aspects of the new technologies do seem qualitatively different from previous waves of innovation The rate of technological change today is strikingly rapid and while hard to measure appears to be accelerating Consider in this regard the development of deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques based on neural networks the exponential increase in computing capacity made available through the cloud and the sheer volume of data that can be generated These advances are driving AI for example enabling the development of autonomous vehicles but also heralding breakthrough applications such as a heightened ability to diagnose disease with non invasive techniques Accordingly the share of jobs that could be automated could also be larger than historical precedents suggest That said we see no evidence to date suggesting that the time it takes for new technologies to be diffused throughout the economy is shrinking Looking at a range of high value technologies over the past 60 years from airbags to MRI machines to smartphones we find that the pace of adoption hasn t changed It still takes between 5 and 16 years to reach 50 percent adoption and 5 to 28 years to reach 80 percent adoption Even highly popular social media applications do not beat this clock Facebook for example was begun in 2004 and had attracted more than 2 2 billion followers 13 years later but the untapped market remains vast Consider too that new technology is rarely applied to a blank canvas a variety of economic and social factors play a big role in determining the pace of adoption They include the cost of developing and deploying the hardware and software labor market dynamics the regulatory environment and social acceptance Computer algorithms in state of the art technology aircraft can do just about anything asked of them without a helping hand but we still insist on humans in the cockpit for peace of mind And who wants to be cared for in a hospital solely by a robot We remain disconcerted by the uncanny valley the term coined by the Japanese robotics guru Masahiro Mori to characterize that unsettling feeling people may experience when facing humanoid robots Indeed for tech luminaries ranging from the MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson to the former Google chairman Eric Schmidt the future of work looks set to be not a tale of machines replacing humans but of machines complementing humans in the workplace The rise of AI and the ascendance of self learned algorithms whose logic can be hard to explain pose some arguably unique problems A recent report from a who s who of experts on the malicious use of AI lists a number of the darkest scenarios from political manipulation through hyper personalized disinformation campaigns to a major increase in sophisticated computer hacking attacks For now AI pioneers including Google DeepMind s chief executive Demis Hassabis are clear that while machines are proving formidable in specific areas such as games we remain a long way away from the time when they will have mastered a general artificial intelligence enabling them to think and act like humans And a number of groups including Stanford University s AI100 with which I am associated are trying to look ahead to study and anticipate how AI will affect the way people live work and play long into the future The challenges here for policymakers and business leaders worldwide are significant We will need to institute retraining of workers on a scale we have not seen for generations We will need to rethink and adapt our social systems to help hundreds of millions of workers affected by the new technologies hopefully handling it better than we have handled globalization in providing both new forms of income and job transition support We will need to find ways to tame the wilder unpredictable side of AI For their part CEOs will need to rethink their organizational structures and processes to take advantage of the technologies and the performance enhancing effects they can have or risk ending up in the recycle bin of business history While all of this may seem intimidating it is still the best way forward We should embrace automation technologies for the productivity benefits they bring even as we deal proactively with the workforce transitions that will accompany adoption Given that demographic trends increased longevity low birth rates are rapidly increasing the dependent population our societies really need that productivity boost Beyond the prosperity and employment these technologies will create there will be other societal benefits new moonshots as we use the power of AI to tackle daunting problems from cancer to climate change We can already see one of the key challenges that of worker retraining or reskilling as some like to call it advancing to the top of the corporate agenda and in some countries also receiving renewed political attention In our recent work on the skills that will be needed by the workforce we found that demand will rise sharply not just for technological skills of all kinds but also for social and emotional skills that is leadership and empathy with customers as well as for higher cognitive skills linked to creativity and complex information processing Business leaders tell us that they believe finding the right talent to help implement automation is critical to their future financial performance and they expect companies to take the lead in the skills upgrade that is required Some firms are already putting in place large scale retraining initiatives AT T is using external education providers including for example Udacity At SAP the German enterprise software company the focus is on in house efforts to create learning journeys for thousands of employees including engineers who need to acquire softer skills as their roles change to service customers directly Walmart has set up more than 100 academies in the United States that provide hands on training for positions that include customer service managers and online grocery pickup While welcome these disparate retraining efforts are barely a start Given the scale of the occupational and skill shifts that we see coming in the next decade much more will need to be done and not just by business Governments and educational establishments working together with philanthropic foundations will of necessity be part of the mix Foundations have the advantage of being able to test innovative programs as pilots and will not face the disadvantage of concern that workers with new skills will subsequently jump ship for a new employer As a starter governments will need to reverse the 20 plus year decline in spending on labor related services no small task in light of tight government budgets and in the United States reflexive opposition to government intervention They will also need to be more flexible in order to adapt to the rapidly changing workplace Mobility is one key yet labor markets have become markedly less dynamic in recent years In the United States for example job reallocation rates have declined by 25 percent since 1990 This is the time to test ideas such as portable benefits that are owned by workers and not tied to particular jobs or companies Technology itself can help facilitate greater mobility especially digital platforms turbocharged by AI that enable matching of people to jobs But we also need to rethink some basic assumptions In order for changing jobs across sectors to become a common practice companies will need to agree on definitions and qualifications for specific skills And a major debate is overdue about credentialing Today higher education encourages the world to judge graduates by their subject knowledge rather than by their skills in problem solving and creative thinking skills that will be especially valuable in an AI enhanced workplace More than anything we need to prepare for this new era in which humans must work alongside smart machines far more intensively President Lyndon Johnson was prescient in this regard writing a half a century ago Automation is not our enemy Our enemies are ignorance indifference and inertia Automation can be the ally of our prosperity if we will just look ahead if we will understand what is to come and if we will set our course wisely after proper planning Back then nobody other than science fiction writers could have imagined robot dogs opening doors and escaping to wherever those androids from Blade Runner found refuge But LBJ s words resonate planning for change has never been more important 2019 Milken InstitutePrivacy NoticeShutterstockThere is a strange dichotomy at the moment surrounding the future of work In public political movements throughout the western world have seen populist campaigners railing against the threat to jobs from low wage migrants entering a country and outsourcing to low cost regions by multinationals What hasn t really been touched on is the impact automation might have on jobs in the future What began with the famous study from Oxford University academics Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne back in 2013 which highlighted the huge number of white and blue collar jobs that could be disrupted by automation has progressed to growing interest from governments around the world For instance a report by the British government s Science Technology Select Committee into AI examined the issue from a range of aspects from ethics to employment Watch on Forbes This was followed by a second report from the Chief Scientific Advisor to the British government which looked at the possible benefits to the state of an AI driven world in areas such as tax collection Further afield you have a recent report from the United Nations that looked at the disruptive possibilities of automation in the labor market It suggested that for now at least most of the disruption from automation will be in routine tasks and therefore the biggest impact will be in the developing world rather than the developed world Automation In AmericaDespite the rhetoric from the President elect it s perhaps no surprise that the White House has a view on this topic too and a recent report from the President s Council of Economic Advisors highlights the significant impact on professions such as driving What each of these reports have in common is their advocated response to the threat of automation All highlight the growing importance of education and the ability of people to adapt quickly to changes in the labor market We should not advance a policy that is premised on giving up on the possibility of workers remaining employed the White House paper says Our goal should be first and foremost to foster the skills training job search assistance and other labor market institutions to make sure people can get into jobs This is important because history tells us that technology and automation tend to create more jobs than they destroy but we don t tend to know what those jobs are yet Indeed the U S Department of Labor predicted a few years ago that around 65 of school children today will be employed in jobs that don t yet exist A Glass Half FullIt s also important because there is a backlash against globalization at the moment that is easy to imagine transferring its ire towards technology in the coming years The merits of globalization were quite aptly described by British economist Henry Martyn back in the 1700s He used the analogy of technological innovation to make his point and suggested that by using a tool a sawmill in his case we could perform the work of 30 men with the labor of two men Now of course we could employ those 30 men instead but that would be a waste of human resources The same is true for most technologies and whilst most would surely agree that technology is a force for good it s not an assumption that can be guaranteed Martyn went on to compare this with globalization and suggested that if another country can produce textiles for instance more efficiently than we can then it is akin to having a new technology to do likewise and we should jump at such an opportunity and instead deploy our resources to trade with that nation in areas that we can excel A Measured ResponseWhilst the White House report makes a number of measured responses including greater funding for adult education and an expanded welfare safety net the response of the new Trump administration is much less certain Whilst he currently blames immigration and free trade for the loss of jobs in America it s easy to imagine him flip flopping his attention onto automation if machines represent a more attractive target for him In reality the answers are largely the same in both instances whether it s providing greater support for lifelong learning supporting people to move where the jobs are and so on These responses do necessitate some action on behalf of those that are disrupted by technology however It s not enough to blame an external actor and hope to roll back change it requires one to take control and strive to learn the skills that give you a chance in the labor market This is a topic I ve covered a few times and whilst there is a growing appreciation for the urgency of such measures I can t help but feel that governments around the world are asleep at the wheel For more visit adigaskell org I am a free range human who believes that the future already exists if we know where to look From the bustling Knowledge Quarter in London it is my mission in life t By Mark Baillie 2018 05 24T09 00 34 143Z BusinessThe British government is keen to recognise the importance of artificial intelligence AI and automation in ensuring the long term future success of UK industry In line with this it has acknowledged that one of its grand challenges is putting the UK at the forefront of the AI and data revolution In fact comments from Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond have suggested that large swathes of government activity will soon be performed by AI and automation to free up time for human civil servants Automating some aspects of government jobs will result in savings and efficiencies However there are concerns that public sector workers will be at risk of losing their jobs to AI and automation in the next decade Think tank Reform estimated early last year that 250 000 of the UK s five million public sector workers risk losing jobs to AI and automation in the next 15 years Speaking to a House of Lords committee in 2017 Hammond said The government is looking at how it can apply artificial intelligence There are very significant areas of government activity which involve relatively low level decision making which will be highly susceptible to AI probably over a relatively short period of time which does present the tantalising possibility of being able to drive some real productivity enhancement in the delivery of government processes The truth is that automation in the public sector is already developing at a rapid pace New initiatives range from implementing AI and automation into day to day bureaucratic tasks such as form filling and applying for patents to using facial recognition technologies to verify the identity of individuals entering the UK But it s time to stop viewing AI and automation as an existential threat to our livelihoods Far from replacing people AI and automation will transform the workplace as menial tasks and some non routine jobs are digitalised through AI and process automation enabling greater efficiency while taking away some of the strain of day to day tasks In its industrial strategy report the UK government rightly realised we are at one of the most important exciting and challenging times in the history of global enterprise Importantly that report highlights that Britain is well placed to benefit from this new Industrial Revolution This digital revolution will be powered by humans increasing reliance on AI and automation Set to impact almost every sector of British industry AI and automation is here to stay Organisations are turning to digital transformation to boost innovation and enhance user experience and AI and automation will play a major role in this change While some jobs may disappear or evolve along the road to automation there is considerable opportunity for innovation and change AI and automation can give government departments both at the national and local level much faster access to sophisticated insights Combining this technology and big data will allow them to make better decisions more quickly for a greater number of citizens This ability to rapidly adapt to and drive new innovations is part of what allowed Britain to prosper and develop so quickly during the first industrial revolution After all as the government goes on to note in the industrial strategy report We are an open enterprising economy built on invention innovation and competition We have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business with high standards respected institutions and the reliable rule of law We have achieved near historic levels of employment We are a crossing point for the world because of our geographic position the English language our strong ties our openness to ideas and our vibrant culture Driving an automated future offers a wide range of benefits Not least is the prospect of boosting productivity across all of Britain s leading industries from high tech post industrial manufacturing through to the creative industries sector The UK s industrial strategy has already identified the four grand challenges in the years ahead as artificial intelligence and big data clean growth the future of mobility and meeting the needs of an ageing society Astute investments in AI and automation can enable huge productivity boosts UK consumers are already beginning to recognise that more organisations are embracing this technology and the advantages it can offer including within the public sector In fact after surveying 2 000 UK consumers on their attitudes towards AI and automation in government last year OpenText found that two thirds of UK citizens 66 per cent believe this technology will be introduced into government services within 20 years with 16 per cent claiming that this could happen in the next two years The same poll revealed less fear and uncertainty about the introduction of AI and automation in government than many headlines suggest The majority of those surveyed were not concerned about the implementation of this technology in government with over a quarter 26 per cent going as far as claiming AI and automated technologies would be able to make better decisions than most elected representatives though they would prefer for final decisions to be made by a human Many respondents recognised the immediate benefits of the technology A fifth 20 per cent felt that updating processes by bringing in AI and automation would lead to less admin and form filling Additionally 24 per cent pinpointed reduced waiting times as a major advantage while 19 per cent thought that there would be fewer errors in government as a result of the effective implementation of AI and automation This research shows increasing acceptance of AI and automation as a method to improve services but Britain still has some way to go to fully embrace its potential The UK ranked lowest 16 per cent across the countries surveyed when asked if AI and automated technology would be working in government in the next five years showing more hesitance around its uptake than countries such as France 24 per cent the Netherlands 28 per cent and the USA 22 per cent AI and automation will transform the workplace and bring a wide range of benefits to all sectors including the public sector With the potential to increase the speed efficiency and effectiveness of a wide range of government services AI and automated technologies cannot be ignored While the technology already exists the key challenge over the next few years will be gaining trust amongst both public sector employees and British citizens Mark Baillie director public sector UK Ireland OpenText Image

Facing the Future of Work Facing the Future of Work In the last few years it has felt like every big election has focused on jobs and the threats they supposedly face from trade from immigrants and most accurately from technology No wonder Until recently the forecasts were almost unanimously grim The robots were coming we were told and they d soon make us humans redundant In the summer of 2015 the Atlantic captured the panic with a cover story titled A World Without Work which warned that the moment when machines make workers obsolete may finally be arriving Then on March 18 of this year a self driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Tempe Arizona and the conversation began to shift Suddenly the fear that humans would soon be superfluous started to seem a little less likely Around the same time the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released a new study that gave intellectual and statistical heft to this idea Yes automation will supplant some workers the report found But not nearly as many as we once thought and not nearly as soon As a result what exactly we should expect work to look like in the future has now become a lot more complicated and the discussions about it much more nuanced Which is why Foreign Policy has devoted this special issue to making sense of the emerging reality While the questions still outnumber the answers a few themes have started to surface As Molly Kinder argues in Learning to Work With Robots new technologies will create both winners and losers Artificial intelligence won t eliminate human labor in some cases it will even produce new jobs But automation is rapidly changing the nature of work and governments must help workers adapt Ryan Avent explores this idea further In Then They Came for the Lawyers he shows how manual laborers won t be the only ones forced to contend with a shifting workplace AI will also change the lives of doctors teachers and other professionals Adaptation is key but it s not the only task ahead of us In Protect Yourself Before You Wreck Yourself Michael Lind warns that retraining workers won t be enough governments must also reshape their trade policies to reflect the new era Of course despite the new developments and the strategies meant to deal with them automation still poses plenty of risks In Closing the Factory Doors Christina Larson shows how automated factories by replacing human textile and other light manufacturing workers may deprive poor nations of a traditional route out of poverty But the key point is that the news is far from uniformly bad FP s Ravi Agrawal shows how the much criticized gig economy is proving a boon for the developing world see Why India Gives Uber 5 Stars And as FP s Rhys Dubin reminds us in There s No Such Thing as a Stable Career constant change has been a fact of life for as long as there has been work to do just ask lectors and longshoremen Indeed just about the only factor that has remained the same is humans ability to adjust to new circumstances and generally make their lives better in the process Big changes are coming and plenty of them But there s no reason to think we won t weather them in typical fashion by

might be If government is to remain relevant into the future its people need to think about their audiences every step of the way whatever their role But how do individual public servants with their own skills sets and natural abilities embrace a communications role Sue Cato perhaps Australia s leading issues management practitioner will join us in a facilitated discussion that will empower participants to start to realise their own individual potential to make strategic communication work for them their careers and the areas of public work for which they have responsibility We are living through a fundamental transformation in the way we work Automation and thinking machines are replacing human tasks changing the skills that organisations are looking for in their people But what will the future look like This isn t a time to sit back and wait for events to unfold To be prepared for the future you have to understand it In this session PwC will lead participants through a conversation about what the future of work could look like and how organisations and people can prepare for it now Technological innovations including always on connectivity artificial intelligence and automation are undeniably changing the nature of work As well pressures both in and outside of work are leading Australian employees to report high rates of workplace stress No longer separating home and work today s employees are increasingly expecting their employer to offer flexibility and support to deal with the changes they are experiencing In fact successful employers and workplaces of the future will be those that provide a strong and compelling workplace culture and an employee experience that supports employees to deal with change and stress both within and outside of work Sunsuper s 2018 Australian Employee Insights Report highlights the significant impact technology is having on Australian employees at work We will explore the employee experience as the future of work In particular how a strong workplace culture employee wellbeing services including those that build financial resilience and wellbeing as well as diversity and flexibility in the workplace can support employees wellbeing and create an experience that attracts retains and engages employees to help deliver business results 2018 Breakout Stream 2CitySmart built a digital platform called Reduce Your Juice that households want to use and the results prove the program creates behaviour change This is your chance to learn more about the program that cuts Australians power bills and trial the Reduce Your Juice app You ll also learn more about how this gamified approach and digital scaffold can be applied to other behaviours Program Note This session continues the Reduce Your Juice story that began in session 1A but it is not necessary to have attended that session to get all the benefits and insights from this session The future for policymaking will be a compact between government business and the community to resolve real world problems together More meaningful engagement with expertise in the community can only help to address the complex issues of trust and enhance confidence in public policy solutions Industry Secretary Heather Smith 2018 IPAA address US based CB Insights recently released research that connecting professional expertise that is outside the traditional top down consulting model of billable hours and allows experts to solve problems with non traditional availability increasing the capacity and capability of the problem solvers application to solutions Platforms like MindHive enable this new collaborative compact by harness the power of the crowd They have a capacity to enable industry government and universities to work together to develop more innovative creative and unique solutions to complex problems They provide an opportunity for policy innovators to work at a state national and international level to leverage its unique strengths across a range of private and public sector challenges Based in Brisbane Australia and with over 13 300 community experts and growing MindHive is the world s first crowdsourcing consultancy An Airbnb for brains it s aim is to disrupt the 145B consulting world This session will explore the technologies of expertise engaging crowds shared intelligence collaborative problem solving and strategy co design including a series of case studies drawn from across Mindhive and other idea innovation platforms Program Note The story of MindHive s evolution as a collaborative policy and strategy startup continues in Breakout 3B in a session focused on the digital platform and its future ambitions Many jurisdictions nationally and internationally are already using sustainability concepts to springboard new business models and transform their economies across ideas such as the circular economy But while multinationals and local communities alike are seeing economic environmental and social returns in many ways the core of this model is an innovation based on trust This session will explore the concept of the circular economy using a series of case studies to demonstrate the change that is already happening and changing our society and the way its institutions work from one based on take make and dispose to one that is restorative and regenerative by design The fast pace of digital change is re shaping today s workforce PwC research indicates there will be net job creation from technology however there is an increasing consensus across thought and practice leaders that it s time to get practical about assisting all workers to adapt to the digital age The task of retraining talent goes beyond digital upskilling 87 of Australia s CEOs either agree or strongly agree that they need to strengthen the soft skills of employees alongside their digital skills Human skills such as creativity flexibility agility problem solving collaboration adaptability and emotional intelligence are skills that can t be automated and therefore there is much value to gain from harnessing these skills in employees This session will distil the shift towards automation and AI in workplaces generally and the public sector in particular and use this as the beginning of a constructive even personal conversation A conversation that acknowledges and de mystifies their potential and facilitates a way to embrace the competitive advantage for individuals and organisations alike from developing skills that complement and leverage an integrated AI HI

the concept through a digital platform has been central to ensuring the viability of the original concept With MindHive 2 0 a new crowdsourcing and networking platform nearing launch participants will have the opportunity to observe how the theoretical and practical challenges were resolved and have the opportunity to experience the potential for policy and strategy development through the MindHive methodology firsthand To many minds the rise of technology and the state of the environment have a relationship that is parallel at best and inverse at worst A rise in one has too often been seen as necessarily having to come at the cost of the other But advances in technology from 3D printing to social media to big data are fundamental enablers to many of the facets of circular economy How can government enable and capitalise on this shift across portfolios as diverse as energy infrastructure social services and foreign aid This session will combine case studies with practical experience to

normal The rate of technological advancement we are witness to every single day is at unprecedented levels Technology is changing not only how we interact with each other but also our expectations when it comes to experiences Government and Enterprise are in the midst of the biggest call to action that we ve had in the last century and it s all coming down to one word Trust This is the new augmented world of humanity and technology fused together at the very core It s also more exciting than ever Just remember this though New world means new rules Global Futurist Chris Riddell will take you on an incredible journey unlocking exciting insights into human change the mega trends of beyond tomorrow and what true innovation in government looks like Welcome to a new Beyond Tomorrow Leaders and organisations are in an overheating crucible of radical transformation showing up their vulnerabilities and lack of agility It is a world characterised by increasing Variety Interdependency Complexity Change Ambiguity Seamlessness and Sustainability VICCASS These exponential changes challenge the established models and approaches of leadership and require very different capabilities and mindsets Leaders need to think differently behave differently and react differently We need to identify leaders early for their agility creativity ability to lead and connect people and teams their thinking patterns and their systems thinking Senior leaders should be measured on their ability to cut through bureaucracy to enable change their ability to create counter intuitive insights and their courage in challenging the norm It s time to change our thinking on who is a leader how they are trained and in what ways they are rewarded and supported Let s rethink reexamine and redesign leadership development and get the right people into leadership roles now while we still can 2018 Breakout Stream 4Most people interested in the field of innovation have heard of agile innovation teams These small entrepreneurial groups are designed to stay close to customers and adapt quickly to changing conditions When implemented correctly they have a reputation for almost always result in higher team productivity and moral faster time to market better quality and lower risk than traditional approaches can achieve But while agile methods caught on first in IT departments and are now widely used in software development the agile approach has potential to transform the public sector in ways far beyond better bits and bytes Conditions are ripe for agile teams in any situation where problems are complex solutions are at first unclear project requirements are likely to change and close collaboration with end users is feasible a description that matches many facing a wide variety of public sector activities This session will provide participants with an opportunity explore what the world of agile can teach them about themselves their work and their potential to serve their clients better whatever their role It will confront some of the common myths and misconceptions about agile and demonstrate how an agile approach can enable teams to deliver sooner and scale faster through a proven learning culture that builds and strengthens the team and its capabilities Navigating today s increasingly complex and volatile business terrain requires deep reservoirs of tenacity optimism and hardiness This session will equip participants with the ability to fundamentally and permanently strengthen their personal resilience by exploring elements of one of the world s most advanced scientifically grounded and widely adopted adversity tools By participating attendees will The best places are vibrant and complex But how do you quantify urban life The census is outdated before it s released Consumer research focuses on generalisations rather than diversity And community engagement processes struggle to reach enough people to uncover local nuances Every day millions of Australians create valuable data online that paints a picture about the places they visit and what they value Neighbourlytics harvests this rich user generated data to help city makers understand the unique identity of the places they plan build and manage Neighbourlytics is a social analytics platform for neighbourhoods pioneering the use of social data to help city makers across Australia understand the unique identity and local nuances of communities This session will not only serve as a deep dive into the practical reality of big data and data innovation for public sectors applications such as social sustainability but to the Neighbourlytics platform as it is currently operating in locations around the country Queensland Government BiiG NetworkQueensland Government BiiG NetworkCopyright 2000 2019 Cvent Inc All rights reserved From TV shows like Black Mirror to McKinsey Oxford OECD and Brookfield Institute studies many views of the impact of technology particularly automation on the future of jobs and society is bleak We are told stories of automation that will eliminate broad swaths of jobs opening up opportunity for some and having catastrophic effects for others like non college educated workers Brookfield Institute s The Talented Mr Robot 2016 estimates that nearly 42 of the employed Canadian labour force is at a high risk 70 or higher probability of being affected by automation over the next 10 to 20 years Some speculate like futurist Thomas Frey 2014 that hundreds of new types of jobs resulting from emerging technologies capabilities and needs will emerge to employ those people NESTA predicts that around one tenth of the workforce are in occupations that are likely to grow as a percentage of the workforce Around one fifth are in occupations that will likely shrink This latter figure is much lower than recent studies of automation have suggested This means that roughly seven in ten people are currently in jobs where we simply cannot know for certain what will happen It is clear there is not a consensus on what the overall job loss or creation impact of emerging technologies could be with wide ranging estimates of across sectors Further while predictions for job loss like these abound there are far fewer organizations working on envisioning the future of work and the jobs of the future that will employ the workforce of the future as current jobs are changed by automation and other emerging technologies This is where I ve focused my research with my digitalHKS research fellowship Since January 2018 I ve been collaborating with Bill Eggers and Amrita Datar from the Deloitte Center for Government insights to humanize the future of work and visualize the impact of technology on jobs to empower organizations employees and individuals to create a more positive future This week at MIT s EmTech NEXT Conference Bill and I debuted some of the early products and methods we ve developed together including a Future of Government Work Gallery Walk This gallery walk featured four government jobs of the future depicted through futuristic art text and storytelling including Child Aid Coordinators of the future are smart connected and always prepared the deliver on their mission protecting vulnerable children They safeguard the rights of children and intervene in cases of abuse neglect or ill treatment Garrison Commander of the future uses analytical software virtual reality training tools and secure communications to ensure a smoothly functional military installation that service members family members and civilian employees are proud to call home Mobility Platform Managers of their future and their teams are responsible for managing the city s integrated multimodal transportation network and ensuring the seamless movement of people and vehicles They supervise advanced AI systems that power the mobility platform Public Health and Safety Guardians of the future use the power of data cognitive technologies and their public health expertise to protect the health and safety of citizens The Gallery Walk exhibition seeks to invite observers to consider how emerging technologies will enable government work to become more impactful and productive increase decision making capability and better support the overall wellbeing of the employee while focusing on the core building block of the future of work the individual person doing the job The exhibition seeks to humanize the work transformation we might expect to see by 2025 This work demonstrates that not only new jobs will be created but some existing jobs will change in very real ways that we also need to be prepared for It also provides a story that both employees and employers can relate to in order to help encourage real discussion about these futures and enable people to visualize how they might start to approach those possible destinations Our work reverses the current tendency to go from generalizations about changing technology to assumptions about broad job classifications and instead starts with specifics about particular jobs for a more concrete understanding of what could happen in the workplace The Gallery Walk is just a taste of what we re working on We ve been busy developing content examples of jobs of the future and a method for developing jobs of the future and engagement approaches such as workshops and the gallery walk to encourage engagement and discussion around that content Developing proactive and productive tools for designing the future of work is both timely and important According to McKinsey 375 million workers or roughly 14 percent of the global workforce may need to switch occupational categories as digitization automation and advances in artificial intelligence disrupt the world of work In terms of magnitude it s akin to coping with the large scale shift from agricultural work to manufacturing that occurred in the early 20th century in North America and Europe and more recently in China The task confronting every economy particularly advanced economies will likely be to retrain and redeploy tens of millions of mid career middle age workers As the MGI report notes there are few precedents in which societies have successfully re trained such large numbers of people Both employers and employees will need to own their continued education and skill development in order to fill the jobs of the future Thus employers and employees will need to be given tools to envision the jobs of the future in a more visceral way so we can move towards them as a realistic destination Today society has an opportunity to design a better future given the transformation in jobs and way of working that is coming a future where workers aren t just more productive but where their individual well being is better cared for in a job Emerging technologies will change existing jobs as well as create brand new ones It will affect almost everyone you me our family our neighbors Its time humanize the discussion to one beyond an economic discussion about workforce and labour The individual people that will be affected by this change should also be engaged in this discussion The content and engagement approaches that I ve been developing through my digitalHKS fellowship in partnership with Deloitte are a few ways I believe we can start increasing the diversity of voices in the discussion about the future of work You can hear more about our call to put people back at the center of the future of work discussion in the talk I delivered at EmTech NEXT here https events technologyreview com video watch jenn gustetic harvard people future work Powered by SquarespaceCommentFor many people artificial intelligence conjures up images of sci fi movies and the future They see it as a threat to their jobs and sometimes even their safety but AI represents the biggest leap forward in terms of work productivity since the personal computer and few other industries can benefit from AI as much as government With AI we can change the way government works and help employees do their job better AI is already integrated into numerous cloud platforms and can be used to discover new information and deliver outcomes instantly I like to refer to this as practical AI AI has the potential to improve employee experiences by speeding up decision making and automating mundane and repetitive tasks Bringing machine learning to everyday work enables government agencies and departments to make better decisions faster because they do not have to hunt for data and aggregate it into a spreadsheet By building intelligence into platforms AI helps manage complex workflows and allows organizations to One way that AI will be applied in the workplace is automating service requests Most companies have an IT service desk as well as a customer support center These functions ensure that customers and employees receive help in a timely manner whether it is a request for a new computer a password reset or the status of a repair Manually triaging thousands of incidents or cases categorizing tasks and routing work can consume resources introduce human error and slow resolution In fact a new report from Accenture found that customer support functions spend up to 12 percent of their time categorizing prioritizing and assigning tickets Meanwhile AI accurately categorizes requests nearly instantly It eliminates the bottleneck created by agents having to manually assign categorize and route requests A full two days a week is wasted on manual administrative work according to the recent State of Work survey conducted by ServiceNow If an agency with 5 000 people automated those processes they could get 4 million work hours back a year Adding AI frees up employees to do the work they want to do spurring creativity Nearly half of respondents 48 percent said work levels increased by 20 percent or more after they adopted AI solutions Additionally 91 percent of executives say their skilled employees spend too much time on admin tasks and 93 percent believe that reducing mundane tasks unleashes employee creativity To properly implement AI solutions across government agencies we need to define which tasks are best suited for humans and which ones should be performed by AI The government has a term inherently governmental to describe work processes or decisions that must be done by government employees Contractors do much of the work in our government agencies but certain work is inherently governmental in nature As we move into an age defined by AI we need to identify and define the work processes and decisions that are inherently human We are going to increasingly work in a blended workplace with AI systems and humans working together to achieve a mission There are certain activities within any work environment that can only be performed or should only be performed by humans While there may be many more human activities designated as inherently human in the beginning I believe that as humans become more comfortable with the role of AI in the blended workforce less and less work will be designated as inherently human There will always be a need for humans to remain in charge from factual responsibility and liability aspects as well as from emotional and psychological ones We spend a third of our lives at work It shapes who we are how we feel and how we interact with the world so we must create great work experiences and this is what AI does AI creates work experiences that unleash productivity bringing out the best in us Rather than fearing machines stealing jobs we need to understand how AI will change the way government works though small but practical ways and prepare the

need to fully process data integrate with existing legacy systems and effectively communicate with their stakeholders and citizens while enforcing security privacy and regulations compliance Government workforces are taking on increased workloads with increased expectations and under increased scrutiny while relying on dated and disconnected technology systems to make it all work Enter Intelligent Automation By combining the power of artificial intelligence AI robotic process automation RPA business process management BPM and integration government agencies can address speed process improvement quality accuracy and even the citizen experience At all levels of government automating processes allows time to focus on high value strategic initiatives But in order to enhance programs and services government agencies must first understand how to harness intelligent automation to reap maximum benefits Here are a few benefits that agencies are already seeing with each technology Robotic Process Automation Public sector agencies are finding that RPA bots are valuable for automating mundane repetitive tasks such as cutting and pasting data from one system to another These tools can work with existing IT systems making them a great way to get started Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence AI can solve a number of challenges that the public sector faces today Governments are already implementing AI to improve the quality of citizen engagement and deliver cost savings through chatbots Business Process Management When used effectively BPM can uncover process inefficiencies and improve the quality of end to end processes while also ensuring regulatory compliance and improving government services to citizens by making it easier to modify decision rules and processes as requirements change Integration Integrations empower government to support multiple public data systems on one platform and consolidate the data into a single unified interface Although the Federal government has made gradual strides toward overhauling its IT systems agencies must place a greater emphasis on automation and the new possibilities that come with emerging technologies
