challenges – and opportunities – for government and the public services
as they gear up for a Spending Review.

Now in its seventh year, The State of the State has once again brought together Deloitte
LLP and Reform to re�ect on the most pressing public sector issues along with new,
exclusive research. Central to the report is our citizen survey, which provides a platform for
the most important voice of all in the public sector: that of the public. Also exclusive to the
report is our research with the people who know the public sector’s challenges best: the
people who run it. 
 
This year, we interviewed �fty senior �gures including civil servants, police leaders, NHS
directors and council chief executives, producing the most extensive qualitative research of
its kind in the sector.  
 

The State of the State citizen survey �nds that eight years of austerity
have shifted the public mood. Support for spending cuts has ebbed away
and the majority now believe that taxes should rise to fund more
extensive public services. Across the UK’s governments and its public
sector, o�cials told us about organisational pressures, the impact of
austerity and their concerns over funding for the future. 
 
But at the same time, they also talked about the potential for continued
reforms including greater regional devolution, ongoing digital
transformation, more deliberate talent management, fresh progress on
the industrial strategy and a clearer connection between budgets and
outcomes. All of this means that ministers and o�cials face incredibly
tough decisions in Spending Review 2019 – but at the same time, the
Review represents an opportunity for the government to chart a bold
new course for public sector reform.

services – Our citizen survey �nds that eight years of austerity has seen a turnaround in
attitudes to tax, spending and the scope of public services.  
 
The most acceptable forms of charging for public services are penalty �nes for
wasting public sector time - Leaders from the public’s services told us that charging for
some elements of their o�er might be a way to alleviate budget pressures and demand.
Our citizen survey explored the circumstances in which the public would �nd charges
reasonable, and found that the most acceptable would be penalty �nes for wasting public
sector time, like missing NHS appointments or wrongly calling out the emergency services. 
 
Citizen views di�er signi�cantly across the UK’s four countries - While devolution in its
current form has been in place for 21 years, the past four have seen some of the most
signi�cant events in its history – not least the ongoing absence of a Northern Ireland
Executive. Recent years have also seen an acceleration in the public policy di�erences
between the devolved administrations, and our survey �nds that citizen attitudes also
di�er.

This year’s report comes a decade after the global �nancial crisis and amid the UK’s
complex departure from the EU. That process is taking place under intense press scrutiny,
fuelled by passionate politics and debated relentlessly across social media, with an
inevitable consequence that the depth of other policy development may not be as
profound as it needs to be. This report casts a spotlight on the broader challenges – both
related to Brexit and not – that a�ect the quality of our public services, the fairness of our
society, the security of our citizens and the prosperity of our country. Read more on The
