We test the theoretical prediction on panel data for 60 countries over the time span 1993-2013.</p><p>Regression estimates sup-port the theoretical prediction, suggesting that a 1% increase in population growth is associated with an approximately 2% reduction in the growth rate of robot density.</p><p>Our results are robust to the inclusion of standard control variables, different estima-tion methods, dynamic specifications, and changes to the measurement of the stock of robots.</p>
