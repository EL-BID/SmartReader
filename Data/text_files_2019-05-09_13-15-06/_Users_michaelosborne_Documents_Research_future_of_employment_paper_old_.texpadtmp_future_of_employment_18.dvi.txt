We examine how susceptible jobs are to computerisation. To assessthis, we begin by implementing a novel methodology to estimatethe probability of computerisation for 702 detailed occupations, using aGaussian process classifier. Based on these estimates, we examine expectedimpacts of future computerisation on US labour market outcomes,with the primary objective of analysing the number of jobs at risk andthe relationship between an occupation’s probability of computerisation,wages and educational attainment. 
According to our estimates, about 47percent of total US employment is at risk. We further provide evidencethat wages and educational attainment exhibit a strong negative relationshipwith an occupation’s probability of computerisation.
