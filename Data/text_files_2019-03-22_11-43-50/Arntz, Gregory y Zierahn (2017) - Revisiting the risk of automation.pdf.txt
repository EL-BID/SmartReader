Forthcoming in Economics Letters 

In light of rapid advances in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics, many 
scientists discuss the potentials of new technologies to substitute for human labour. 
Fuelling the economic debate, various empirical assessments suggest that up to half of 
all jobs in western industrialized countries are at risk of automation in the next 10 to 20 
years. This paper demonstrates that these scenarios are overestimating the share of 
automatable jobs by neglecting the substantial heterogeneity of tasks within occupations 
as well as the adaptability of jobs in the digital transformation. To demonstrate this, we 
use detailed task data and show that, when taking into accounting the spectrum of tasks 
within occupations, the automation risk of US jobs drops, ceteris paribus, from 38 % to 
9 %.

Introduction 

The prevailing view in academic research is that technological advances in the 19th and 20th 

century did not result in net job losses (Autor 2015). Nevertheless, a new wave of 

technological anxiety floods the public and academic debate, fearing that technology will 

displace jobs on a large scale in the near future. The reasons put forward are rapid advances in 

the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) (c.f. Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014). 

These arguments receive increasing attention in the economic debate (e.g. 

Acemoglu/Restrepo 2017; Nordhaus 2015; Pratt 2015) and, e.g., have been discussed in the 

special session on Economics and Artificial Intelligence at the 2017 ASSA meetings.  

Fueling this debate, various risk assessments predict that up to half of the workforce is at risk 

of automation in the next two decades, thus provoking political demands such as a robot tax 

or basic income. As a key drawback, these assessments neglect the general finding that tasks 

vary substantially within occupations (Autor and Handel 2013) and adjust to computerization 

(Spitz-Oener 2006). As a prominent example, Frey and Osborne (2017) develop automation 

scenarios by applying assessments from robotics and AI experts on the automatibility of 

occupations to the corresponding employment shares in the US economy. As a result, book-

keeping, accounting and auditing clerks are assigned a 98% probability of being automated in 

the near future, irrespective of the task variation across workplaces within this profession. 

However, according to our task data, many workers in such highly exposed occupations also 

perform tasks that machines struggle with, such as problem solving or influencing. We 

demonstrate that neglecting this variation leads to an overestimation of the overall risk of 

automation in the economy.  

Our analysis exploits detailed information on the task content of jobs. After linking expert-

based assessments regarding the occupational risk of automation to individual job tasks and 

characteristics, we then re-estimate the automation potential in two scenarios: In a first 

scenario, we replicate the results of former studies with our data assuming homogenous tasks 

within occupations. In a second scenario, we allow for differences in the tasks across 

workplaces within occupations. Overall, we find that the automation risk of US jobs drops 

from 38 % to 9 % when allowing for workplace heterogeneity. Occupation-level assessments 

of automation potentials thus are severely upward-biased.

1 The occupation-level vs. job-level approach 

Our approach relates experts‚Äô assessments of occupation-specific automation risks as 

collected by Frey and Osborne (2017) to individual job characteristics. The underlying idea is 

to assume that the experts‚Äô assessment regarding the potential for automating a particular 

occupation contains valid information, but captures only a representative occupation that 

masks important differences at the level of workplaces within its profession. Hence, we merge 

the information on occupation-specific automation risks to workers in that particular 

occupation for whom the PIACC database also includes individual-level information on 

socio-economic and job-related characteristics. We then estimate the following fractional 

response model: ùëéùëéùëúùëú = ‚àë ùõΩùõΩùëòùëòùë•ùë•ùëòùëòùëòùëò + ùúñùúñùëòùëòùêæùêæùëòùëò=1 , where ùëéùëéùëúùëú represents the automation risk of individual 

i‚Äôs occupation ùëúùëú as provided by Frey and Osborne (2017) and where xki represents the K job 

characteristics of worker ùëñùëñ including 25 tasks as well as variables to capture that the actual 

content of a specific task may vary across individuals and firms depending on firm-size, 

gender, education or competences.1 The coefficients Œ≤k measures the influence of the K job 

characteristics on the occupation-specific automation potential, which we then use to predict 

automation potentials for each individual job i, ùëéùëéÔøΩùëòùëò = ‚àë ùõΩùõΩùëòùëòÔøΩùë•ùë•ùëòùëòùëòùëòùêæùêæùëòùëò=1 . Note that by projecting 

occupation-level risks of automation on job-level characteristics, our approach allows for 

within-occupational heterogeneity in the predicted automation potential as jobs may differ in 

K job characteristics.  

Since the original automation potential ao is measured at the occupational level it does not 

contain the job-level-variation in the exposure to automation which implies a measurement 

error in the dependent variable. An additional measurement error in this variable results from 

the discrepancy between the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) for which the 

occupation-specific risk assessments are available and the PIACC data that contains the ISCO 

classification. We rely on the Bureau of Labor Statistics‚Äô correspondence table to transfer the 

SOC-level automation potentials to the ISCO classification. As a consequence, j multiple 

values of the automation potential aoj are assigned to each individual i in the PIAAC data, 

whenever there is no one-to-one assignment between both classifications. We use the 

Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm proposed by Ibrahim (1990) for the estimation of 

                                                 
1 In accordance with the literature, we assume that the technological potential for automating task k is constant 

across workplaces.

the fractional response model described above in order to cope with these measurement 

errors. Essentially, the method estimates the weights for each individual‚Äôs multiple values aoj 

that maximize the likelihood of being the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù automation risk, given workers‚Äô 

characteristics. This yields a weighted occupational risk of automation that varies across 

individuals given their characteristics. Hence, the imputation method addresses both the 

assignment problem due to the mismatched occupational classifications and, at the same time, 

yields individual level automation risks. See Ibrahim et al. (2005) for applications.  

Based on the coefficient estimates, we predict the automation risks at the job level ùëéùëéÔøΩùëòùëò  (job-

level approach). For comparison, we additionally estimate occupation-level automation 

potentials by keeping tasks constant within occupations to replicate former studies. For this, 

we calculate the occupation-level median of our variables ùë•ùë•ÔøΩùëòùëòùëúùëú, predict the occupation-specific 

automation potential ùëéùëéùëúùëúÔøΩ = ‚àë ùõΩùõΩùëòùëòÔøΩùë•ùë•ÔøΩùëòùëòùëúùëúùêæùêæùëòùëò=1  and apply these risks to all workers in occupation o.  

2 Re-assessing the risk of automation 

Descriptive statistics for the explanatory variables as well as average marginal effects 

resulting from the fractional response model described in Section 2 are shown in the 

Appendix. Overall, we find that the automation potential is lower in jobs that require 

programming, presenting, training or influencing others. In contrast, the risk of automation is 

higher in jobs with a high share of tasks that are related to exchanging information, selling or 

using fingers and hands. This resembles the evidence from the task-based literature which 

argues that routine tasks are subject to automation, whereas interactive or cognitive tasks are 

less likely to be substituted by machines and computers (see Acemoglu and Autor 2011).

Figure 1: Employment shares by automation risk in the US: occupation-level vs. job-level approach  

  

Figure 1 compares employment shares by decile of the predicted automation risk distribution 

in the US between the occupation-level vs. job-level approach. The results for the occupation-

based approach resemble the bi-polar structure from previous risk assessments, i.e. the 

majority of jobs are assigned either a very high or a very low risk of automation. Accordingly, 

38 % of the workers perform jobs with a risk of automation above 70 %. In contrast, when 

using the job-level approach, i.e. predicting the risk of automation at the level of individual 

jobs ùëéùëéÔøΩùëòùëò, we find only a moderate polarization in automation probabilities with most jobs being 

exposed to a medium risk of automation. Hence, only 9 % of all workers in the US face a risk 

of automation that exceeds 70 %.

Figure 2: Difference between job- and occupation-level automation potential: Distribution across workers 

in the US 

 

Evidently, our job-level approach suggests a much lower share of jobs at risk of automation 

compared to previous occupation-level assessments, as the job- is below the occupation-level 

estimate for 76% of all workers (Figure 2). This is counterintuitive: as both predictions are 

computed using the same model, parameter estimates and data, one would expect the two 

estimates to be similar. The only difference between both approaches is that we use 

occupation-level median task values in the occupation-level approach, whereas we use the 

individual-level task information in the job-level approach. The difference between the job- 

and occupation-level results therefore is solely driven by the fact that the majority of jobs 

involve non-automatable tasks more often compared to the occupational median job, as 

workers of the same occupation specialize in different non-automatable tasks. As an example, 

consider Numerical and Material Recording Clerks (ISCO08=43), for which our occupation-

level estimates suggest a high (74.4%) risk of automation. According to the data, many clerks 

of this profession specialise in niches that involve non-automatable tasks such as presenting, 

planning or problem solving. Taking the large and heterogeneous range of their tasks into 

account suggests that only 18.2% of them actually face a high risk of automation. Put 

differently, the average worker does a job that is much less automatable than the median job 

in this occupation. Technically speaking, the contribution of each task to an individuals‚Äô 

automation potential, ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩùúáùëòùëòùëòùëò = ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩùõΩùëòùëòùë•ùë•ùëòùëòùëòùëò, is negatively skewed within occupations for 72% of all 

tasks and there is no systematic correlation between the tasks‚Äô contributions to automation 

potentials (ùëêùëêùëúùëúùëêùëêùëêùëê(ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩùúáùëòùëòùëòùëò, ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩùúáùëòùëò‚Ä≤ùëòùëò)). As a consequence,  the occupational median job underestimates

the relevance of many specialized jobs with less automatable tasks, thus leading to an 

upward-bias of automation risks.  

3 Conclusion 

Our study reveals a serious and systematic upward bias in occupation-level estimates of 

automation potentials compared to a job-level approach, as workers specialize in non-

automatable niches within their profession. One potential reason for our results could be that 

workers increasingly focus on a diverse set of tasks that complement these technologies, as 

would be consistent with the evidence by Spitz-Oener (2006). This implies that the exposure 

to automation should be measured at the level of jobs rather than occupations. When doing so, 

still one in ten jobs is highly exposed. While some of these workers may only need to adjust 

their tasks, others might actually lose their jobs. Yet, whether this leads to net job losses 

depends on the relative sizes of job-creation and job-destruction effects (Acemoglu and 

Restrepo 2017, Gregory et al. 2016).
