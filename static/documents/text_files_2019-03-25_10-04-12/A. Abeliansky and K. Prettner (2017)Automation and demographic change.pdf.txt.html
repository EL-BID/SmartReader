For example, in the United States, the total fertility rate (TFR)</p><p></p><p>fell from 3.33 children per woman in the period 1950-1955 to 1.89 children per woman in</p><p></p><p>the period 2010-2015. Over the same time span, the crude birth rate (CBR) decreased</p><p></p><p>from 24.4 children per 1000 inhabitants to 12.6 children per 1000 inhabitants (see The</p><p></p><p>United Nations, 2015, and Table 1 in which we depict the situation in the G7 countries).</p><p></p><p>While these demographic changes have already had a pronounced effect on the evolution</p><p></p><p>of the labor force, the relatively larger cohorts that entered the labor markets of these</p><p></p><p>countries in the 1960s and 1970s are now starting to reach the retirement age such that</p><p></p><p>a substantial decline in the working-age population is most likely to occur in the coming</p><p></p><p>decades.</p><p></p><p>There are many concerns among economists regarding the long-run consequences of</p><p></p><p>the mentioned demographic developments. For example, it is often argued that social se-</p><p></p><p>curity systems and retirement schemes would need to be reformed to ensure that they are</p><p></p><p>accurately financed in the future when fewer and fewer workers will have to support ever</p><p></p><p>more retirees (see Gruber and Wise, 1998; Bloom et al., 2010; The Economist, 2011), there</p><p></p><p>are concerns that investment rates will decline when the retiring cohorts run down their</p><p></p><p>assets (Mankiw and Weil, 1989; Schich, 2008), and some are afraid that the innovative</p><p></p><p>capacity of aging societies will decline (see, for example, Canton et al., 2002; Borghans</p><p></p><p>and ter Weel, 2002; Irmen and Litina, 2016; Gehringer and Prettner, 2017). Some com-</p><p></p><p>mentators have even gone so far as to argue that aging is a “threat more grave and certain</p><p></p><p>than those posed by chemical weapons, nuclear proliferation, or ethnic strife” (Peterson,</p><p></p><p>1999).</p><p></p><p>Table 1: TFR and CBR in the G7 countries 1950-1955 and 2010-2015 (United Nations,</p><p>2015)</p><p></p><p>Country TFR TFR CBR CBR</p><p>1950-1955 2010-2015 1950-1955 2010-2015</p><p></p><p>Canada 3.65 1.61 27.4 10.9</p><p>France 2.75 2.00 19.1 12.4</p><p>Germany 2.13 1.39 15.6 8.3</p><p>Italy 2.36 1.43 18.2 8.6</p><p>Japan 3.00 1.40 23.8 8.3</p><p>U.K. 2.18 1.92 15.1 12.6</p><p>USA 3.33 1.89 24.4 12.6</p><p></p><p>As far as the expected labor shortages due to population aging are concerned, there is</p><p></p><p>a silver lining on the horizon. In recent years, robots have started to take over many tasks</p><p></p><p>that have previously been regarded as non-automatable and it is expected that this trend</p><p></p><p>will continue in the future (see Frey and Osborne, 2013; Arntz et al., 2016; Acemoglu and</p><p></p><p>Restrepo, 2017b, for different views on the extent of this development and for a discussion</p><p></p><p>2</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>on how automation could alleviate the burden of population aging). Very prominent</p><p></p><p>examples that have received an extensive media coverage in recent years are autonomous</p><p></p><p>cars and lorries that could soon transport passengers and goods without the need to rely</p><p></p><p>on the (usually highly imperfect) driving skills of humans; fully automated food deliveries</p><p></p><p>are already present in some cities; 3D printers are starting to produce highly specialized</p><p></p><p>products – that could not be mass-manufactured before and which therefore required a lot</p><p></p><p>of specialized human labor input – at a large scale; software based on machine learning is</p><p></p><p>already more reliable in diagnosing diseases than doctors; and even the skills of authors</p><p></p><p>become more and more obsolete as algorithms are able to write newsflashes, reports, and</p><p></p><p>even novels on their own.1 Admittedly, it is still a much bigger pleasure to read “Anna</p><p></p><p>Karenina” than “True Love” (a novel written by an algorithm programmed to rewrite</p><p></p><p>Anna Karenina in the style of the Japanese author Haruki Murakami; see Barrie, 2014).</p><p></p><p>However, things might change quite fast and maybe we will some day find out how “The</p><p></p><p>Castle” or “The Man Without Qualities” could have come to an end – hopefully in the</p><p></p><p>style of Franz Kafka and Robert Musil, respectively.</p><p></p><p>The effects of automation on employment, wages, and productivity have only recently</p><p></p><p>started to catch the attention of economists. Acemoglu and Restrepo (2015), Hémous</p><p></p><p>and Olsen (2016), and Prettner and Strulik (2017) set up endogenous growth models</p><p></p><p>in which robots can easily perform the tasks of low-skilled workers, Steigum (2011) and</p><p></p><p>Prettner (2017) introduce automation capital as a substitute for labor into the otherwise</p><p></p><p>standard neoclassical growth models of Cass (1965) and Solow (1956), and Graetz and</p><p></p><p>Michaels (2015) and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017a) investigate the empirical effects</p><p></p><p>of automation on productivity and wages. In general, the finding that automation has</p><p></p><p>the potential to increase productivity and thereby economic growth is common in these</p><p></p><p>studies.2 The effects of robots on the functional income distribution also seem to be</p><p></p><p>clear and unambiguous: since robots compete with labor more closely than other types of</p><p></p><p>machines but their income flows to the capital owners that invested in robots, automation</p><p></p><p>has the potential to explain part of the reduction in the labor income share that has been</p><p></p><p>observed over the past few decades (see, for example, Elsby et al., 2013; Karabarbounis</p><p></p><p>and Neiman, 2014). However, the theoretical predictions differ slightly with respect to</p><p></p><p>the effects of automation on inequality in terms of the wage distribution. Acemoglu and</p><p></p><p>Restrepo (2015) and Hémous and Olsen (2016) argue that new tasks (which are initially</p><p></p><p>1See, for example, The Economist (2014), Abeliansky et al. (2015), Lanchester (2015), Graetz and</p><p>Michaels (2015), Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2016), El Pais (2016), Prettner (2017), and Prettner and</p><p>Strulik (2017) on different aspects of automation and on new developments.</p><p></p><p>2In the frameworks used by Sachs and Kotlikoff (2012), Benzell et al. (2015), and Sachs et al. (2015),</p><p>automation potentially reduces economic prosperity. This however, crucially hinges on the structure of</p><p>the overlapping generations model that they use as a basis of their analysis (Diamond, 1965). In such a</p><p>model, young workers save for retirement by investing in capital (and robots if this type of investment is</p><p>available). The only source of savings for the young are their wages. Since wages decline with automation,</p><p>investment also declines, which leads to a vicious cycle of declining wages and declining per capita income.</p><p>However, if households can save also out of their capital income – as in Solow (1956) or in the neoclassical</p><p>growth model due to Ramsey (1928), Cass (1965), and Koopmans (1965), this downward spiral need not</p><p>occur (see Gasteiger and Prettner, 2017).</p><p></p><p>3</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>non-automatable) are constantly developed for workers who are displaced by automation,</p><p></p><p>which mitigates the negative effects of automation to the extent that low-skilled wages</p><p></p><p>could even grow in the long run. By contrast, the conclusions of Steigum (2011), Prettner</p><p></p><p>(2017), and Prettner and Strulik (2017) are less optimistic. They show that automation</p><p></p><p>might imply stagnating (and even decreasing) wages of low-skilled workers as it has been</p><p></p><p>observed since 1970s in the United States (Mishel et al., 2015; Murray, 2016). These</p><p></p><p>potential negative effects of automation have stoked debates among politicians and the</p><p></p><p>general public on taxing robots and on introducing a universal basic income to support</p><p></p><p>workers who loose their jobs due to automation. For example, at the beginning of 2017,</p><p></p><p>Bill Gates proposed a tax on robots to raise revenues for redistribution.3</p><p></p><p>While all of the mentioned works are related to our paper because they are dealing</p><p></p><p>with some of the causes and consequences of automation, none of them analyzes the extent</p><p></p><p>to which demographic changes impact on the adoption to robots. In our contribution we</p><p></p><p>aim to close this gap by setting up a simple economic growth model that takes automation</p><p></p><p>capital as a separate new production factor into account. We show that countries with</p><p></p><p>lower population growth have lower incentives to invest in automation. In the second</p><p></p><p>part of the paper we investigate empirically whether the implications of the theoretical</p><p></p><p>model are borne out by the data. Regression estimates support the theoretical prediction,</p><p></p><p>suggesting that a 1% increase in population growth is associated with an approximately</p><p></p><p>2% reduction in the growth rate of the automation density as measured by the number of</p><p></p><p>robots per thousand inhabitants.</p><p></p><p>Our paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we provide some theoretical consid-</p><p></p><p>erations on the potential effects of automation in the face of the demographic changes</p><p></p><p>outlined in the introduction. Furthermore, we assess which countries – with their given</p><p></p><p>demographic structure – will be likely to adopt robots earlier and faster. In Section 3</p><p></p><p>we test the theoretical predictions empirically and in Section 4 we discuss our results and</p><p></p><p>draw some policy conclusions.</p><p></p><p>2 Declining population growth and automation: theoretical</p><p></p><p>considerations</p><p></p><p>2.1 Basic assumptions</p><p></p><p>Consider an economy with three production factors, human labor, traditional capital (ma-</p><p></p><p>chines, assembly lines, production halls, office buildings, etc.), and automation capital</p><p></p><p>(robots, 3D printers, driverless cars, devices based on machine learning, etc). Time t</p><p></p><p>evolves discretely such that one time step corresponds to approximately 25 years and</p><p></p><p>the population grows at rate n between time t and time t + 1. Traditional capital and</p><p></p><p>automation capital can be accumulated and they fully depreciate over the course of one</p><p></p><p>3See, for example, http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/02/20/</p><p>robots-take-peoples-jobs-should-pay-taxes-says-bill-gates/.</p><p></p><p>4</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>generation. Human labor and traditional physical capital are imperfect substitutes, while</p><p></p><p>automation capital is – by its definition – a perfect substitute for labor (Merriam-Webster,</p><p></p><p>2017). Note the special and non-standard role that automation capital plays in such a</p><p></p><p>setting: on the one hand, it performs the tasks of human labor and therefore constitutes</p><p></p><p>a perfect substitute for this production factor; on the other hand, its accumulation resem-</p><p></p><p>bles the process of standard physical capital accumulation such that the income stream</p><p></p><p>that automation capital generates flows to investors, i.e., the capital owners/savers in an</p><p></p><p>economy. Overall, we follow the simplified exposition of Solow (1956) and assume that</p><p></p><p>households save a constant fraction s ∈ (0, 1) of their total income. The savings rate could</p><p></p><p>be endogenized along the lines of Ramsey (1928), Cass (1965), and Koopmans (1965) but</p><p></p><p>this would mainly complicate the exposition without adding substantially new insights</p><p></p><p>regarding the effect of demographic change on automation.</p><p></p><p>2.2 Households and population growth</p><p></p><p>The population size is given by Nt and its evolution is governed by the difference equation</p><p></p><p>Nt+1 = (1 + n)Nt,</p><p></p><p>where n is the population growth rate. Because of the demographic changes outlined in</p><p></p><p>the introduction, this rate is expected to fall in the future – in some countries even to</p><p></p><p>negative values. We assume that there is inelastic labor supply of households and full</p><p></p><p>employment such that the labor force at time t is given by Lt ≡ Nt. Consequently, a</p><p></p><p>reduction in the population growth rate translates into a reduction in the growth rate</p><p></p><p>of the workforce, which is realistic in the long run. Since we are primarily interested in</p><p></p><p>structural long-run effects, we abstract from modeling the delayed translation between the</p><p></p><p>decline of the population growth rate and the decline in the workforce.</p><p></p><p>Aggregate savings are given by St+1 = sNt and there are two savings vehicles, tradi-</p><p></p><p>tional physical capital and automation capital. As a consequence, there is a no-arbitrage</p><p></p><p>condition that has to hold in any equilibrium in which individuals are investing in both</p><p></p><p>types of assets. This condition states that the rates of return on traditional physical</p><p></p><p>capital and on automation capital have to be equal.</p><p></p><p>2.3 Production and automation</p><p></p><p>We follow Prettner (2017) and assume that the production function has a Cobb-Douglas</p><p></p><p>structure with respect to human labor and traditional physical capital. However, the</p><p></p><p>additional non-standard production factor “automation capital” is a perfect substitute for</p><p></p><p>labor such that aggregate output is given by</p><p></p><p>Yt = K</p><p>α</p><p>t (Lt + Pt)</p><p></p><p>1−α,</p><p></p><p>5</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>where Kt refers to traditional physical capital, Pt denotes automation capital, and α ∈</p><p></p><p>(0, 1) is the elasticity of output with respect to traditional physical capital. We abstract</p><p></p><p>from factor-augmenting technological progress that would only act as an additional source</p><p></p><p>of economic growth but it would not alter the crucial mechanisms in our framework.4</p><p></p><p>Perfect competition on factor markets implies that the production factors are paid their</p><p></p><p>marginal value products. Normalizing the price of final output to 1, the wage rate and</p><p></p><p>the rates of return on the two types of capital are given by</p><p></p><p>wt = (1− α)</p><p></p><p>(</p><p></p><p>Kt</p><p></p><p>Lt + Pt</p><p></p><p>)α</p><p></p><p>, (1)</p><p></p><p>Rautomt+1 = wt = (1− α)</p><p></p><p>(</p><p></p><p>Kt</p><p></p><p>Lt + Pt</p><p></p><p>)α</p><p></p><p>, (2)</p><p></p><p>Rtradt+1 = α</p><p></p><p>(</p><p></p><p>Lt + Pt</p><p>Kt</p><p></p><p>)1−α</p><p></p><p>, (3)</p><p></p><p>where Rautomt+1 is the gross interest rate paid on automation capital, which is equal to the</p><p></p><p>wage rate, and Rtradt+1 is the gross interest rate paid on traditional physical capital. While</p><p></p><p>the effects of Kt and Lt on wages and on the rate of return on traditional physical capi-</p><p></p><p>tal are straightforward, we have a non-standard effect of the accumulation of automation</p><p></p><p>capital: As Pt increases, the wage rate decreases because workers compete with automa-</p><p></p><p>tion capital, whereas the rate of return on traditional physical capital increases because</p><p></p><p>automation capital substitutes for workers and therefore raises the marginal product of</p><p></p><p>traditional physical capital. Together with the fact that the income stream earned by au-</p><p></p><p>tomation capital flows to the capital owners, this mechanism has the potential to explain</p><p></p><p>part of the decrease in the labor income share that we have observed over the last few</p><p></p><p>decades (see also Steigum, 2011; Prettner, 2017). It is important to note at this point</p><p></p><p>that, while automation reduces the marginal product of labor and thereby the wage rate,</p><p></p><p>labor productivity as measured by output per worker increases with automation.</p><p></p><p>The no-arbitrage condition states that investments in both types of physical capital</p><p></p><p>have to yield the same rate of return, i.e., it holds that Rautomt+1 = R</p><p>trad</p><p>t+1 . Setting Equations</p><p></p><p>(2) and (3) equal to each other and solving for Kt and Pt, respectively, yields</p><p></p><p>Pt =</p><p>1− α</p><p></p><p>α</p><p>Kt − Lt ⇔ Kt =</p><p></p><p>α</p><p></p><p>1− α</p><p>(Pt + Lt).

However, these papers focus on a different aspect of the rise of machines than the</p><p>implications of demographic change for investments in (and the adoption of) automation technology.</p><p></p><p>6</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>where it is immediately clear that the standard convergence process to a stationary equi-</p><p></p><p>librium with no long-run growth that we know from the Solow (1956) model without</p><p></p><p>technological progress does not hold anymore. Instead, the production function has the</p><p></p><p>potential to lead to long-run growth if the savings rate is large enough so as to sustain a</p><p></p><p>positive accumulation rate of automation capital (cf. Steigum, 2011; Prettner, 2017). Note</p><p></p><p>that Equation (5) resembles the properties of an AK type of production structure. How-</p><p></p><p>ever, in contrast to standard AK type of growth models, this is not due to an assumption</p><p></p><p>that removes the diminishing marginal product of physical capital but due to the structure</p><p></p><p>of the production process in the presence of automation capital.5 Allowing for a different</p><p></p><p>rate of depreciation for traditional physical capital and for automation capital would leave</p><p></p><p>our central results unchanged. The only difference would be that an additional constant</p><p></p><p>term (the difference between the rates of depreciation between the two forms of capital)</p><p></p><p>appeared in Equation (4) and in the derivations that are based on this equation.</p><p></p><p>From Equation (5) it follows that per capita GDP is given by</p><p></p><p>yt =</p><p></p><p>(</p><p></p><p>α</p><p></p><p>1− α</p><p></p><p>)</p><p></p><p>(pt + 1), (6)</p><p></p><p>where pt is the automation density in terms of automation capital per capita. We imme-</p><p></p><p>diately see that the prosperity of a country is positively linked to its automation density.</p><p></p><p>The intuitive explanation for this relation is clear. For a given population size, automation</p><p></p><p>overcomes the diminishing marginal product of traditional physical capital that acts as a</p><p></p><p>boundary for long-run economic growth in the standard Solow (1956) model (see Prettner,</p><p></p><p>2017, for the analysis of the implications of automation for long-run economic growth in</p><p></p><p>such a setting). Once the tasks that could previously only be carried out by human labor</p><p></p><p>are automated, the stock of labor becomes, essentially, a reproducible production factor.</p><p></p><p>At the aggregate level, this implies that there are constant returns to scale with respect</p><p></p><p>to all reproducible production factors. Consequently, automation creates the potential for</p><p></p><p>long-run growth without factor-augmenting technological progress.</p><p></p><p>Next, we analyze how the automation density itself depends on the demographic set-</p><p></p><p>ting, which is our main question of interest that we analyze empirically in Section 3.</p><p></p><p>2.4 The effect of demographic change on automation density</p><p></p><p>Since households save a constant fraction s ∈ (0, 1) of their total income Yt and the</p><p></p><p>economy is closed, aggregate investment is It = sYt such that</p><p></p><p>Kt+1 + Pt+1 = sYt.</p><p></p><p>5Peretto and Saeter (2013) construct a long-run economic growth model in which firms can invest in</p><p>technological progress that raises the productivity of physical capital by increasing the elasticity of final</p><p>output with respect to physical capital.

In this case a country will have a higher automation</p><p></p><p>density (p) if it has a lower population growth rate (n).</p><p></p><p>Proof.

The sample includes 60 countries for which the data are available (for the</p><p></p><p>list of countries see Table 9 in the Appendix). We had to combine the NAFTA countries</p><p></p><p>(Canada, the United States, and Mexico) into one country because they report the values</p><p></p><p>jointly until 2011.</p><p></p><p>The IFR also reports the deliveries and the stock of robots at the industry level. They</p><p></p><p>consider that robots have a life-time horizon of 12 years, after which they are deployed</p><p></p><p>(International Federation of Robotics, 2016). Following Graetz and Michaels (2015), we</p><p></p><p>use an alternative way to calculate the stock of robots (for all robots and for robots in the</p><p></p><p>manufacturing industry separately) that relies on the perpetual inventory method under</p><p></p><p>the assumption of a depreciation rate of 10%. In robustness checks we also use alternative</p><p></p><p>depreciation rates of 5% and 15%. Similar to Graetz and Michaels (2015), we prefer</p><p></p><p>this method over the one used by the IFR because it is more in line with the standard</p><p></p><p>economics literature. Since the IFR reports the stock of robots in 1993, this is our first</p><p></p><p>value for the constructed series. Although all countries report the total stock of robots,</p><p></p><p>not all of them report the stock nor the deliveries disaggregated at the industry level on a</p><p></p><p>yearly basis. Given that we are mainly interested in the robots used in the manufacturing</p><p></p><p>sector, we follow Graetz and Michaels (2015) and take the average share of deliveries of</p><p></p><p>manufacturing robots over the total deliveries of robots (when the data were available),</p><p></p><p>construct an average share, and impute the values for deliveries of manufacturing robots,</p><p></p><p>as well as for the initial stock of robots (when the corresponding data were not available).</p><p></p><p>In Table 8 in the Appendix we show the first reported year of robots’ data disaggregated</p><p></p><p>by the industry level for the countries for which there were gaps in the reported data.</p><p></p><p>In the following figures we show how the robot density has evolved between the first</p><p></p><p>period of the sample (1993-1995) and the last period (2011-2013). We discriminate between</p><p></p><p>percentiles with Figure 1 (covering the period 1993-1995) reporting in the lightest shade</p><p></p><p>of blue the 75th percentile, proceeding with the 90th percentile, the 95th percentile, and</p><p></p><p>finally the last 5% of the distribution (there are many countries with zeroes in this period</p><p></p><p>which is why we use the 75th percentile as the first cutoff). For comparison, we show the</p><p></p><p>same data for the period 2011-2013 in Figure 2 and use the same cutoffs as in the previous</p><p></p><p>figure. We observe a strong increase in robot density, especially in Europe and South Asia.</p><p></p><p>Similar figures but only for robots used in the manufacturing sector are displayed in the</p><p></p><p>Appendix (Figures 3 and 4).</p><p></p><p>We also collected information from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the</p><p></p><p>investment share of GDP.

Since we have zeroes and negative values in the dependent variable</p><p></p><p>and in the population growth rate, we employed the Box-Cox transformation (Box and</p><p></p><p>Cox, 1964).8 We apply the logarithmic transformation because this alleviates concerns</p><p></p><p>regarding heteroscedasticity and non-linearities in the non-transformed variables. We</p><p></p><p>relied on 3-year averages to alleviate problems regarding measurement errors and business-</p><p></p><p>cycle effects. While the economic growth literature usually relies on 5 year averages, we</p><p></p><p>would only have 2 consecutive time periods left for estimation in this case.</p><p></p><p>We first estimate Equation (8) using pooled OLS (POLS) and then proceed with a</p><p></p><p>random-effects (RE) and a fixed-effects (FE) specification. Finally, we take the potential</p><p></p><p>dynamics into account by including the lagged dependent variable in the regressions and</p><p></p><p>applying various corrected fixed effects estimators (CorrFE) following Bruno (2005a,b),</p><p></p><p>and the system GMM estimator [GMM (sys)] of Blundell and Bond (1998). Note that both</p><p></p><p>of these types of estimators are seen as remedies for the Nickell (1981) bias in a dynamic</p><p></p><p>panel data setting. We report the results for the total amount of robots and then also</p><p></p><p>separately for the subset of manufacturing robots. Moreover, we assess the robustness of</p><p></p><p>our results by adding a proxy for education, a proxy for GDP per capita, and a proxy for</p><p></p><p>openness. In other robustness checks reported in the Appendix, we also consider different</p><p></p><p>depreciation rates in the construction of the robot data series (5% and 15% instead of</p><p></p><p>10%), and a different transformation of the robot adoption and population growth rates</p><p></p><p>[a neglog transformation as used by Whittaker et al.

However, this variable is only available in 5 year intervals. Another</p><p>alternative would have been to use the literacy rate but this is close to one in most countries of the sample</p><p>and there are also a lot of missing values for this variable, so we decided to stick with the gross enrollment</p><p>ratio (Busse and Spielmann, 2006).</p><p></p><p>8We created a new variable in the following manner: z = ln(growth rate − k), choosing k such that</p><p>the skewness of z is zero.

Furthermore, a better educated population might</p><p></p><p>be more inclined to invest in (or adapt to) robots such that the coefficient of education</p><p></p><p>should also be positive. However, we have no a priori expectation regarding the sign of</p><p></p><p>the coefficient for openness – on the one hand, as countries become more open, they might</p><p></p><p>need fewer robots because domestic production could easier be substituted by imports;</p><p></p><p>on the other hand, open economies are also subject to stronger international competition</p><p></p><p>such that there is an incentive to automate the production in search of efficiency gains.</p><p></p><p>3.3 Main Results</p><p></p><p>Table 3 contains the regression outputs from a baseline specification of Equation (8). As</p><p></p><p>regressors we include the two crucial variables that are suggested by our theoretical consid-</p><p></p><p>erations in Equation (7), the population growth rate and the investment rate. We observe</p><p></p><p>that there is a negative relationship between population growth and the growth rate of the</p><p></p><p>robot density in all specifications and it is statistically significant in the majority of the</p><p></p><p>columns. Only in column (1), which reports the POLS regression, we find the coefficient</p><p></p><p>not to be statistically significant which is most likely due to the lack of accounting for</p><p></p><p>country-level heterogeneity. Our results are robust to the dynamic specifications using</p><p></p><p>the corrected fixed effects estimators, as well as the system GMM estimator which also</p><p></p><p>controls for endogeneity of the regressorss using internal instruments. As far as the choice</p><p></p><p>between corrected fixed effects and system GMM is concerned, we prefer the corrected</p><p></p><p>fixed effects specifications because Judson and Owen (1999) report that this estimator</p><p></p><p>performs better when the amount of time periods is smaller than 10, which is the case in</p><p></p><p>our sample. Although the lagged dependent variable is statistically significant, the size of</p><p></p><p>the coefficient does not suggest strong evidence for the use of a dynamic specification. Our</p><p></p><p>preferred specification is therefore the fixed effects regression because the Hausman test</p><p></p><p>indicates that the results from the random effects specification are inconsistent such that</p><p></p><p>we need to control for unobserved heterogeneity. The coefficient estimate for the popu-</p><p></p><p>lation growth rate in case of the fixed-effects specification suggests that when population</p><p></p><p>growth increases by 1%, growth of the robot density will decrease by 2%. As far as the</p><p></p><p>main control variable (the investment share) is concerned, we find the expected positive</p><p></p><p>relationship, although it is not statistically significant.</p><p></p><p>Table 4 shows the results for the growth rate of the manufacturing robot density (in-</p><p></p><p>stead of all robots). We again find the negative association between population growth</p><p></p><p>and growth of the robot density as suggested by Proposition 1 with the size of the coeffi-</p><p></p><p>cients being similar to the those reported in Table 3. As in the previous case, we document</p><p></p><p>an insignificant positive correlation between the investment rate and the growth rate of</p><p></p><p>the manufacturing robots density. In this case, there is even less evidence than before for</p><p></p><p>13</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>the need of a dynamic specification because the coefficients of the lagged dependent vari-</p><p></p><p>able are smaller in size and not even statistically significant in case of the system GMM</p><p></p><p>estimator.</p><p></p><p>Table 3: The relation between total robots growth and population growth</p><p></p><p>(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7)</p><p>POLS RE FE CorrFE (bb) CorrFE (ab) CorrFE (ah) GMM (sys)</p><p></p><p>p̂t−1 0.316*** 0.259*** 0.245** 0.226**</p><p>(0.779) (0.090) (0.0987) (0.111)</p><p></p><p>nt−1 -0.539 -0.694* -2.030** -1.690*** -1.803*** -1.828*** -3.515***</p><p>(0.328) (0.354) (0.894) (0.597) (0.562) (0.557) (1.205)</p><p></p><p>st−1 0.063 0.090 0.419 0.304 0.324 0.335 0.115</p><p>(0.119) (0.129) (0.495) (0.357) (0.340) (0.341) (0.473)</p><p></p><p>Country FE no no yes yes yes yes -</p><p>Time FE yes yes yes yes yes yes yes</p><p>AR(2) test 0.922</p><p>Hansen test 0.623</p><p>Countries 60 60 60 60 60 60 60</p><p>Observations 300 300 300 300 300 300 300</p><p></p><p>Note: Standard errors in parenthesis. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent level,</p><p>respectively.

However,</p><p></p><p>GDP per capita reverts its sign from column (3) onwards. Again, we believe that the</p><p></p><p>reason for this is the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and therefore the estimation of</p><p></p><p>a misspecified regression, as also suggested by the Hausman test. Secondary enrollment</p><p></p><p>has the predicted sign, although it is not statistically significant. Finally, openness has a</p><p></p><p>negative sign in most of the specifications, although none of the coefficients is statistically</p><p></p><p>significant. Finally, the coefficient size of the lagged dependent variable shows that there</p><p></p><p>is no pressing need to take the dynamics into account in the regression.</p><p></p><p>Turning to the results regarding manufacturing robots as displayed in Table 6, we</p><p></p><p>observe a similar pattern as for the case of the total amount of robots. All specifications</p><p></p><p>show a negative correlation between manufacturing robot density growth and population</p><p></p><p>growth. In contrast to the previous results, we find no statistical significance in case of</p><p></p><p>the system GMM estimator reported in column (7). However, this could be related to the</p><p></p><p>fact that the system GMM estimator is known to be very inefficient in case of a small time</p><p></p><p>dimension. As in the previous tables, we find no evidence of the importance of investment</p><p></p><p>or secondary schooling for robots adoption. Similar to the case of total robots, we find a</p><p></p><p>positive relationship between GDP per capita and the growth rate of the manufacturing</p><p></p><p>robots density. A puzzling result is the change in the sign of per capita GDP in case of</p><p></p><p>the system GMM estimator. However, the estimations performed with the corrected fixed</p><p></p><p>16</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>effects estimators still exhibit the significantly positive coefficient estimate. In Tables 10</p><p></p><p>and 11 in the Appendix we report the same specification but omitting the controls that</p><p></p><p>were not statistically significant (i.e., secondary school enrollment and openness). The</p><p></p><p>results do not change dramatically but the significance of the puzzling negative sign of per</p><p></p><p>capita GDP in case of the system GMM estimator vanishes.</p><p></p><p>As further robustness checks, we used 2-year averages instead of averaging the data over</p><p></p><p>3 years. Tables 12 and 13 in the Appendix show the corresponding results. As before, we</p><p></p><p>observe a statistically significant negative correlation of the population growth rate with</p><p></p><p>the growth of robot density (either of the total stock of robots or the ones employed in the</p><p></p><p>manufacturing sector). However, the magnitude of the correlation is smaller in absolute</p><p></p><p>value. The investment rate coefficient continues to be statistically insignificant in both</p><p></p><p>tables, having a positive sign in most of the cases. Only in column (7) of Table 13 the</p><p></p><p>coefficient of the investment rate is negative, although this estimate should be considered</p><p></p><p>with caution because the AR(2) test cannot rule out remaining autocorrelation of the</p><p></p><p>residuals at the 10% significance level. Moreover, we also constructed two alternative</p><p></p><p>robot stocks using 5% and 15% as alternative depreciation rates. The estimates for the</p><p></p><p>baseline model can be seen in Tables 14 and 16 (for total robots) and Tables 15 and 17</p><p></p><p>(for manufacturing robots) in the Appendix. We find no substantial differences with our</p><p></p><p>previous estimates.</p><p></p><p>In another sensitivity analysis we exclude Germany, South Korea, the NAFTA coun-</p><p></p><p>tries, Japan, and China because these are the countries with the highest (manufacturing)</p><p></p><p>robot density and also very low fertility rates. Irrespective of this substantial reduction in</p><p></p><p>the sample, the results are very stable, as can be seen is Tables 18 and 19 in the Appendix.</p><p></p><p>A concern could arise that our results are dependent on the Box-cox transformation.</p><p></p><p>A further robustness check therefore relies on using the neglog transformation for both</p><p></p><p>the population growth rate and the robot density growth rate. The neglog transformation</p><p></p><p>involves making the following adjustments to a variable (which we call x for simplicity).</p><p></p><p>If x <= 0, then we use − ln(−x + 1) instead of x and if x > 0, then we use ln(x + 1)</p><p></p><p>instead of x. The results are shown in Tables 20 and 21 of the Appendix. Again, the</p><p></p><p>results remain similar in terms of the sign and the statistical significance, although the</p><p></p><p>size of the coefficients is much larger.</p><p></p><p>For the last robustness check we follow Graetz and Michaels (2015) and convert the</p><p></p><p>dependent variable into percentiles. Consequently, we include the population growth rate</p><p></p><p>without the logarithmic transformation as regressor. We estimate, as before, a pooled</p><p></p><p>OLS and a random effects specification. To the latter we also add continent dummies</p><p></p><p>to further control for differences related to the geographical location. Finally, we also</p><p></p><p>include several cross-sectional regressions for different time periods. Tables 22 and 23</p><p></p><p>show the results. Naturally, the coefficient estimates are not anymore elasticities. We can</p><p></p><p>see that the qualitative relationships between the variables remains the same and that the</p><p></p><p>coefficients are statistically significant in most of the specifications (sometimes also the</p><p></p><p>investment rate is significant as can be seen in Table 22). We refrain from using the fixed</p><p></p><p>17</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>effects estimator given the nature of the dependent variable. In this scenario the preferred</p><p></p><p>specification is the one obtained with the random effects estimator. Both tables show</p><p></p><p>that a one percent increase of the population growth rate is associated with a decrease</p><p></p><p>of approximately two percentiles in the growth of the robot density. The addition of the</p><p></p><p>continent dummies does not add much additional explanatory power and the magnitude</p><p></p><p>of the coefficient of interest barely changes. With regards to the cross-sections, we rank</p><p></p><p>the robot density growth rates because we cannot divide them into percentiles with only</p><p></p><p>60 observations. The coefficient of interest is still significant in most specifications and</p><p></p><p>has the predicted negative sign. In columns (5) and (7) of both tables, however, the</p><p></p><p>coefficient looses statistical significance. This could be due to the dot-com crisis and the</p><p></p><p>financial crisis because these columns correspond to the periods including 2001 and 2008,</p><p></p><p>respectively.</p><p></p><p>4 Conclusions</p><p></p><p>We propose a theoretical framework of production in the age of automation for countries</p><p></p><p>that are subject to declining population growth and population aging. In so doing we</p><p></p><p>introduce a new production factor that resembles the properties of labor in the produc-</p><p></p><p>tion process, i.e., it is a perfect substitute for labor, while it resembles the properties of</p><p></p><p>traditional physical capital in the accumulation process, i.e., it is accumulated in the same</p><p></p><p>manner as physical capital due to the savings and investment decisions of households.</p><p></p><p>We show that countries with a lower population growth rate have a stronger incentive</p><p></p><p>to invest in the adoption of automation. Our empirical estimates and several robustness</p><p></p><p>checks support this theoretical prediction.</p><p></p><p>As far as policy implications are concerned, our theoretical and empirical findings sug-</p><p></p><p>gest that countries which are subject to larger demographic challenges will be the first</p><p></p><p>to adopt and/or invent new automation technologies. This in turn might help them to</p><p></p><p>overcome some of the negative effects that declining population growth and population</p><p></p><p>aging imply for long-run economic prosperity, issues that also the media is heavily con-</p><p></p><p>cerned with (see, for example, The Washington Post, 2016). Of course, the transition to</p><p></p><p>automation technologies might not be all that smooth because automation capital com-</p><p></p><p>petes with labor and therefore could act so as to depress wages. If this concern is valid and</p><p></p><p>widespread, it might lead to resistance against automation from labor unions and the pop-</p><p></p><p>ulation at large. Altogether, it might therefore be in everybody’s interest if governments</p><p></p><p>enact policies that alleviate the burden of those who suffer because of automation. Poten-</p><p></p><p>tial policies along these lines could include education subsidies and re-training programs,</p><p></p><p>making unemployment insurance widely available, and to provide access to the health-care</p><p></p><p>system for those who become unemployed. Furthermore, it would at some point be neces-</p><p></p><p>sary to rethink how social security systems are financed because the main contribution is</p><p></p><p>now made by the production factor labor. If labor income becomes a smaller and smaller</p><p></p><p>share of total income, alternatives need to be found. One remedy that is often suggested</p><p></p><p>18</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>could be to make sure that everybody owns some part of the automation capital of an</p><p></p><p>economy, for example, a driverless car that earns an income stream for him or her (Pratt,</p><p></p><p>2015; The Economist, 2017).</p><p></p><p>We admit that our framework stayed deliberately simple and the results that we present</p><p></p><p>are meant as a first step in the direction of analyzing the interrelations between demog-</p><p></p><p>raphy and automation. In reality, there are different skill groups in the population and</p><p></p><p>the tasks that are performed by the different skill groups might be more or less suited to</p><p></p><p>automation and they might even change over time (cf. Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2015). A</p><p></p><p>more detailed framework should be able to take this into account and to empirically distin-</p><p></p><p>guish between the education level of different types of workers, and also the heterogeneity</p><p></p><p>of tasks that workers perform. However, this crucially hinges on the data for automation</p><p></p><p>in general, and robots, in particular, to become more widely available. In addition, a more</p><p></p><p>detailed modeling of demographic change is called for that takes survival to old age and</p><p></p><p>changing life expectancy into account. First steps in this direction have been undertaken</p><p></p><p>by Gasteiger and Prettner (2017).</p><p></p><p>Acknowledgments</p><p></p><p>We would like to thank Matthias Beulmann, Georg Graetz, Volker Meier, and the par-</p><p></p><p>ticipants at the annual meeting of the field committee for population economics of the</p><p></p><p>German Economic Association in Passau 2017 for valuable comments and suggestions and</p><p></p><p>David Höhle for excellent research assistance.
