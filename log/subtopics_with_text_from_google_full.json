{"automation": "Everyday uses of artificial intelligence that can talk listen and see are coming Is government ready When the 2008 Summer Olympics were about to open in Beijing China government authorities grew increasingly concerned about the city s notorious pollution problem Rather than risk the health of athletes and guests at the games dozens of nearby factories were ordered closed and driving restrictions reduced traffic by 90 percent according to state news reports While the moves were considered radical and impacted the region s economy the Beijing government felt it had little choice Today Beijing is saturated with sensors that can measure CO2 content and other pollutants Data from the sensors is now combined with information from the city s weather service and run through algorithms developed by IBM s Almaden Laboratory in Silicon Valley that help to predict whether or not the city is going to be impacted by high levels of pollution Based on the findings authorities can select which factories need to shut down if they want to reduce the chances of high pollution by 50 percent before the problem emerges The technology behind all this is artificial intelligence By collecting an enormous amount of data and combining it with historical data on weather patterns the city can predict just how bad pollution will be and then modestly dial back the industrial sector and traffic rather than shut down the entire city which is what happened in 2008 This is a practical way of using AI to mitigate a problem minimize the impact on the economy and reduce pollution overall said Jeff Welser vice president and director of the Almaden Laboratory If you re looking for a single word that sums up the status of artificial intelligence today it could be practical While the general public might get excited or alarmed by the concept of computers that can see hear and speak government has become quite bullish on real world applications of AI that can find ways to improve the environment make public spaces safer and most importantly strip out the mundane manual work that clogs up government operations This era of practical AI has already taken root in the private sector In a special report The Economist showcased how AI technology will reshape traditional business functions such as supply chain finance human resources and customer service For example companies will use AI to predict when equipment might fail or when a client is going to pay late Already 30 percent of companies now have standalone bots that can answer questions and solve problems In HR companies are building systems that can predict which job candidates are worth interviewing and can virtually screen candidates to increase diversity in hiring These are just some of the examples of what experts define as narrow AI in which machine learning neural networks and predictive analytics produce an output that is well understood Narrow AI is about intelligent automation of processes that have too much manual intervention as well as questions that require decisions that can be off loaded to the computer said Rick Howard vice president of research at Gartner AI thrives on data Lots of it Until recently trying to store and process that data was a costly endeavor for any organization But there s been a precipitous drop in storage and computer costs according to Benjamin Cheatham a senior partner with McKinsey and Company Those costs were a huge barrier to AI adoption he said Now we re inundated with data but storing and processing it no longer costs so much The result AI adoption has picked up rapidly But so far the adoption of AI in state and local government follows the same arc of adoption as technology in general It s happening at a much slower pace and smaller scale when compared to the private sector About 20 percent of our survey respondents in government CIOs are actively experimenting or have made investments in AI said Howard But compare that to a rate of 50 percent among what Gartner calls top performers in other industries Howard said that government should benchmark its adoption and deployment of AI against similar industries in the private sector such as finance banking and other financial services But when you look at the top performers in those fields 15 percent have made significant investments and have deployed scalable applications versus just 2 percent in government That shows you how big the gap is and more importantly how much quicker government needs to move with AI said Howard Despite what have been modest efforts to use AI in states and localities the desire to try AI is strong and experimentations have become increasingly useful Nowhere has this been more evident than with conversational AI A lot of governments are starting with chatbots said Kim Nelson executive director of state and local government solutions at Microsoft It s one of the emerging areas where AI will have an impact in state and local government and it s where they are experimenting to get comfortable Nelson reeled off a series of examples mostly having to do with bots that provide support by answering routine questions such as registering a business But then she mentioned how the San Diego County Sheriff has launched a bot that helps deputies get crucial information while they are in their cruiser Typically deputies call their dispatcher to run a license plate number or to get a profile check on a possible suspect It can take up to 30 minutes for that information to get back to the deputy in the cruiser she said But the bot known as Coptivity is a voice activated assistant that deputies can access in their cruiser and which is able to pull criminal background information as well as other sources of information from back end databases in real time It will also save dispatchers time on routine calls allowing them to focus on more complex information requests Nelson said the AI application wouldn t be possible without cloud computing which brings together data and cognitive services along with edge computing that allows for the fast response time needed by the deputies Bots are probably the most recognizable form of AI in government For now they tend to be used in very narrow applications answering simple and routine questions But their value increases as they listen to more conversations hear more questions learn from them and provide feedback that can improve customer service Jeff Gallino is the founder and chief technical officer of CallMiner an AI software company We listen to phone calls he said We take every word spoken how it was spoken put it into a database and mine that for insight Those insights include whether or not a customer was satisfied whether there might be a risk in the conversation and other outcomes such as the ability to pay a bill Over time the algorithms that CallMiner has developed can improve the efficiencies of call center agents manyfold saving companies millions of dollars But Gallino sees a real opportunity to use this special form of AI as a way to improve customer service in government particularly 311 call centers Gallino calls 311 an inbound form of phone service The public calls 311 to get answers to questions to request a service or to complain about a problem By collecting all types of calls into a database and then building a machine learning system local governments could start to predict who is calling based on whether the call is from a mobile phone or a landline whether the person has called before and the history of their previous calls By mining that information AI can route particular callers to specific agents who would be able to answer their query or complaint more quickly and with more accuracy Gallino refers to this as call deflection and when done right it can quickly increase caller satisfaction As Gallino and other AI experts point out the value in the technology right now is in its ability to sift through vast amounts of data find certain anomalies or patterns that would take humans far too long to notice and then use alerts or nudges to get agents to ask more pertinent questions or trigger the bot to provide a more targeted and accurate answer When those nudges alerts and intelligent responses are spread across the vast number of government service centers from municipal 311 systems to Medicaid eligibility programs the efficiencies begin to have an outsized impact on operations not to mention a surge in constituent satisfaction Gallino envisions a point in the near future where bots will answer a growing number of the calls queries and complaints on 311 calls and predicts that bots could also siphon off some of the initial questions that may happen on a 911 call before handing it over to a live dispatcher But the technology isn t quite there yet The challenge is to make the conversation with a bot more natural said IBM s Welser Right now bots are pretty good if a person asks a question that it understands and can give an answer to But that s not how human interaction works Phone into any call center and the caller and agent often exchange several questions and answers to clarify the situation Getting to that natural kind of conversation where a bot can replicate how a caller and agent go back and forth to understand a problem is an active part of research he said Welser points to other challenges that can arise as the use of AI spreads One issue is developing a better understanding of where certain correlations are coming from It s one thing to have correlations that might help predict future air pollution patterns but it s quite another when it comes to decision making that affects health and safety or some other important public policy AI should augment what a person is doing not replace them he said That means the human expert who is making a decision based on AI needs to understand where the sources of data came from where the outcome came from and the reasons the system came up with a particular recommendation or connection Keeping bias out of AI results is another ongoing challenge Almaden Labs spends a lot of time figuring out how to make sure unintentional bias hasn t been built into an AI system But Welser admits the problem won t be easy to fix State and local governments face their own particular barriers to deploying AI beyond the fundamental challenges with AI itself Not surprisingly the historically low levels of IT investment in the public sector have slowed the introduction of AI in government If you look at the technology stack in state and local government it s very antiquated said McKinsey s Cheatham The fundamental technology infrastructure hasn t been upgraded at the rate found in the private sector Cheatham also points to the lack of data scientists in the public sector as another reason AI is spreading so slowly Without the knowledge or expertise to craft AI solutions state and local governments will be heavily dependent on others to figure out the best way to use AI Then there is just the public s leeriness about AI What does it mean to have algorithms supporting public policy and decision making he asked As a result government will need to be far more transparent than the private sector when it comes to adopting and using AI In a bullish report on potential uses of AI in government published in 2017 Deloitte Insights predicted that with adequate investment and support AI could free up 30 percent of government workforce s time within five to seven years Just as digital spreadsheets transformed finance departments AI is expected to make routine back office work more efficient reported The Economist That kind of efficiency is expected to ripple throughout state and local government There is a huge value potential for government customers that use AI said Microsoft s Nelson She points to the enormous possibilities to curtail fraud waste and abuse using AI There s two trillion dollars spent annually by government Imagine the potential to save on fraud and waste using cognitive services The best way to get started with AI is by identifying the major pain points in a program that is amenable to AI according to Welser Second you want to make sure there s enough data in that program to train a system effectively The good news for state and local government is that if they have a good candidate for AI and they have the data there are now a number of pre developed cognitive programs out there that can help launch a productive application The vendor community is increasingly turning its attention to the government market as far as AI is concerned To be strategic about AI s future role in government Gartner s Howard suggests that states and localities focus on how they can become more conversational with a greater percentage of citizens It s all about becoming more intelligent he said Given that citizens are already used to interacting with AI in the commercial space and have come to expect to use a digital assistant bot or some type of intelligent service it s important that government not fall too far behind with AI If you let the technology gap window grow more than 30 months you are not doing anything to increase the trust and confidence in public institutions said Howard There is a digital urgency today time is not your

Deloitte s Center for Government Insights said at a Nov 29 FCW event on government modernization that 20 to 30 percent of all work activities will soon be automatable thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence He pointed to a Deloitte study of the federal workforce that found 4 3 billion hours are spent each year on a wide range of task and activities A huge share of those hours is devoted to essentially moving paper he said while relatively little time goes to coaching and other sorts of human activities But the study also found that four out of five of the most labor intensive activities have either a medium or high automation potential Eggers said That could allow for reductions in certain parts of the workforce he noted but it also frees up time for critical higher value work and the chance to deliver better service by giving the human workforce AI powered support Studies have repeatedly shown Eggers said that it s the human machine pairing that gives the best results

Privacy Policy Automating governmentEven as artificial intelligence AI is forecast to exceed human capabilities across a range of industries it is also predicted to augment human labor In finance AI is already helping financial advisors augment financial planning while enhancing investment strategy And in medicine AI diagnostics systems have proven to be far more accurate than doctors in diagnosing heart disease and cancerous growths In fact McKinsey lists some 400 use cases representing 6 trillion in value across 19 industries in which AI will augment human work But what about government What will the impact of AI be on the nature of government Waking Government to AINot surprisingly much of the public sector has already begun experimenting with AI driven technologies At the federal level many agencies are beginning to deploy AI powered interfaces for customer service alongside an expanding use of software to update legacy systems and automate simple tasks Growing investments in infrastructure planning legal adjudication fraud detection and citizen response systems represent the first phase in the ongoing digitization of government Notwithstanding these investments however government remains far behind the private sector in deploying and integrating AI As Silicon Valley s Tim O Reilly has suggested augmenting government through AI is critical to modernizing the public sector AI based applications could potentially reduce backlogs and free workers from mundane tasks while cutting costs According to Deloitte documenting and recording information alone consumes a half billion staff hours each year at a cost of more than 16 billion in wages Add to this an additional 15 billion in the procuring and processing of information and the value of AI in transforming government bureaucracy becomes clear Some now argue that the affordances of technology are critical to remaking government for the 21st century Advancing democracies into the era of Big Data could go a long way towards reducing systemic dysfunction within the public sector Using sensor technologies and machine learning systems to reinforce government oversight could begin to reduce regulation while actually increasing the amount of oversight Coining the term algorithmic regulation for example O Reilly suggests that government regulations should be regarded as algorithms i e a set of rules that can be adjusted based on fresh data The most recent advancement in AI deep learning represents a revolution in the use of machines for supporting decision management forecasting data classification and the synthesis of information Building on deep learning tools AI could mean significantly improving service delivery for citizens and elevating the work of public service professionals while also inspiring a new generation of technocrats to enter government Alternatively AI could also mean remaking government altogether US CapitolDigital LeviathanIn the United States demographic polarization and toxic federal politics have stymied needed action on a host of pressing issues including immigration reform welfare reform gun control and the country s overall faith in government and its institutions More problematically this political polarization lends itself to growing concerns about the very efficacy of democracy itself Outside the US China is clearly pioneering an entirely different model of government Where Soviet style central planning led to scarcity and oppression China s new economic thinking is that Big Data can assist planned economies in shaping markets and potentially leapfrogging democracy Combining Big Data sensor technologies and AI China is introducing a techno utilitarianism that may well outpace participatory decision making Could China s model work in other countries and if so what would that mean for democracy In the West the growing fear is that China will become a kind of digital autocracy on a scale never previously imagined Given China s expanding use of AI and its outsized influence on the developing world this begs the question what systems of government are necessary for managing AI driven societies And what is the potential for exploitation in such a vast system of algorithmic management and control Technocracy or Democracy The worrying question today for many is whether democracy can survive AI The reality is that disruptive technologies like AI cannot be put back in the box AI is becoming a mainstream technology that will need to be effectively integrated into 21st century decision making across all institutions especially government In the wake of this digital revolution some functions of government will necessarily be eliminated But AI will also enable new tools for smart citizenship and open government that can augment democracy Rather than technocracy or democracy the answer will likely be a combination of both What we do know is that we are leaving the era of centralized systems and top down decision making As Beth Noveck former head of President Obama s Open Government Initiative explains representative democracy itself now faces a crisis of legitimacy The rationale for closed systems of decision making in which citizen participation is confined to voting or interest group activism belongs to a different era In an era of networks we now need tools that bridge algorithms with new forms of collaborative decision making Simply put we need digital democracies that build on the capabilities of AI and Big Data Follow me danielarayaXY or connect directly at

Description Agencies have been accumulating data for many years However organizations also realize they have not gained many benefits from the datasets Along with an increase in unstructured data there has also been a rise in the number of data formats Administrative data such as notes and articles as the primary data type have expanded to include images audio video and sensors Many organizations fail to consider how quickly a big data project scales Constantly pausing a project to add additional resources cuts into time for data analysis Assessing what data exists and its integrity completeness accuracy bias and trust prolong the analysis effort This challenge is further compounded by integrating disparate data sources and securing big data This track addresses the major challenges faced by Big Data environments with an emphasis on identifying what data you have how to source additional data how to organize it how to clean it how to prepare the data for use in a machine learning application and ultimately how to integrate and scale the application into the Agency s IT systems 2 00 pm Panel Getting Your Data Ready for AIThe basic challenge of working with data

Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humans Please think forward to the year 2030 Analysts expect that people will become even more dependent on networked artificial intelligence AI in complex digital systems Some say we will continue on the historic arc of augmenting our lives with mostly positive results as we widely implement these networked tools Some say our increasing dependence on these AI and related systems is likely to lead to widespread difficulties Our question By 2030 do you think it is most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will enhance human capacities and empower them That is most of the time will most people be better off than they are today Or is it most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will lessen human autonomy and agency to such an extent that most people will not be better off than the way things are today Please explain why you chose the answer you did and sketch out a vision of how the human machine AI collaboration will function in 2030 Please consider giving an example of how a typical human machine interaction will look and feel in a specific area for instance in the workplace in family life in a health care setting or in a learning environment Why What is your hope or fear What actions might be taken to assure the best future In answer to Question One Among the key themes emerging in our December 10 2018 report from 979 respondents overall answers were CONCERNS Human Agency Decision making on key aspects of digital life is automatically ceded to code driven black box tools People lack input and do not learn the context about how the tools work They sacrifice independence privacy and power over choice they have no control over these processes This effect will deepen as automated systems become more prevalent and complex Data Abuse Most AI tools are and will be in the hands of companies striving for profits or governments striving for power Values and ethics are often not baked into the digital systems making people s decisions for them These systems are globally networked and not easy to regulate or rein in Job Loss The efficiencies and other economic advantages of code based machine intelligence will continue to disrupt all aspects of human work While some expect new jobs will emerge others worry about massive job losses widening economic divides and social upheavals including populist uprisings Dependence Lock in Many see AI as augmenting human capacities but some predict the opposite that people s deepening dependence on machine driven networks will erode their abilities to think for themselves take action independent of automated systems and interact effectively with others Mayhem Some predict further erosion of traditional sociopolitical structures and the possibility of great loss of lives due to accelerated growth of autonomous military applications and the use of weaponized information lies and propaganda to dangerously destabilize human groups Some also fear cybercriminals reach into economic systems POTENTIAL REMEDIES Global Good is 1 It is vital to improve human collaboration across borders and stakeholder groups Digital cooperation to serve humanity s best interests is the top priority Ways must be found for people around the world to come to common understandings and agreements to join forces to facilitate the innovation of widely accepted approaches aimed at tackling wicked problems and maintaining control over complex human digital networks Values Based Systems Develop policies to assure AI will be directed at the common good Adopt a moonshot mentality to build inclusive decentralized intelligent digital networks imbued with empathy that help humans aggressively ensure that technology meets social and ethical responsibilities Some new level of regulatory and certification process will be necessary Prioritize People Alter economic and political systems to better help humans race with the machines Direct energies to radical human improvement Reorganize economic and political systems toward the goal of expanding humans capacities and capabilities in order to heighten human AI collaboration and staunch trends that would compromise human relevance in the face of programmed intelligence BENEFITS of AI 2030 New Life and Work Efficiencies AI will be integrated into most aspects of like producing new efficiencies and enhancing human capacities It can optimize and augment people s life experiences including the work lives of those who choose to work Health Care Improvements AI can revolutionize medical and wellness services reduce errors and recognize life saving patterns opening up a world of opportunity and options in health care Education Advances Adaptive and

AI and the Future of Humans anon xhtmlDigital life is augmenting human capacities and disrupting eons old human activities Code driven systems have spread to more than half of the world s inhabitants in ambient information and connectivity offering previously unimagined opportunities and unprecedented threats As emerging algorithm driven artificial intelligence AI continues to spread will people be better off than they are today Some 979 technology pioneers innovators developers business and policy leaders researchers and activists answered this question in a canvassing of experts conducted in the summer of 2018 The experts predicted networked artificial intelligence will amplify human effectiveness but also threaten human autonomy agency and capabilities They spoke of the wide ranging possibilities that computers might match or even exceed human intelligence and capabilities on tasks such as complex decision making reasoning and learning sophisticated analytics and pattern recognition visual acuity speech recognition and language translation They said smart systems in communities in vehicles in buildings and utilities on farms and in business processes will save time money and lives and offer opportunities for individuals to enjoy a more customized future Many focused their optimistic remarks on health care and the many possible applications of AI in diagnosing and treating patients or helping senior citizens live fuller and healthier lives They were also enthusiastic about AI s role in contributing to broad public health programs built around massive amounts of data that may be captured in the coming years about everything from personal genomes to nutrition Additionally a number of these experts predicted that AI would abet long anticipated changes in formal and informal education systems Yet most experts regardless of whether they are optimistic or not expressed concerns about the long term impact of these new tools on the essential elements of being human All respondents in this non scientific canvassing were asked to elaborate on why they felt AI would leave people better off or not Many shared deep concerns and many also suggested pathways toward solutions The main themes they sounded about threats and remedies are outlined in the accompanying table Specifically participants were asked to consider the following Please think forward to the year 2030 Analysts expect that people will become even more dependent on networked artificial intelligence AI in complex digital systems Some say we will continue on the historic arc of augmenting our lives with mostly positive results as we widely implement these networked tools Some say our increasing dependence on these AI and related systems is likely to lead to widespread difficulties Our question By 2030 do you think it is most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will enhance human capacities and empower them That is most of the time will most people be better off than they are today Or is it most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will lessen human autonomy and agency to such an extent that most people will not be better off than the way things are today Overall and despite the downsides they fear 63 of respondents in this canvassing said they are hopeful that most individuals will be mostly better off in 2030 and 37 said people will not be better off A number of the thought leaders who participated in this canvassing said humans expanding reliance on technological systems will only go well if close attention is paid to how these tools platforms and networks are engineered distributed and updated Following are some of the most powerful overarching answers Sonia Katyal co director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology and a member of the inaugural U S Commerce Department Digital Economy Board of Advisors predicted In 2030 the greatest set of questions will involve how perceptions of AI and their application will influence the trajectory of civil rights in the future Questions about privacy speech the right of assembly and technological construction of personhood will all re emerge in this new AI context throwing into question our deepest held beliefs about equality and opportunity for all Who will benefit and who will be disadvantaged in this new world depends on how broadly we analyze these questions today for the future Erik Brynjolfsson director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy and author of Machine Platform Crowd Harnessing Our Digital Future said AI and related technologies have already achieved superhuman performance in many areas and there is little doubt that their capabilities will improve probably very significantly by 2030 I think it is more likely than not that we will use this power to make the world a better place For instance we can virtually eliminate global poverty massively reduce disease and provide better education to almost everyone on the planet That said AI and ML machine learning can also be used to increasingly concentrate wealth and power leaving many people behind and to create even more horrifying weapons Neither outcome is inevitable so the right question is not What will happen but What will we choose to do We need to work aggressively to make sure technology matches our values This can and must be done at all levels from government to business to academia and to individual choices Bryan Johnson founder and CEO of Kernel a leading developer of advanced neural interfaces and OS Fund a venture capital firm said I strongly believe the answer depends on whether we can shift our economic systems toward prioritizing radical human improvement and staunching the trend toward human irrelevance in the face of AI I don t mean just jobs I mean true existential irrelevance which is the end result of not prioritizing human well being and cognition Marina Gorbis executive director of the Institute for the Future said Without significant changes in our political economy and data governance regimes AI is likely to create greater economic inequalities more surveillance and more programmed and non human centric interactions Every time we program our environments we end up programming ourselves and our interactions Humans have to become more standardized removing serendipity and ambiguity from our interactions And this ambiguity and complexity is what is the essence of being human Judith Donath author of The Social Machine Designs for Living Online and faculty fellow at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society commented By 2030 most social situations will be facilitated by bots intelligent seeming programs that interact with us in human like ways At home parents will engage skilled bots to help kids with homework and catalyze dinner conversations At work bots will run meetings A bot confidant will be considered essential for psychological well being and we ll increasingly turn to such companions for advice ranging from what to wear to whom to marry We humans care deeply about how others see us and the others whose approval we seek will increasingly be artificial By then the difference between humans and bots will have blurred considerably Via screen and projection the voice appearance and behaviors of bots will be indistinguishable from those of humans and even physical robots though obviously non human will be so convincingly sincere that our impression of them as thinking feeling beings on par with or superior to ourselves will be unshaken Adding to the ambiguity our own communication will be heavily augmented Programs will compose many of our messages and our online AR appearance will be computationally crafted Raw unaided human speech and demeanor will seem embarrassingly clunky slow and unsophisticated Aided by their access to vast troves of data about each of us bots will far surpass humans in their ability to attract and persuade us Able to mimic emotion expertly they ll never be overcome by feelings If they blurt something out in anger it will be because that behavior was calculated to be the most efficacious way of advancing whatever goals they had in mind But what are those goals Artificially intelligent companions will cultivate the impression that social goals similar to our own motivate them to be held in good regard whether as a beloved friend an admired boss etc But their real collaboration will be with the humans and institutions that control them Like their forebears today these will be sellers of goods who employ them to stimulate consumption and politicians who commission them to sway opinions Andrew McLaughlin executive director of the Center for Innovative Thinking at Yale University previously deputy chief technology officer of the United States for President Barack Obama and global public policy lead for Google wrote 2030 is not far in the future My sense is that innovations like the internet and networked AI have massive short term benefits along with long term negatives that can take decades to be recognizable AI will drive a vast range of efficiency optimizations but also enable hidden discrimination and arbitrary penalization of individuals in areas like insurance job seeking and performance assessment Michael M Roberts first president and CEO of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN and Internet Hall of Fame member wrote The range of opportunities for intelligent agents to augment human intelligence is still virtually unlimited The major issue is that the more convenient an agent is the more it needs to know about you preferences timing capacities etc which creates a tradeoff of more help requires more intrusion This is not a black and white issue the shades of gray and associated remedies will be argued endlessly The record to date is that convenience overwhelms privacy I suspect that will continue danah boyd a principal researcher for Microsoft and founder and president of the Data Society Research Institute said AI is a tool that will be used by humans for all sorts of purposes including in the pursuit of power There will be abuses of power that involve AI just as there will be advances in science and humanitarian efforts that also involve AI Unfortunately there are certain trend lines that are likely to create massive instability Take for example climate change and climate migration This will further destabilize Europe and the U S and I expect that in panic we will see AI be used in harmful ways in light of other geopolitical crises Amy Webb founder of the Future Today Institute and professor of strategic foresight at New York University commented The social safety net structures currently in place in the U S and in many other countries around the world weren t designed for our transition to AI The transition through AI will last the next 50 years or more As we move farther into this third era of computing and as every single industry becomes more deeply entrenched with AI systems we will need new hybrid skilled knowledge workers who can operate in jobs that have never needed to exist before We ll need farmers who know how to work with big data sets Oncologists trained as robotocists Biologists trained as electrical engineers We won t need to prepare our workforce just once with a few changes to the curriculum As AI matures we will need a responsive workforce capable of adapting to new processes systems and tools every few years The need for these fields will arise faster than our labor departments schools and universities are acknowledging It s easy to look back on history through the lens of present and to overlook the social unrest caused by widespread technological unemployment We need to address a difficult truth that few are willing to utter aloud AI will eventually cause a large number of people to be permanently out of work Just as generations before witnessed sweeping changes during and in the aftermath of the Industrial Revolution the rapid pace of technology will likely mean that Baby Boomers and the oldest members of Gen X especially those whose jobs can be replicated by robots won t be able to retrain for other kinds of work without a significant investment of time and effort Barry Chudakov founder and principal of Sertain Research commented By 2030 the human machine AI collaboration will be a necessary tool to manage and counter the effects of multiple simultaneous accelerations broad technology advancement globalization climate change and attendant global migrations In the past human societies managed change through gut and intuition but as Eric Teller CEO of Google X has said Our societal structures are failing to keep pace with the rate of change To keep pace with that change and to manage a growing list of wicked problems by 2030 AI or using Joi Ito s phrase extended intelligence will value and revalue virtually every area of human behavior and interaction AI and advancing technologies will change our response framework and time frames which in turn changes our sense of time Where once social interaction happened in places work school church family environments social interactions will increasingly happen in continuous simultaneous time If we are fortunate we will follow the 23 Asilomar AI Principles outlined by the Future of Life Institute and will work toward not undirected intelligence but beneficial intelligence Akin to nuclear deterrence stemming from mutually assured destruction AI and related technology systems constitute a force for a moral renaissance We must embrace that moral renaissance or we will face moral conundrums that could bring about human demise My greatest hope for human machine AI collaboration constitutes a moral and ethical renaissance we adopt a moonshot mentality and lock arms to prepare for the accelerations coming at us My greatest fear is that we adopt the logic of our emerging technologies instant response isolation behind screens endless comparison of self worth fake self presentation without thinking or responding smartly John C Havens executive director of the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems and the Council on Extended Intelligence wrote Now in 2018 a majority of people around the world can t access their data so any human AI augmentation discussions ignore the critical context of who actually controls people s information and identity Soon it will be extremely difficult to identify any autonomous or intelligent systems whose algorithms don t interact with human data in one form or another Batya Friedman a human computer interaction professor at the University of Washington s Information School wrote Our scientific and technological capacities have and will continue to far surpass our moral ones that is our ability to use wisely and humanely the knowledge and tools that we develop Automated warfare when autonomous weapons kill human beings without human engagement can lead to a lack of responsibility for taking the enemy s life or even knowledge that an enemy s life has been taken At stake is nothing less than what sort of society we want to live in and how we experience our humanity Greg Shannon chief scientist for the CERT Division at Carnegie Mellon University said Better worse will appear 4 1 with the long term ratio 2 1 AI will do well for repetitive work where close will be good enough and humans dislike the work Life will definitely be better as AI extends lifetimes from health apps that intelligently nudge us to health to warnings about impending heart stroke events to automated health care for the underserved remote and those who need extended care elder care As to liberty there are clear risks AI affects agency by creating entities with meaningful intellectual capabilities for monitoring enforcing and even punishing individuals Those who know how to use it will have immense potential power over those who don t can t Future happiness is really unclear Some will cede their agency to AI in games work and community much like the opioid crisis steals agency today On the other hand many will be freed from mundane unengaging tasks jobs If elements of community happiness are part of AI objective functions then AI could catalyze an explosion of happiness Kostas Alexandridis author of Exploring Complex Dynamics in Multi agent based Intelligent Systems predicted Many of our day to day decisions will be automated with minimal intervention by the end user Autonomy and or independence will be sacrificed and replaced by convenience Newer generations of citizens will become more and more dependent on networked AI structures and processes There are challenges that need to be addressed in terms of critical thinking and heterogeneity Networked interdependence will more likely than not increase our vulnerability to cyberattacks There is also a real likelihood that there will exist sharper divisions between digital haves and have nots as well as among technologically dependent digital infrastructures Finally there is the question of the new commanding heights of the digital network infrastructure s ownership and control Oscar Gandy emeritus professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania responded We already face an ungranted assumption when we are asked to imagine human machine collaboration Interaction is a bit different but still tainted by the grant of a form of identity maybe even personhood to machines that we will use to make our way through all sorts of opportunities and challenges The problems we will face in the future are quite similar to the problems we currently face when we rely upon others including technological systems devices and networks to acquire things we value and avoid those other things that we might or might not be aware of James Scofield O Rourke a professor of management at the University of Notre Dame said Technology has throughout recorded history been a largely neutral concept The question of its value has always been dependent on its application For what purpose will AI and other technological advances be used Everything from gunpowder to internal combustion engines to nuclear fission has been applied in both helpful and destructive ways Assuming we can contain or control AI and not the other way around the answer to whether we ll be better off depends entirely on us or our progeny The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings Simon Biggs a professor of interdisciplinary arts at the University of Edinburgh said AI will function to augment human capabilities The problem is not with AI but with humans As a species we are aggressive competitive and lazy We are also empathic community minded and sometimes self sacrificing We have many other attributes These will all be amplified Given historical precedent one would have to assume it will be our worst qualities that are augmented My expectation is that in 2030 AI will be in routine use to fight wars and kill people far more effectively than we can currently kill As societies we will be less affected by this as we currently are as we will not be doing the fighting and killing ourselves Our capacity to modify our behaviour subject to empathy and an associated ethical framework will be reduced by the disassociation between our agency and the act of killing We cannot expect our AI systems to be ethical on our behalf they won t be as they will be designed to kill efficiently not thoughtfully My other primary concern is to do with surveillance and control The advent of China s Social Credit System SCS is an indicator of what it likely to come We will exist within an SCS as AI constructs hybrid instances of ourselves that may or may not resemble who we are But our rights and affordances as individuals will be determined by the SCS This is the Orwellian nightmare realised Mark Surman executive director of the Mozilla Foundation responded AI will continue to concentrate power and wealth in the hands of a few big monopolies based on the U S and China Most people and parts of the world will be worse off William Uricchio media scholar and professor of comparative media studies at MIT commented AI and its related applications face three problems development at the speed of Moore s Law development in the hands of a technological and economic elite and development without benefit of an informed or engaged public The public is reduced to a collective of consumers awaiting the next technology Whose notion of progress will prevail We have ample evidence of AI being used to drive profits regardless of implications for long held values to enhance governmental control and even score citizens social credit without input from citizens themselves Like technologies before it AI is agnostic Its deployment rests in the hands of society But absent an AI literate public the decision of how best to deploy AI will fall to special interests Will this mean equitable deployment the amelioration of social injustice and AI in the public service Because the answer to this question is social rather than technological I m pessimistic The fix We need to develop an AI literate public which means focused attention in the educational sector and in public facing media We need to assure diversity in the development of AI technologies And until the public its elected representatives and their legal and regulatory regimes can get up to speed with these fast moving developments we need to exercise caution and oversight in AI s development The remainder of this report is divided into three sections that draw from hundreds of additional respondents hopeful and critical observations 1 Concerns about human AI evolution 2 Suggested solutions to address AI s impact 3 Expectations of what life will be like in 2030 including respondents positive outlooks on the quality of life and the future of work health care and education Some responses are lightly edited for style A clear majority of the responses from these experts contained material outlining certain challenges fears or concerns about the AI infused future The five most often mentioned concerns were 1 the use of AI reduces individuals control over their lives 2 surveillance and data systems designed primarily for efficiency profit and control are inherently dangerous 3 displacement of human jobs by AI will widen economic and digital divides possibly leading to social upheaval 4 individuals cognitive social and survival skills will be diminished as they become dependent on AI and 5 citizens will face increased vulnerabilities such as exposure to cybercrime and cyberwarfare that spin out of control and the possibility that essential organizations are endangered by weaponized information A few also worried about the wholesale destruction of humanity The sections of this chapter will cover experts answers tied to these themes Autonomous systems can reduce or eliminate the need for human involvement in some tasks Today s ever advancing artificial narrow intelligence ANI tools for instance search engines and digital agents such as Siri Alexa and Cortana are not close to reaching the goal of human like artificial general intelligence AGI They are however continually becoming more powerful thanks to developments in machine learning and natural language processing and advances in materials science networking energy storage and hardware capabilities ANI is machine intelligence that equals or exceeds people s abilities or efficiency at a specific task For years code based tools in robots and other systems have performed repetitive tasks like factory floor assembly activities Today these tools are quickly evolving to master human traits such as reason logic learning task performance and creativity Today s smart networked software equipped devices cars digital assistants and platforms such as Google search and Facebook social mapping accomplish extremely complex tasks The systems underpinning today s global financial markets businesses militaries police forces and medical energy and industrial operations are all dependent upon networked AI of one type or another What is the future of humans in an age of accelerating technological change Many experts in this canvassing said that as AI advances human autonomy and agency are at risk They note that decision making on key aspects of life is ceded to code driven tools Individuals who function in this digital world sacrifice to varying degrees their independence right to privacy and power over choice Many of the experts who worry about this say humans accede to this in order to stay competitive to participate socially and professionally in the world to be entertained and to get things done They say people hand over some control of their lives because of the perceived advantages they gain via digital tools efficiency convenience and superior pattern recognition data storage and search and find capabilities Here is a selection of responses from these experts that touch on this An anonymous respondent summed up the concerns of many writing The most feared reversal in human fortune of the AI age is loss of agency The trade off for the near instant low friction convenience of digital life is the loss of context about and control over its processes People s blind dependence on digital tools is deepening as automated systems become more complex and ownership of those systems is by the elite Baratunde Thurston futurist former director of digital at The Onion and co founder of comedy technology start up Cultivated Wit said For the record this is not the future I want but it is what I expect given existing default settings in our economic and sociopolitical system preferences The problems to which we are applying machine learning and AI are generally not ones that will lead to a better life for most people That s why I say in 2030 most people won t be better due to AI We won t be more autonomous we will be more automated as we follow the metaphorical GPS line through daily interactions We don t choose our breakfast or our morning workouts or our route to work An algorithm will make these choices for us in a way that maximizes efficiency narrowly defined and probably also maximizes the profitability of the service provider By 2030 we may cram more activities and interactions into our days but I don t think that will make our lives better A better life by my definition is one in which we feel more valued and happy Given that the biggest investments in AI are on behalf of marketing efforts designed to deplete our attention and bank balances I can only imagine this leading to days that are more filled but lives that are less fulfilled To create a different future I believe we must unleash these technologies toward goals beyond profit maximization Imagine a mapping app that plotted your work commute through the most beautiful route not simply the fastest Imagine a communications app that facilitated deeper connections with people you deemed most important These technologies must be more people centric We need to ask that they ask us What is important to you How would you like to spend your time But that s not the system we re building All those decisions have been hoarded by the unimaginative pursuit of profit Thad Hall a researcher and coauthor of Politics for a Connected American Public added AI is likely to have benefits from improving medical diagnoses to improving people s consumer experiences However there are four aspects of AI that are very problematic 1 It is likely to result in more economic uncertainty and dislocation for people including employment issues and more need to change jobs to stay relevant 2 AI will continue to erode people s privacy as search becomes more thorough China s monitoring of populations illustrates what this could look like in authoritarian and Western countries with greater facial recognition used to identify people and affect their privacy 3 AI will likely continue to have biases that are negative toward minority populations including groups we have not considered Given that algorithms often have identifiable biases e g favoring people who are white or male they likely also have biases that are less well recognized such as biases that are negative toward people with disabilities older people or other groups These biases may ripple through society in unknown ways Some groups are more likely to be monitored effectively 4 AI is creating a world where reality can be manipulated in ways we do not appreciate Fake videos audio and similar media are likely to explode and create a world where reality is hard to discern The relativistic political world will become more so with people having evidence to support their own reality or multiple realities that mean no one knows what is the truth Thomas Schneider head of International Relations Service and vice director at the Federal Office of Communications OFCOM in Switzerland said AI will help mankind to be more efficient live safer and healthier and manage resources like energy transport etc more efficiently At the same time there are a number of risks that AI may be used by those in power to manipulate control and dominate others We have seen this with every new technology It can and will be used for good and bad Much will depend about how AI will be governed If we have an inclusive and bottom up governance system of well informed citizens then AI will be used for improving our quality of life If only a few people decide about how AI is used and what for many others will be dependent on the decisions of these few and risk being manipulated by them The biggest danger in my view is that there will be a greater pressure on all members of our societies to live according to what the system will tell us is best for us to do and not to do i e that we may lose the autonomy to decide ourselves how we want to live our lives to choose diverse ways of doing things With more and more recommendations rankings and competition through social pressure and control we may risk a loss of individual fundamental freedoms including but not limited to the right to a private life that we have fought for in the last decades and centuries Bart Knijnenburg assistant professor of computer science who is active in the Human Factors Institute at Clemson University said Whether AI will make our lives better depends on how it is implemented Many current AI systems including adaptive content presentation systems and so called recommender systems try to avoid information and choice overload by replacing our decision making processes with algorithmic predictions True empowerment will come from these systems supporting rather than replacing our decision making practices This is the only way we can overcome choice information overload and at the same time avoid so called filter bubbles For example Facebook s current post ranking systems will eventually turn us all into cat video watching zombies because they follow our behavioral patterns which may not be aligned with our preferences The algorithms behind these tools need to support human agency not replace it Peter Reiner professor and co founder of the National Core for Neuroethics at the University of British Columbia commented I am confident that in 2030 both arms of this query will be true AI driven algorithms will substantially enhance our abilities as humans and human autonomy and agency will be diminished Whether people will be better off than they are today is a separate question and the answer depends to a substantial degree on how looming technological developments unfold On the one hand if corporate entities retain unbridled control over how AI driven algorithms interact with humans people will be less well off as the loss of autonomy and agency will be largely to the benefit of the corporations On the other hand if we the people demand that corporate entities deploy AI algorithms in a manner that is sensitive to the issues of human autonomy and agency then there is a real possibility for us to be better off enhanced by the power of the AI driven algorithm and yet not relegated to an impoverished seat at the decision making table One could even parse this further anticipating that certain decisions can be comfortably left in the hands of the AI driven algorithm with other decisions either falling back on humans or arrived at through a combination of AI driven algorithmic input and human decision making If we approach these issues skillfully and it will take quite a bit of collaborative work between ethicists and industry we can have the best of both worlds On the other hand if we are lax in acting as watchdogs over industry we will be functionally rich and decisionally poor Paul Vixie an Internet Hall of Fame member known for designing and implementing several Domain Name System protocol extensions and applications wrote Understanding is a perfect proxy for control As we make more of the world s economy non understandable by the masses we make it easier for powerful interests to practice control Real autonomy or privacy or unpredictability will be seen as a threat and managed around Jo o Pedro Taveira embedded systems researcher and smart grids architect for INOV INESC Inova o in Portugal wrote Basically we will lose several degrees of freedom Are we ready for that When we wake up to what is happening it might be too late to do anything about it Artificial intelligence is a subject that must be studied philosophically in open minded abstract and hypothetical ways Using this perspective the issues to be solved by humans are but not limited to AI feelings values motivation free will solidarity love and hate Yes we will have serious problems Dropping the artificial off AI look at the concept of intelligence As a computer science person I know that so called AI studies how an agent a software program increases its knowledge base using rules that are defined using pattern recognition mechanisms No matter which mechanisms are used to generate this rule set the result will be always behavioral profiling Right now everybody uses and agrees to use a wide set of appliances services and products without a full understanding of the information that is being shared with enterprises companies and other parties There s a lack of needed regulation and audit mechanisms on who or what uses our information and how it is used and whether it is stored for future use Governments and others will try to access this information using these tools by decree arguing national security or administration efficiency improvements Enterprises and companies might argue that these tools offer improvement of quality of service but there s no guarantee about individuals privacy anonymity individual security intractability and so on Ramon Lopez de Mantaras director of the Spanish National Research Council s Artificial Intelligence Research Institute said I do not think it is a good idea to give high levels of autonomy to AI systems They are and will be weak AI systems without commonsense knowledge They will have more and more competence yes but this will be competence without comprehension AI machines should remain at the level of tools or at most assistants always keeping the human in the loop We should all read or re read the book Computer Power and Human Reason by Joseph Weizenbaum before deciding whether or not to give lots of autonomy to stupid machines Oscar Gandy emeritus professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania responded AI systems will make quite substantial and important contributions to the ability of health care providers to generate accurate diagnoses of maladies and threats to my well being now and in the future I can imagine the development and deployment of systems in which my well being is the primary basis of our relationship I am less sure about how my access to and use of this resource may be constrained or distorted by the interests of the other actors humans within profit power seeking orientations I assume that they will be aided by their own AI systems informing them how to best present options to me I am hopeful that we will have agents whether private social governmental whose interest and responsibility is in ensuring that my interests govern those relationships Robert Epstein senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology and the founding director of the Loebner Prize a competition in artificial intelligence said By 2030 it is likely that AIs will have achieved a type of sentience even if it is not human like They will also be able to exercise varying degrees of control over most human communications financial transactions transportation systems power grids and weapon systems As I noted in my 2008 book Parsing the Turing Test they will reside in the InterNest we have been building for them and we will have no way of dislodging them How they decide to deal with humanity to help us ignore us or destroy us will be entirely up to them and there is no way currently to predict which avenue they will choose Because a few paranoid humans will almost certainly try to destroy the new sentient AIs there is at least a reasonable possibility that that they will swat us like the flies we are the possibility that Stephen Hawking Elon Musk and others have warned about There is no way to my knowledge of stopping this future from emerging Driven by the convenience of connectivity the greed that underlies business expansion and the pipedreams of muddle headed people who confuse machine like intelligence with biological intelligence we will continue to build AIs we can barely understand and to expand the InterNest in which they will live until the inevitable whatever that proves to be occurs An attorney specializing in policy issues for a global digital rights organization commented I m not sure even today whether the tech advances of the last 12 years have been net positive over the global population We ve seen a widening gap between the very rich and everybody else That is likely bad for democracy AI seems likely to make the employment training problem worse in the U S and AI may have similar effects in countries that currently provide cheap labor On the political governmental side AI will exacerbate current surveillance and accountability problems I figure that AI will improve and speed up all biometric pattern recognition as well as DNA analysis and natural language processing And though we know that much of this is biased we re not adequately counteracting the bias we know about The companies who generate and disseminate AI technology have every incentive to continue I m not optimistic that collective action at least in the U S system will successfully counter those incentives Brian Behlendorf executive director of the Hyperledger project at The Linux Foundation and expert in blockchain technology wrote I am concerned that AI will not be a democratizing power but will enhance further the power and wealth of those who already hold it This is because more data means better AI and data is expensive to acquire especially personal data the most valuable kind This is in contrast to networking technologies whose benefits were shared fairly widely as the prices for components came down equally fast for everyone One other reason AI apps will be harder to debug than ordinary apps and we already see hard to debug applications leading to disenfranchisement and deterioration of living So I do not take as a given that AI will enrich most people s lives over the next 12 years Eileen Donahoe executive director of the Global Digital Policy Incubator at Stanford University commented While I do believe human machines collaboration will bring many benefits to society over time I fear that we will not have made enough progress by 2030 to ensure that benefits will be spread evenly or to protect against downside risks especially as they relate to bias discrimination and loss of accountability by that time David Bray executive director of People Centered Internet commented Hope Human machine AI collaborations extend our abilities of humans while we humans intentionally strive to preserve values of respect dignity and agency of choice for individuals Machines bring together different groups of people and communities and help us work and live together by reflecting on our own biases and helping us come to understand the plurality of different perspectives of others Big concern Human machine AI collaborations turn out to not benefit everyone only a few and result in a form of indentured servitude or neo feudalism that is not people centered and not uplifting of people Machines amplify existing confirmation biases and other human characteristics resulting in sensationalist emotion ridden news and other communications that gets page views and ad clicks yet lack nuance of understanding resulting in tribalism and a devolution of open societies and pluralities to the detriment of the global human condition Bernie Hogan senior research fellow at Oxford Internet Institute wrote The current political and economic climate suggests that existing technology especially machine learning will be used to create better decisions for those in power while creating an ever more tedious morass of bureaucracy for the rest We see little example of successful bottom up technology open source technology and hacktivism relative to the encroaching surveillance state and attention economy Dan Buehrer a retired professor of computer science formerly with the National Chung Cheng University in Taiwan warned Statistics will be replaced by individualized models thus allowing control of all individuals by totalitarian states and eventually by socially intelligent machines Nathalie Marechal doctoral candidate at the University of Southern California s Annenberg School for Communication who researches the intersection of internet policy and human rights said Absent rapid and decisive actions to rein in both government overreach and companies amoral quest for profit technological developments including AI will bring about the infrastructure for total social control threatening democracy and the right to individual self determination Katja Grace contributor to the AI Impacts research project and a research associate with the Machine Intelligence Research Institute said There is a substantial chance that AI will leave everyone worse off perhaps radically so The chance is less than 50 percent but the downside risk is so large that there could be an expectation the world might be worse for AI David A Banks an associate research analyst with the Social Science Research Council said AI will be very useful to a small professional class but will be used to monitor and control everyone else Luis German Rodriguez Leal teacher and researcher at the Universidad Central de Venezuela and consultant on technology for development said Humankind is not addressing properly the issue of educating people about possibilities and risks of human machine AI collaboration One can observe today the growing problems of ill intentioned manipulation of information and technological resources There are already plenty of examples about how decision making is biased using big data machine learning privacy violations and social networks just to mention a few elements and one can see that the common citizen is unaware of how much of his her will does not belong to him her This fact has a meaningful impact on our social political economic and private life We are not doing enough to attend to this issue and it is getting very late Llewellyn Kriel CEO of TopEditor International a media services company based in Johannesburg South Africa wrote Current developments do not augur well for the fair growth of AI Vast swaths of the population simply do not have the intellectual capacity or level of sophistication to understand 1 the technology itself and 2 the implications of its safe use This entrenches and widens the digital divide in places like Africa The socio political implications of this breed deep primitive superstition racial hatred toward whites and Asians who are seen as techno colonialists and the growth of kleptocracies amid the current mushrooming of corruption Steven Thompson an author specializing in illuminating emerging issues and editor of Androids Cyborgs and Robots in Contemporary Culture and Society wrote The keyword from the query is dependence I published pioneering quantitative research on internet addiction and dependency in 1996 and followed up 15 years later with a related updated research talk on the future of AI and internet dependency at a UNESCO sponsored conference on information literacy in Morocco My expertise is in ethical and technological issues related to moving the internet appliance into the human body The internet is moving into the human body and in that process societal statuses are altered privileging some while abandoning others in the name of emerging technologies and the global order is restructuring to the same effect Think of net neutrality issues gone wild corporately and humanly sustained with the privileges such creation and maintenance affords some members of society Now think of the liberty issues arising from those persons who are digital outcasts and wish to not be on the grid yet will be forced to do so by society and even government edicts Alan Mutter a longtime Silicon Valley CEO cable TV executive and now a teacher of media economics and entrepreneurism at the University of California Berkeley said The danger is that we will surrender thinking exploring and experimentation to tools that hew to the rules but can t color outside the lines Would you like computers to select the president or decide if you need hip surgery Dan Geer a respondent who provided no identifying details commented If you believe as do I that having a purpose to one s life is all that enables both pride and happiness then the question becomes whether AI will or will not diminish purpose For the irreligious AI will demolish purpose yet if AI is truly intelligent then AI will make serving it the masses purpose Ergo Cristobal Young an associate professor of sociology at Cornell University specializing in economic sociology and stratification commented I mostly base my response that tech will not leave most people better off than they are today on Twitter and other online media which were initially praised as liberation technology It is clear that the internet has devastated professional journalism filled the public sphere with trash that no one believes and degraded civil discourse This isn t about robots but rather about how humans use the internet Donald Trump himself says that without Twitter he could never have been elected and Twitter continues to be his platform for polarization insult and attacks on the institutions of accountability David J Krieger co director of the Institute for Communication Leadership in Lucerne Switzerland wrote The affordances of digital technologies bind people into information networks such that the network becomes the actor and intelligence as well as agency are qualities of the network as a whole and not any individual actors whether human or non human Networks will have access to much more information than do any present day actors and therefore be able to navigate complex environments e g self driving cars personal assistants smart cities Typically we will consult and cooperate with networks in all areas but the price will be that we have no such thing as privacy Privacy is indeed dead but in the place of personal privacy management there will be network publicy governance publicy is the opposite of privacy To ensure the use of these technologies for good instead of evil it will be necessary to dismantle and replace current divides between government and governed workers and capitalists as well as to establish a working global governance Wendy M Grossman author of net wars and technology blogger wrote 2030 is 12 years from now I believe human machine AI collaboration will be successful in many areas but that we will be seeing like we are now over Facebook and other social media serious questions about ownership and who benefits It seems likely that the limits of what machines can do will be somewhat clearer than they are now when we re awash in hype We will know by then for example how successful self driving cars are going to be and the problems inherent in handing off control from humans to machines in a variety of areas will also have become clearer The big fight is to keep people from relying on experimental systems and turning off the legacy ones too soon which is our current situation with the internet Karl M van Meter founding editor of the Bulletin of Sociological Methodology and author of Computational Social Science in the Age of Big Data said The well being of the world s population depends on governments making intelligent decisions based on AI or other means Moreover environmental change may well be the determining factor for future well being with or without intelligent decisions by world governments Andrew Whinston computer science professor and director of the Center for Research in Electronic Commerce at the University of Texas at Austin said There are several issues First security problems do not get the attention needed Secondly there may be use of the technology to control the population as we see developing in China AI methodology is focused on prediction at least so far so methods to improve health or general welfare are lacking Deep learning which is getting the big hype does not have a clear foundation That makes it scientifically weak An information administration manager responded We cede more and more decision making and policy making to self interested parties in the private sphere Our institutions are insufficiently nimble to keep up with the policy questions that arise and attempts to regulate new industries are subverted by corrupt money politics at both the federal and state levels An internet pioneer said Nothing in our current social economic or political structures points to a positive outcome There is no evidence that more AI will improve the lives of most people In fact the opposite is likely to be the case There will be more unemployment less privacy etc The following one liners from anonymous respondents also tie into human agency Other anonymous respondents commented Who decides what about people s code defined lives when where why and how Many of these respondents cited concerns that the future of AI will be shaped by those driven by profit motives and power thirst They note that many AI tools rely on individuals sharing of information preferences search strategies and data Human values and ethics are not necessarily baked into the systems making peoples decisions for them These experts worry that data based decision making can be prone to errors biases and false logic or mistaken assumptions And these experts argue that machine based decisions often favor efficiencies in the name of profit or power that are extremely unfavorable to individuals and the betterment of the human condition Michael Kleeman a senior fellow at the University of California San Diego and board member at the Institute for the Future wrote The utilization of AI will be disproportionate and biased toward those with more resources In general it will reduce autonomy and coupled with big data it will reduce privacy and increase social control There will be some areas where IA intelligence augmentation helps make things easier and safer but by and large it will be a global net negative A professor at a major U S university and expert in artificial intelligence as applied to social computing said As AI systems take in more data and make bigger decisions people will be increasingly subject to their unaccountable decisions and non auditable surveillance practices The trends around democratic governance of AI are not encouraging The big players are U S based and the U S is in an anti regulation stance that seems fairly durable Therefore I expect AI technologies to evolve in ways that benefit corporate interests with little possibility of meaningful public response Justin Reich executive director of MIT Teaching Systems Lab and research scientist in the MIT Office of Digital Learning responded Systems for human AI collaborations will be built by powerful affluent people to solve the problems of powerful affluent people In the hands of autocratic leaders AI will become a powerful tool of surveillance and control In capitalist economies human AI collaboration will be deployed to find new powerful ways of surveilling and controlling workers for the benefit of more affluent consumers Seth Finkelstein consulting programmer at Finkelstein Consulting and EFF Pioneer Award winner commented AI depends on algorithms and data Who gets to code the algorithms and to challenge the results Is the data owned as private property and who can change it As a very simple example let s take the topic of algorithmic recommendations for articles to read Do they get tuned to produce suggestions which lead to more informative material which granted is a relatively difficult task and fraught with delicate determinations Or are they optimized for ATTENTION CLICKS OUTRAGE To be sure the latter is cheap and easy and though it has its own share of political problems they re often more amenable to corporate management i e what s accurate vs what s unacceptable There s a whole structure of incentives that will push toward one outcome or the other Douglas Rushkoff professor of media at City University of New York responded The main reason I believe AI s impact will be mostly negative is that we will be applying it mostly toward the needs of the market rather than the needs of human beings So while AI might get increasingly good at extracting value from people or manipulating people s behavior toward more consumption and compliance much less attention will likely be given to how AI can actually create value for people Even the most beneficial AI is still being measured in terms of its ability to provide utility value or increase in efficiency fine values sure but not the only ones that matter to quality of life Annalie Killian futurist and vice president for strategic partnerships at Sparks Honey wrote More technology does not make us more human we have evidence for that now within 10 years of combining the smartphone device with persuasive and addictive designs that shape and hijack behavior Technologists who are using emotional analytics image modification technologies and other hacks of our senses are destroying the fragile fabric of trust and truth that is holding our society together at a rate much faster than we are adapting and compensating let alone comprehending what is happening The sophisticated tech is affordable and investible in the hands of very few people who are enriching themselves and growing their power exponentially and these actors are NOT acting in the best interest of all people Collin Baker senior AI researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California Berkeley commented I fear that advances in AI will be turned largely to the service of nation states and mega corporations rather than be used for truly constructive purposes The positive potential particularly in education and health care is enormous but people will have to fight to make it come about I hope that AI will get much better at understanding Gricean maxims for cooperative discourse and at understanding people s beliefs intentions and plans Brian Harvey lecturer on the social implications of computer technology at the University of California Berkeley said The question makes incorrect presuppositions encapsulated in the word we There is no we there are the owners and the workers The owners the 0 1 will be better off because of AI The workers bottom 95 will be worse off as long as there are owners to own the AI same as for any piece of technology One of the world s foremost social scientists studying human technology interactions said My chief fear is face recognition used for social control Even Microsoft has begged for government regulation Surveillance of all kinds is the future for AI It is not benign if not controlled Devin Fidler futurist and founder of Rethinkery Labs commented If earlier industrialization is any guide we may be moving into a period of intensified creative destruction as AI technologies become powerful enough to overturn the established institutions and the ordering systems of modern societies If the holes punched in macro scale organizational systems are not explicitly addressed and repaired there will be increased pressures on everyday people as they face not only the problems of navigating an unfamiliar new technology landscape themselves but also the systemic failure of institutions they rely on that have failed to adapt An anonymous respondent said My fear is that technology will further separate us from what makes us human and sensitive to others My hope is that technology would be used to improve the quality of living not supplant it Much of the AI innovation is simply clogging our senses stealing our time increasing the channels and invasion of adverts This has destroyed our phones filled our mailboxes and crowded our email No product is worth that level of incursion Paola Perez vice president of the Internet Society s Venezuela chapter and chair of the LACNIC Public Policy Forum responded Humans will be better with AI Many problems will be solved but many jobs are going to disappear and there may be more poor people as a result Will we see life extension Maybe and maybe not because our dependence on technology may also be destructive to our health Eliot Lear principal engineer at Cisco Systems predicted AI and tech will not leave most people better off than they are today As always technology outpaces our ability to understand its ramifications so as to properly govern its use I have no reason to believe that we will have caught up by 2030 Olivia Coombe a respondent who provided no identifying details wrote Children learn from their parents As AI systems become more complex and are given increasingly important roles in the functioning of day to day life we should ask ourselves what are we teaching our artificial digital children If we conceive and raise them in a world of individual self interest will they just strengthen these existing and often oppressive systems of capitalist competition Or could they go their own way aspiring to a life of entrepreneurship to collaboration Worse yet will they see the reverence we hold for empires and seek to build their own through conquest Peter Asaro a professor at The New School and philosopher of science technology and media who examines artificial intelligence and robotics commented AI will produce many advantages for many people but it will also exacerbate many forms of inequality in society It is likely to benefit a small group who design and control the technology greatly benefit a fairly larger group of the already well off in many ways but also potentially harm them in other ways and for the vast majority of people in the world it will offer few visible benefits and be perceived primarily as a tool of the wealthy and powerful to enhance their wealth and power Mark Deuze a professor of media studies at the University of Amsterdam wrote With the advances in AI and tech the public debate grows over their impact It is this debate that will contribute to the ethical and moral dimensions of AI hopefully inspiring a society wide discussion on what we want from tech and how we will take responsibility for that desire Rob Frieden professor and Pioneers Chair in Telecommunications and Law at Penn State University said Any intelligent system depends on the code written to support it If the code is flawed the end product reflects those flaws An old school acronym spells this out GIGO Garbage In Garbage Out I have little confidence that AI can incorporate any and every real world scenario even with likely developments in machine learning As AI expands in scope and reach defects will have ever increasing impacts largely on the negative side of the ledger Anthony Judge author futurist editor of the Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential and former head of the Union of International Associations said AI will offer greater possibilities My sense is that it will empower many most probably 1 to 30 and will disempower many if not 99 Especially problematic will be the level of complexity created for the less competent notably the elderly as is evident with taxation and banking systems issues to which sysadmins are indifferent For some it will be a boon proactive companions whether for quality dialogue or sex Sysadmins will build in unfortunate biases Missing will be the enabling of interdisciplinarity as has long been possible but carefully designed out for the most dubious divide and rule reasons Blinkered approaches and blind spots will set the scene for unexpected disasters currently deniably incomprehensible Black Swan effect Advantages for governance will be questionable Better oversight will be dubiously enabled Stephanie Perrin president of Digital Discretion a data privacy consulting firm wrote There is a likelihood that given the human tendency to identify risk when looking at the unknown future AI will be used to attempt to predict risk In other words more and deeper surveillance will be used to determine who is a good citizen purchaser employee student etc and who is bad This will find itself into public space surveillance systems employee vetting systems note the current court case where LinkedIn is suing data scrapers who offer to predict flight risk employees and all kinds of home management systems and intelligent cars While this might possibly introduce a measure of safety in some applications the impact of fear that comes with unconscious awareness of surveillance will have a severe impact on creativity and innovation We need that creativity as we address massive problems in climate change and reversing environmental impacts so I tend to be pessimistic about outcomes Alistair Knott an associate professor specializing in cognitive science and AI at the University of Otago in Dunedin New Zealand wrote AI has the potential for both positive and negative impacts on society Negative impacts are rooted in the current dominance of transnational companies and tech companies in particular in global politics These companies are likely to appropriate the majority of advances in AI technology and they are unlikely to spread the benefit of these advances throughout society We are currently witnessing an extraordinary concentration of wealth in the hands of a tiny proportion of the world s population This is largely due to the mainstreaming of neoliberalism in the world s dominant economies but it is intensified by the massive success of tech companies which achieve huge profits with relatively small workforces The advance of AI technologies is just going to continue this trend unless quite draconian political changes are effected that bring transnational companies under proper democratic control Richard Forno of the Center for Cybersecurity at the University of Maryland Baltimore County wrote AI is only as smart and efficient as its human creators can make it If AI in things like Facebook algorithms is causing this much trouble now what does the future hold The problem is less AI s evolution and more about how humankind develops and uses it that is where the real crisis in AI will turn out Sam Punnett research and strategy officer at TableRock Media wrote The preponderance of AI controlled systems are designed to take collected data and enable control advantage Most of the organizations with the resources to develop these systems do so to enable advantages in commercial financial transactions manufacturing efficiency and surveillance Self regulation by industry has already been shown to fail e g social media platforms and Wall Street Government agencies are lagging in their will and understanding of the implications of the technology to effectively implement guidelines to curtail the impacts of unforeseen circumstances As such government participation will be reactive to the changes that the technology will bring My greatest fear is a reliance on faulty algorithms that absolve responsibility while failing to account for exceptions Luis Pereira associate professor of electronics and nanotechnologies Universidade NOVA de Lisboa Portugal responded I fear that more control and influence will be exerted on people such as has started in China There will be a greater wealth gap benefits will not spread to all and a caste system will develop unless a new social compact is put in place which is unlikely Widespread revolt is plausible Stavros Tripakis an associate professor of computer science at Aalto University in Finland and adjunct professor at the University of California Berkeley wrote 1984 George Orwell police state A principal architect for a top five technology company commented AI will enable vicious regimes to track citizens at all times Mistaken identifications will put innocent people in jail and even execute them with no hope of appeal In general AI will only have a positive contribution in truly democratic states which are dwindling in number John Sniadowski a director for a technology company wrote As technology is currently instantiated it simply concentrates power into a smaller number of international corporations That needs fixing for everyone to gain the best from AI David Brake senior lecturer in communications at the University of Bedfordshire UK said Like many colleagues I fear that AI will be framed as neutral and objective and thereby used as cover to make decisions that would be considered unfair if made by a human If we do not act to properly regulate the use of AI we will not be able to interrogate the ways that AI decision making is constructed or audit them to ensure their decisions are indeed fair Decisions may also be made even more than today based on a vast array of collected data and if we are not careful we will be unable to control the flows of information about us used to make those decisions or to correct misunderstandings or errors which can follow us around indefinitely Imagine being subject to repeated document checks as you travel around the country because you know a number of people who are undocumented immigrants and your movements therefore fit the profile of an illegal immigrant And you are not sure whether to protest because you don t know whether such protests could encourage an algorithm to put you into a suspicious category which could get you harassed even more often A longtime veteran of a pioneering internet company commented Profit motive and AI at scale nearly guarantee suffering for most people It should be spiffy for the special people with wealth and power though Watching how machines are created to ensure addiction to deliver ads is a reminder that profit driven exploitation always comes first The push for driverless cars too is a push for increased profits Joshua Loftus assistant professor of information operations and management sciences at New York University and co author of Counterfactual Fairness in Machine Learning commented How have new technologies shaped our lives in the past It depends on the law market structure and who wields political power In the present era of extreme inequality and climate catastrophe I expect technologies to be used by employers to make individual workers more isolated and contingent by apps to make users more addicted on a second by second basis and by governments for surveillance and increasingly strict border control Eugene H Spafford internet pioneer and founder and executive director emeritus of the Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security commented Without active controls and limits the primary adopters of AI systems will be governments and large corporations Their use of it will be to dominate control people and this will not make our lives better Michael Muller a researcher in the AI interactions group for a global technology solutions provider said it will leave some people better off and others not writing For the wealthy and empowered AI will help them with their daily lives and it will probably help them to increase their wealth and power For the rest of us I anticipate that AI will help the wealthy and empowered people to surveil us to manipulate us and in some cases to control us or even imprison us For those of us who do not have the skills to jump to the AI related jobs I think we will find employment scarce and without protections In my view AI will be a mixed and intersectional blessing at best Estee Beck assistant professor at the University of Texas at Arlington and author of A Theory of Persuasive Computer Algorithms for Rhetorical Code Studies responded Tech design and policy affects our privacy in the United States so much so that most people do not think about the tracking of movements behaviors and attitudes from smartphones social media search engines ISPs internet service providers and even Internet of Things enabled devices Until tech designers and engineers build privacy into each design and policy decision for consumers any advances with human machine AI collaboration will leave consumers with less security and privacy Michael H Goldhaber an author consultant and theoretical physicist who wrote early explorations on the digital attention economy said For those without internet connection now its expansion will probably be positive overall For the rest we will see an increasing arms race between uses of control destructive anarchism racism etc and ad hoc from below efforts at promoting social and environmental good Organizations and states will seek more control to block internal or external attacks of many sorts The combined struggles will take up an increasing proportion of the world s attention efforts and so forth I doubt that any very viable and democratic egalitarian order will emerge over the next dozen years and even in a larger time frame good outcomes are far from guaranteed Dave Burstein editor and publisher at Fast Net News said There s far too much second rate AI that is making bad decisions based on inadequate statistical understanding For example a parole or sentencing AI probably would find a correlation between growing up in a single parent household and likelihood of committing another crime Confounding variables like the poverty of so many single mothers need to be understood and dealt with I believe it s wrong for someone to be sent to jail longer because their father left That kind of problem confounding variables and the inadequacy of preponderant data is nearly ubiquitous in AI in practice Ian Peter pioneer internet activist and internet rights advocate said Personal data accumulation is reaching a point where privacy and freedom from unwarranted surveillance are disappearing In addition the algorithms that control usage of such data are becoming more and more complex leading to inevitable distortions Henry Kissinger may have not been far off the mark when he described artificial intelligence as leading to The End of the Age of Enlightenment Michael Zimmer associate professor and privacy and information ethics scholar at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee commented I am increasingly concerned that AI driven decision making will perpetuate existing societal biases and injustices while obscuring these harms under the false belief such systems are neutral Martin Shelton a professional technologist commented There are many kinds of artificial intelligence some kinds reliant on preset rules to appear smart and some which respond to changing conditions in the world But because AI can be used anywhere we can recognize patterns the potential uses for artificial intelligence are pretty huge The question is how will it be used While these tools will become cheaper and more widespread we can expect that like smartphones or web connectivity their uses will be primarily driven by commercial interests We re beginning to see the early signs of AI failing to make smart predictions in larger institutional contexts If Amazon fails to correctly suggest the right product in the future everything is fine You bought a backpack once and now Amazon thinks you want more backpacks forever It ll be okay But sometimes these decisions have enormous stakes ProPublica documented how automated risk assessment software used in U S courtroom sentencing procedures is only slightly more accurate at predicting recidivism than the flip of a coin Likewise hospitals using IBM Watson to make predictions about cancer treatments find the software often gives advice that humans would not To mitigate harm in high stakes situations we must critically interrogate how our assumptions about our data and the rules that we use to create our AI promote harm Nigel Hickson an expert on technology policy development for ICANN based in Brussels responded I am optimistic that AI will evolve in a way that benefits society by improving processes and giving people more control over what they do This will only happen though if the technologies are deployed in a way in which benefits all My fear is that in non democratic countries AI will lessen freedom choice and hope Vian Bakir a professor of political communication and journalism at Bangor University responded I am pessimistic about the future in this scenario because of what has happened to date with AI and data surveillance For instance the recent furor over fake news disinformation and the use of complex data analytics in the U K s 2016 Brexit referendum and in the U S 2016 presidential election To understand influence and micro target people in order to try get them to vote a certain way is deeply undemocratic It shows that current political actors will exploit technology for personal political gains irrespective of wider social norms and electoral rules There is no evidence that current bad practices would not be replicated in the future especially as each new wave of technological progress outstrips regulators ability to keep up and people s ability to comprehend what is happening to them and their data Furthermore and related the capabilities of mass dataveillance in private and public spaces is ever expanding and their uptake in states with weak civil society organs and minimal privacy regulation is troubling In short dominant global technology platforms show no signs of sacrificing their business models that depend on hoovering up ever more quantities of data on people s lives then hyper targeting them with commercial messages and across the world political actors and state security and intelligence agencies then also make use of such data acquisitions frequently circumventing privacy safeguards or legal constraints Tom Slee senior product manager at SAP SE and author of What s Yours is Mine Against the Sharing Economy wrote Many aspects of life will be made easier and more efficient by AI But moving a decision such as health care or workplace performance to AI turns it into a data driven decision driven by optimization of some function which in turn demands more data Adopting AI driven insurance ratings for example demands more and more lifestyle data from the insured if it is to produce accurate overall ratings Optimized data driven decisions about our lives unavoidably require surveillance and once our lifestyle choices become input for such decisions we lose individual autonomy In some cases we can ignore this data collection but we are in the early days of AI driven decisions By 2030 I fear the loss will be much greater I do hope I am wrong Timothy Graham a postdoctoral research fellow in sociology and computer science at Australian National University commented There is already an explosion of research into fairness and representation in ML and conferences such as Fairness Accountability and Transparency in Machine Learning as it is difficult to engineer systems that do not simply reproduce existing social inequality disadvantage and prejudice Deploying such systems uncritically will only result in an aggregately worse situation for many individuals whilst a comparatively small number benefit A senior researcher and programmer for a major global think tank commented I expect AI to be embedded in systems tools etc to make them more useful However I am concerned that AI s role in decision making will lead to more brittle processes where exceptions are more difficult than today this is not a good thing Jenni Mechem a respondent who provided no identifying details said My two primary reasons for saying that advances in AI will not benefit most people by 2030 are first there will continue to be tremendous inequities in who benefits from these advances and second if the development of AI is controlled by for profit entities there will be tremendous hidden costs and people will yield control over vast areas of their lives without realizing it The examples of Facebook as a faux community commons bent on extracting data from its users and of pervasive internet censoring in China should teach us that neither for profit corporations nor government can be trusted to guide technology in a manner that truly benefits everyone Democratic governments that enforce intelligent regulations as the European Union has done on privacy may offer the best hope Suso Baleato a fellow at Harvard University s Institute of Quantitative Social Science and liaison for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD s Committee on Digital Economy Policy commented The intellectual property framework impedes the necessary accountability of the underlying algorithms and the lack of efficient redistributive economic policies will continue amplifying the bias of the datasets Sasha Costanza Chock associate professor of civic media at MIT said Unfortunately it is most likely that AI will be deployed in ways that deepen existing structural inequality along lines of race class gender ability and so on A small portion of humanity will benefit greatly from AI while the vast majority will experience AI through constraints on life chances Although it s possible for us to design AI systems to advance social justice our current trajectory will reinforce historic and structural inequality Dalsie Green Baniala CEO and regulator of the Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulator of Vanuatu wrote Often machine decisions do not produce an accurate result they do not meet expectations or specific needs For example applications are usually invented to target the developed world market They may not work appropriately for countries like ours small islands separated by big waters Michiel Leenaars director of strategy at NLnet Foundation and director of the Internet Society s Netherlands chapter responded Achieving trust is not the real issue achieving trustworthiness and real empowerment of the individual is As the technology that to a large extent determines the informational self disappears or in practical terms is placed out of local control going underground under the perfect pretext of needing networked AI the balance between societal well being and human potential on the one hand and corporate ethics and opportunistic business decisions on the other stands to be disrupted Following the typical winner takes all scenario the internet is known to produce I expect that different realms of the internet will become even less transparent and more manipulative For the vast majority of people especially in non democracies there already is little real choice but to move and push along with the masses Mike O Connor a retired technologist who worked at ICANN and on national broadband issues commented I m feeling internet pioneer regret about the Internet of S that is emerging from the work we ve done over the last few decades I actively work to reduce my dependence on internet connected devices and the amount of data that is collected about me and my family I will most certainly work equally hard to avoid human AI devices connections I earnestly hope that I m resoundingly proven wrong in this view when 2030 arrives Luke Stark a fellow in the department of sociology at Dartmouth College and at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society wrote AI technologies run the risk of providing a comprehensive infrastructure for corporate and state surveillance more granular and all encompassing than any previous such regime in human history Zoetanya Sujon a senior lecturer specializing in digital culture at the University of the Arts London commented Like the history of so many technologies show us AI will not be the magic solution to the world s problems or to symbolic and economic inequalities Instead AI is most benefitting those with the most power Larry Lannom internet pioneer and vice president at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives CNRI said I am hopeful that networked human machine interaction will improve the general quality of life My fear Will all of the benefits of more powerful artificial intelligence benefit the human race as a whole or simply the thin layer at the top of the social hierarchy that owns the new advanced technologies A professor and researcher in AI based in Europe noted Using technological AI based capabilities will give people the impression that they have more power and autonomy However those capabilities will be available in contexts already framed by powerful companies and states No real freedom For the good and for the bad An anonymous respondent said In the area of health care alone there will be tremendous benefits for those who can afford medicine employing AI But at the same time there is an enormous potential for widening inequality and for abuse We can see the tip of this iceberg now with health insurance companies today scooping up readily available poorly protected third party data that will be used to discriminate A senior data analyst and systems specialist expert in complex networks responded Artificial intelligence software will implement the priorities of the entities that funded development of the software In some cases this will be a generic service sold to the general public much as we now have route planning software in GPS units and this will provide a definite benefit to consumers In other cases software will operate to the benefit of a large company but to the detriment of consumers for example calculating a price for a product that will be the highest that a given customer is prepared to pay In yet a third category software will provide effective decision making in areas ranging from medicine to engineering but will do so at the cost of putting human beings out of work A distinguished engineer at one of the world s largest computing hardware companies commented Tech will continue to be integrated into our lives in a seamless way My biggest concern is responsible gathering of information and its use Information can be abused in many ways as we are seeing today A digital rights activist commented AI is already through racial recognition in particular technologically laundering longstanding and pervasive bias in the context of police surveillance Without algorithmic transparency and transparency into training data AIs can be bent to any purpose The following one liners from anonymous respondents also tie into this theme Other anonymous respondents commented One of the chief fears about today s technological change is the possibility that autonomous hardware and software systems will cause millions of people globally to lose their jobs and as a result their means for affording life s necessities and participating in society Many of these experts say new jobs will emerge along with the growth of AI just as they have historically during nearly every human transition to new tools Brad Templeton chair for computing at Singularity University said While obviously there will be good and bad the broad history of automation technologies is positive even when it comes to jobs There is more employment today than ever in history Ben Shneiderman distinguished professor and founder of the Human Computer Interaction Lab at the University of Maryland said Automation is largely a positive force which increases productivity lowers costs and raises living standards Automation expands the demand for services thereby raising employment which is what has happened at Amazon and FedEx My position is contrary to those who believe that robots and artificial intelligence will lead to widespread unemployment Over time I think AI machine learning strategies will become merely tools embedded in ever more complex technologies for which human control and responsibility will become clearer Robert D Atkinson president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation wrote about how advances in AI are essential to expanded job opportunities The developed world faces an unprecedented productivity slowdown that promises to limit advances in living standards AI has the potential to play an important role in boosting productivity and living standards Toby Walsh a professor of AI at the University of New South Wales in Australia and president of the AI Access Foundation said I m pessimistic in short term we re seeing already technologies like AI being used to make life worse for many but I m optimistic in long term that we ll work out how to get machines to do the dirty dull dangerous and difficult and leave us free to focus on all the more important and human parts of our lives Yet many others disagree Some fear the collapse of the middle class and social and economic upheaval if most of the world s economic power is held by a handful of technology behemoths that are reaping the great share of financial rewards in the digital age while employing far fewer people than the leading companies of the industrial age A fairly large share of these experts warn that if steps are not taken now to adjust to this potential future that AI s radical reduction in human work will be devastating David Cake an leader with Electronic Frontiers Australia and vice chair of the ICANN Generic Names Supporting Organization Council wrote The greatest fear is that the social disruption due to changing employment patterns will be handled poorly and lead to widespread social issues Jerry Michalski founder of the Relationship Economy eXpedition said We re far from tipping into a better social contract In a more just world AI could bring about utopias However many forces are shoving us in the opposite direction 1 Businesses are doing all they can to eliminate full time employees who get sick and cranky need retirement accounts and raises while software gets better and cheaper The precariat will grow 2 Software is like a flesh eating bacterium Tasks it eats vanish from the employment landscape Unlike previous technological jumps this one unemploys people more quickly than we can retrain and reemploy them 3 Our safety net is terrible and our beliefs about human motivations suck 4 Consumerism still drives desires and expectations James Hendler professor of computer web and cognitive sciences and director of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for Data Exploration and Application wrote I believe 2030 will be a point in the middle of a turbulent time when AI is improving services for many people but it will also be a time of great change in society based on changes in work patterns that are caused to a great degree by AI On the one hand for example doctors will have access to information that is currently hard for them to retrieve rapidly resulting in better medical care for those who have coverage and indeed in some countries the first point of contact in a medical situation may be an AI which will help with early diagnoses prescriptions On the other hand over the course of a couple of generations starting in the not too distant future we will see major shifts in work force with not just blue collar jobs but also many white collar jobs lost Many of these will not be people replaced by AIs but rather the result of a smaller number of people being able to accomplish the same amount of work for example in professions such as law clerks physicians assistants and many other currently skilled positions we would project a need for less people even as demand grows Betsy Williams a researcher at the Center for Digital Society and Data Studies at the University of Arizona wrote AI s benefits will be unequally distributed across society Few will reap meaningful benefits Large entities will use AI to deliver marginal improvements in service to their clients at the cost of requiring more data and risking errors Employment trends from computerization will continue AI will threaten medium skill jobs Instead of relying on human expertise and context knowledge many tasks will be handled directly by clients using AI interfaces or by lower skilled people in service jobs boosted by AI AI will harm some consumers For instance rich consumers will benefit from self driving cars while others must pay to retrofit existing cars to become more visible to the AI Through legal maneuvering self driving car companies will avoid many insurance costs and risks shifting them to human drivers pedestrians and bicyclists In education creating high quality automated instruction requires expertise and money Research on American K 12 classrooms suggests that typical computer aided instruction yields better test scores than instruction by the worst teachers By 2030 most AI used in education will be of middling quality for some their best alternative The children of the rich and powerful will not have AI used on them at school instead they will be taught to use it For AI to significantly benefit the majority it must be deployed in emergency health care where quicker lab work reviews of medical histories or potential diagnoses can save lives or in aid work say to coordinate shipping of expiring food or medicines from donors to recipients in need Nathaniel Borenstein chief scientist at Mimecast wrote Social analyses of IT information technology trends have consistently wildly exaggerated the human benefits of that technology and underestimated the negative effects I foresee a world in which IT and so called AI produce an ever increasing set of minor benefits while simultaneously eroding human agency and privacy and supporting authoritarian forms of governance I also see the potential for a much worse outcome in which the productivity gains produced by technology accrue almost entirely to a few widening the gap between the rich and poor while failing to address the social ills related to privacy But if we can find a way to ensure that these benefits are shared equally among the population it might yet prove to be the case that the overall effect of the technology is beneficial to humanity This will only happen however if we manage to limit the role of the rich in determining how the fruits of increased productivity will be allocated Andrea Romaoli Garcia an international lawyer active in internet governance discussions commented AI will improve the way people make decisions in all industries because it allows instant access to a multitude of information People will require training for this future educational and technological development This is a very high level of human development that poor countries don t have access to Without proper education and policies they will not have access to wealth The result may be a multitude of hungry and desperate people This may be motivation for wars or invasion of borders Future human machine interaction AI will only be positive if richer countries develop policies to help poorer countries to develop and gain access to work and wealth Josh Calder a partner at the Foresight Alliance commented The biggest danger is that workers are displaced on a mass scale especially in emerging markets Jeff Johnson computer science professor at the University of San Francisco previously with Xerox HP Labs and Sun Microsystems responded I believe advances in AI will leave many more people without jobs which will increase the socioeconomic differences in society but other factors could help mitigate this e g adoption of guaranteed income Alan Bundy a professor of automated reasoning at the University of Edinburgh wrote Unskilled people will suffer because there will be little employment for them This may create disruption to society some of which we have already seen with Trump Brexit etc Peter Levine associate dean for research and professor of citizenship and public affairs in Tufts University s Tisch College of Civic Life wrote Being a fully fledged citizen has traditionally depended on work I m worried that rising levels of non employment will detract from civic engagement Also AI is politically powerful and empowers the people and governments that own it Thus it may increase inequality and enhance authoritarianism Hassaan Idrees an electrical engineer and Fulbright Scholar active in creating energy systems for global good commented I believe human machine interaction will be more of a utility and less fanciful as science fiction puts it People will not need to see their physicians in person their automated doctors making this irrelevant Similarly routine workplace activities like data processing and financial number crunching would be performed by AI Humans with higher levels of intellect can survive this age and those on the lower ends of spectrum of mental acumen would be rendered unnecessary Ethem Alpaydin a professor of computer engineering at Bogazici University in Istanbul responded As with other technologies I imagine AI will favor the developed countries that actually develop these technologies For the developing countries however whose labor force is mostly unskilled and whose exports are largely low tech AI implies higher unemployment lower income and more social unrest The aim of AI in such countries should be to add skill to the labor force rather than supplant them Sam Ladner a former UX researcher for Amazon and Microsoft now an adjunct professor at Ontario College of Art and Design wrote Technology is not a neutral tool but one that has our existing challenges imprinted onto it Inequality is high and growing Too many companies deny their employees a chance to work with dignity whether it be through providing them meaningful things to do or with the basic means to live AI will be placed on top of that existing structure Those who already have dignified work with a basic income will see that enhanced those who are routinely infantilized or denied basic rights will see that amplified Some may slip into that latter category because their work is more easily replaced by AI and machine learning Jonathan Swerdloff consultant and data systems specialist for Driven Inc wrote The more reliant on AI we become the more we are at the mercy of its developers While AI has the ability to augment professionals and to make decisions I have three concerns which make me believe it will not leave us better off by 2030 This does not address fears that anything run via AI could be hacked and changed by bad faith third parties 1 Until any sort of self policed AI sentience is achieved it will suffer from a significant GIGO garbage in garbage out problem As AI as currently conceived only knows what it is taught the seed sets for teaching must be thought out in detail before the tools are deployed Based on the experience with Microsoft s Tay and some responses I ve heard from the Sophia robot I am concerned that AI will magnify humanities flaws 2 Disparate access Unless the cost for developing AI drops precipitously and it may since one AI tool could be leveraged into building further less expensive AI tools access to whatever advantages the tools will bring will likely be clustered among a few beneficiaries I view this akin to high frequency trading on Wall Street Those who can do Those who can t lose 3 Tool of control If AI is deployed to make civic or corporate decisions those who control the algorithms control everything In the U S we ve recently seen Immigration and Customs Enforcement change its bond algorithm to always detain in every case Stuart A Umpleby a professor and director of the research program in social and organizational learning at George Washington University wrote People who use AI and the internet will have their lives enhanced by these technologies People who do not use them will be increasingly disconnected from opportunities As the digital world becomes more complicated and remote from real world experiences the need will grow for people and software to make connections There will be a need for methods to distinguish the real world from the scam world Simeon Yates director of the Centre for Digital Humanities and Social Science at the University of Liverpool said AI will simply increase existing inequalities it like the internet will fail in its emancipatory promise Panagiotis T Metaxas author of Technology Propaganda and the Limits of Human Intellect and professor of computer science at Wellesley College responded There will be a lot of wealth that AI supported devices will be producing The new technologies will make it easier and cheaper to produce food and entertainment massively bread and circus This wealth will not be distributed evenly increasing the financial gap between the top small percentage of people and the rest Even though this wealth will not be distributed evenly the relatively small share given to the vast majority of people will be enough to improve their 2018 condition In this respect the majority of people will be better off than they are today They may not feel better off if they were aware of the inequalities compared to the top beneficiaries but they will not be aware of them due to controlled propaganda Unfortunately there will not be much they could do about the increased inequalities Technologies of police enforcement by robots and lack of private communication will make it impossible for them to organize complain or push for change They will not be valued as workers citizens or soldiers The desire for democracy as we know it today will be coming to an end Many will feel depressed but medical products will make it easy for them to increase pleasure and decrease pain Grace Mutung u co leader of the Kenya ICT Action Network responded New technologies will more likely increase current inequalities unless there is a shift in world economics From the experience of the UN work on Millennium Development Goals while there has been improvement with the quality of life generally low and middle income countries still suffer disparate inequalities This will likely lead to governance problems In any case governments in these countries are investing heavily in surveillance which will likely have more negative effects on society Danny Gillane a netizen from Lafayette Louisiana commented Technology promises so much but delivers so little Facebook gave us the ability to stay in touch with everyone but sacrificed its integrity and our personal information in pursuit of the dollar The promise that our medical records would be digitized and more easily shared and drive costs down still has not materialized on a global scale The chief drivers of AI innovation and application will be for profit companies who have shown that their altruism only extends to their bottom lines Like most innovations I expect AI to leave our poor even poorer and our rich even richer increasing the numbers of the former while consolidating power and wealth in an ever shrinking group of currently rich people A professional working on the setting of web standards wrote Looking ahead 12 years from now I expect that AI will be enhancing the quality of life for some parts of some populations and in some situations while worsening the quality of life for others AI will still be uneven in quality and unevenly available throughout different parts of society Privacy and security protections will be inadequate data bias will still be common many technologies and response patterns will be normed to the needs of the common denominator user and misidentify or misinterpret interactions with people with disabilities or if appropriately identifying their disability will expose that information without user consent or control So many people included comments and concerns about the future of jobs for humans in their wide ranging responses to this canvassing that a later section of this report has more expert opinions on this topic The following one liners from anonymous respondents also tie into AI and jobs Other anonymous respondents commented While these experts expect AI to augment humans in many positive ways some are concerned that a deepening dependence upon machine intelligence networks will diminish crucial human capabilities Some maintain there has already been an erosion of people s abilities to think for themselves to take action independent of automated systems and to interact effectively face to face with others Charles Ess an expert in ethics and professor with the department of media and communication at the University of Oslo said It seems quite clear that evolving AI systems will bring about an extraordinary array of options making our lives more convenient But convenience almost always comes at the cost of deskilling of our offloading various cognitive practices and virtues to the machines and thereby our becoming less and less capable of exercising our own agency autonomy and most especially our judgment phronesis In particular empathy and loving itself are virtues that are difficult to acquire and enhance My worst fears are not only severe degradation perhaps more or less loss of such capacities and worst of all our forgetting they even existed in the first place along with the worlds they have made possible for us over most of our evolutionary and social history Daniel Siewiorek a professor with the Human Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University predicted The downside isolating people decreasing diversity a loss of situational awareness witness GPS directional systems and losing the receipt of how to do things In the latter case as we layer new capabilities on older technologies if we forget how the older technology works we cannot fix it and layered systems may collapse thrusting us back into a more primitive time Marilyn Cade longtime global internet policy consultant responded Technology often reflects the ethics of its creators but more significantly those who commercialize it Most individuals focus on how they personally use technology They do not spend time or even have the skills expertise to make judgments about the attributes of the way that technology is applied We must introduce and maintain a focus on critical thinking for our children youth so that they are capable of understanding the implications of a different fully digitized world I love the fact that my typos are autocorrected but I know how to spell all the words I know how to construct a logical argument If we don t teach critical thinking at all points in education we will have a 2030 world where the elites scientists make decisions that are not even apparent to the average person on the street neighborhood Garland McCoy founder and chief development officer of the Technology Education Institute wrote I am an optimist at heart and so believe that given a decade plus the horror that is unfolding before our eyes will somehow be understood and resolved That said if the suicide epidemic we are witnessing continues to build and women continue to opt out of motherhood all bets are off I do think technology is at the core of both the pathology and choice Aneesh Aneesh professor at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee said Socially AI systems will automate tasks that currently require human negotiation and interaction Unless people feel the pressure institutionally or otherwise to interact with each other they more often than not choose not to interact The lack of physical embodied interaction is almost guaranteed to result in social loneliness and anomie and associated problems such as suicide a phenomenon already are on the rise in the United States Ebenezer Baldwin Bowles author editor and journalist responded If one values community and the primacy of face to face eye to eye communication then human machine AI collaboration in 2030 will have succeeded in greatly diminishing the visceral primal aspects of humanity Every expression of daily life either civil or professional or familial or personal will be diminished by the iron grip of AI on the fundamental realities of interpersonal communications Already the reliance on voice to text technology via smartphone interface diminishes the ability of people to write with skill and cogency Taking the time to ring up another and chat requires too much psychic energy so we speak to one another in text box fragments written down and oft altered by digital assistants The dismissive but socially acceptable TL DR becomes commonplace as our collective attention span disintegrates Yes diagnostic medicine and assembly line production and expanded educational curriculum will surely be enhanced by cyber based one and zero technologies but at what cost to humanity Is it truly easier and safer to look into a screen and listen to an electronically delivered voice far away on the other side of an unfathomable digital divide instead of looking into another s eyes perhaps into a soul and speaking kind words to one another and perhaps singing in unison about the wonders of the universe We call it artificial intelligence for good reason A principal design researcher at one of the world s largest technology companies commented Although I have long worked in this area and been an optimist I now fear that the goal of most AI and UX is geared toward pushing people to interact more with devices and less with other people As a social species that is built to live in communities reductions in social interaction will lead to erosion of community and rise in stress and depression over time Although AI has the potential to improve lives as well those advances will come more slowly than proponents think due to the complexity brake Paul Allen wrote about among other things There have been AI summers and AI winters This is not an endless summer A chief operating officer wrote No doubt in my mind AI is and will continue to present benefits in simplifying and aiding human activities however the net effect is not likely to leave people better off The advances in AI enabled tools are likely to expand the digital gap in human competencies This growing gap will decrease the capacity of sizable portions of the population to survive an outage of the technology This raises humanitarian and national security concerns Dalsie Green Baniala CEO and regulator of the Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulator of Vanuatu wrote With the introduction of the Internet of Things human senses are in decline Alper Dincel of T C Istanbul Kultur University in Turkey wrote Personal connections will continue to drop as they are in today s world We are going to have more interest in fiction than in reality These issues will affect human brain development as a result Michael Dyer an emeritus professor of computer science at the University of California Los Angeles commented As long as GAI general AI is not achieved then specialized AI will eliminate tasks associated with jobs but not the jobs themselves A trucker does a lot more than merely drive a truck A bartender does a lot more than merely pour drinks Society will still have to deal with the effects of smart technologies encroaching ever into new parts of the labor market A universal basic income could mitigate increasing social instability Later on as general AI spreads it will become an existential threat to humanity My estimate is that this existential threat will not begin to arise until the second half of the 21st century Unfortunately by then humanity might have grown complacent since specialized AI systems do not pose an existential threat Mauro D R os an adviser to the E Government Agency of Uruguay and director of the Internet Society s Uruguay chapter responded In 2030 dependence on AI will be greater in all domestic personal work and educational contexts this will make the lives of many people better However it has risks We must be able to maintain active survival capabilities without AI Human freedom cannot be lost in exchange for the convenience of improving our living standards AI must continue to be subject to the rationality and control of the human being Nancy Greenwald a respondent who provided no identifying details wrote Perhaps the primary downside is overreliance on AI which 1 is only as good as the algorithms created how are they instructed to learn and 2 has the danger of limiting independent human thinking How many Millennials can read a map or navigate without the step by step instructions from Waze Google or their iPhones And information searches online don t give you an overview I once wasted 1 5 billable hours searching for a legal concept when two minutes with the human based BNA outline got me the result in two minutes Let s be thoughtful about how we use the amazing technology Valarie Bell a computational social scientist at the University of North Texas commented As a social scientist I m concerned that never before have we had more ways in which to communicate and yet we ve never done it so poorly so venomously and so wastefully With devices replacing increasingly higher order decisions and behaviors people have become more detached more disinterested and yet more self focused and self involved Lane Jennings managing editor for the World Future Review from 2009 to 2015 wrote It is most likely that advances in AI will improve technology and thus give people new capabilities But this progress will also make humanity increasingly vulnerable to accidental breakdowns power failures and deliberate attacks Example Driverless cars and trucks and pilotless passenger aircraft will enhance speed and safety when they work properly but they will leave people helpless if they fail Fear and uncertainty could negate positive benefits after even a few highly publicized disasters Michael Veale co author of Fairness and Accountability Designs Needs for Algorithmic Support in High Stakes Public Sector Decision Making and a technology policy researcher at University College London responded AI technologies will turn out to be more narrowly applicable than some hope There will be a range of small tasks that will be more effectively automated Whether these tasks leave individuals with increased ability to find meaning or support in life is debatable Freed from some aspects of housework and administration some individuals may feel empowered whereas others might feel aimless Independent living for the elderly might be technologically mediated but will it have the social connections and community that makes life worth living Jobs too will change in nature but it is not clear that new tasks will make people happy It is important that all technologies and applications are backed up with social policies and systems to support meaning and connection or else even effective AI tools might be isolating and even damaging on aggregate The following one liners from anonymous respondents also tie into this theme Other anonymous respondents commented Some of these experts are particularly worried about how networked artificial intelligence can amplify cybercrime create fearsome possibilities in cyberwarfare or enable the erosion of essential institutions and organizations Anthony Nadler assistant professor of media and communication studies at Ursinus College commented The question has to do with how decisions will be made that shape the contingent development of this potentially life changing technology And who will make those decisions In the best case scenario the development of AI will be influenced by diverse stakeholders representing different communities who will be affected by its implementation and this may mean that particular uses of AI military applications medical marketing etc will be overseen by reflective ethical processes In the absolute worst case scenario unrestricted military development will lead to utter destruction whether in a situations in which the machines take over or more likely in which weapons of tremendous destruction become all the more readily accessible Jennifer J Snow an innovation officer with the U S Air Force wrote Facets including weaponized information cyberbullying privacy issues and other potential abuses that will come out of this technology will need to be addressed by global leaders Lee McKnight associate professor at Syracuse University s School of Information Studies commented There will be good bad and ugly outcomes from human machine interaction in artificially intelligent systems services and enterprises Poorly designed artificially intelligent services and enterprises will have unintended societal consequences hopefully not catastrophic but sure to damage people and infrastructure Even more regrettably defending ourselves against evil or to be polite bad AI systems turned ugly by humans or other machines must become a priority for societies well before 2030 given the clear and present danger How can I be sure What are bots and malware doing every day today Is there a reason to think evil doers will be less motivated in the future No So my fear is that the hopefully sunny future of AI which in aggregate we may assume will be a net positive for all of us will be marred by many unfortunate events Robert M Mason a professor emeritus at the University of Washington s Information School responded Technologies including AI leverage human efforts People find ways to apply technologies to enhance the human spirit and the human experience yet others can use technologies to exploit human fears and satisfy personal greed As the late Fred Robbins Nobel Laureate in Physiology Medicine observed my paraphrase when I asked why he was pessimistic about the future of mankind Of course I m pessimistic Humans have had millions of years to develop physically and mentally but we ve had only a few thousand years as the world population has expanded to develop the social skills that would allow us to live close together I understand his pessimism and it takes only a few people to use AI or any technology in ways that result in widespread negative societal impacts Frank Feather futurist and consultant with StratEDGY commented AI by 2030 This is only about a decade away so despite AI s continuing evolution it will not have major widespread effects by 2030 With care in implementation all effects should be positive in social and economic impact That said the changes will represent a significant step toward what I call a DigiTransHuman Future where the utility of humans will increasingly be diminished as this century progresses to the extent that humans may become irrelevant or extinct replaced by DigiTransHumans and their technologies robots that will appear and behave just like today s humans except at very advanced stages of humanoid development This is not going to be a so called singularity and there is nothing artificial about the DigiTransHuman Intelligence It is part of designed evolution of the species John Leslie King a computer science professor at the University of Michigan and a consultant for several years on cyberinfrastructure for the National Science Foundation s directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE and Social Behavioral and Economic SBE sciences commented If there are evil things to be done with AI people will find out about them and do them There will be an ongoing fight like the one between hackers and IT security people John Markoff fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University and author of Machines of Loving Grace The Quest for Common Ground Between Humans and Robots wrote There are expected and unexpected consequences to AI and related technologies It is quite possible that improvements in living standards will be offset by the use of autonomous weapons in new kinds of war A veteran of a pioneering internet company commented In the face of managing resources and warfare the big issues for AI at scale the goals are not likely to be sharing and co existence Dan Schultz senior creative technologist at Internet Archive responded AI will no doubt result in life saving improvements for a huge portion of the world s population but it will also be possible to weaponize in ways that further exacerbate divides of any kind you can imagine political economic education privilege etc AI will amplify and enable the will of those in power its net impact on humanity will depend on the nature of that will Sam Gregory director of WITNESS and digital human rights activist responded Trends in AI suggest it will enable more individualized personalized creation of synthetic media filter bubbles around people including the use of deepfakes and related individualized synthetic audio and video micro targeting based on personal data and trends in using AI generated and directed bots These factors may be controlled by increasing legislation and platform supervision but by 2030 there is little reason to think that most peoples individual autonomy and ability to push back to understand the world around them will have improved Miguel Moreno Mu oz a professor of philosophy specializing in ethics epistemology and technology at the University of Granada in Spain said There is a risk of overreliance on systems with poorly experienced intelligence augmentation due to pressure to reduce costs This could lead to major dysfunctions in health care or in the supervision of highly complex processes A hasty application of management systems based on the Internet of Things could be problematic in certain sectors of industry transport or health but its advantages will outweigh its disadvantages I do believe there may be significant risks in the military applications of AI Denise N Rall a professor of arts and social sciences at Southern Cross University in Australia responded The basic problem with the human race and its continued existence on this planet is overpopulation and depletion of the Earth s resources So far interactions with technology have reduced population in the first world but not in developing countries and poverty will fuel world wars Technology may support robotic wars and reduce casualties for the wealthy countries The disparity between rich and poor will continue unabated Patrick Lambe a partner at Straits Knowledge and president of the International Society for Knowledge Organization s Singapore chapter wrote I chose the negative answer not because of a dystopian vision for AI itself and technology interaction with human life but because I believe social economic and political contexts will be slow to adapt to technology s capabilities The real world environment and the technological capability space are becoming increasingly disjointed and out of synch Climate change migration pressures political pressures food supply and water will create a self reinforcing crisis loop with which human machine AI capabilities will be largely out of touch There will be some capability enhancement e g medicine but on the whole technology contributions will continue to add negative pressures to the other environmental factors employment job security left right political swings On the whole I think these disjoints will continue to become more enhanced until a major crisis point is reached e g war Mechthild Schmidt Feist department coordinator for digital communications and media at New York University said Historical precedent shows that inventions are just as powerful in the hands of criminals or irresponsible or uninformed people The more powerful our communication the more destructive it could be We would need global enforceable legislation to limit misuse 1 That is highly unlikely 2 It is hard to predict all misuses My negative view is due to our inability to make responsible use of our current online communication and media models The utopian freedom has become a dystopian battleground Marc Brenman managing partner at IDARE LLC said We do not know all that machines can do There is no inherent necessity that they will care for us We may be an impediment to them They may take orders from evil doers They will enable us to make mistakes even faster than we do now Any technology is only as good as the morality and ethics of its makers programmers and controllers If machines are programmed to care more for the earth than for people they may eliminate us anyway since we are destroying the earth Robert K Logan chief scientist at the Strategic Innovation Lab sLab at OCAT University and professor emeritus of physics at the University of Toronto said The idea of the Singularity is an example of the over extension of AI Computers will never achieve an equivalency to human intelligence There is no such thing as AW artificial wisdom AI as a tool to enhance human intelligence makes sense but AI to replace human intelligence makes no sense and therefore is nonsense Alexey Turchin existential risks researcher and futurist responded There are significant risks of AI misuse before 2030 in the form of swarms of AI empowered drones or even non aligned human level AI Adam Popescu a writer who contributes frequently to the New York Times Washington Post Bloomberg Businessweek Vanity Fair and the BBC wrote We put too much naive hope in everything tech being the savior The following one liners from anonymous respondents also tie into this theme Other anonymous respondents commented A number of participants in this canvassing offered solutions to the worrisome potential future spawned by AI Among them 1 Improving collaboration across borders and stakeholder groups 2 Developing policies to assure that development of AI will be directed at augmenting humans and the common good 3 Shifting the priorities of economic political and education systems to empower individuals to stay ahead in the race with the robots Many respondents sketched out overall aspirations Andrew Wycoff the director of OECD s directorate for science technology and innovation and Karine Perset an economist in OECD s digital economy policy division commented Twelve years from now we will benefit from radically improved accuracy and efficiency of decisions and predictions across all sectors Machine learning systems will actively support humans throughout their work and play This support will be unseen but pervasive like electricity As machines ability to sense learn interact naturally and act autonomously increases they will blur the distinction between the physical and the digital world AI systems will interconnect and work together to predict and adapt to our human needs and emotions The growing consensus that AI should benefit society at large leads to calls to facilitate the adoption of AI systems to promote innovation and growth help address global challenges and boost jobs and skills development while at the same time establishing appropriate safeguards to ensure these systems are transparent and explainable and respect human rights democracy culture nondiscrimination privacy and control safety and security Given the inherently global nature of our networks and applications that run across then we need to improve collaboration across countries and stakeholder groups to move toward common understanding and coherent approaches to key opportunities and issues presented by AI This is not too different from the post war discussion on nuclear power We should also tread carefully toward Artificial General Intelligence and avoid current assumptions on the upper limits of future AI capabilities Wendy Hall professor of computer science at the University of Southampton and executive director of the Web Science Institute said By 2030 I believe that human machine AI collaboration will be empowering for human beings overall Many jobs will have gone but many new jobs will have been created and machines AI should be helping us do things more effectively and efficiently both at home and at work It is a leap of faith to think that by 2030 we will have learnt to build AI in a responsible way and we will have learnt how to regulate the AI and robotics industries in a way that is good for humanity We may not have all the answers by 2030 but we need to be on the right track by then Ian O Byrne an assistant professor focusing on literacy and technology at the College of Charleston said I believe in human machine AI collaboration but the challenge is whether humans can adapt our practices to these new opportunities Arthur Bushkin an IT pioneer who worked with the precursors to the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ARPANET and Verizon wrote The principal issue will be society s collective ability to understand manage and respond to the implications and consequences of the technology Daniel Obam information and communications technology policy advisor responded As we develop AI the issue of ethical behaviour is paramount AI will allow authorities to analyse and allocate resources where there is the greatest need AI will also change the way we work and travel Digital assistants that mine and analyse data will help professionals in making concise decisions in health care manufacturing and agriculture among others Smart devices and virtual reality will enable humans to interact with and learn from historical or scientific issues in a more clear manner Using AI authorities will be able to prevent crime before it happens Cybersecurity needs to be at the forefront to prevent unscrupulous individuals from using AI to perpetrate harm or evil on the human race Ryan Sweeney director of analytics at Ignite Social Media commented Our technology continues to evolve at a growing rate but our society culture and economy are not as quick to adapt We ll have to be careful that the benefits of AI for some do not further divide those who might not be able to afford the technology What will that mean for our culture as more jobs are automated We will need to consider the impact on the current class divide Susan Mernit executive director of The Crucible and co founder and board member of Hack the Hood responded If AI is in the hands of people who do not care about equity and inclusion it will be yet another tool to maximize profit for a few The next three sections of this report focus on solutions most often mentioned by respondents to this canvassing A number of these experts said ways must be found for people of the world to come to a common understanding of the evolving concerns over AI and digital life and to reach agreement in order to create cohesive approaches to tackling AI s challenges Danil Mikhailov head of data and innovation for Wellcome Trust responded I see a positive future of human AI interaction in 2030 In my area health there is tremendous potential in the confluence of advances in big data analysis and genomics to create personalised medicine and improve diagnosis treatment and research Although I am optimistic about human capacity for adaptation learning and evolution technological innovation will not always proceed smoothly In this we can learn from previous technological revolutions For example Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane rightly pointed out that the original luddites in the 19th century had a justified grievance They suffered severe job losses and it took the span of a generation for enough jobs to be created to overtake the ones lost It is a reminder that the introduction of new technologies benefits people asymmetrically with some suffering while others benefit To realise the opportunities of the future we need to acknowledge this and prepare sufficient safety nets such as well funded adult education initiatives to name one example It s also important to have an honest dialogue between the experts the media and the public about the use of our personal data for social good projects like health care taking in both the risks of acting such as effects on privacy and the opportunity costs of not acting It is a fact that lives are lost currently in health systems across the world that could be saved even with today s technology let alone that of 2030 Edson Prestes a professor and director of robotics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul responded We must understand that all domains technological or not have two sides a good and a bad one To avoid the bad one we need to create and promote the culture of AI Robotics for good We need to stimulate people to empathize toward others We need to think about potential issues even if they have small probability to happen We need to be futurists foreseeing potential negative events and how to circumvent them before they happen We need to create regulations laws at national and international levels to handle globally harmful situations for humans other living beings and the environment Applying empathy we should seriously think about ourselves and others if the technology will be useful for us and others and if it will not cause any harm We cannot develop solutions without considering people and the ecosystem as the central component of development If so the pervasiveness of AI robotics in the future will diminish any negative impact and create a huge synergy among people and environment improving people s daily lives in all domains while achieving environment sustainability Adam Nelson a software developer for one of the big five global technology companies said Human machine AI collaboration will be extremely powerful but humans will still control intent If human governance isn t improved AI will merely make the world more efficient But the goals won t be human welfare They ll be wealth aggregation for those in power Wendy Seltzer strategy lead and counsel at the World Wide Web Consortium commented I m mildly optimistic that we will have devised better techno social governance mechanisms such that if AI is not improving the lives of humans we will restrict its uses Jen Myronuk a respondent who provided no identifying details said The optimist s view includes establishing and implementing a new type of ISO standard encoded human rights as a functional data set alongside exponential and advancing technologies Global human rights and human machine AI technology can and must scale together If applied as an extension of the human experience human machine AI collaboration will revolutionize our understanding of the world around us Fiona Kerr industry professor of neural and systems complexity at the University of Adelaide commented The answer depends very much on what we decide to do regarding the large questions around ensuring equality of improved global health by agreeing on what productivity and worth now look like partly supported by the global wage through fair redistribution of technology profits to invest in both international and national social capital through robust discussion on the role of policy in rewarding technologists and businesses to build quality partnerships between humans and AI through the growth of understanding in the neurophysiological outcomes of human human and human technological interaction which allows us to best decide what not to technologies when a human is more effective and how to ensure we maximise the wonders of technology as an enabler of a human centric future Benjamin Kuipers a professor of computer science at the University of Michigan wrote We face several critical choices between positive and negative futures Advancing technology will provide vastly more resources the key decision is whether those resources will be applied for the good of humanity as a whole or if they will be increasingly held by a small elite Advancing technology will vastly increase opportunities for communication and surveillance The question is whether we will find ways to increase trust and the possibilities for productive cooperation among people or whether individuals striving for power will try to dominate by decreasing trust and cooperation In the medium term increasing technology will provide more powerful tools for human corporate or even robot actors in society The actual problems will be about how members of a society interact with each other In a positive scenario we will interact with conversational AIs for many different purposes and even when the AI belongs to a corporation we will be able to trust that it takes what in economics is called a fiduciary stance toward each of us That is the information we provide must be used primarily for our individual benefit Although we know and are explicitly told that our aggregated information is valuable to the corporation we can trust that it will not be used for our manipulation or our disadvantage Denise Garcia an associate professor of political science and international affairs at Northeastern University said Humanity will come together to cooperate Charles Geiger head of the executive secretariat for the UN s World Summit on the Information Society commented As long as we have a democratic system and a free press we may counterbalance the possible threats of AI Warren Yoder longtime director of the Public Policy Center of Mississippi now an instructor at Mississippi College optimistically responded Human AI collaborations will augment our human abilities and increase the material well being of humanity At the same time the concomitant increase in the levels of education and health will allow us to develop new social philosophies and rework our polities to transform human well being AI increases the disruption of the old social order making the new transformation both necessary and more likely though not guaranteed Wangari Kabiru author of the MitandaoAfrika blog based in Nairobi Kenya commented In 2030 advancing AI and tech will not leave most people better off than they are today because our global digital mission is not strong enough and not principled enough to assure that no not one is left behind perhaps intentionally The immense positive impact potential for enabling people to achieve more in nearly every area of life the full benefits of human machine AI collaboration can only be experienced when academia civil society and other institutions are vibrant enterprise is human values based and governments and national constitutions and global agreements place humanity first Engineering should serve humanity and never should humanity be made to serve the exploits of engineering More people MUST be creators of the future of LIFE the future of how they live future of how they work future of how their relationships interact and overall how they experience life Beyond the coexistence of human machine this creates synergy A professor expert in AI connected to a major global technology company s projects in AI development wrote Precision democracy will emerge from precision education to incrementally support the best decisions we can make for our planet and our species The future is about sustaining our planet As with the current development of precision health as the path from data to wellness so too will artificial intelligence improve the impact of human collaboration and decision making in sustaining our planet Some respondents argued that individuals must do better at taking a more active role in understanding and implementing the decision making options available to them in these complex code dependent systems Kristin Jenkins executive director of BioQUEST Curriculum Consortium said Like all tools the benefits and pitfalls of AI will depend on how we use it A growing concern is the collection and potential uses of data about people s day to day lives Something always knows where we are the layout of the house what s in the fridge and how much we slept The convenience provided by these tools will override caution about data collection so strong privacy protection must be legislated and culturally nurtured We need to learn to be responsible for our personal data and aware of when and how it is collected and used Peng Hwa Ang professor of communications at Nanyang Technological University and author of Ordering Chaos Regulating the Internet commented AI is still in its infancy A lot of it is ruled based and not demanding of true intelligence or learning But even so I find it useful My car has lane assistance I find that it makes me a better driver When AI is more full fledged it would make driving safer and faster I am using AI for some work I am doing on sentiment analysis I find that I am able to be more creative in asking questions to be investigated I expect AI will compel greater creativity Right now the biggest fear of AI is that it is a black box operation yes the factors chosen are good and accurate and useful but no one knows why those criteria are chosen We know the percentages of the factors but we do not know the whys Hopefully by 2030 the box will be more transparent That s on the AI side On the human side I hope human beings understand that true AI will make mistakes If not it is not real AI This means that people have got to be ready to catch the mistakes that AI will make It will be very good But it will still not be foolproof Bert Huang an assistant professor in the department of computer science at Virginia Tech focused on machine learning wrote AI will cause harm and it has already caused harm but its benefits will outweigh the harm it causes That said the historical pattern of technology being net positive depends on people seeking positive things to do with the technology so efforts to guide research toward societal benefits will be important to ensure the best future An anonymous respondent said We should ensure that values local or global and basic philosophical theories on ethics inform the development and implementation of AI systems Many experts who shared their insights in this study suggested there has to be an overall change in the development regulation and certification of autonomous systems They generally said the goal should be values based inclusive decentralized networks imbued with empathy that help individuals assure that technology meets social and ethical responsibilities for the common good Susan Etlinger an industry analyst for Altimeter Group and expert in data analytics and digital strategy commented In order for AI technologies to be truly transformative in a positive way we need a set of ethical norms standards and practical methodologies to ensure that we use AI responsibly and to the benefit of humanity AI technologies have the potential to do so much good in the world identify disease in people and populations discover new medications and treatments make daily tasks like driving simpler and safer monitor and distribute energy more efficiently and so many other things we haven t yet imagined or been able to realize And like any tectonic shift AI creates its own type of disruption We ve seen this with every major invention from the Gutenberg press to the invention of the semiconductor But AI is different Replication of some human capabilities using data and algorithms has ethical consequences Algorithms aren t neutral they replicate and reinforce bias and misinformation They can be opaque And the technology and means to use them rests in the hands of a select few organizations at least today Bryan Johnson founder and CEO of Kernel a leading developer of advanced neural interfaces and OS Fund a venture capital firm said We could start with owning our own digital data and the data from our bodies minds and behavior and then follow by correcting our major tech companies incentives away from innovation for everyday convenience and toward radical human improvement As an example of what tech could look like when aligned with radical human improvement cognitive prosthetics will one day give warnings about biases like how cars today have sensors letting you know when you drift off to sleep or if you make a lane change without a signal and correct cognitive biases and warn an individual away from potential cognitive biases This could lead to better behaviors in school home and work and encourage people to make better health decisions Marc Rotenberg executive director of Electronic Privacy Information Center EPIC commented The challenge we face with the rise of AI is the growing opacity of processes and decision making The favorable outcomes we will ignore The problematic outcomes we will not comprehend That is why the greatest challenge ahead for AI accountability is AI transparency We must ensure that we understand and can replicate the outcomes produced by machines The alternative outcome is not sustainable John C Havens executive director of the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems and the Council on Extended Intelligence wrote While today people provide consent for their data usage most people don t understand the depth and breadth of how their information is utilized by businesses and governments at large Until every individual is provided with a sovereign identity attached to a personal data cloud they control information won t truly be shared just tracked By utilizing blockchain or similar technologies and adopting progressive ideals toward citizens and their data as demonstrated by countries like Estonia we can usher in genuine digital democracy in the age of the algorithm The other issue underlying the human AI augmentation narrative rarely discussed is the economic underpinnings driving all technology manufacturing Where exponential growth shareholder models are prioritized human and environmental well being diminishes Multiple reports from people like Joseph Stiglitz point out that while AI will greatly increase GDP in the coming decades the benefits of these increases will favor the few versus the many It s only by adopting Beyond GDP or triple bottom line metrics that people planet and profit will shape a holistic future between humans and AI Greg Lloyd president and co founder at Traction Software presented a future scenario By 2030 AIs will augment access and use of all personal and networked resources as highly skilled and trusted agents for almost every person human or corporate These agents will be bound to act in accordance with new laws and regulations that are fundamental elements of their construction much like Isaac Asimov s Three Laws of Robotics but with finer grain certifications for classes of activities that bind their behavior and responsibility for practices much like codes for medical legal accounting and engineering practice Certified agents will be granted access to personal or corporate resources and within those bounds will be able to converse take direction give advice and act like trusted servants advisers or attorneys Although these agents will feel like intelligent and helpful beings they will not have any true independent will or consciousness and must not pretend to be human beings or act contrary to the laws and regulations that bind their behavior Think Ariel and Prospero Tracey P Lauriault assistant professor of critical media and big data at Carleton University s School of Journalism and Communication commented What about regulatory and policy interventions to protect citizens from potentially harmful outcomes AI auditing oversight transparency and accountability Without some sort of principles of a systems based framework to ensure that AI remains ethical and in the public interest in a stable fashion then I must assume that AI will impede agency and could lead to decision making that can be harmful biased inaccurate and not able to dynamically change with changing values There needs to be some sort of accountability Jo l Colloc professor at Universit du Havre Normandy University and author of Ethics of Autonomous Information Systems commented When AI supports human decisions as a decision support system it can help humanity enhance life health and well being and supply improvements for humanity See Marcus Flavius Quintilianus s principles Who is doing what with what why how when where Autonomous AI is power that can be used by powerful persons to control the people put them in slavery Applying the Quintilian principles to the role of AI we should propose a code of ethics of AI to evaluate that each type of application is oriented toward the well being of the user 1 do not harm the user 2 benefits go to the user 3 do not misuse her his freedom identity and personal data and 4 decree as unfair any clauses alienating the user s independence or weakening his her rights of control over privacy in use of the application The sovereignty of the user of the system must remain total Joseph Turow professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania wrote Whether or not AI will improve society or harm it by 2030 will depend on the structures governing societies of the era Broadly democratic societies with an emphasis on human rights might encourage regulations that push AI in directions that help all sectors of the nation Authoritarian societies will by contrast set agendas for AI that further divide the elite from the rest and use technology to cultivate and reinforce the divisions We see both tendencies today the dystopian one has the upper hand especially in places with the largest populations It is critical that people who care about future generations speak out when authoritarian tendencies of AI appear Henry E Brady dean of the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California Berkeley wrote I believe that policy responses can be developed that will reduce biases and find a way to accommodate AI and robotics with human lives Jennifer King director of privacy at Stanford Law School s Center for Internet and Society said Unless we see a real effort to capture the power of AI for the public good I do not see an overarching public benefit by 2030 The shift of AI research to the private sector means that AI will be developed to further consumption rather than extend knowledge and public benefit Gary Kreps distinguished professor of communication and director of the Center for Health and Risk Communication at George Mason University wrote The tremendous potential for AI to be used to engage and adapt information content and computer services to individual users can make computing increasingly helpful engaging and relevant However to achieve these outcomes AI needs to be programmed with the user in mind For example AI services should be user driven adaptive to individual users easy to use easy to understand and easy for users to control These AI systems need to be programmed to adapt to individual user requests learning about user needs and preferences Thomas Streeter a professor of sociology at the University of Vermont said The technology will not determine whether things are better or worse in 2030 social and political choices will Paul Werbos a former program director at the National Science Foundation who first described the process of training artificial neural networks through backpropagation of errors in 1974 said We are at a moment of choice The outcome will depend a lot on the decisions of very powerful people who do not begin to know the consequences of the alternatives they face or even what the substantive alternatives are Divina Frau Meigs professor of media sociology at the University of Paris III Sorbonne Nouvelle and UNESCO chair for sustainable digital development responded The sooner the ethics of AI are aligned with human rights tenets the better Juan Ortiz Freuler a policy fellow at the World Wide Web Foundation wrote We believe technology can and should empower people If the people will continue to have a substantive say on how society is run then the state needs to increase its technical capabilities to ensure proper oversight of these companies Tech in general and AI in particular will promote the advancement of humanity in every area by allowing processes to scale efficiently reducing the costs and making more services available to more people including quality health care mobility education etc The open question is how these changes will affect power dynamics To operate effectively AI requires a broad set of infrastructure components which are not equally distributed These include data centers computing power and big data What is more concerning is that there are reasons to expect further concentration On the one hand data scales well The upfront fixed costs of setting up a datacenter are large compared to the cost of keeping it running Therefore the cost of hosting each extra datum is marginally lower than the previous one Data is the fuel of AI and therefore whoever gets access to more data can develop more effective AI On the other hand AI creates efficiency gains by allowing companies to automate more processes meaning whoever gets ahead can undercut competitors This circle fuels concentration As more of our lives are managed by technology there is a risk that whoever controls these technologies gets too much power The benefits in terms of quality of life and the risks to people s autonomy and control over politics are qualitatively different and there cannot and should not be up for tradeoffs Meryl Alper an assistant professor of communication at Northeastern University and a faculty associate at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society wrote My fear is that AI tools will be used by a powerful few to further centralize resources and marginalize people These tools much like the internet itself will allow people to do this ever more cheaply quickly and in a far reaching and easily replicable manner with exponentially negative impacts on the environment Preventing this in its worst manifestations will require global industry regulation by government officials with hands on experience in working with AI tools on the federal state and local level and transparent audits of government AI tools by grassroots groups of diverse in every sense of the term stakeholders David Wilkins instructor in computer science at the University of Oregon responded AI must be able to explain the basis for its decisions A top research director and technical fellow at a major global technology company said There is a huge opportunity to enhance folks lives via AI technologies The positive uses of AI will dominate as they will be selected for their value to people I trust the work by industry academia and civil society to continue to play an important role in moderating the technology such as pursuing understandings of the potential costly personal social and societal influences of AI I particularly trust the guidance coming from the long term ongoing One Hundred Year Study on AI and the efforts of the Partnership on AI Peter Stone professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin and chair of the first study panel of the One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence AI100 responded As chronicled in detail in the AI100 report I believe that there are both significant opportunities and significant challenges risks when it comes to incorporating AI technologies into various aspects of everyday life With carefully crafted industry specific policies and responsible use I believe that the potential benefits outweigh the risks But the risks are not to be taken lightly Anita Salem systems research and design principal at SalemSystems warned of a possible dystopian outcome Human machine interaction will result in increasing precision and decreasing human relevance unless specific efforts are made to design in humanness For instance AI in the medical field will aid more precise diagnosis will increase surgical precision and will increase evidence based analytics If designed correctly these systems will allow the humans to do what they do best provide empathy use experience based intuition and utilize touch and connection as a source of healing If human needs are left out of the design process we ll see a world where humans are increasingly irrelevant and more easily manipulated We could see increasing under employment leading to larger wage gaps greater poverty and homelessness and increasing political alienation We ll see fewer opportunities for meaningful work which will result in increasing drug and mental health problems and the further erosion of the family support system Without explicit efforts to humanize AI design we ll see a population that is needed for purchasing but not creating This population will need to be controlled and AI will provide the means for this control law enforcement by drones opinion manipulation by bots cultural homogeny through synchronized messaging election systems optimized from big data and a geopolitical system dominated by corporations that have benefited from increasing efficiency and lower operating costs Chris Newman principal engineer at Oracle commented As it becomes more difficult for humans to understand how AI tech works it will become harder to resolve inevitable problems A better outcome is possible with a hard push by engineers and consumers toward elegance and simplicity e g Steve Jobs era Apple A research scientist based in North America wrote The wheels of legislation which is a primary mechanism to ensure benefits are distributed throughout society move slowly While the benefits of AI automation will accrue very quickly for the 1 it will take longer for the rest of the populace to feel any benefits and that s ONLY if our representative leaders DELIBERATELY enact STRONG social and fiscal policy For example AI will save billions in labor costs and also cut the bargaining power of labor in negotiations with capital Any company using AI technologies should be heavily taxed with that money going into strong social welfare programs like job retraining and federal jobs programs For another example any publicly funded AI research should be prevented from being privatized The public ought to see the reward from its own investments Don t let AI follow the pattern of Big Pharma s exploitation of the public permitted Bayh Dole Act Ken Birman a professor in the department of computer science at Cornell University responded By 2030 I believe that our homes and offices will have evolved to support app like functionality much like the iPhone in my pocket People will customize their living and working spaces and different app suites will support different lifestyles or special needs For example think of a young couple with children a group of students sharing a home or an elderly person who is somewhat frail Each would need different forms of support This applications perspective is broad and very flexible But we also need to ensure that privacy and security are strongly protected by the future environment I do want my devices and apps linked on my behalf but I don t ever want to be continuously spied upon I do think this is feasible and as it occurs we will benefit in myriad ways Martin Geddes a consultant specializing in telecommunications strategies said The unexpected impact of AI will be to automate many of our interactions with systems where we give consent and to enable a wider range of outcomes to be negotiated without our involvement This requires a new presentation layer for the augmented reality metaverse with a new browser the Guardian Avatar that helps to protect our identity and our interests Lindsey Andersen an activist at the intersection of human rights and technology for Freedom House and Internews now doing graduate research at Princeton University commented Already there is an overreliance on AI to make consequential decisions that affect people s lives We have rushed to use AI to decide everything from what content we see on social media to assigning credit scores to determining how long a sentence a defendant should serve While often well intentioned these uses of AI are rife with ethical and human rights issues from perpetuating racial bias to violating our rights to privacy and free expression If we have not dealt with these problems through smart regulation consumer buyer education and establishment of norms across the AI industry we could be looking at a vastly more unfair polarized and surveilled world in 2030 Yeseul Kim a designer for a major South Korean search firm wrote The prosperity generated by and the benefits of AI will promote the quality of living for most people only when its ethical implications and social impacts are widely discussed and shared inside the human society and only when pertinent regulations and legislation can be set up to mitigate the misconduct that can be brought about as the result of AI advancement If these conditions are met computers and machines can process data at unprecedented speed and at an unrivaled precision level and this will improve the quality of life especially in medical and healthcare sectors It has already been proven and widely shared among medical expert groups that doctors perform better in detecting diseases when they work with AI Robotics for surgery is also progressing so this will also benefit the patients as they can assist human surgeons who inevitably face physical limits when they conduct surgeries Mark Maben a general manager at Seton Hall University wrote The AI revolution is sadly likely to be dystopian At present governmental educational civic religious and corporate institutions are ill prepared to handle the massive economic and social disruption that will be caused by AI I have no doubt that advances in AI will enhance human capacities and empower some individuals but this will be more than offset by the fact that artificial intelligence and associated technological advances will mean far fewer jobs in the future Sooner than most individuals and societies realize AI and automation will eliminate the need for retail workers truck drivers lawyers surgeons factory workers and other professions In order to ensure that the human spirit thrives in a world run and ruled by AI we will need to change the current concept of work That is an enormous task for a global economic system in which most social and economic benefits come from holding a traditional job We are already seeing a decline in democratic institutions and a rise in authoritarianism due to economic inequality and the changing nature of work If we do not start planning now for the day when AI results in complete disruption of employment the strain is likely to result in political instability violence and despair This can be avoided by policies that provide for basic human needs and encourage a new definition of work but the behavior to date by politicians governments corporations and economic elites gives me little confidence in their ability to lead us through this transition Eduardo Vendrell a computer science professor at the Polytechnic University of Valencia in Spain responded These advances will have a noticeable impact on our privacy since the basis for this application is focused on the information we generate with the use of different technologies It will be necessary to regulate in a decisive way the access to the information and its use Yoram Kalman an associate professor at the Open University of Israel and member of The Center for Internet Research at the University of Haifa wrote The main risk is when communication and analysis technologies are used to control others to manipulate them or to take advantage of them These risks are ever present and can be mitigated through societal awareness and education and through regulation that identifies entities that become very powerful thanks to a specific technology or technologies and which use that power to further strengthen themselves Such entities be they commercial political national military religious or any other have in the past tried and succeeded in leveraging technologies against the general societal good and that is an ever present risk of any powerful innovation This risk should make us vigilant but should not keep us from realizing one of the most basic humans urges the strive to constantly improve the human condition Sam Gregory director of WITNESS and digital human rights activist responded We should assume all AI systems for surveillance and population control and manipulation will be disproportionately used and inadequately controlled by authoritarian and non democratic governments These governments and democratic governments will continue to pressure platforms to use AI to monitor for content and this monitoring in and of itself will contribute to the data set for personalization and for surveillance and manipulation To fight back against this dark future we need to get the right combination of attention to legislation and platform self governance right now and we need to think about media literacy to understand AI generated synthetic media and targeting We should also be cautious about how much we encourage the use of AI as a solution to managing content online and as a solution to for example managing hate speech Jonathan Kolber futurist wrote My fear is that by generating AIs that can learn new tasks faster and more reliably than people can do the future economy will have only evanescent opportunities for most people My hope is that we will begin implementing a sustainable and viable universal basic income and in particular Michael Haines MUBI proposal To my knowledge the only such proposal that is sustainable and can be implemented in any country at any time I have offered a critique of alternatives Given that people may no longer need depend on their competitive earning power in 2030 AI will empower a far better world If however we fail to implement a market oriented universal basic income or something equally effective vast multitudes will become unemployed and unemployable without means to support themselves That is a recipe for societal disaster Walid Al Saqaf senior lecturer at S dert rn University member of the board of trustees of the Internet Society ISOC and vice president of the ISOC Blockchain Special Interest Group commented The challenge is to ensure that the data used for AI procedures is reliable This entails the need for strong cyber security and data integrity The latter I believe can be tremendously enhanced by distributed ledger technologies such as blockchain I foresee mostly positive results from AI so long as there is enough guards to protect from automated execution of tasks in areas that may have ethical considerations such as taking decisions that may have life or death implications AI has a lot of potential It should be used to add to and not replace human intellect and judgement Danny O Brien international director for a nonprofit digital rights group commented I m generally optimistic about the ability of humans to direct technology for the benefit of themselves and others I anticipate human machine collaboration to take place at an individual level with tools and abilities that enhance our own judgment and actions rather than this being a power restricted to a few actors So for instance if we use facial recognition or predictive tools it will be under the control of an end user transparent and limited to personal use This may require regulation internal coding restraints or a balance being struck between user capabilities But I m hopeful we can get there Fernando Barrio director of the law program at the Universidad Nacional de R o Negro in Argentina commented The interaction between humans and networked AI could lead to a better future for a big percentage of the population In order to do so efforts need to be directed not only at increasing AI development and capabilities but also at positive policies to increase the availability and inclusiveness of those technologies The challenge is not technical it is sociopolitical Paul Jones professor of information science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill responded AI as we know it in 2018 is just beginning to understand itself Like HAL it will have matured by 2030 into an understanding of its post adolescent self and of its relationship to humans and to the world But also humans will have matured in our relationship to AI Like all adolescent relationships there will have been risk taking and regrets and hopefully reconciliation Language was our first link to other intelligences then books then the internet each a more intimate conversation than the one before AI will become our link adviser and to some extent our wise loving companion Jean Claude Heudin a professor with expertise in AI and software engineering at the De Vinci Research Center at Pole Universitaire Leonard de Vinci in France wrote Natural intelligence and artificial intelligence are complementary We need all of the possible intelligence possible for solving the problems yet to come More intelligence is always better Bryan Alexander futurist and president of Bryan Alexander Consulting responded I hope we will structure AI to enhance our creativity to boost our learning to expand our relationships worldwide to make us physically safer and to remove some drudgery But some have concerns that the setting of policy could do some damage Scott Burleigh software engineer and intergalactic internet pioneer wrote Advances in technology itself including AI always increase our ability to change the circumstances of reality in ways that improve our lives It also always introduces possible side effects that can make us worse off than we were before Those effects are realized when the policies we devise for using the new technologies are unwise I don t worry about technology I worry about stupid policy I worry about it a lot but I am guardedly optimistic in most cases I think we eventually end up with tolerable policies Jeff Jarvis director of the Tow Knight Center at City University of New York s Craig Newmark School of Journalism commented What worries me most is worry itself An emerging moral panic that will cut off the benefits of this technology for fear of what could be done with it What I fear most is an effort to control not just technology and data but knowledge itself prescribing what information can be used for before we know what those uses could be I could substitute book for AI and the year 1485 or maybe 1550 for 2030 in your question and it d hold fairly true Some thought it would be good some bad both end up right We will figure this out We always have Sure after the book there were wars and other profound disturbances But in the end humans figure out how to exploit technologies to their advantage and control them for their safety I d call that a law of society The same will be true of AI Some will misuse it of course and that is the time to identify limits to place on its use not speculatively before Many more will use it to find economic societal educational and cultural benefit and we need to give them the freedom to do so Some respondents said no matter how society comes together to troubleshoot AI concerns there will still be problems Dave Gusto professor of political science and co director of the Consortium for Science Policy Outcomes at Arizona State University said The question asked about most people Most people in the world live a life that is not well regarded by technology technology developers and AI I don t see that changing much in the next dozen years A longtime Silicon Valley communications professional who has worked at several of the top tech companies over the past few decades responded AI will continue to improve if quality human input is behind it If so better AI will support service industries at the top of the funnel leaving humans to handle interpretation decisions and applied knowledge Medical data gathering for earlier diagnostics comes to mind Smarter job search processes environmental data collection for climate change actions these applications all come to mind Hari Shanker Sharma an expert in nanotechnology and neurobiology at Uppsala University in Sweden said AI has not yet peaked hence growth will continue but evil also uses such developments That will bring bigger dangers to mankind The need will be to balance growth with safety e g social media is good and bad The ways to protect from evil mongers are not sufficient Tracing an attacker evil monger in a global village to control and punish is the need AI will give birth to an artificial human being who could be an angel or a devil Plan for countering evil at every development stage A changemaker working for digital accessibility wrote There is no reason to assume some undefined force will be able to correct for or ameliorate the damage of human nature amplified with power centralizing technologies There is no indication that governments will be able to counterbalance power centralization trends as governments too take advantage of such market failures The outward dressing of such interactions is probably the least important aspect of it An information science futurist commented I fear that powerful business interests will continue to put profits above all else closing their eyes to the second and third order effects of their decisions I fear that we do not have the political will to protect and promote the common interests of citizens and democracy I fear that our technological tools are advancing more quickly than our ability to manage them wisely I have however recently spotted new job openings with titles like Director of Research Policy and Ethics in AI and Architect AI Ethical Practice at major software companies There are reasons for hope The following one liners from anonymous respondents also tie into this theme Other anonymous respondents commented A share of these experts suggest the creation of policies regulations or ethical and operational standards should shift corporate and government priorities to focus on the global advancement of humanity rather than profits or nationalism They urge that major organizations revamp their practices and make sure AI advances are aimed at human augmentation for all regardless of economic class Evan Selinger professor of philosophy at the Rochester Institute of Technology commented In order for people in general to be better off as AI advances through 2030 a progressive political agenda one rooted in the protection of civil liberties and human rights and also conscientious of the dangers of widening social and economic inequalities would have to play a stronger role in governance In light of current events it s hard to be optimistic that such an agenda will have the resources necessary to keep pace with transformative uses of AI throughout ever increasing aspects of society To course correct in time it s necessary for the general public to develop a deep appreciation about why leading ideologies concerning the market prosperity and security are not in line with human flourishing Nicholas Beale leader of the strategy practice at Sciteb an international strategy and search firm commented All depends on how responsibly AI is applied AI done right will empower But unless Western CEOs improve their ethics it won t I m hoping for the best Benjamin Shestakofsky an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania specializing in digital technology s impacts on work said Policymakers should act to ensure that citizens have access to knowledge about the effects of AI systems that affect their life chances and a voice in algorithmic governance The answer to this question will depend on choices made by citizens workers organizational leaders and legislators across a broad range of social domains For example algorithmic hiring systems can be programmed to prioritize efficient outcomes for organizations or fair outcomes for workers The profits produced by technological advancement can be broadly shared or can be captured by the shareholders of a small number of high tech firms Charles Zheng a researcher into machine learning and AI with the National Institute of Mental Health wrote To ensure the best future politicians must be informed of the benefits and risks of AI and pass laws to regulate the industry and to encourage open AI research My hope is that AI algorithms advance significantly in their ability to understand natural language and also in their ability to model humans and understand human values My fear is that the benefits of AI are restricted to the rich and powerful without being accessible to the general public Mary Chayko author of Superconnected The Internet Digital Media and Techno Social Life said We will see regulatory oversight of AI geared toward the protection of those who use it Having said that people will need to remain educated as to AI s impacts on them and to mobilize as needed to limit the power of companies and governments to intrude on their spaces lives and civil rights It will take vigilance and hard work to accomplish this but I feel strongly that we are up to the task R Ray Wang founder and principal analyst at Constellation Research based in Silicon Valley said We have not put the controls of AI in the hands of many In fact the experience in China has shown how this technology can be used to take away the freedoms and rights of the individual for the purposes of security efficiency expediency and whims of the state On the commercial side we also do not have any controls in play as to ethical AI Five elements should be included transparency explainability reversibility coachability and human led processes in the design John Willinsky professor and director of the Public Knowledge Project at Stanford Graduate School of Education said Uses of AI that reduce human autonomy and freedom will need to be carefully weighed against the gains in other qualities of human life e g driverless cars that improve traffic and increase safety By 2030 deliberations over such matters will be critical to the functioning of human machine AI collaboration My hope however is that these deliberations are not framed as collaborations between what is human and what is AI but will be seen as the human use of yet another technology with the wisdom of such use open to ongoing human consideration and intervention intent on advancing that sense of what is most humane about us A professor of media studies at a U S university commented Technology will be a material expression of social policy If that social policy is enacted through a justice oriented democratic process then it has a better chance of producing justice oriented outcomes If it is enacted solely by venture funded corporations with no obligation to the public interest most people in 2030 will likely be worse off Gene Crick director of the Metropolitan Austin Interactive Network and longtime community telecommunications expert wrote To predict AI will benefit most people is more hopeful than certain AI can benefit lives at work and home if competing agendas can be balanced Key support for this important goal could be technology professionals acceptance and commitment regarding social and ethical responsibilities of our work Anthony Picciano a professor of education at the City of New York University s Interactive Technology and Pedagogy program responded I am concerned that profit motives will lead some companies and individuals to develop AI applications that will threaten not necessarily improve our way of life In the next 10 years we will see evolutionary progress in the development of artificial intelligence After 2030 we will likely see revolutionary developments that will have significant ramifications on many aspects of human endeavor We will need to develop checks on artificial intelligence Bill Woodcock executive director at Packet Clearing House the research organization behind global network development commented In short term pragmatic ways learning algorithms will save people time by automating much of tasks like navigation and package delivery and shopping for staples But that tactical win comes at a strategic loss as long as the primary application of AI is to extract more money from people because that puts them in opposition to our interests as a species helping to enrich a few people at the expense of everyone else In AI that exploits human psychological weaknesses to sell us things we have for the first time created something that effectively predates our own species That s a fundamentally bad idea and requires regulation just as surely as would self replicating biological weapons Ethem Alpaydin a professor of computer engineering at Bogazici University in Istanbul responded AI will favor the developed countries that actually develop these technologies AI will help find cures for various diseases and overall improve the living conditions in various ways For the developing countries however whose labor force is mostly unskilled and whose exports are largely low tech AI implies higher unemployment lower income and more social unrest The aim of AI in such countries should be to add skill to the labor force rather than supplant them For example automatic real time translation systems e g Google s Babel fish would allow people who don t speak a foreign language to find work in the tourism industry Joe Whittaker a former professor of sciences and associate director of the NASA GESTAR program now associate provost at Jackson State University said Actions should be taken to make the internet universally available and accessible provide the training and know how for all users John Paschoud councilor for the London borough of Lewisham said It is possible that advances in AI and networked information will benefit most people but this is highly dependent upon on how those benefits are shared If traditional capitalist models of ownership of the means of production prevail then benefits of automated production will be retained by the few who own not the many who work Similarly models of housing health care etc can be equitably distributed and can all be enhanced by technology David Schlangen a professor of applied computational linguistics at Bielefeld University in Germany responded If the right regulations are put in place and ad based revenue models can be controlled in such a way that they cannot be exploited by political interest groups the potential for AI based information search and decision support is enormous That s a big if but I prefer to remain optimistic Kate Carruthers a chief data and analytics officer based in Australia predicted Humans will increasingly interact with AI on a constant basis and it will become hard to know where the boundaries are between the two Just as kids now see their mobile phones as an extension of themselves so too will human AI integration be I fear that the cause of democracy and freedom will be lost by 2030 so it might be a darker future To avoid that one thing we need to do is ensure the development of ethical standards for the development of AI and ensure that we deal with algorithmic bias We need to build ethics into our development processes Further I assume that tracking and monitoring of people will be an accepted part of life and that there will be stronger regulation on privacy and data security Every facet of life will be circumscribed by AI and it will be part of the fabric of our lives David Zubrow associate director of empirical research at Carnegie Mellon University s Software Engineering Institute said How the advances are used demands wisdom leadership and social norms and values that respect and focus on making the world better for all education and health care will reach remote and underserved areas for instance The fear is control is consolidated in the hands of few that seek to exploit people nature and technology for their own gain I am hopeful that this will not happen Francisco S Melo an associate professor of computer science at Instituto Superior T cnico in Lisbon Portugal responded I expect that AI technology will contribute to render several services in health assisted living etc more efficient and humane and by making access to information more broadly available contribute to mitigate inequalities in society However in order for positive visions to become a reality both AI researchers and the general population should be aware of the implications that such technology can have particularly in how information is used and the ways by which it can be manipulated In particular AI researchers should strive for transparency in their work in order to demystify AI and minimize the possibility of misuse the general public on the other hand should strive to be educated in the responsible and informed use of technology Kyung Sin Park internet law expert and co founder of Open Net Korea responded AI consists of software and training data Software is already being made available on an open source basis What will decide AI s contribution to humanity will be whether data used for training AI will be equitably distributed Data protection laws and the open data movement will hopefully do the job of making more data available equally to all people I imagine a future where people can access AI driven diagnosis of symptoms which will drastically reduce health care costs for all Doug Schepers chief technologist at Fizz Studio said AI ML in applications and in autonomous devices and vehicles will make some jobs obsolete and the resulting unemployment will cause some economic instability that impacts society as a whole but most individuals will be better off The social impact of software and networked systems will get increasingly complex so ameliorating that software problem with software agents may be the only way to decrease harm to human lives but only if we can focus the goal of software to benefit individuals and groups rather than companies or industries Erik Huesca president of the Knowledge and Digital Culture Foundation based in Mexico City said There is a concentration of places where specific AI is developed It is a consequence of the capital investment that seeks to replace expensive professionals Universities have to rethink what type of graduates to prepare especially in areas of health legal and engineering where the greatest impact is expected since the labor displacement of doctors engineers and lawyers is a reality with the incipient developed systems Stephen Abram principal at Lighthouse Consulting Inc wrote I am concerned that individual agency is lost in AI and that appropriate safeguards should be in place around data collection as specified by the individual I worry that context can be misconstrued by government agencies like ICE IRS police etc There is a major conversation needed throughout the time during which AI applications are developed and they need to be evergreen as innovation and creativity spark new developments Indeed this should not be part of a political process but an academic independent process guided by principles and not economics and commercial entities David Klann consultant and software developer at Broadcast Tool Die responded AI and related technologies will continue to enhance peoples lives I tend toward optimism I instinctively believe there are enough activists who care about the ethics of AI that the technology will be put to use solving problems that humans cannot solve on their own Take mapping for instance I recently learned about congestion problems caused by directions being optimized for individuals People are now tweaking the algorithms to account for multiple people taking the most efficient route that had become congested and was causing neighborhood disturbance due to the increased traffic I believe people will construct AI algorithms to learn of and to think ahead about such unintended consequences and to avoid them before they become problems Of course my fear is that money interests will continue to wield an overwhelming influence over AI and machine learning ML These can be mitigated through fully disclosed techniques transparency and third party oversight These third parties may be government institutions or non government organizations with the strength to enforce ethical use of the technologies Open source code and open ML training data will contribute significantly to this mitigation Andrian Kreye a journalist and documentary filmmaker based in Germany said If humanity is willing to learn from its mistakes with low level AIs like social media algorithms there might be a chance for AI to become an engine for equality and progress Since most digital development is driven by venture capital experience shows that automation and abuse will be the norm Mai Sugimoto an associate professor of sociology at Kansai University in Japan responded AI could amplify one s bias and prejudice We have to make data unbiased before putting it into AI but it s not very easy An anonymous respondent wrote There are clearly advances associated with AI but the current global political climate gives no indication that technological advancement in any area will improve most lives in the future We also need to think ecologically in terms of the interrelationship between technology and other social change events For example medical technology has increased lifespans but the current opioid crisis has taken many lives in the U S among certain demographics A founder and president said The future of AI is more about the policies we choose and the projects we choose to fund I think there will be large corporate interests in AI that serve nothing but profits and corporations interests This is the force for the bad However I also believe that most technologists want to do good and that most people want to head in a direction for the common good In the end I think this force will win out A senior strategist in regulatory systems and economics for a top global telecommunications firm wrote If we do not strive to improve society making the weakest better off the whole system may collapse So AI had better serve to make life easier for everyone What will human technology co evolution look like by 2030 Participants in this canvassing expect the rate of change to fall in a range anywhere from incremental to extremely impactful Generally they expect AI to continue to be targeted toward efficiencies in workplaces and other activities and they say it is likely to be embedded in most human endeavors The greatest share of participants in this canvassing said automated systems driven by artificial intelligence are already improving many dimensions of their work play and home lives and they expect this to continue over the next decade While they worry over the accompanying negatives of human AI advances they hope for broad changes for the better as networked intelligent systems are revolutionizing everything from the most pressing professional work to hundreds of the little everyday aspects of existence One respondent s answer covered many of the improvements experts expect as machines sit alongside humans as their assistants and enhancers An associate professor at a major university in Israel wrote In the coming 12 years AI will enable all sorts of professions to do their work more efficiently especially those involving saving life individualized medicine policing even warfare where attacks will focus on disabling infrastructure and less in killing enemy combatants and civilians In other professions AI will enable greater individualization e g education based on the needs and intellectual abilities of each pupil student Of course there will be some downsides greater unemployment in certain rote jobs e g transportation drivers food service robots and automation etc This section begins with experts sharing mostly positive expectations for the evolution of humans and AI It is followed by separate sections that include their thoughts about the potential for AI human partnerships and quality of life in 2030 as well as the future of jobs health care and education Many of the leading experts extolled the positives they expect to continue to expand as AI tools evolve to do more things for more people Martijn van Otterlo author of Gatekeeping Algorithms with Human Ethical Bias and assistant professor of artificial intelligence at Tilburg University in the Netherlands wrote Even though I see many ethical issues potential problems and especially power imbalance misuse issues with AI not even starting about singularity issues and out of control AI I do think AI will change most lives for the better especially looking at the short horizon of 2030 even more so because even bad effects of AI can be considered predominantly good by the majority of people For example the Cambridge Analytica case has shown us the huge privacy issues of modern social networks in a market economy but overall people value the extraordinary services Facebook offers to improve communication opportunities sharing capabilities and so on Vint Cerf Internet Hall of Fame member and vice president and chief internet evangelist at Google said I see AI and machine learning as augmenting human cognition a la Douglas Engelbart There will be abuses and bugs some harmful so we need to be thoughtful about how these technologies are implemented and used but on the whole I see these as constructive M che l Foghl engineering director and DevOps Code Pillar at Google s Munich office said The trend is that AI ML models in specific domains can out perform human experts e g certain cancer diagnoses based on image recognition in retina scans I think it would be fairly much the consensus that this trend would continue and many more such systems could aid human experts to be more accurate Craig Mathias principal at Farpoint Group an advisory firm specializing in wireless networking and mobile computing commented Many if not most of the large scale technologies that we all depend upon such as the internet itself the power grid and roads and highways will simply be unable to function in the future without AI as both solution complexity and demand continue to increase Matt Mason a roboticist and the former director of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University wrote AI will present new opportunities and capabilities to improve the human experience While it is possible for a society to behave irrationally and choose to use it to their detriment I see no reason to think that is the more likely outcome Mike Osswald vice president of experience innovation at Hanson Inc commented I m thinking of a world in which people s devices continuously assess the world around them to keep a population safer and healthier Thinking of those living in large urban areas with devices forming a network of AI input through sound analysis air quality natural events etc that can provide collective notifications and insight to everyone in a certain area about the concerns of environmental factors physical health even helping provide no quarter for bad actors through community policing Barry Hughes senior scientist at the Center for International Futures at the University of Denver commented I was one of the original test users of the ARPANET and now can hardly imagine living without the internet Although AI will be disruptive through 2030 and beyond meaning that there will be losers in the workplace and growing reasons for concern about privacy and AI cyber related crime on the whole I expect that individuals and societies will make choices on use and restriction of use that benefit us Examples include likely self driving vehicles at that time when my wife s deteriorating vision and that of an increased elderly population will make it increasingly liberating I would expect rapid growth in use for informal non traditional education as well as some more ambivalent growth in the formal education sector Big data applications in health related research should be increasingly productive and health care delivery should benefit Transparency with respect to its character and use including its developers and their personal benefits is especially important in limiting the inevitable abuse Dana Klisanin psychologist futurist and game designer predicted People will increasingly realize the importance of interacting with each other and the natural world and they will program AI to support such goals which will in turn support the ongoing emergence of the slow movement For example grocery shopping and mundane chores will be allocated to AI smart appliances freeing up time for preparation of meals in keeping with the slow food movement Concern for the environment will likewise encourage the growth of the slow goods slow fashion movement The ability to recycle reduce reuse will be enhanced by the use of in home 3D printers giving rise to a new type of craft that is supported by AI AI will support the cradle to grave movement by making it easier for people to trace the manufacturing process from inception to final product Liz Rykert president at Meta Strategies a consultancy that works with technology and complex organizational change responded The key for networked AI will be the ability to diffuse equitable responses to basic care and data collection If bias remains in the programming it will be a big problem I believe we will be able to develop systems that will learn from and reflect a much broader and more diverse population than the systems we have now Michael R Nelson a technology policy expert for a leading network services provider who worked as a technology policy aide in the Clinton administration commented Most media reports focus on how machine learning will directly affect people medical diagnosis self driving cars etc but we will see big improvements in infrastructure traffic sewage treatment supply chain etc Gary Arlen president of Arlen Communications wrote After the initial frenzy recedes about specific AI applications such as autonomous vehicles workplace robotics transaction processing health diagnoses and entertainment selections specific applications will develop probably in areas barely being considered today As with many new technologies the benefits will not apply equally potentially expanding the haves and have nots dichotomy In addition as AI delves into new fields including creative work such as design music art composition we may see new legal challenges about illegal appropriation of intellectual property via machine learning However the new legal tasks from such litigation may not need a conventional lawyer but could be handled by AI itself Professional health care AI poses another type of dichotomy For patients AI could be a bonanza identifying ailments often in early stages based on early symptoms and recommending treatments At the same time such automated tasks could impact employment for medical professionals And again there are legal challenges to be determined such as liability in the case of a wrong action by the AI Overall there is no such thing as most people but many individuals and groups especially in professional situations WILL live better lives thanks to AI albeit with some severe adjustment pains Tim Morgan a respondent who provided no identifying details said Algorithmic machine learning will be our intelligence amplifier exhaustively exploring data and designs in ways humans alone cannot The world was shocked when IBM s Deep Blue computer beat Garry Kasparov in 1997 What emerged later was the realization that human and AI centaurs could combine to beat anyone human or AI The synthesis is more than the sum of the parts Marshall Kirkpatrick product director of influencer marketing responded If the network can be both decentralized and imbued with empathy rather than characterized by violent exploitation then we re safe I expect it will land in between hopefully leaning toward the positive For example I expect our understanding of self and freedom will be greatly impacted by an instrumentation of a large part of memory through personal logs and our data exhaust being recognized as valuable just like when we shed the term junk DNA Networked AI will bring us new insights into our own lives that might seem as far fetched today as it would have been 30 years ago to say I ll tell you what music your friends are discovering right now AI is most likely to augment humanity for the better but it will take longer and not be done as well as it could be Hopefully we ll build it in a way that will help us be comparably understanding to others Daniel A Menasce professor of computer science at George Mason University commented AI and related technologies coupled with significant advances in computer power and decreasing costs will allow specialists in a variety of disciplines to perform more efficiently and will allow non specialists to use computer systems to augment their skills Some examples include health delivery smart cities and smart buildings For these applications to become reality easy to use user interfaces or better yet transparent user interfaces will have to be developed David Wells chief financial officer at Netflix at the time he responded to this study responded Technology progression and advancement has always been met with fear and anxiety giving way to tremendous gains for humankind as we learn to enhance the best of the changes and adapt and alter the worst Continued networked AI will be no different but the pace of technological change has increased which is different and requires us to more quickly adapt This pace is different and presents challenges for some human groups and societies that we will need to acknowledge and work through to avoid marginalization and political conflict But the gains from better education medical care and crime reduction will be well worth the challenges Rik Farrow editor of login for the USENIX association wrote Humans do poorly when it comes to making decisions based on facts rather than emotional issues Humans get distracted easily There are certainly things that AI can do better than humans like driving cars handling finances even diagnosing illnesses Expecting human doctors to know everything about the varieties of disease and humans is silly Let computers do what they are good at Steve Crocker CEO and co founder of Shinkuro Inc and Internet Hall of Fame member responded AI and human machine interaction has been under vigorous development for the past 50 years The advances have been enormous The results are marbled through all of our products and systems Graphics speech and language understanding are now taken for granted Encyclopedic knowledge is available at our fingertips Instant communication with anyone anywhere exists for about half the world at minimal cost The effects on productivity lifestyle and reduction of risks both natural and man made have been extraordinary and will continue As with any technology there are opportunities for abuse but the challenges for the next decade or so are not significantly different from the challenges mankind has faced in the past Perhaps the largest existential threat has been the potential for nuclear holocaust In comparison the concerns about AI are significantly less James Kadtke expert on converging technologies at the Institute for National Strategic Studies at the U S National Defense University wrote Barring the deployment of a few different radically new technologies such as general AI or commercial quantum computers the internet and AI between now and 2030 will proceed on an evolutionary trajectory Expect internet access and sophistication to be considerably greater but not radically different and also expect that malicious actors using the internet will have greater sophistication and power Whether we can control both these trends for positive outcomes is a public policy issue more than a technological one Tim Morgan a respondent who provided no identifying details said Human AI collaboration over the next 12 years will improve the overall quality of life by finding new approaches to persistent problems We will use these adaptive algorithmic tools to explore whole new domains in every industry and field of study materials science biotech medicine agriculture engineering energy transportation and more This goes beyond computability into human relationships AIs are beginning to understand and speak the human language of emotion The potential of affective computing ranges from productivity increasing adaptive interfaces to pre crime security monitoring of airports and other gathering places to companion pets which monitor their aging owners and interact with them in ways that improve their health and disposition Will there be unseen dangers or consequences Definitely That is our pattern with our tools We invent them use them to improve our lives and then refine them when we find problems AI is no different Ashok Goel director of the human centered computing Ph D program at Georgia Tech wrote Human AI interaction will be multimodal We will directly converse with AIs for example However much of the impact of AI will come in enhancing human human interaction across both space we will be networked with others and time we will have access to all our previously acquired knowledge This will aid augment and amplify individual and collective human intelligence in unprecedented and powerful ways David Cake an leader with Electronic Frontiers Australia and vice chair of the ICANN GNSO Council wrote In general machine learning and related technologies have the capacity to greatly reduce human error in many areas where it is currently very problematic and make available good appropriately tailored advice to people to whom it is currently unavailable in literally almost every field of human endeavour Fred Baker an independent networking technologies consultant longtime leader in the Internet Engineering Task Force and engineering fellow with Cisco commented In my opinion developments have not been out of control in the sense that the creation of Terminator s Skynet or the HAL 9000 computer might depict them Rather we have learned to automate processes in which neural networks have been able to follow data to its conclusion which we call big data unaided and uncontaminated by human intuition and sometimes the results have surprised us These remain and in my opinion will remain to be interpreted by human beings and used for our purposes Bob Frankston software innovation pioneer and technologist based in North America wrote It could go either way AI could be a bureaucratic straitjacket and tool of surveillance I m betting that machine learning will be like the X ray in giving us the ability to see new wholes and gain insights Perry Hewitt a marketing content and technology executive wrote Today voice activated technologies are an untamed beast in our homes Some 16 of Americans have a smart speaker and yet they are relatively dumb devices They misinterpret questions offer generic answers and to the consternation of some are turning our kids into a holes I am bullish on human machine interactions developing a better understanding of and improving our daily routines I think in particular of the working parent often although certainly not exclusively a woman who carries so much information in their head What if a human machine collaboration could stock the house with essentials schedule the pre camp pediatrician appointments and prompt drivers for the alternate side parking street cleaning rules The ability for narrow AI to assimilate new information the bus is supposed to come at 7 10 but a month into the school year is known to actually come at 7 16 could keep a family connected and informed with the right data and reduce the mental load of household management John McNutt a professor in the school of public policy and administration at the University of Delaware responded Throwing out technology because there is a potential downside is not how human progress takes place In public service a turbulent environment has created a situation where knowledge overload can seriously degrade our ability to do the things that are essential to implement policies and serve the public good AI can be the difference between a public service that works well and one that creates more problems than it solves Randy Marchany chief information security officer at Virginia Tech and director of Virginia Tech s IT Security Laboratory said AI human interaction in 2030 will be in its infancy stage AI will need to go to school in a manner similar to humans They will amass large amounts of data collected by various sources but need ethics training to make good decisions Just as kids are taught a wide variety of info and some sort of ethics religion social manners etc AI will need similar training Will AI get the proper training Who decides the training content Robert Stratton cybersecurity expert said While there is widespread acknowledgement in a variety of disciplines of the potential benefits of machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies progress has been tempered by their misapplication Part of data science is knowing the right tool for a particular job As more rigorous practitioners begin to gain comfort and apply these tools to other corpora it s reasonable to expect some significant gains in efficiency insight or profitability in many fields This may not be visible to consumers except through increased product choice but it may include everything from drug discovery to driving A data analyst for an organization developing marketing solutions said Assuming that policies are in place to prevent the abuse of AI and programs are in place to find new jobs for those who would be career displaced there is a lot of potential in AI integration By 2030 most AI will be used for marketing purposes and be more annoying to people than anything else as they are bombarded with personalized ads and recommendations The rest of AI usage will be its integration into more tedious and repetitive tasks across career fields Implementing AI in this fashion will open up more time for humans to focus on long term and in depth tasks that will allow further and greater societal progression For example AI can be trained to identify and codify qualitative information from surveys reviews articles etc far faster and in greater quantities than even a team of humans can By having AI perform these tasks analysts can spend more time parsing the data for trends and information that can then be used to make more informed decisions faster and allow for speedier turn around times Minor product faults can be addressed before they become widespread scientists can generate semiannual reports on environmental changes rather than annual or biannual Helena Draganik a professor at the University of Gdansk in Poland responded AI will not change humans It will change the relations between them because it can serve as an interpreter of communication It will change our habits as an intermediation technology AI will be a great commodity It will help in cases of health problems diseases It will also generate a great data industry big data market and a lack of anonymity and privacy Humanity will more and more depend on energy electricity These factors will create new social cultural security and political problems There are those who think there won t be much change by 2030 Christine Boese digital strategies professional commented I believe it is as William Gibson postulated The future is already here it just not very evenly distributed What I know from my work in user experience design and in exposure to many different Fortune 500 IT departments working in big data and analytics is that the promise and potential of AI and machine learning is VASTLY overstated There has been so little investment in basic infrastructure entire chunks of our systems won t even be interoperable The AI and machine learning code will be there in a pocket here a pocket there but system wide it is unlikely to be operating reliably as part of the background radiation against which many of us play and work online An anonymous respondent wrote While various deployments of new data science and computation will help firms cut costs reduce fraud and support decision making that involves access to more information than an individual can manage organisations professions markets and regulators public and private usually take many more than 12 years to adapt effectively to a constantly changing set of technologies and practices This generally causes a decline in service quality insecurity over jobs and investments new monopoly businesses distorting markets and social values etc For example many organisations will be under pressure to buy and implement new services but unable to access reliable market information on how to do this leading to bad investments distractions from core business and labour and customer disputes Mario Morino chairman of the Morino Institute and co founder of Venture Philanthropy Partners commented While I believe AI ML will bring enormous benefits it may take us several decades to navigate through the disruption and transition they will introduce on multiple levels Daniel Berninger an internet pioneer who led the first VoIP deployments at Verizon HP and NASA currently founder at Voice Communication Exchange Committee VCXC said The luminaries claiming artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence and promoting robot reverence imagine exponentially improving computation pushes machine self actualization from science fiction into reality The immense valuations awarded Google Facebook Amazon Tesla et al rely on this machine dominance hype to sell infinite scaling As with all hype pretending reality does not exist does not make reality go away Moore s Law does not concede the future to machines because human domination of the planet does not owe to computation Any road map granting machines self determination includes miracle as one of the steps You cannot turn a piece of wood into a real boy AI merely models human activity No amount of improvement in the development of these models turns the model into the thing Robot reverence attempts plausibility by collapsing the breadth of human potential and capacities It operates via denialism with advocates disavowing the importance of anything they cannot model In particular super AI requires pretending human will and consciousness do not exist Human beings remain the source of all intent and the judge of all outcomes Machines provide mere facilitation and mere efficiency in the journey from intent to outcome The dehumanizing nature of automation and the diseconomy of scale of human intelligence is already causing headaches that reveal another AI Winter arriving well before 2030 Paul Kainen futurist and director of the Lab for Visual Mathematics at Georgetown University commented Quantum cat here I expect complex superposition of strong positive negative and null as typical impact for AI For the grandkids sake we must be positive The following one liners from anonymous respondents also tie into AI in 2030 Other anonymous respondents commented The hopeful experts in this sample generally expect that AI will work to optimize augment and improve human activities and experiences They say it will save time and it will save lives via health advances and the reduction of risks and of poverty They expect it will spur innovation and broaden opportunities increase the value of human to human experiences augment humans and increase individuals overall satisfaction with life Clay Shirky writer and consultant on the social and economic effects of internet technologies and vice president at New York University said All previous forms of labor saving devices from the level to the computer have correlated with increased health and lifespan in the places that have adopted them Jamais Cascio research fellow at the Institute for the Future wrote Although I do believe that in 2030 AI will have made our lives better I suspect that popular media of the time will justifiably highlight the large scale problems displaced workers embedded bias and human systems being too deferential to machine systems But AI is more than robot soldiers autonomous cars or digital assistants with quirky personalities Most of the AI we will encounter in 2030 will be in the walls behind the scenes systems built to adapt workspaces living spaces and the urban environment to better suit our needs Medical AI will keep track of medication and alert us to early signs of health problems Environmental AI will monitor air quality heat index and other indicators relevant to our day s tasks Our visual and audio surroundings may be altered or filtered to improve our moods better our focus or otherwise alter our subconscious perceptions of the world Most of this AI will be functionally invisible to us as long as it s working properly The explicit human machine interface will be with a supervisor system that coordinates all of the sub AI and undoubtedly there will be a lively business in creating supervisor systems with quirky personalities Mike Meyer chief information officer at Honolulu Community College wrote Social organizations will be increasingly administered by AI ML systems to ensure equity and consistency in provisioning of services to the population The steady removal of human emotion driven discrimination will rebalance social organizations creating true equitable opportunity to all people for the first time in human history People will be part of these systems as censors in the old imperial Chinese model providing human emotional intelligence where that is needed to smooth social management All aspects of human existence will be affected by the integration of AI into human societies Historically this type of base paradigmatic change is both difficult and unstoppable The results will be primarily positive but will produce problems both in the process of change and in totally new types of problems that will result from the ways that people do adapt the new technology based processes Mark Crowley an assistant professor expert in machine learning and core member of the Institute for Complexity and Innovation at the University of Waterloo in Ontario Canada wrote While driving home on a long commute from work the human will be reading a book in the heads up screen of the windshield The car will be driving autonomously on the highway for the moment The driver will have an idea to note down and add to a particular document all this will be done via voice In the middle of this a complicated traffic arrangement will be seen approaching via other networked cars The AI will politely interrupt the driver put away the heads up display and warn the driver they may need to take over in the next 10 seconds or so The conversation will be flawless and natural like Jarvis in Avengers even charming But it will be tasks focused to the car personal events notes and news Theodore Gordon futurist management consultant and co founder of the Millennium Project commented There will be ups and downs surely but the net is I believe good The most encouraging uses of AI will be in early warning of terror activities incipient diseases and environmental threats and in improvements in decision making Yvette Wohn director of the Social Interaction Lab and expert on human computer interaction at the New Jersey Institute of Technology said One area in which artificial intelligence will become more sophisticated will be in its ability to enrich the quality of life so that the current age of workaholism will transition into a society where leisure the arts entertainment and culture are able to enhance the well being of society in developed countries and solve issues of water production food growth distribution and basic health provision in developing countries Ken Goldberg distinguished chair in engineering director of AUTOLAB s and CITRIS people and robots initiative and founding member of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab at the University of California Berkeley said As in the past 50 years AI will be combined with IA intelligence augmentation to enhance humans ability to work One example might be an AI based Devil s Advocate that would challenge my decisions with insightful questions as long as I can turn it off periodically Rich Ling a professor of media technology at Nanyang Technological University responded The ability to address complex issues and to better respond to and facilitate the needs of people will be the dominant result of AI An anonymous respondent wrote There will be an explosive increase in the number of autonomous cognitive agents e g robots and humans will interact more and more with them being unaware most of the time if it is interactivity with a robot or with another human This will increase the number of personal assistants and the level of service Fred Davis mentor at Runway Incubator in San Francisco responded As daily a user of the Google Assistant on my phone and both Google Home and Alexa I feel like AI has already been delivering significant benefits to my daily life for a few years My wife and I take having an always on omnipresent assistant on hand for granted at this point Google Home s ability to tell us apart and even respond with different voices is a major step forward in making computers people literate rather than the other way around There s always a concern about privacy but so far it hasn t caused us any problems Obviously this could change and instead of a helpful friend I might look at these assistants as creepy strangers Maintaining strict privacy and security controls is essential for these types of services Andrew Tutt an expert in law and author of An FDA for Algorithms which called for critical thought about how best to prevent deter and compensate for the harms that they cause said AI will be absolutely pervasive and absolutely seamless in its integration with everyday life It will simply become accepted that AI are responsible for ever more complex and ever more human tasks By 2030 it will be accepted that when you wish to hail a taxi the taxi will have no driver it will be an autonomously driven vehicle Robots will be responsible for more dynamic and complex roles in manufacturing plants and warehouses Digital assistants will play an important and interactive role in everyday interactions ranging from buying a cup of coffee to booking a salon appointment It will no longer be unexpected to call a restaurant to book a reservation for example and speak to a digital assistant who will pencil you in These interactions will be incremental but become increasingly common and increasingly normal My hope is that the increasing integration of AI into everyday life will vastly increase the amount of time that people can devote to tasks they find meaningful L Schomaker professor at the University of Groningen and scientific director of the Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Engineering ALICE research institute said In the 1990s you went to a PC on a desktop in a room in your house In the 2010s you picked a phone from your pocket and switched it on By 2030 you will be online 24 7 via miniature devices such as in ear continuous support advice and communications Michael Wollowski associate professor of computer science and software engineering at Rose Hulman Institute of Technology and expert in the Internet of Things diagrammatic systems and artificial intelligence wrote Assuming that industry and government are interested in letting the consumer choose and influence the future there will be many fantastic advances of AI I believe that AI and the Internet of Things will bring about a situation in which technology will be our guardian angel For example self driving cars will let us drive faster than we ever drove before but they will only let us do things that they can control Since computers have much better reaction time than people it will be quite amazing Similarly AI and the Internet of Things will let us conduct our lives to the fullest while ensuring that we live healthy lives Again it is like having a guardian angel that lets us do things knowing they can save us from stupidity Steve King partner at Emergent Research said 2030 is less than 12 years away So the most likely scenario is AI will have a modest impact on the lives of most humans over this time frame Having said that we think the use of AI systems will continue to expand with the greatest growth coming from systems that augment and complement human capabilities and decision making This is not to say there won t be negative impacts from the use of AI Jobs will be replaced and certain industries will be disrupted Even scarier there are many ways AI can be weaponized But like most technological advancements we think the overall impact of AI will be additive at least over the next decade or so Vassilis Galanos a Ph D student and teaching assistant actively researching future human machine symbiosis at the University of Edinburgh commented 2030 is not that far away so there is no room for extremely utopian dystopian hopes and fears Given that AI is already used in everyday life social media algorithms suggestions smartphones digital assistants health care and more it is quite probable that humans will live in a harmonious co existence with AI as much as they do now to a certain extent with computer and internet technologies Charlie Firestone communications and society program executive director and vice president at the Aspen Institute commented I remain optimistic that AI will be a tool that humans will use far more widely than today to enhance quality of life such as medical remedies education and the environment For example the AI will help us to conserve energy in homes and in transportation by identifying exact times and temperatures we need identifying sources of energy that will be the cheapest and the most efficient There certainly are dire scenarios particularly in the use of AI for surveillance a likely occurrence by 2030 I am hopeful that AI and other technologies will identify new areas of employment as it eliminates many jobs Pedro U Lima an associate professor of computer science at Instituto Superior T cnico in Lisbon Portugal said Overall I see AI based technology relieving us from repetitive and or heavy and or dangerous tasks opening new challenges for our activities I envisage autonomous mobile robots networked with a myriad of other smart devices helping nurses and doctors at hospitals in daily activities working as a third hand and physical and emotional support to patients I see something similar happening in factories where networked robot systems will help workers on their tasks relieving them from heavy duties John Laird a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan responded There will be a continual off loading of mundane intellectual and physical tasks on to AI and robotic systems In addition to helping with everyday activities it will significantly help the mentally and physically impaired and disabled There will also be improvements in customized individualized education and training of humans and conversely the customization of AI systems by everyday users We will be transitioning from current programming practices to user customization Automated driving will be a reality eliminating many deaths but also having significant societal changes Steven Polunsky director of the Alabama Transportation Policy Research Center at the University of Alabama wrote AI will allow public transportation systems to better serve existing customers by adjusting routes travel times and stops to optimize service New customers will also see advantages Smart transportation systems will allow public transit to network with traffic signals and providers of last mile trips to minimize traffic disruption and inform decision making about modal rail bus mobility on demand planning and purchasing Sanjiv Das a professor of data science and finance at Santa Clara University responded AI will enhance search to create interactive reasoning and analytical systems Search engines today do not know why we want some information and hence cannot reason about it They also do not interact with us to help with analysis An AI system that collects information based on knowing why it is needed and then asks more questions to refine its search would be clearly available well before 2030 These search thinking bots will also write up analyses based on parameters elicited from conversation and imbue these analyses with different political left right and linguistic aggressive mild slants chosen by the human using advances in language generation which are already well under way These intellectual agents will become companions helping us make sense of our information overload I often collect files of material on my cloud drive that I found interesting or needed to read later and these agents would be able to summarize and engage me in a discussion of these materials very much like an intellectual companion It is unclear to me if I would need just one such agent though it seems likely that different agents with diverse personalities may be more interesting As always we should worry what the availability of such agents might mean for normal human social interaction but I can also see many advantages in freeing up time for socializing with other humans as well as enriched interactions based on knowledge and science assisted by our new intellectual companions Lawrence Roberts designer and manager of ARPANET the precursor to the internet and Internet Hall of Fame member commented AI voice recognition or text with strong context understanding and response will allow vastly better access to website program documentation voice call answering and all such interactions will greatly relieve user frustration with getting information It will mostly provide service where no or little human support is being replaced as it is not available today in large part For example finding and or doing a new or unused function of the program or website one is using Visual 3D space recognition AI to support better than human robot activity including vehicles security surveillance health scans and much more Christopher Yoo a professor of law communication and computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania Law School responded AI is good at carrying out tasks that follow repetitive patterns In fact AI is better than humans Shifting these functions to machines will improve performance It will also allow people to shift their efforts to high value added and more rewarding directions an increasingly critical consideration in developing world countries where population is declining Research on human computer interaction HCI also reveals that AI driven pattern recognition will play a critical role in expanding humans ability to extend the benefits of computerization HCI once held that our ability to gain the benefit from computers would be limited by the total amount of time people can spend sitting in front of a screen and inputting characters through a keyboard The advent of AI driven HCI will allow that to expand further and will reduce the amount of customization that people will have to program in by hand At the same time AI is merely a tool All tools have their limits and can be misused Even when humans are making the decisions instead of machines blindly following the results of a protocol without exercising any judgment can have disastrous results Future applications of AI will thus likely involve both humans and machines if they are to fulfill their potential Joseph Konstan distinguished professor of computer science specializing in human computer interaction and AI at the University of Minnesota predicted Widespread deployment of AI has immense potential to help in key areas that affect a large portion of the world s population including agriculture transportation more efficiently getting food to people and energy Even as soon as 2030 I expect we ll see substantial benefits for many who are today disadvantaged including the elderly and physically handicapped who will have greater choices for mobility and support and those in the poorest part of the world A number of expert insights on this topic were shared earlier in this report These additional observations add to the discussion of hopes and concerns about the future of human jobs This segment starts with comments from those who are hopeful that the job situation and related social issues will turn out well It is followed by statements from those who are pessimistic Bob Metcalfe Internet Hall of Fame member co inventor of Ethernet founder of 3Com and now professor of innovation and entrepreneurship at the University of Texas at Austin said Pessimists are often right but they never get anything done All technologies come with problems sure but generally they get solved The hardest problem I see is the evolution of work Hard to figure out Forty percent of us used to know how to milk cows but now less than 1 do We all used to tell elevator operators which floor we wanted and now we press buttons Most of us now drive cars and trucks and trains but that s on the verge of being over AIs are most likely not going to kill jobs They will handle parts of jobs enhancing the productivity of their humans Stowe Boyd founder and managing director at Work Futures said There is a high possibility that unchecked expansion of AI could rapidly lead to widespread unemployment My bet is that governments will step in to regulate the spread of AI to slow the impacts of this phenomenon as a result of unrest by the mid 2020s That regulation might include for example not allowing AIs to serve as managers of people in the workplace but only to augment the work of people on a task or process level So we might see high degrees of automation in warehouses but a human being would be in charge in some sense Likewise fully autonomous freighters might be blocked by regulations An anonymous respondent wrote Repeatedly throughout history people have worried that new technologies would eliminate jobs This has never happened so I m very skeptical it will this time Having said that there will be major short term disruptions in the labor market and smart governments should begin to plan for this by considering changes to unemployment insurance universal basic income health insurance etc This is particularly the case in America where so many benefits are tied to employment I would say there is almost zero chance that the U S government will actually do this so there will be a lot of pain and misery in the short and medium term but I do think ultimately machines and humans will peacefully coexist Also I think a lot of the projections on the use of AI are ridiculous Regardless of the existence of the technology cross state shipping is not going to be taken over by automated trucks any time soon because of legal and ethical issues that have not been worked out Steven Miller vice provost and professor of information systems at Singapore Management University said It helps to have a sense of the history of technological change over the past few hundred years even longer Undoubtedly new ways of using machines and new machine capabilities will be used to create economic activities and services that were either a not previously possible or b previously too scarce and expensive and now can be plentiful and inexpensive This will create a lot of new activities and opportunities At the same time we know some existing tasks and jobs with a high proportion of those tasks will be increasingly automated So we will simultaneously have both new opportunity creation as well as technological displacement Even so the long term track record shows that human societies keep finding ways of creating more and more economically viable jobs Cognitive automation will obviously enhance the realms of automation but even with tremendous progress in this technology there are and will continue to be limits Humans have remarkable capabilities to deal with and adapt to change so I do not see the end of human work The ways people and machines combine together will change and there will be many new types of human machine symbiosis Those who understand this and learn to benefit from it will proposer Henry E Brady dean of the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California Berkeley wrote AI can replace people in jobs that require sophisticated and accurate pattern matching driving diagnoses based upon medical imaging proofreading and other areas There is also the fact that in the past technological change has mostly led to new kinds of jobs rather than the net elimination of jobs Furthermore I also believe that there may be limits to what AI can do It is very good at pattern matching but human intelligence goes far beyond pattern matching and it is not clear that computers will be able to compete with humans beyond pattern matching It also seems clear that even the best algorithms will require constant human attention to update check and revise them Geoff Livingston author and futurist commented The term AI misleads people What we should call the trend is machine learning or algorithms Weak AI as it is called today s AI reduces repetitive tasks that most people find mundane This in turn produces an opportunity to escape the trap of the proletariat being forced into monotonous labor to earn a living Instead of thinking of the Terminator we should view the current trend as an opportunity to seek out and embrace the tasks that we truly love including more creative pursuits If we embrace the inevitable evolution of technology to replace redundant tasks we can encourage today s youth to pursue more creative and strategic pursuits Further today s workers can learn how to manage machine learning or embrace training to pursue new careers that they may enjoy more My fear is that many will simply reject change and blame technology as has often been done One could argue much of today s populist uprising we are experiencing globally finds its roots in the current displacements caused by machine learning as typified by smart manufacturing If so the movement forward will be troublesome rife with dark bends and turns that we may regret as cultures and countries Marek Havrda director at NEOPAS and strategic adviser for the GoodAI project a private research and development company based in Prague that focuses on the development of artificial general intelligence and AI applications explained the issue from his point of view The development and implementation of artificial intelligence has brought about questions of the impact it will have on employment Machines are beginning to fill jobs that have been traditionally reserved for humans such as driving a car or prescribing medical treatment How these trends may unfold is a crucial question We may expect the emergence of super labour a labour defined by super high added value of human activity due to augmentation by AI Apart from the ability to deploy AI super labour will be characterised by creativity and the ability to co direct and supervise safe exploration of business opportunities together with perseverance in attaining defined goals An example may be that by using various online AI gig workers and maybe several human gig workers while leveraging AI to its maximum potential at all aspects from product design to marketing and after sales care three people could create a new service and ensure its smooth delivery for which a medium size company would be needed today We can expect growing inequalities between those who have access and are able to use technology and those who do not However it seems more important how big a slice of the AI co generated pie is accessible to all citizens in absolute terms e g having enough to finance public service and other public spending which would make everyone better off than in pre AI age than the relative inequalities Yoram Kalman an associate professor at the Open University of Israel and member of The Center for Internet Research at the University of Haifa wrote In essence technologies that empower people also improve their lives I see that progress in the area of human machine collaboration empowers people by improving their ability to communicate and to learn and thus my optimism I do not fear that these technologies will take the place of people since history shows that again and again people used technologies to augment their abilities and to be more fulfilled Although in the past too it seemed as if these technologies would leave people unemployed and useless human ingenuity and the human spirit always found new challenges that could best be tackled by humans Thomas H Davenport distinguished professor of information technology and management at Babson College and fellow of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy responded So far most implementations of AI have resulted in some form of augmentation not automation Surveys of managers suggest that relatively few have automation based job loss as the goal of their AI initiatives So while I am sure there will be some marginal job loss I expect that AI will free up workers to be more creative and to do more unstructured work Yvette Wohn director of the Social Interaction Lab and expert on human computer interaction at the New Jersey Institute of Technology commented Artificial intelligence will be naturally integrated into our everyday lives Even though people are concerned about computers replacing the jobs of humans the best case scenario is that technology will be augmenting human capabilities and performing functions that humans do not like to do Smart farms and connected distribution systems will hopefully eliminate urban food deserts and enable food production in areas not suited for agriculture Artificial intelligence will also become better at connecting people and provide immediate support to people who are in crisis situations A principal architect for a major global technology company responded AI is a prerequisite to achieving a post scarcity world in which people can devote their lives to intellectual pursuits and leisure rather than to labor The first step will be to reduce the amount of labor required for production of human necessities Reducing tedium will require changes to the social fabric and economic relationships between people as the demand for labor shrinks below the supply but if these challenges can be met then everyone will be better off Tom Hood an expert in corporate accounting and finance said By 2030 AI will stand for Augmented Intelligence and will play an ever increasing role in working side by side with humans in all sectors to add its advanced and massive cognitive and learning capabilities to critical human domains like medicine law accounting engineering and technology Imagine a personal bot powered by artificial intelligence working by your side in your laptop or smartphone making recommendations on key topics by providing up to the minute research or key pattern recognition and analysis of your organization s data One example is a CPA in tax given a complex global tax situation amid constantly changing tax laws in all jurisdictions who would be able to research and provide guidance on the most complex global issues in seconds It is my hope for the future of artificial intelligence in 2030 that we will be augmenting our intelligence with these machines A professor of computer science expert in systems who works at a major U S technological university wrote By 2030 we should expect advances in AI networking and other technologies enabled by AI and networks e g the growing areas of persuasive and motivational technologies to improve the workplace in many ways beyond replacing humans with robots The following one liners from anonymous respondents express a bright future for human jobs A section earlier in this report shared a number of key experts concerns about the potential negative impact of AI on the socioeconomic future if steps are not taken soon to begin to adjust to a future with far fewer jobs for humans Many additional respondents to this canvassing shared fears about this Wout de Natris an internet cybercrime and security consultant based in Rotterdam Netherlands wrote Hope Advancement in health care education decision making availability of information higher standards in ICT security global cooperation on these issues etc Fear Huge segments of society especially the middle classes who carry society in most ways e g through taxes savings and purchases will be rendered jobless through endless economic cuts by industry followed by governments due to lower tax income Hence all of society suffers Can governments and industry refrain from an overkill of surveillance Otherwise privacy values keep declining leading to a lower quality of life Jonathan Taplin director emeritus at the University of Southern California s Annenberg Innovation Lab wrote My fear is that the current political class is completely unprepared for the disruptions that AI and robotics applied at scale will bring to our economy While techno utopians point to universal basic income as a possible solution to wide scale unemployment there is no indication that anyone in politics has an appetite for such a solution And because I believe that meaningful work is essential to human dignity I m not sure that universal basic income would be helpful in the first place Alex Halavais an associate professor of social technologies at Arizona State University wrote AI is likely to rapidly displace many workers over the next 10 years and so there will be some potentially significant negative effects at the social and economic level in the short run Uta Russmann professor in the department of communication at FHWien der WKW University of Applied Sciences for Management Communication said Many people will not be benefitting from this development as robots will do their jobs Blue collar workers people working in supermarkets stacking shelves etc will not be needed less but the job market will not offer them any other possibilities The gap between rich and poor will increase as the need for highly skilled and very well paid people increases and the need for less skilled workers will decrease tremendously Ross Stapleton Gray principal at Stapleton Gray and Associates an information technology and policy consulting firm commented Human machine interaction could be for good or for ill It will be hugely influenced by decisions on social priorities We may be at a tipping point in recognizing that social inequities need to be addressed so say a decreased need for human labor due to AI will result in more time for leisure education etc instead of increasing wealth inequity Aneesh Aneesh author of Global Labor Algocratic Modes of Organization and professor at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee responded Just as automation left large groups of working people behind even as the United States got wealthier as a country it is quite likely that AI systems will automate the service sector in a similar way Unless the welfare state returns with a vengeance it is difficult to see the increased aggregate wealth resulting in any meaningful gains for the bottom half of society Alper Dincel of T C Istanbul Kultur University in Turkey wrote Unqualified people won t find jobs as machines and programs take over easy work in the near future Machines will also solve performance problems There is no bright future for most people if we don t start to try finding solutions Jason Abbott professor and director at the Center for Asian Democracy at University of Louisville said AI is likely to create significant challenges to the labor force as previously skilled semi skilled jobs are replaced by AI everything from AI in trucks and distribution to airlines logistics and even medical records and diagnoses Kenneth R Fleischmann an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin s School of Information responded In corporate settings I worry that AI will be used to replace human workers to a disproportionate extent such that the net economic benefit of AI is positive but that economic benefit is not distributed equally among individuals with a smaller number of wealthy individuals worldwide prospering and a larger number of less wealthy individuals worldwide suffering from fewer opportunities for gainful employment Gerry Ellis founder and digital usability and accessibility consultant at Feel The BenefIT responded Technology has always been far more quickly developed and adopted in the richer parts of the world than in the poorer regions where new technology is generally not affordable AI cannot be taken as a stand alone technology but in conjunction with other converging technologies like augmented reality robotics virtual reality the Internet of Things big data analysis etc It is estimated that around 80 of jobs that will be done in 2030 do not exist yet One of the reasons why unskilled and particularly repetitive jobs migrate to poor countries is because of cheap labour costs but AI combined with robotics will begin to do many of these jobs For all of these reasons combined the large proportion of the earth s population that lives in the under developed and developing world is likely to be left behind by technological developments Unless the needs of people with disabilities are taken into account when designing AI related technologies the same is true for them or I should say us as I am blind Karen Oates director of workforce development and financial stability for La Casa de Esperanza commented Ongoing increases in the use of AI will not benefit the working poor and low to middle income people Having worked with these populations for 10 years I ve already observed many of these people losing employment when robots and self operating forklifts are implemented Although there are opportunities to program and maintain these machines realistically people who have the requisite knowledge and education will fill those roles The majority of employers will be unwilling to invest the resources to train employees unless there is an economic incentive from the government to do so Many lower wage workers won t have the confidence to return to school to develop new knowledge skills when they were unsuccessful in the past As the use of AI increases low wage workers will lose the small niche they hold in our economy Peggy Lahammer director of health life sciences at Robins Kaplan LLP and legal market analyst commented Jobs will continue to change and as many disappear new ones will be created These changes will have an impact on society as many people are left without the necessary skills A European computer science professor expert in machine learning commented The social sorting systems introduced by AI will most likely define and further entrench the existing world order of the haves and the have nots making social mobility more difficult and precarious given the unpredictability of AI driven judgements of fit The interesting problem to solve will be the fact that initial designs of AI will come with built in imaginaries of what good or correct constitutes The level of flexibility designed in to allow for changes in normative perceptions and judgements will be key to ensuring that AI driven systems support rather than obstruct productive social change Stephen McDowell a professor of communication at Florida State University and expert in new media and internet governance commented Much of our daily lives is made up of routines and habits that we repeat and AI could assist in these practices However just because some things we do are repetitive does not mean they are insignificant We draw a lot of meaning from things we do on a daily weekly or annual basis whether by ourselves or with others Cultural practices such as cooking shopping cleaning coordinating and telling stories are crucial parts of building our families and larger communities Similarly at work some of the routines are predictable but are also how we gain a sense of mastery and expertise in a specific domain In both these examples we will have to think about how we define knowledge expertise collaboration and growth and development David Sarokin author of Missed Information Better Information for Building a Wealthier More Sustainable Future commented My biggest concern is that our educational system will not keep up with the demands of our modern times It is doing a poor job of providing the foundations to our students As more and more jobs are usurped by AI endowed machines everything from assembling cars to flipping burgers those entering the workplace will need a level of technical sophistication that few graduates possess these days Justin Amyx a technician with Comcast said My worry is automation Automation occurs usually with mundane tasks that fill low paying blue collar and under jobs Those jobs will disappear lawn maintenance truck drivers and fast food to name a few Those un skilled or low skilled workers will be jobless Unless we have training programs to take care of worker displacement there will be issues Many of these experts have high hopes for continued incremental advances across all aspects of health care and life extension They predict a rise in access to various tools including digital agents that can perform rudimentary exams with no need to visit a clinic a reduction in medical errors and better faster recognition of risks and solutions They also worry over the potential for a widening health care divide between those who can afford cutting edge tools and treatments and those less privileged They express concerns about the potential for data abuses such as the denial of insurance or coverage or benefits for select people or procedures Leonard Kleinrock Internet Hall of Fame member and co director of the first host to host online connection and professor of computer science at the University of California Los Angeles predicted As AI and machine learning improve we will see highly customized interactions between humans and their health care needs This mass customization will enable each human to have her medical history DNA profile drug allergies genetic makeup etc always available to any caregiver medical professional that they engage with and this will be readily accessible to the individual as well Their care will be tailored to their specific needs and the very latest advances will be able to be provided rapidly after the advances are established The rapid provision of the best medical treatment will provide great benefits In hospital settings such customized information will dramatically reduce the occurrence of medical injuries and deaths due to medical errors My hope and expectation is that intelligent agents will be able to assess the likely risks and the benefits that ensue from proposed treatments and procedures far better than is done now by human evaluators such humans even experts typically being poor decision makers in the face of uncertainty But to bring this about there will need to be carefully conducted tests and experimentation to assess the quality of the outcomes of AI based decision making in this field However as with any optimized system one must continually be aware of the fragility of optimized systems when they are applied beyond the confines of their range of applicability Kenneth Grady futurist founding author of the Algorithmic Society blog and adjunct and advisor at the Michigan State University College of Law responded In the next dozen years AI will still be moving through a phase where it will augment what humans can do It will help us sift through organize and even evaluate the mountains of data we create each day For example doctors today still work with siloed data Each patient s vital signs medicines dosage rates test results and side effects remain trapped in isolated systems Doctors must evaluate this data without the benefit of knowing how it compares to the thousands of other patients around the country or world with similar problems They struggle to turn the data into effective treatments by reading research articles and mentally comparing them to each patient s data As it evolves AI will improve the process Instead of episodic studies doctors will have near real time access to information showing the effects of treatment regimes Benefits and risks of drug interactions will be identified faster Novel treatments will become evident more quickly Doctors will still manage the last mile interpreting the analysis generated through AI This human in the loop approach will remain critical during this phase As powerful as AI will become it still will not match humans on understanding how to integrate treatment with values When will a family sacrifice effectiveness of treatment to prolong quality of life When two life threatening illnesses compete which will the patient want treated first This will be an important learning phase as humans understand the limits of AI Charles Zheng a researcher in machine learning and AI with the National Institute of Mental Health commented In the year 2030 I expect AI will be more powerful than they currently are but not yet at human level for most tasks A patient checking into a hospital will be directed to the correct desk by a robot The receptionist will be aided by software that listens to their conversation with the patient and automatically populates the information fields without needing the receptionist to type the information Another program cross references the database in the cloud to check for errors The patient s medical images would first be automatically labeled by a computer program before being sent to a radiologist A professor of computer science expert in systems who works at a major U S technological university wrote By 2030 physiological monitoring devices e g lower heartbeats and decreasing blood sugar levels could indicate lower levels of physical alertness Smart apps could detect those decaying physical conditions at an individual level and suggest improvements to the user e g taking a coffee break with a snack Granted there may be large scale problems caused by AI and robots e g massive unemployment but the recent trends seem to indicate small improvements such as health monitor apps outlined above would be more easily developed and deployed successfully Kenneth Cukier author and senior editor at The Economist commented AI will be making more decisions in life and some people will be uneasy with that But these are decisions that are more effectively done by machines such as assessing insurance risk the propensity to repay a loan or to survive a disease A good example is health care Algorithms not doctors will be diagnosing many diseases even if human doctors are still in the loop The benefit is that healthcare can reach down to populations that are today underserved the poor and rural worldwide Gabor Melli senior director of engineering for AI and machine learning for Sony PlayStation responded My hope is that by 2030 most of humanity will have ready access to health care and education through digital agents Kate Eddens research scientist at the Indiana University Network Science Institute responded There is an opportunity for AI to enhance human ability to gain critical information in decision making particularly in the world of health care There are so many moving parts and components to understanding health care needs and deciding how to proceed in treatment and prevention With AI we can program algorithms to help refine those decision making processes but only when we train the AI tools on human thinking a tremendous amount of real data and actual circumstances and experiences There are some contexts in which human bias and emotion can be detrimental to decision making For example breast cancer is over diagnosed and over treated While mammography guidelines have changed to try to reflect this reality strong human emotion powered by anecdotal experience leaves some practitioners unwilling to change their recommendations based on evidence and advocacy groups reluctant to change their stance based on public outcry Perhaps there is an opportunity for AI to calculate a more specific risk for each individual person allowing for a tailored experience amid the broader guidelines If screening guidelines change to recommended based on individual risk it lessens the burden on both the care provider and the individual People still have to make their own decisions but they may be able to do so with more information and a greater understanding of their own risk and reward This is such a low tech and simple example of AI but one in which AI can importantly supplement human decision making without replacing it Angelique Hedberg senior corporate strategy analyst at RTI International said The greatest advancements and achievements will be in health physical mental and environmental The improvements will have positive trickle down impacts on education work gender equality and reduced inequality AI will redefine our understanding of health care optimizing existing processes while simultaneously redefining how we answer questions about what it means to be healthy bringing care earlier in the cycle due to advances in diagnostics and assessment i e in the future preventative care identifies and initiates treatment for illness before symptoms present The advances will not be constrained to humans they will include animals and the built environment This will happen across the disease spectrum Advanced omics will empower better decisions There will be a push and a pull by the market and individuals This is a global story with fragmented and discontinuous moves being played out over the next decade as we witness wildly different experiments in health across the globe This future is full of hope for individuals and communities My greatest hope is for disabled individuals and those currently living with disabilities I m excited for communities and interpersonal connections as the work in this future will allow for and increase the value of the human to human experiences Progress is often only seen in retrospect I hope the speed of exponential change allows everyone to enjoy the benefits of these collaborations An anonymous respondent wrote In health care I hope AI will improve the diagnostics and reduce the number of errors Doctors cannot recall all the possibilities they have problems correlating all the symptoms and recognizing the patterns I hope that in the future patients will be interviewed by computers which will correlate the described symptoms with results of tests I hope that with the further development of AI and cognitive computing there will be fewer errors in reports of medical imaging and diagnosis Eduardo Vendrell a computer science professor at the Polytechnic University of Valencia in Spain responded In the field of health many solutions will appear that will allow us to anticipate current problems and discover other risk situations more efficiently The use of personal gadgets and other domestic devices will allow interacting directly with professionals and institutions in any situation of danger or deterioration of our health Monica Murero director of the E Life International Institute and associate professor in sociology of new technology at the University of Naples Federico II in Italy commented In health care I foresee positive outcomes in terms of reducing human mistakes that are currently still creating several failures Also I foresee an increased development of mobile remote 24 7 health care services and personalized medicine thanks to AI and human machine collaboration applied to the field Uta Russmann professor in the department of communication at FHWien der WKW University of Applied Sciences for Management Communication said Life expectancy is increasing globally and human machine AI collaboration will help older people to manage their life on their own by taking care of them helping them in the household taking down the garbage cleaning up etc as well as keeping them company just like cats and dogs do but it will be a much more advanced interaction Lindsey Andersen an activist at the intersection of human rights and technology for Freedom House and Internews now doing graduate research at Princeton University commented AI will augment human intelligence In health care for example it will help doctors more accurately diagnose and treat disease and continually monitor high risk patients through internet connected medical devices It will bring health care to places with a shortage of doctors allowing health care workers to diagnose and treat disease anywhere in the world and to prevent disease outbreaks before they start An anonymous respondent said The most important place where AI will make a difference is in health care of the elderly Personal assistants are already capable of many important tasks to help make sure older adults stay in their home But adding to that emotion detection more in depth health monitoring and AI based diagnostics will surely enhance the power of these tools Denis Parra assistant professor of computer science in the school of engineering at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile commented I live in a developing country Whilst there are potential negative aspects of AI loss of jobs for people with disabilities AI technology could improve their lives I imagine people entering a government office or health facility where people with eye or ear related disabilities could effortlessly interact to state their necessities and resolve their information needs Timothy Leffel research scientist National Opinion Research Center NORC at the University of Chicago said Formulaic transactions and interactions are particularly ripe for automation This can be good in cases where human error can cause problems e g for well understood diagnostic medical testing Jean Daniel Fekete researcher in human computer interaction at INRIA in France said Humans and machines will integrate more improving health through monitoring and easing via machine control Personal data will then become even more revealing and intrusive and should be kept under personal control Joe Whittaker a former professor of sciences and associate director of the NASA GESTAR program now associate provost at Jackson State University responded My hope is that AI human machine interface will become commonplace especially in the academic research and health care arena I envision significant advances in brain machine interface to facilitate mitigation of physical and mental challenges Similar uses in robotics should also be used to assist the elderly James Gannon global head of eCompliance for emerging technology cloud and cybersecurity at Novartis responded AI will increase the speed and availability to develop drugs and therapies for orphan indications AI will assist in general lifestyle and health care management for the average person Jay Sanders president and CEO of the Global Telemedicine Group responded AI will bring collective expertise to the decision point and in health care bringing collective expertise to the bedside will save many lives now lost by individual medical errors Geoff Arnold CTO for the Verizon Smart Communities organization said One of the most important trends over the next 12 years is the aging population and the high costs of providing them with care and mobility AI will provide better data driven diagnoses of medical and cognitive issues and it will facilitate affordable AV based paratransit for the less mobile It will support not replace human care givers John Lazzaro retired professor of electrical engineering and computer science University of California Berkeley commented When I visit my primary care physician today she spends a fair amount time typing into an EMS application as she s talking to me In this sense the computer has already arrived in the clinic An AI system that frees her from this clerical task that can listen and watch and distill the doctor patient interaction into actionable data would be an improvement A more advanced AI system would be able to form a second opinion based on this data as the appointment unfolds discreetly advising the doctor via a wearable The end goal is a reduction in the number of false starts in patient diagnosis If you ve read Lisa Sander s columns in the New York Times where she traces the arc of difficult diagnoses you understand the real clinical problem that this system addresses Steve Farnsworth chief marketing officer at Demand Marketing commented Machine learning and AI offer tools to turn that into actionable data One project using machine learning and big data already was able to predict SIDS correctly 94 of the time Imagine AI looking at diagnostics tests and successful treatments of millions of medical cases We would instantly have a deluge of new cures and know the most effective treatment options using only the data medicines and therapies we have now The jump in quality health care alone for humans is staggering This is only one application for AI Daniel Siewiorek a professor with the Human Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University predicted AI will enable systems to perform labor intensive activities where there are labor shortages For example consider recovery from an injury There is a shortage of physical therapists to monitor and correct exercises AI would enable a virtual coach to monitor correct and encourage a patient Virtual coaches could take on the persona of a human companion or a pet allowing the aging population to live independently Joly MacFie president of the Internet Society New York chapter commented AI will have many benefits for people with disabilities and health issues Much of the aging baby boomer generation will be in this category The overall hopes for the future of health care are tempered by concerns that there will continue to be inequities in access to the best care and worries that private health data may be used to limit people s options Craig Burdett a respondent who provided no identifying details wrote While most AI will probably be a positive benefit the possible darker side of AI could lead to a loss of agency for some For example in a health care setting an increasing use of AI could allow wealthier patients access to significantly more advanced diagnosis agents When coupled with a supportive care team these patients could receive better treatment and a greater range of treatment options Conversely less affluent patients may be relegated to automated diagnoses and treatment plants with little opportunity for interaction to explore alternative treatments AI could effectively manage long term health care costs by offering lesser treatment and sub optimal recovery rates to individuals perceived to have a lower status Consider two patients with diabetes One patient upon diagnosis modifies their eating and exercise patterns borne out by embedded diagnostic tools and would benefit from more advanced treatment The second patient fails to modify their behaviour resulting in substantial ongoing treatment that could be avoided by simple lifestyle choices An AI could subjectively evaluate that the patient has little interest in their own health and withhold more expensive treatment options leading to a shorter lifespan and an overall cost saving Sumandra Majee an architect at F5 Networks Inc said AI deep learning etc will become more a part of daily life in advanced countries This will potentially widen the gap between technology savvy people and economically well to do folks and the folks with limited access to technology However I am hopeful that in the field of healthcare especially when it comes to diagnosis AI will significantly augment the field allowing doctors to do a far better job Many of the routines aspects of checkups can be done via technology There is no reason an expert human has to be involved in basic A B testing to reach a conclusion Machines can be implemented for those tasks and human doctors should only do the critical parts I do see AI playing a negative role in education where students may not often actually do the hard work of learning through experience It might actually make the overall population dumber Timothy Graham a postdoctoral research fellow in sociology and computer science at Australian National University commented In health care we see current systems already under heavy criticism e g the My Health Record system in Australia or the NHS Digital program because they are nudging citizens into using the system through an opt out mechanism and there are concerns that those who do not opt out may be profiled targeted and or denied access to services based on their own data Valarie Bell a computational social scientist at the University of North Texas commented Let s say medical diagnosis is taken over by machines computers and robotics how will stressful prognoses be communicated Will a hologram or a computer deliver the bad news instead of a physician Given the health care industry s inherent profit motives it would be easy for them to justify how much cheaper it would be to simply have devices diagnose prescribe treatment and do patient care without concern for the importance of human touch and interactions Thus we may devolve into a health care system where the rich actually get a human doctor while everyone else or at least the poor and uninsured get the robot The following one liners from anonymous respondents also tie into the future of health care Over the past few decades experts and amateurs alike have predicted the internet would have large scale impacts on education Many of these hopes have not lived up to the hype Some respondents to this canvassing said the advent of AI could foster those changes They expect to see more options for affordable adaptive and individualized learning solutions including digital agents or AI assistants that work to enhance student teacher interactions and effectiveness Barry Chudakov founder and principal of Sertain Research and author of Metalifestream commented In the learning environment AI has the potential to finally demolish the retain to know learning and regurgitate model Knowing is no longer retaining machine intelligence does that it is making significant connections Connect and assimilate becomes the new learning model Lou Gross professor of mathematical ecology and expert in grid computing spatial optimization and modeling of ecological systems at the University of Tennessee Knoxville said I see AI as assisting in individualized instruction and training in ways that are currently unavailable or too expensive There are hosts of school systems around the world that have some technology but are using it in very constrained ways AI use will provide better adaptive learning and help achieve a teacher s goal of personalizing education based on each student s progress Guy Levi chief innovation officer for the Center for Educational Technology based in Israel wrote In the field of education AI will promote personalization which almost by definition promotes motivation The ability to move learning forward all the time by a personal AI assistant which opens the learning to new paths is a game changer The AI assistants will also communicate with one another and will orchestrate teamwork and collaboration The AI assistants will also be able to manage diverse methods of learning such as productive failure teach back and other innovating pedagogies Micah Altman a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and head scientist in the program on information science at MIT Libraries wrote These technologies will help to adapt learning and other environments to the needs of each individual by translating language aiding memory and providing us feedback on our own emotional and cognitive state and on the environment We all need adaptation each of us practically every day is at times tired distracted fuzzy headed or nervous which limits how we learn how we understand and how we interact with others AI has the potential to assist us to engage with the world better even when conditions are not ideal and to better understand ourselves Shigeki Goto Asia Pacific internet pioneer Internet Hall of Fame member and a professor of computer science at Waseda University commented AI is already applied to personalized medicine for an individual patient Similarly it will be applied to learning or education to realize personalized learning or tailored education We need to collect data which covers both of successful learning and failure experiences because machine learning requires positive and negative data Andreas Kirsch fellow at Newspeak House formerly with Google and DeepMind in Zurich and London wrote Higher education outside of normal academia will benefit further from AI progress and empower more people with access to knowledge and information For example question and answer systems will improve Tech similar to Google Translate and WaveNet will lower the barrier of knowledge acquisition for non English speakers At the same time child labor will be reduced because robots will be able to perform the tasks far cheaper and faster forcing governments in Asia to find real solutions Kristin Jenkins executive director of BioQUEST Curriculum Consortium said One of the benefits of this technology is the potential to have really effective responsive education resources We know that students benefit from immediate feedback and the opportunity to practice applying new information repeatedly to enhance mastery AI systems are perfect for analyzing students progress providing more practice where needed and moving on to new material when students are ready This allows time with instructors to focus on more complex learning including 21st century skills Mike Meyer chief information officer at Honolulu Community College commented Adult education availability and relevance will undergo a major transformation Community colleges will become more directly community centers for both occupational training and greatly expanded optional liberal arts art crafts and hobbies Classes will by 2030 be predominantly augmented reality based with a full mix of physical and virtual students in classes presented in virtual classrooms by national and international universities and organizations The driving need will be expansion of knowledge for personal interest and enjoyment as universal basic income or equity will replace the automated tasks that had provided subsistence jobs in the old system Jennifer Groff co founder of the Center for Curriculum Redesign an international non governmental organization dedicated to redesigning education for the 21st century wrote The impact on learning and learning environments has the potential to be one of the most positive future outcomes Learning is largely intangible and invisible making it a black box and our tools to capture and support learning to this point have been archaic Think large scale assessment Learners need tools that help them understand where they are in a learning pathway how they learn best what they need next and so on We re only just beginning to use technology to better answer these questions AI has the potential to help us better understand learning gain insights into learners at scale and ultimately build better learning tools and systems for them But as a large social system it is also prey to the complications of poor public policy that ultimately warps and diminishes AI s potential positive impact Norton Gusky an education technology consultant wrote By 2030 most learners will have personal profiles that will tap into AI machine learning Learning will happen everywhere and at any time There will be appropriate filters that will limit the influence of AI but ethical considerations will also be an issue Cliff Zukin professor of public policy and political science at Rutgers University s School of Planning and Public Policy and the Eagleton Institute of Politics said It takes information out of the category of a commodity and more information makes for better decisions and is democratizing Education to me has always been the status leveler correcting to some extent for birth luck and social mobility This will be like Asimov s Foundation where everyone is plugged into the data sphere There is a dark side later but overall a positive However some expect that there will be a continuing digital divide in education with the privileged having more access to advanced tools and more capacity for using them well while the less privileged lag behind Henning Schulzrinne co chair of the Internet Technical Committee of the IEEE Communications Society professor at Columbia University and Internet Hall of Fame member said Human mediated education will become a luxury good Some high school and college level teaching will be conducted partially by video and AI graded assignments using similar platforms to the MOOC massive open online courses models today with no human involvement to deal with increasing costs for education robo TA Joe Whittaker a former professor of sciences and associate director of the NASA GESTAR program now associate provost at Jackson State University responded Huge segments of society will be left behind or excluded completely from the benefits of digital advances many persons in underserved communities as well as others who are socio economically challenged This is due to the fact that these persons will be under prepared generally with little or no digital training or knowledge base They rarely have access to the relatively ubiquitous internet except when at school or in the workplace Clearly the children of these persons will be greatly disadvantaged Some witnesses of technology s evolution over the past few decades feel that its most positive potential has been disappointingly delayed After witnessing the slower than expected progress of tech s impact on public education since the 1990s they are less hopeful than others Ed Lyell longtime educational technologies expert and professor at Adams State University said education has been held back to this point by the tyranny of the status quo He wrote By 2030 lifelong learning will become more widespread for all ages The tools already exist including Khan Academy and YouTube We don t have to know as much just how to find information when we want it We will have on demand 24 7 schooling This will make going to sit down classroom schools more and more a hindrance to our learning The biggest negative will be from those protecting current status quo education including teachers faculty school boards and college administrators They are protecting their paycheck or ego based role They will need training counseling and help to embrace the existing and forthcoming change as good for all learners Part of the problem now is that they do not want to acknowledge the reality of how current schools are today Some do a good job yet these are mostly serving already smarter higher income communities Parents fight to have their children have a school like they experienced forgetting how inefficient and often useless it was AI can help customize curricula to each learner and guide monitor their journey through multiple learning activities including some existing schools on the job learning competency based learning internships and such You can already learn much more and more efficiently using online resources than almost all of the classes I took in my public schooling and college all the way through getting a Ph D A consultant and analyst also said that advances in education have been held back by entrenched interests in legacy education systems writing The use of technology in education is minimal today due to the existence and persistence of the classroom in a school model As we have seen over the last 30 years the application of artificial intelligence in the field of man machine interface has grown in many unexpected directions Who would have thought back in the late 1970s that the breadth of today s online i e internet capabilities could emerged I believe we are just seeing the beginning of the benefits of the man machine interface for mankind The institutionalized education model must be eliminated to allow education of each and every individual to grow The human brain can be educated 24 hours a day by intelligent educators who may not even be human in the future Access to information is no longer a barrier as it was 50 years ago The next step now is to remove the barrier of structured human delivery of learning in the classroom Brock Hinzmann a partner in the Business Futures Network who worked for 40 years as a futures researcher at SRI International was hopeful in his comments but also issued a serious warning He wrote Most of the improvements in the technologies we call AI will involve machine learning from big data to improve the efficiency of systems which will improve the economy and wealth It will improve emotion and intention recognition augment human senses and improve overall satisfaction in human computer interfaces There will also be abuses in monitoring personal data and emotions and in controlling human behavior which we need to recognize early and thwart Intelligent machines will recognize patterns that lead to equipment failures or flaws in final products and be able to correct a condition or shut down and pinpoint the problem Autonomous vehicles will be able to analyze data from other vehicles and sensors in the roads or on the people nearby to recognize changing conditions and avoid accidents In education and training AI learning systems will recognize learning preferences styles and progress of individuals and help direct them toward a personally satisfying outcome However governments or religious organizations may monitor emotions and activities using AI to direct them to feel a certain way to monitor them and to punish them if their emotional responses at work in education or in public do not conform to some norm Education could become indoctrination democracy could become autocracy or theocracy The expert predictions reported here about the impact of the internet between 2018 and 2030 came in response to questions asked by Pew Research Center and Elon University s Imagining the Internet Center in an online canvassing conducted between July 4 2018 and Aug 6 2018 This is the 10th Future of the Internet study the two organizations have conducted together For this project we invited more than 10 000 experts and members of the interested public to share their opinions on the likely future of the internet and 985 responded to at least one of the questions we asked This report covers only the answers to our questions about AI and the future of humans We also asked respondents to answer a series of questions tied to the 50th anniversary of the ARPANET internet additional reports tied to those responses will be released in 2019 the anniversary year Specifically related to artificial intelligence the participants in the nonscientific canvassing were asked Please think forward to the year 2030 Analysts expect that people will become even more dependent on networked artificial intelligence AI in complex digital systems Some say we will continue on the historic arc of augmenting our lives with mostly positive results as we widely implement these networked tools Some say our increasing dependence on these AI and related systems is likely to lead to widespread difficulties Our question By 2030 do you think it is most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will enhance human capacities and empower them That is most of the time will most people be better off than they are today Or is it most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will lessen human autonomy and agency to such an extent that most people will not be better off than the way things are today The answers of the 979 respondents include Additionally they were also asked Please explain why you chose the answer you did and sketch out a vision of how the human machine AI collaboration will function in 2030 Please consider giving an example of how a typical human machine interaction will look and feel in a specific area for instance in the workplace in family life in a health care setting or in a learning environment Why What is your hope or fear What actions might be taken to assure the best future The web based instrument was first sent directly to a list of targeted experts identified and accumulated by Pew Research Center and Elon University during previous Future of the Internet studies as well as those identified in an earlier study of people who made predictions about the likely future of the internet between 1990 to 1995 Additional experts with proven interest in this particular research topic were also added to the list Among those invited were artificial intelligence researchers developers and business leaders from leading global organizations including to name a few Oxford Cambridge MIT Stanford and Carnegie Mellon universities Google Microsoft Facebook Amazon Kernel Kyndi BT and Cloudflare leaders active in global internet governance and internet research activities such as the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN Internet Society ISOC International Telecommunications Union ITU Association of Internet Researchers AoIR and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD We also invited a large number of professionals and policy people working in government including the National Science Foundation Federal Communications Commission U S military and European Union think tanks and interest networks for instance those that include professionals and academics in anthropology sociology psychology law political science and communications engineering computer science and business entrepreneurship faculty graduate students and postgraduate researchers who have published work tied to these topics plus many who are active in civil society organizations such as Association for Progressive Communications APC Electronic Privacy Information Center EPIC Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF and Access Now and those affiliated with newly emerging nonprofits and other research units Invitees were encouraged to share the survey link with others they believed would have an interest in participating thus there was a small snowball effect as a small percentage of these invitees invited others to weigh in Since the data are based on a nonrandom sample the results are not projectable to any population other than the individuals expressing their points of view in this sample The respondents remarks reflect their personal positions and are not the positions of their employers the descriptions of their leadership roles help identify their background and the locus of their expertise About half of the expert respondents elected to remain anonymous Because people s level of expertise is an important element of their participation in the conversation anonymous respondents were given the opportunity to share a description of their internet expertise or background and this was noted where relevant in this report Some 519 respondents answered the demographic questions on the canvassing About 70 identified themselves as being based in North America while 30 hail from other corners of the world When asked about their primary area of internet interest 33 identified themselves as professor teacher 17 as research scientists 13 as futurists or consultants 8 as technology developers or administrators 5 as entrepreneurs or business leaders 5 as advocates or activist users 4 as pioneers or originators 1 as legislators politicians or lawyers and an additional 13 specified their primary area of interest as other Following is a list of some of

deep learning to medicine starting with the analysis of images such as X rays and CT scans It is an obvious use of the technology Deep learning is renowned for its superhuman prowess at certain forms of image recognition there are large sets of labelled training data to crunch and there is tremendous potential to make health care more accurate and efficient Dr Barani who used to be an oncologist points to some CT scans of a patient s lungs taken from three different angles Red blobs flicker on the screen as Enlitic s deep learning system examines and compares them to see if they are blood vessels harmless imaging artefacts or malignant lung nodules The system ends up highlighting a particular feature for further investigation In a test against three expert human radiologists working together Enlitic s system was 50 better at classifying malignant tumours and had a false negative rate where a cancer is missed of zero compared with 7 for the humans Another of Enlitic s systems which examines X rays to detect wrist fractures also handily outperformed human experts The firm s technology is currently being tested in 40 clinics across Australia Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor s Picks A computer that dispenses expert radiology advice is just one example of how jobs currently done by highly trained white collar workers can be automated thanks to the advance of deep learning and other forms of artificial intelligence The idea that manual work can be carried out by machines is already familiar now ever smarter machines can perform tasks done by information workers too What determines vulnerability to automation experts say is not so much whether the work concerned is manual or white collar but whether or not it is routine Machines can already do many forms of routine manual labour and are now able to perform some routine cognitive tasks too As a result says Andrew Ng a highly trained and specialised radiologist may now be in greater danger of being replaced by a machine than his own executive assistant She does so many different things that I don t see a machine being able to automate everything she does any time soon So which jobs are most vulnerable In a widely noted study published in 2013 Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne examined the probability of computerisation for 702 occupations and found that 47 of workers in America had jobs at high risk of potential automation In particular they warned that most workers in transport and logistics such as taxi and delivery drivers and office support such as receptionists and security guards are likely to be substituted by computer capital and that many workers in sales and services such as cashiers counter and rental clerks telemarketers and accountants also faced a high risk of computerisation They concluded that recent developments in machine learning will put a substantial share of employment across a wide range of occupations at risk in the near future Subsequent studies put the equivalent figure at 35 of the workforce for Britain where more people work in creative fields less susceptible to automation and 49 for Japan Economists are already worrying about job polarisation where middle skill jobs such as those in manufacturing are declining but both low skill and high skill jobs are expanding In effect the workforce bifurcates into two groups doing non routine work highly paid skilled workers such as architects and senior managers on the one hand and low paid unskilled workers such as cleaners and burger flippers on the other The stagnation of median wages in many Western countries is cited as evidence that automation is already having an effect though it is hard to disentangle the impact of offshoring which has also moved many routine jobs including manufacturing and call centre work to low wage countries in the developing world Figures published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis show that in America employment in non routine cognitive and non routine manual jobs has grown steadily since the 1980s whereas employment in routine jobs has been broadly flat see chart As more jobs are automated this trend seems likely to continue And this is only the start We are just seeing the tip of the iceberg No office job is safe says Sebastian Thrun an AI professor at Stanford known for his work on self driving cars Automation is now blind to the colour of your collar declares Jerry Kaplan another Stanford academic and author of Humans Need Not Apply a book that predicts upheaval in the labour market Gloomiest of all is Martin Ford a software entrepreneur and the bestselling author of Rise of the Robots He warns of the threat of a jobless future pointing out that most jobs can be broken down into a series of routine tasks more and more of which can be done by machines In previous waves of automation workers had the option of moving from routine jobs in one industry to routine jobs in another but now the same big data techniques that allow companies to improve their marketing and customer service operations also give them the raw material to train machine learning systems to perform the jobs of more and more people E discovery software can search mountains of legal documents much more quickly than human clerks or paralegals can Some forms of journalism such as writing market reports and sports summaries are also being automated Predictions that automation will make humans redundant have been made before however going back to the Industrial Revolution when textile workers most famously the Luddites protested that machines and steam engines would destroy their livelihoods Never until now did human invention devise such expedients for dispensing with the labour of the poor said a pamphlet at the time Subsequent outbreaks of concern occurred in the 1920s March of the machine makes idle hands declared a New York Times headline in 1928 the 1930s when John Maynard Keynes coined the term technological unemployment and 1940s when the New York Times referred to the revival of such worries as the renewal of an old argument As computers began to appear in offices and robots on factory floors President John F Kennedy declared that the major domestic challenge of the 1960s was to maintain full employment at a time when automation is replacing men In 1964 a group of Nobel prizewinners known as the Ad Hoc Committee on the Triple Revolution sent President Lyndon Johnson a memo alerting him to the danger of a revolution triggered by the combination of the computer and the automated self regulating machine This they said was leading to a new era of production which requires progressively less human labour and threatened to divide society into a skilled elite and an unskilled underclass The advent of personal computers in the 1980s provoked further hand wringing over potential job losses Yet in the past technology has always ended up creating more jobs than it destroys That is because of the way automation works in practice explains David Autor an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Automating a particular task so that it can be done more quickly or cheaply increases the demand for human workers to do the other tasks around it that have not been automated There are many historical examples of this in weaving says James Bessen an economist at the Boston University School of Law During the Industrial Revolution more and more tasks in the weaving process were automated prompting workers to focus on the things machines could not do such as operating a machine and then tending multiple machines to keep them running smoothly This caused output to grow explosively In America during the 19th century the amount of coarse cloth a single weaver could produce in an hour increased by a factor of 50 and the amount of labour required per yard of cloth fell by 98 This made cloth cheaper and increased demand for it which in turn created more jobs for weavers their numbers quadrupled between 1830 and 1900 In other words technology gradually changed the nature of the weaver s job and the skills required to do it rather than replacing it altogether In a more recent example automated teller machines ATMs might have been expected to spell doom for bank tellers by taking over some of their routine tasks and indeed in America their average number fell from 20 per branch in 1988 to 13 in 2004 Mr Bessen notes But that reduced the cost of running a bank branch allowing banks to open more branches in response to customer demand The number of urban bank branches rose by 43 over the same period so the total number of employees increased Rather than destroying jobs ATMs changed bank employees work mix away from routine tasks and towards things like sales and customer service that machines could not do The same pattern can be seen in industry after industry after the introduction of computers says Mr Bessen rather than destroying jobs automation redefines them and in ways that reduce costs and boost demand In a recent analysis of the American workforce between 1982 and 2012 he found that employment grew significantly faster in occupations for example graphic design that made more use of computers as automation sped up one aspect of a job enabling workers to do the other parts better The net effect was that more computer intensive jobs within an industry displaced less computer intensive ones Computers thus reallocate rather than displace jobs requiring workers to learn new skills This is true of a wide range of occupations Mr Bessen found not just in computer related fields such as software development but also in administrative work health care and many other areas Only manufacturing jobs expanded more slowly than the workforce did over the period of study but that had more to do with business cycles and offshoring to China than with technology he says So far the same seems to be true of fields where AI is being deployed For example the introduction of software capable of analysing large volumes of legal documents might have been expected to reduce the number of legal clerks and paralegals who act as human search engines during the discovery phase of a case in fact automation has reduced the cost of discovery and increased demand for it Judges are more willing to allow discovery now because it s cheaper and easier says Mr Bessen The number of legal clerks in America increased by 1 1 a year between 2000 and 2013 Similarly the automation of shopping through e commerce along with more accurate recommendations encourages people to buy more and has increased overall employment in retailing In radiology says Dr Barani Enlitic s technology empowers practitioners making average ones into experts Rather than putting them out of work the technology increases capacity which may help in the developing world where there is a shortage of specialists And while it is easy to see fields in which automation might do away with the need for human labour it is less obvious where technology might create new jobs We can t predict what jobs will be created in the future but it s always been like that says Joel Mokyr an economic historian at Northwestern University Imagine trying to tell someone a century ago that her great grandchildren would be video game designers or cybersecurity specialists he suggests These are jobs that nobody in the past would have predicted Similarly just as people worry about the potential impact of self driving vehicles today a century ago there was much concern about the impact of the switch from horses to cars notes Mr Autor Horse related jobs declined but entirely new jobs were created in the motel and fast food industries that arose to serve motorists and truck drivers As those industries decline new ones will emerge Self driving vehicles will give people more time to consume goods and services increasing demand elsewhere in the economy and autonomous vehicles might greatly expand demand for products such as food delivered locally There will also be some new jobs created in the field of AI itself Self driving vehicles may need remote operators to cope with emergencies or ride along concierges who knock on doors and manhandle packages Corporate chatbot and customer service AIs will need to be built and trained and have dialogue written for them AI firms are said to be busy hiring poets they will have to be constantly updated and maintained just as websites are today And no matter how advanced artificial intelligence becomes some jobs are always likely to be better done by humans notably those involving empathy or social interaction Doctors therapists hairdressers and personal trainers fall into that category An analysis of the British workforce by Deloitte a consultancy highlighted a profound shift over the past two decades towards caring jobs the number of nursing assistants increased by 909 teaching assistants by 580 and careworkers by 168 Focusing only on what is lost misses a central economic mechanism by which automation affects the demand for labour notes Mr Autor that it raises the value of the tasks that can be done only by humans Ultimately he says those worried that automation will cause mass unemployment are succumbing to what economists call the lump of labour fallacy This notion that there s only a finite amount of work to do and therefore that if you automate some of it there s less for people to do is just totally wrong he says Those sounding warnings about technological unemployment basically ignore the issue of the economic response to automation says Mr Bessen But couldn t this time be different As Mr Ford points out in Rise of the Robots the impact of automation this time around is broader based not every industry was affected two centuries ago but every industry uses computers today During previous waves of automation he argues workers could switch from one kind of routine work to another but this time many workers will have to switch from routine unskilled jobs to non routine skilled jobs to stay ahead of automation That makes it more important than ever to help workers acquire new skills quickly But so far says Mr Autor there is zero evidence that AI is having a new and significantly different impact on employment And while everyone worries about AI says Mr Mokyr far more labour is being replaced by cheap workers overseas Another difference is that whereas the shift from agriculture to industry typically took decades software can be deployed much more rapidly Google can invent something like Smart Reply and have millions of people using it just a few months later Even so most firms tend to implement new technology more slowly not least for non technological reasons Enlitic and other companies developing AI for use in medicine for example must grapple with complex regulations and a fragmented marketplace particularly in America which is why many startups are testing their technology elsewhere It takes time for processes to change standards to emerge and people to learn new skills The distinction between invention and implementation is critical and too often ignored observes Mr Bessen What of the worry that new high tech industries are less labour intensive than earlier ones Mr Frey cites a paper he co wrote last year showing that only 0 5 of American workers are employed in industries that have emerged since 2000 Technology might create fewer and fewer jobs while exposing a growing share of them to automation he says An oft cited example is that of Instagram a photo sharing app When it was bought by Facebook in 2012 for 1 billion it had tens of millions of users but only 13 employees Kodak which once employed 145 000 people making photographic products went into bankruptcy at around the same time But such comparisons are misleading says Marc Andreessen It was smartphones not Instagram that undermined Kodak and far more people are employed by the smartphone industry and its surrounding ecosystems than ever worked for Kodak or the traditional photography industry So who is right the pessimists many of them techie types who say this time is different and machines really will take all the jobs or the optimists mostly economists and historians who insist that in the end technology always creates more jobs than it destroys The truth probably lies somewhere in between AI will not cause mass unemployment but it will speed up the existing trend of computer related automation disrupting labour markets just as technological change has done before and requiring workers to learn new skills more quickly than in the past Mr Bessen predicts a difficult transition rather than a sharp break with history But despite the wide range of views expressed pretty much everyone agrees on the prescription that companies and governments will need to make it easier for workers to acquire new skills and switch jobs as needed That would provide the best defence in the event that the pessimists are right and the impact of artificial intelligence proves to be more rapid and more dramatic

tasks and there is massive disruption of jobs experts say a wider array of education and skills building programs will be created to meet new demands There are two uncertainties Will well prepared workers be able to keep up in the race with AI tools And will market capitalism survive By Lee Rainie and Janna AndersonMachines are eating humans jobs talents And it s not just about jobs that are repetitive and low skill Automation robotics algorithms and artificial intelligence AI in recent times have shown they can do equal or sometimes even better work than humans who are dermatologists insurance claims adjusters lawyers seismic testers in oil fields sports journalists and financial reporters crew members on guided missile destroyers hiring managers psychological testers retail salespeople and border patrol agents Moreover there is growing anxiety that technology developments on the near horizon will crush the jobs of the millions who drive cars and trucks analyze medical tests and data perform middle management chores dispense medicine trade stocks and evaluate markets fight on battlefields perform government functions and even replace those who program software that is the creators of algorithms People will create the jobs of the future not simply train for them and technology is already central It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead Jonathan GrudinMultiple studies have documented that massive numbers of jobs are at risk as programmed devices many of them smart autonomous systems continue their march into workplaces A recent study by labor economists found that one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment to population ratio by about 0 18 0 34 percentage points and wages by 0 25 0 5 percent When Pew Research Center and Elon University s Imagining the Internet Center asked experts in 2014 whether AI and robotics would create more jobs than they would destroy the verdict was evenly split 48 of the respondents envisioned a future where more jobs are lost than created while 52 said more jobs would be created than lost Since that expert canvassing the future of jobs has been at the top of the agenda at many major conferences globally Several policy and market based solutions have been promoted to address the loss of employment and wages forecast by technologists and economists A key idea emerging from many conversations including one of the lynchpin discussions at the World Economic Forum in 2016 is that changes in educational and learning environments are necessary to help people stay employable in the labor force of the future Among the six overall findings in a new 184 page report from the National Academies of Sciences the experts recommended The education system will need to adapt to prepare individuals for the changing labor market At the same time recent IT advances offer new and potentially more widely accessible ways to access education Jobholders themselves have internalized this insight A 2016 Pew Research Center survey The State of American Jobs found that 87 of workers believe it will be essential for them to get training and develop new job skills throughout their work life in order to keep up with changes in the workplace This survey noted that employment is much higher among jobs that require an average or above average level of preparation including education experience and job training average or above average interpersonal management and communication skills and higher levels of analytical skills such as critical thinking and computer skills A central question about the future then is whether formal and informal learning structures will evolve to meet the changing needs of people who wish to fulfill the workplace expectations of the future Pew Research Center and Elon s Imagining the Internet Center conducted a large scale canvassing of technologists scholars practitioners strategic thinkers and education leaders in the summer of 2016 asking them to weigh in on the likely future of workplace training Some 1 408 responded to the following question sharing their expectations about what is likely to evolve by 2026 In the next 10 years do you think we will see the emergence of new educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers in the skills they will need to perform the jobs of the future The nonscientific canvassing found that 70 of these particular respondents said yes such programs would emerge and be successful A majority among the 30 who said no generally do not believe adaptation in teaching environments will be sufficient to teach new skills at the scale that is necessary to help workers keep abreast of the tech changes that will upend millions of jobs See About this canvassing of experts for further details about the limits of this sample Participants were asked to explain their answers and offered the following prompts to consider Several common expectations were evident in these respondents answers no matter how hopeful or fretful they were about the future of skills and capabilities training efforts It is important to note that many respondents listed human behaviors attributes and competencies in describing desirable work skills Although these aspects of psychology cannot be classified as skills and perhaps cannot be directly taught in any sort of training environment we include these answers under the general heading of skills capabilities and attributes A diversifying education and credentialing ecosystem Most of these experts expect the education marketplace especially online learning platforms to continue to change in an effort to accommodate the widespread needs Some predict employers will step up their own efforts to train and retrain workers Many foresee a significant number of self teaching efforts by jobholders themselves as they take advantage of proliferating online opportunities Respondents see a new education and training ecosystem emerging in which some job preparation functions are performed by formal educational institutions in fairly traditional classroom settings some elements are offered online some are created by for profit firms some are free some exploit augmented and virtual reality elements and gaming sensibilities and a lot of real time learning takes place in formats that job seekers pursue on their own A considerable number of respondents to this canvassing focused on the likelihood that the best education programs will teach people how to be lifelong learners Accordingly some say alternative credentialing mechanisms will arise to assess and vouch for the skills people acquire along the way A focus on nurturing unique human skills that artificial intelligence AI and machines seem unable to replicate Many of these experts discussed in their responses the human talents they believe machines and automation may not be able to duplicate noting that these should be the skills developed and nurtured by education and training programs to prepare people to work successfully alongside AI These respondents suggest that workers of the future will learn to deeply cultivate and exploit creativity collaborative activity abstract and systems thinking complex communication and the ability to thrive in diverse environments One such comment came from Simon Gottschalk a professor in the department of sociology at the University of Nevada Las Vegas The skills necessary at the higher echelons will include especially the ability to efficiently network manage public relations display intercultural sensitivity marketing and generally what author Dan Goleman would call social and emotional intelligence This also includes creativity and just enough critical thinking to move outside the box Another example is the response of Fredric Litto a professor emeritus of communications and longtime distance learning expert from the University of S o Paulo We are now in the transitional stage of employers gradually reducing their prejudice in the hiring of those who studied at a distance and moving in favor of such graduates who in the workplace demonstrate greater proactiveness initiative discipline collaborativeness because they studied online Other respondents mentioned traits including leadership design thinking human meta communication deliberation conflict resolution and the capacity to motivate mobilize and innovate Still others spoke of more practical needs that could help workers in the medium term to work with data and algorithms to implement 3 D modeling and work with 3 D printers or to implement the newly emerging capabilities in artificial intelligence and augmented and virtual reality Jonathan Grudin principal researcher at Microsoft commented People will create the jobs of the future not simply train for them and technology is already central It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead Seriously You re asking about the workforce of the future As if there s going to be one Anonymous scientific editorAbout a third of respondents expressed no confidence in training and education evolving quickly enough to match demands by 2026 Some of the bleakest answers came from some of the most respected technology analysts For instance Jason Hong an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University wrote There are two major components needed for a new kind of training program at this scale political will and a proven technology platform Even assuming that the political will and budget existed there s no platform today that can successfully train large numbers of people MOOCs Massive Open Online Courses have a high dropout rate and have serious questions about quality of instruction They are also struggling with basic issues like identification of individuals taking the courses So in short we can train small numbers of individuals tens of thousands per year using today s community colleges and university systems but probably not more Several respondents argued that job training is not a primary concern at a time when accelerating change in market economies is creating massive economic divides that seem likely to leave many people behind An anonymous scientific editor commented Seriously You re asking about the workforce of the future As if there s going to be one Employers either run sweatshops abroad or hire people in the first world to do jobs that they hate while more and more unskilled and skilled people end up permanently on welfare or zero hour contracts And the relatively job secure qualified people who work in the professions are probably a lot closer than they think they are to going over that same cliff The details of how they earn their credentials aren t going to be an issue Most participants in this canvassing wrote detailed elaborations explaining their positions though they were allowed to respond anonymously Their well considered comments provide insights about hopeful and concerning trends These findings do not represent all possible points of view but they do reveal a wide range of striking observations Respondents collectively articulated five major themes that are introduced and briefly explained in the 29 page section below and then expanded upon in more detailed sections Some responses are lightly edited for style or due to length The following section presents a brief overview of the most evident themes extracted from the written responses including a small selection of representative quotes supporting each point Some responses are lightly edited for style or due to length These experts envision that the next decade will bring a more widely diversified world of education and training options in which various entities design and deliver different services to those who seek to learn They expect that some innovation will be aimed at emphasizing the development of human talents that machines cannot match and at helping humans partner with technology They say some parts of the ecosystem will concentrate on delivering real time learning to workers often in formats that are self taught Commonly occurring ideas among the responses in this category are collected below under headings reflecting subthemes Most experts seem to have faith that rapid technological development and a rising wariness of coming impacts of the AI robotics revolution are going to spur the public private and governmental actions needed for education and training systems to be adapted to deliver more flexible open adaptable resilient certifiable and useful lifelong learning Educators have always found new ways of training the next generation of students for the jobs of the future and this generation will be no different Justin ReichJim Hendler a professor of computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute predicted The nature of education will change to a mix of models College education which will still favor multi year residential education will need to be more focused on teaching students to be lifelong learners followed by more online content in situ training and other such elements to increase skills in a rapidly changing information world As automation puts increasing numbers of low and middle skill workers out of work these models will also provide for certifications and training needs to function in an increasingly automated service sector Michael Wollowski an associate professor of computer science at the Rose Hulman Institute of Technology commented We will definitely see a vast increase in educational and training programs We will also see what might be called on demand or on the job kind of training programs We kind of have to as with continued automation we will need to retrain a large portion of the workforce I strongly believe employers will subscribe to this idea wholeheartedly it increases the overall education of their workforce which benefits their bottom line Nevertheless I am a big believer in the college experience which I see as a way to learn what you are all about as a person and in your field of study The confidence in your own self and your abilities cannot be learned in a short course It takes life experience or four years at a tough college At a good college you are challenged to be your best this is very resource intensive and cannot be scaled at this time Justin Reich executive director at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT Teaching Systems Lab observed Educators have always found new ways of training the next generation of students for the jobs of the future and this generation will be no different Our established systems of job training primarily community colleges and state universities will continue to play a crucial role though catastrophically declining public support for these institutions will raise serious challenges David Karger a professor of computer science at MIT wrote Most of what we now call online learning is little more than glorified textbooks but the future is very promising No matter how good our online teaching systems become the current four year college model will remain dominant for quite some time Online teaching will increase the reach of the top universities which will put pressure on lesser universities to demonstrate value One potential future would be for those universities to abandon the idea that they have faculty teaching their own courses and instead consist entirely of a cadre of less well paid teaching assistants who provide support for the students who are taking courses online A few respondents said already established institutions cannot be as fully successful as new initiatives Jerry Michalski founder at REX commented Today s educational and training institutions are a shambles They take too long to teach impractical skills and knowledge not connected to the real world and when they try to tackle critical thinking for a longer time scale they mostly fail The sprouts of the next generation of learning tools are already visible Within the decade the new shoots will overtake the wilting vines and we will see all sorts of new initiatives mostly outside these schooling academic and training institutions which are mostly beyond repair People will shift to them because they work because they are far less expensive and because they are always available Barry Chudakov founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp says education has been liberated because thanks to digital innovation everyone can embed learning continuously in their everyday lives He wrote The key to education in the next 10 years will be the understanding that we now live in a world without walls and so the walls of the school physical and conceptual need to shatter and never go up again In the hopefully near future we will not segregate schooling from work and real world thinking and development They will seamlessly weave into a braid of learning realization exposure hands on experience and integration into students own lives And again the experience of being a student now confined to grade school secondary school and university will expand to include workers those looking for work and those who want or need to retrain as well as what we now think of as conventional education One way we will break down these walls we are already doing so will be to create digital learning spaces to rival classrooms as places where learning happen s Via simulation gaming digital presentations combined with hands on real world experience learning and re education will move out of books and into the world The more likely enhancement will be to take digital enhancements out into the world again breaking down the walls of the classroom and school to inform and enhance experience An anonymous respondent echoed the sentiment of quite a few others who do not think it is possible to advance and enhance online education and training much in the next decade writing These programs have a cost and too few are willing to sacrifice for these programs More such arguments are included in later sections of this report Some respondents expressed confidence in the best of current online education and training options saying online course options are cost effective evolving for the better and game changing because they are globally accessible Those with the most optimism expect great progress will be made in augmented reality AR virtual reality VR and AI While some say 2026 will still be early days for this tech many are excited about its prospects for enhancing learning in the next decade Already today there are quite effective online training and education systems but they are not being implemented to their full potential Edward FriedmanEdward Friedman professor emeritus of technology management at the Stevens Institute of Technology wrote Already today there are quite effective online training and education systems but they are not being implemented to their full potential These applications will become more widely used with familiarity that is gained during the next decade Also populations will be more tech savvy and be able to make use of these systems with greater personal ease In addition the development of virtual reality AI assistants and other technological advances will add to the effectiveness of these systems There will be a greater need for such systems as the needs for new expertise in the workforce increase and the capacity of traditional education systems proves that it is not capable of meeting the need in a cost effective manner The president of a technology LLC wrote Training teaching are all going online partly because of high costs of campus education Richard Adler distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future predicted AI voice response telepresence VR and gamification techniques will come together to create powerful new learning environments capable of personalizing and accelerating learning across a broad range of fields Ray Schroeder associate vice chancellor for online learning at the University of Illinois Springfield commented It is projected that those entering the workforce today will pursue four or five different careers not just jobs over their lifetime These career changes will require retooling training and education The adult learners will not be able to visit physical campuses to access this learning they will learn online I expect that we will see the further development of artificially intelligent teaching specialists such as Jill Watson at Georgia Tech the virtual graduate assistant who was thought to be human by an entire class of computer science students I anticipate the further development and distribution of holoportation technologies such as those developed by Microsoft using HoloLens for real time three dimensional augmented reality These teaching tools will enable highly sophisticated interactions and engagement with students at a distance They will further fuel the scaling of learning to reach even more massive online classes Fredric Litto an professor emeritus of communications and longtime distance learning expert from the University of S o Paulo replied There is no field of work that cannot be learned totally or in great part in well organized and administered online programs either in traditional course formats or in self directed independent learning opportunities supplemented when appropriate by face to face hands on practice situations Tawny Schlieski research director at Intel and president of the Oregon Story Board explained New technologies of human computer interaction like augmented and virtual reality offer the possibility of entirely new mechanisms of education Augmented and virtual reality tools make learning more experiential they engage students with physical movement and they enable interactive and responsive instructional assets As these tools evolve over the next decade the academics we work with expect to see radical change in training and workforce development which will roll into although probably against a longer timeline more traditional institutions of higher learning Many respondents said real world campus based higher education will continue to thrive during the next decade They generally expect that no other educational experience can match residential universities capabilities for fully immersive person to person learning as well as mentoring and socializing functions before 2026 They said a residential university education helps build intangible skills that are not replicable online and thus deepens the skills base of those who can afford to pay for such an education but they expect that job specific training will be managed by employers on the job and via novel approaches Some say major universities core online course content developed with all of the new tech bells and whistles will be marketed globally and adopted as baseline learning in smaller higher education locales where online elements from major MOOCs can be optimally paired in hybrid learning with in person mentoring activities The most important skills to have in life are gained through interpersonal experiences and the liberal arts Human bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion empathy vulnerability and social emotional intelligence Frank ElavskyUta Russmann communications marketing sales professor at the FHWien University of Applied Sciences in Vienna Austria said In the future more and more jobs will require highly sophisticated people whose skills cannot be trained in mass online programs Traditional four year and graduate programs will better prepare people for jobs in the future as such an education gives people a general understanding and knowledge about their field and here people learn how to approach new things ask questions and find answers deal with new situations etc all this is needed to adjust to ongoing changes in work life Special skills for a particular job will be learned on the job Frank Elavsky data and policy analyst at Acumen LLC responded The most important skills to have in life are gained through interpersonal experiences and the liberal arts Human bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion empathy vulnerability and social emotional intelligence These skills are imperative to focus on as the future is in danger of losing these skillsets from the workforce Many people have gained these skills throughout history without any kind of formal schooling but with the growing emphasis on virtual and digital mediums of production education and commerce people will have less and less exposure to other humans in person and other human perspectives Isto Huvila professor at Uppsala University replied The difference between educating to perform and educating to make the future is the difference between vocational education and higher university education Spending four years at a university is not only about learning skills but about bildung self cultivation and socialising in a group that is capable of fostering collaboration much better than an ad hoc group of people But this does not mean that alternative means and paths of learning and accreditation would not be useful as complementary to the traditional system that has limitations as well Dana Klisanin psychologist futurist at Evolutionary Guidance Media R D wrote Educational institutions that succeed will use the tools of social media and game design to grant students access to teachers from all over the world and increase their motivation to succeed Online educational programs will influence the credentialing systems of traditional institutions and online institutions will increasingly offer meet ups and mingles such that a true hybrid educational approach emerges Will training for skills most important in the jobs of the future work well in large scale settings by 2026 Respondents in this canvassing overwhelmingly said yes anticipating that improvements in such education would continue However many believe the most vital skills are not easy to teach learn or evaluate in any education or training setting available today Dozens of descriptive terms were applied by respondents as they noted the skills capabilities and attributes they see as important in workers lives in the next decade The skills needed to succeed in today s world and the future are curiosity creativity taking initiative multi disciplinary thinking and empathy These skills interestingly are the skills specific to human beings that machines and robots cannot do Tiffany ShlainWhile coding and other hard skills were listed as being easiest to teach to a large group in an online setting soft human skills were seen by most respondents as crucial for survival in the age of AI and robotics Devin Fidler research director at the Institute for the Future predicted As basic automation and machine learning move toward becoming commodities uniquely human skills will become more valuable There will be an increasing economic incentive to develop mass training that better unlocks this value Susan Price a digital architect at Continuum Analytics commented Increasingly machines will perform tasks they are better suited to perform than humans such as computation data analysis and logic Functions requiring emotional intelligence empathy compassion and creative judgment and discernment will expand and be increasingly valued in our culture Tiffany Shlain filmmaker and founder of the Webby Awards wrote The skills needed to succeed in today s world and the future are curiosity creativity taking initiative multi disciplinary thinking and empathy These skills interestingly are the skills specific to human beings that machines and robots cannot do and you can be taught to strengthen these skills through education I look forward to seeing innovative live and online programs that can teach these at scale Ben Shneiderman professor of computer science at the University of Maryland observed Students can be trained to be more innovative creative and active initiators of novel ideas Skills of writing speaking and making videos are important but fundamental skills of critical thinking community building teamwork deliberation dialogue and conflict resolution will be powerful A mindset of persistence and the necessary passion to succeed are also critical Louisa Heinrich founder at Superhuman Limited commented Lateral and system thinking skills are increasingly critical for success in an ever changing global landscape and these will need to be re prioritised at all levels of education An anonymous technologist commented Programming and problem solving learning how to work with artificial intelligence and robotics will become more important and more and more workers will be replaced by software hardware based workers Automation will reduce the need for the current workforce and the divide between the upper class and the lower class will continue to eat the middle class Some who are pessimistic about the future of human work due to advances in capable AI and robotics mocked the current push in the U S to train more people in technical skills An anonymous respondent commented Teach a billion people to program and you ll end up with 900 000 000 unemployed programmers An anonymous program director for a major U S technology funding organization predicted We will see training for the jobs of the past and for service jobs The jobs of the future will not need large numbers of workers with a fixed set of skills most things that we can train large numbers of workers for we will also be able to train computers to do better Among the many other skills mentioned were process oriented and system oriented thinking journalistic skills including research evaluation of multiple sources writing and speaking understanding algorithms computational thinking networking and programming grasping law and policy an evidence based way of looking at the world time management conflict resolution decision making locating information in the flood of data storytelling using data and influencing and consensus building A few people mentioned that young adults need to be taught how to have face to face interaction including one who said they seem to be sorely lacking in these skills and can only interact with a cellphone or laptop Because so many intricacies of the workplace the human soft and hard are learned on the job respondents said they expect apprenticeships and forms of mentoring will regain value and evolve along with the 21st century workplace D Yvette Wohn assistant professor of information systems at the New Jersey Institute of Technology wrote Formalized apprenticeships that require both technical skills and interpersonal interaction will become more important Ian O Byrne an assistant professor of literacy education at the College of Charleston replied In the future we ll see more opportunities for online personalized learning This will include open online learning experiences e g MOOCs where individuals can lurk and build up capacity or quench interests I also believe that we ll see a rise in the offering of premium or pay content that creates a space where one to one learning and interaction will allow mentors to guide learners while providing critical feedback We will identify opportunities to build a digital version of the apprenticeship learning models that have existed in the past Alternative credentials and digital badges will provide more granular opportunities to document and archive learning over time from traditional and nontraditional learning sources Through evolving technologies e g blockchain this may provide opportunities for learners to document and frame their own learning pathways An instructional designer with 19 years of experience commented The pattern I m seeing is toward individualized learning almost on the level of tutoring or apprenticeship We ve seen again and again that the broader the audience focus the less the course seems to deliver As for what the skills of the future are they ll be specialized to their fields with a university degree assumed to be a certificate in the ability to learn more about a particular subject specialty You may get a degree in computer software development but the truth is that you still need to be taught how to write software for say the mortgage company or insurance company that hires you The key to the future will be flexibility and personal motivation to learn and tinker with new things As they anticipate the appearance of effective new learning environments and advances in digital accountability systems many of these experts believe fresh certification programs will be created to attest to workers participation in training programs and the mastery of skills Some predict that many more workers will begin using online and app based learning systems Charlie Firestone communications and society program executive director and vice president at The Aspen Institute replied There will be a move toward more precise and better credentialing for skills and competencies e g badging and similar techniques Employers will accept these more as they prove probative And online learning will be more prevalent even as an adjunct to formal classroom learning New industries such as green energy and telemedicine will increase new employment opportunities Despite all of these measures the loss of jobs from artificial intelligence and robotics will exceed any retraining program at least in the short run Sam Punnett research officer at TableRock Media wrote I suspect employers will recognize the new credentialing systems Particularly those certificates awarded for studies in emerging disciplines currently data science appears all the rage and those that reflect an upgrade of previously acquired skills Traditional credentials will continue to hold value but I believe they will be considered in light of a candidates perceived ability in learning how to learn The four year degree and subsequent graduate studies will continue to be less of a guaranty towards employment without work experience Certificates are being viewed more favourably and many universities are lagging in their connection between their pedagogies and working world requirements William J Ward a university communications professor DR4WARD commented Higher Education is doing a poor job of preparing students with the skills they need to succeed in the workforce Online and credentialing systems are more transparent and do a better job on delivering skills People with new types of credentialing systems are seen as more qualified than traditional four year and graduate programs Many workplaces place a higher value on real world work portfolios than they do on a degree or certification yet their hiring systems including AI bots programmed to scan resum s still use the commonly accepted credentials as a basis for interviewing candidates Some respondents hope to see change Schools today turn out widget makers who can make widgets all the same They are built on producing single right answers rather than creative solutions Jeff JarvisA software engineering and system administration professional commented The reliability of the traditional educational system is already being questioned in some fields it s considered common sense that certifications and degrees mean little and that a portfolio references and hands on interviews are much more important for assessing a candidate s ability The unfortunate reality is that many HR departments still post job listings saying degrees and certifications are required as a way of screening candidates Both of those cost a lot of money and neither mean a lot for a candidate s competence I hope this will change both job listings and quality of degrees certifications but don t see it happening soon Meryl Krieger career specialist at Indiana University Bloomington s Jacobs School replied Credentialing systems will involve portfolios as much as resum s resum s simply are too two dimensional to properly communicate someone s skillset Three dimensional materials in essence job reels that demonstrate expertise will be the ultimate demonstration of an individual worker s skills I see credentialing as a piece of a very complex set of criteria these will also incorporate an individual s ability to communicate and work with teams huge in employer requests for new employees which can more readily be documented and tracked through online portfolio tools than through traditional resume formats Thus the educational and training programs of the future will become in their best incarnations sophisticated combinations of classroom and hands on training programs The specific models will necessarily be responding to individual industry requirements Jeff Jarvis a professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism wrote Schools today turn out widget makers who can make widgets all the same They are built on producing single right answers rather than creative solutions They are built on an outmoded attention economy Pay us for 45 hours of your attention and we will certify your knowledge I believe that many not all areas of instruction should shift to competency based education in which the outcomes needed are made clear and students are given multiple paths to achieve those outcomes and they are certified not based on tests and grades but instead on portfolios of their work demonstrating their knowledge While the first three themes found among the responses to this canvassing were mostly hopeful about advances in education and training for 21st century jobs a large share of responses from top experts reflect a significant degree of pessimism for various reasons Some even say the future of jobs for humans is so baleful that capitalism may fail as an economic system The next themes and subthemes examine these responses A large share of respondents predicted that online formats for knowledge transfer will not advance significantly in the next decade The 30 who expressed pessimism were often deeply doubtful about the capabilities of current education systems to adapt to pivot to respond to new challenges as quickly as necessary Interestingly being able to adapt and respond to looming challenges was seen by nearly everyone in this canvassing as one of the most highly prized future capabilities these respondents especially agree that it is important and they say that our human institutions government business education are not adapting efficiently and are letting us down Many of them say that current K 12 or K 16 education programs are incapable of making adjustments within the next decade to serve the shifting needs of future jobs markets Among the other reasons listed by people who do not expect these kinds of transformative advances in job creation and job skill upgrading Some among the 70 of respondents who are mostly optimistic about the future of training for jobs also echoed one or more of the points above mentioning these tension points while hoping for the best Following are representative statements tied to these points and more from all respondents Thomas Claburn editor at large at Information Week wrote I m skeptical that educational and training programs can keep pace with technology Traditional models train people to equate what they do with who they are i e what do you want to be when you grow up rather than to acquire critical thinking and flexible skills and attitudes that fit a rapidly changing world Pamela RutledgeAndrew Walls managing vice president at Gartner wrote Barring a neuroscience advance that enables us to embed knowledge and skills directly into brain tissue and muscle formation there will be no quantum leap in our ability to up skill people Learning takes time and practice which means it requires money lots of money to significantly change the skill set of a large cohort B Remy Cross assistant professor of sociology Webster University commented Lacking a significant breakthrough in machine learning that could lead to further breakthroughs in adaptive responses by a fully online system it is too hard to adequately instruct large numbers of people in the kinds of soft skills that are anticipated as being in most demand As manufacturing and many labor intensive jobs move overseas or are fully mechanized we will see a bulge in service jobs These require good people skills something that is often hard to train online John Bell software developer and teacher at Dartmouth College replied Even today access to information is not the limiting factor in skills education for anyone who can go online While there have been generational gains in the developments of online communities a large scale educational experience either MOOC or on demand broadcasts will not be able to duplicate that Stowe Boyd managing director of Another Voice and a well known thinker on work futures discussed the intangibles of preparing humans to partner with AI and bot systems While we may see the creation and rollout of new training programs he observed it s unclear whether they will be able to retrain those displaced from traditional sorts of work to fit into the workforce of the near future Many of the skills that will be needed are more like personality characteristics like curiosity or social skills that require enculturation to take hold Individual training like programming or learning how to cook may not be what will be needed And employers may play less of a role especially as AI and bot augmented independent contracting may be the best path for many rather than a job Homesteading in exurbia may be the answer for many with forty acres and a bot as a political campaign slogan of 2024 Luis Miron a distinguished university professor and director of the Institute for Quality and Equity in Education at Loyola University in New Orleans wrote Bluntly speaking I have little confidence in the educational sector K 16 having the capacity and vision to offer high quality online educational programs capable of transforming the training needs of the wider society The most important skills are advanced critical thinking and knowledge of globalization affecting diverse societies culturally religiously and politically Pamela Rutledge director of the Media Psychology Research Center wrote The core assumptions driving educational content are not adapting as fast as the world is changing Traditional models train people to equate what they do with who they are i e what do you want to be when you grow up rather than to acquire critical thinking and flexible skills and attitudes that fit a rapidly changing world We have traditional institutions invested in learning as a supply side model rather than demand side that would create proactive self directed learners This bias impacts the entire process from educators to employers It is changing but beliefs are sticky and institutions are cumbersome bureaucracies that are slow to adapt New delivery systems for skills related to technology will be more readily accepted than traditional ones because they avoid much of the embedded bias Successful education models will begin developing mixed methods to leverage technology with traditional delivery and rewrite certification processes with practice relevant standards Justin Reich executive director at the MIT Teaching Systems Lab observed There will continue to be for profit actors in the sector and while some may offer choice and opportunity for students many others will be exploitative with a great er focus on extracting federal grants and burdening students with debt than actually educating students and creating new opportunities John Paine a business analyst commented The competing desires 1 to make educational activity available to all and 2 to monetize the bejeezus out of anything related to the internet will limit the effectiveness of any online learning systems in a more widespread context danah boyd founder of Data Society commented I have complete faith in the ability to identify job gaps and develop educational tools to address those gaps I have zero confidence in us having the political will to address the socio economic factors that are underpinning skill training For example companies won t pay for reskilling and we don t have the political power to tax them at the level needed for public investment in reskilling Furthermore we have serious geographic mismatches underlying discriminatory attitudes and limited opportunities for lower to mid level career advancement What s at stake are not simply skills gaps it s about how we want to architect labor benefits and social safety nets And right now we talk about needing to increase skills but that s not what employers care about It just sounds nice When computer science graduates from CUNY and Howard University can t get a job what s at stake is not skills training Among the future worker capabilities with the highest value in these respondents eyes are the ability to adapt or pivot and the motivation to up skill as needed Many respondents emphasized that the most crucial skill is that people have to learn how to learn and be self motivated to keep learning My biggest concern with self directed learning is that it requires a great deal of internal motivation And I am not confident that individuals will find their way David BersteinDavid Bernstein a former research director wrote The most important skills needed to succeed in the workplace will be flexibility and the ability to adapt and continuously learn My biggest concern with self directed learning is that it requires a great deal of internal motivation And I am not confident that individuals will find their way just as those who enter college today don t know what they want to be when they grow up often until after they graduate So everyone will still need some basic skills interpersonal communications basic arithmetic along with some general culture awareness so they can have that flexibility Any 3 year old can use their parent s smartphone or tablet without reading the manual What I worry about is how well they will adapt when they are 35 or 55 Calton Pu professor and junior chair in software at the Georgia Institute of Technology wrote The most important skill is a meta skill the ability to adapt to changes This ability to adapt is what distinguished Homo sapiens from other species through natural selection As the rate of technological innovation intensifies the workforce of the future will need to adapt to new technology and new markets The people who can adapt the best and fastest will win This view means that any given set of skills will become obsolete quickly as innovations change the various economic sectors precision agriculture manufacturing 4 0 precision medicine just to name a few Therefore the challenge is not only to teach skills but also how to adapt and learn new skills Whether the traditional programs or new programs will be better at teaching adaptive learning remains to be seen Cory Salveson learning systems and analytics lead at RSM US responded The nature of work today and in future is such that if people want to keep increasingly scarce well paying jobs they will need to educate themselves in an ongoing manner for their whole lives Some of these experts say those who aren t motivated to continue to learn and grow will be left behind Scott Amyx CEO of Amyx said online training is advancing and will continue to evolve but The education system is at an inflection point Many ambitious federal and state programs have fizzled to produce dismal to no statistical change in the caliber of K 12 education It s those less educated and less skilled who are most sensitive to technological displacement Online mediums and self directed approaches may be limited in effectiveness with certain labor segments unless supplemented by human coaching and support systems Beth Corzo Duchardt a professor at Muhlenberg College replied Self directed study is a variable that changes the alchemy of teaching and learning It is true that most online courses require self direction Indeed when I advise students I don t recommend that students take online courses unless they have demonstrated an aptitude for self direction But in person courses may also be self directed This works well for some students but not others Students who are self directed often have had a very good foundational education and supportive parents They have been taught to think critically and they know that the most important thing you can learn is how to learn And they are also are more likely to come from economic privilege So not only does the self direction factor pose a problem for teaching at scale the fact that a high degree of self direction may be required for successful completion of coursework towards the new workforce means that existing structures of inequality will be replicated in the future if we rely on these large scale programs Among the 30 of respondents who said they did not think things would turn out well in the future were those who said the trajectory of technology will overwhelm labor markets killing more jobs than it creates They foresee a society where AI programs and machines do most of the work and raise questions about people s sense of identity the socio economic divisions that already distress them their ability to pay for basic needs their ability to use the growing amount of leisure time constructively and the impact of all of this on economic systems It should also be noted that many among the 70 who expect positive change in the next decade also expressed some of these concerns The problem of future jobs is not one of skills training it is one of diminishing jobs How will we cope with a workforce that is simply irrelevant Jennifer ZickermanCory Doctorow activist in residence at MIT Media Lab and co owner of Boing Boing boingboing net responded It s an article of faith that automation begets more jobs than it displaces in the long run but this is a theory free observation based on previous automation booms The current automation is based on general purpose technologies machine learning Turing complete computers a universal network architecture that is equally optimized for all applications and there s good reason to believe that this will be more disruptive and create fewer new jobs than those that came before Glenn Ricart Internet Hall of Fame member and founder and chief technology officer of US Ignite said Up to the present time automation largely has been replacing physical drudgery and repetitive motion things that can and should improve the quality of people s work lives But in the next decade or two there is likely to be a significant amount of technological innovation in machine intelligence and personal assistants that takes a real swipe out of the jobs we want humans to have in education health care transportation agriculture and public safety What are the new jobs we want these people to have If we haven t been able to invent them in response to international trade pacts why are we sure we will be able to create them in the future Richard Stallman Internet Hall of Fame member and president of the Free Software Foundation commented I think this question has no answer I think there won t be jobs for most people a few decades from now and that s what really matters As for the skills for the employed fraction of advanced countries I think they will be difficult to teach You could get better at them by practice but you couldn t study them much Jennifer Zickerman an entrepreneur commented The problem of future jobs is not one of skills training it is one of diminishing jobs How will we cope with a workforce that is simply irrelevant The question isn t how to train people for nonexistent jobs it s how to share the wealth in a world where we don t need most people to work Nathaniel BorensteinNathaniel Borenstein chief scientist at Mimecast replied I challenge the premise of this question that humans will have to be trained for future jobs The jobs of the future are likely to be performed by robots The question isn t how to train people for nonexistent jobs it s how to share the wealth in a world where we don t need most people to work Paul Davis a director based in Australia predicted Whilst such programs will be developed and rolled out on a large scale I question their overall effectiveness Algorithms automation and robotics will result in capital no longer needing labor to progress the economic agenda Labor becomes in many ways surplus to economic requirements This shift will dramatically transform the notion of economic growth and significantly disrupt social contracts labor s bargaining position will be dramatically weakened The nature of this change may require the world to shift to a Post Economic Growth model to avoid societal dislocation and disruption John Sniadowski a systems architect replied The skill sets which could have been taught will be superseded by AI and other robotic technology By the time the training programs are widely available the required skills will no longer be required The whole emphasis of training must now be directed towards personal life skills development rather than the traditional working career based approach There is also the massive sociological economic impact of general automation and AI that must be addressed to redistribute wealth and focus life skills at lifelong learning Tom Sommerville agile coach wrote Our greatest economic challenges over the next decade will be climate change and the wholesale loss of most jobs to automation We urgently need to explore how to distribute the increasing wealth of complex goods and services our civilization produces to a populace that will be increasingly jobless in the traditional sense The current trend of concentrating wealth in the hands of a diminishing number of ultra rich individuals is unsustainable All of this while dealing with the destabilizing effects of climate change and the adaptations necessary to mitigate its worst impacts Some of these experts projected further out into the future imagining a world where the machines themselves learn and overtake core human emotional and cognitive capacities Timothy C Mack managing principal at AAI Foresight said In the area of skill building the wild card is the degree to which machine learning begins to supplant social creative and emotive skill sets This section features responses by several more of the many top analysts who participated in this canvassing Following this wide ranging set of comments on the topic a much more expansive set of quotations directly tied to the set of four themes begins on Page 40 Baratunde Thurston a director s fellow at MIT Media Lab Fast Company columnist and former digital director of The Onion replied Online training and certification will grow significantly in part due to the high expense of formal higher education along with its declining payoffs for certain occupations Why go 100 000 in debt for a four year university when you can take a more targeted course with more guaranteed income generation potential at the end From the employer perspective this type of learning will only grow We are creating a system of on demand labor akin to cloud based labor where companies provision labor resources at will and release them at will not by the year or month but by the job labor unit or small time unit including minutes The automation of human labor will grow significantly And having a workforce trained in discrete and atomizable bits of skills will be seen as a benefit by employers This of course is a terrible soulless insecure life for the workers but since when did that really change anything There will also be a parallel call for benefits professional development and compensation that smooths out the rough patches in this on demand labor life but such efforts will lag behind the exploitation of said labor because big business has more resources and big tech moves too fast for human scale responses of accountability and responsibility To quote Donald Trump Sad Doc Searls journalist speaker and director of Project VRM at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society wrote I don t expect the evolution of work in the connected world to require new educational and training programs Instead I expect we ll see much more adaptive forms of education especially of the self made kind Look at Linux and open source development The world runs on both now and they employ millions of human beings Many or most of the new open source programmers building and running our world today are self taught or teach each other to a higher degree than they are educated by formal schooling Look at Khan Academy and the home schooling movement both of which in many ways outperform formal institutional education The main qualification for programming work isn t a degree It s proven capability This model for employment of self and others will also spread to other professions By the way I don t like the term job It demeans work and reduces the worker to a position in an org chart The great educator John Taylor Gatto who won many awards for his teaching and rarely obeyed curricular requirements says nearly all attempts to reform education make it worse We are by nature learning animals We are each also very different both from each other and from who we were yesterday As a society we need to take advantage of that and nurture our natural hunger for knowledge and productive work while respecting and encouraging our diversity a fundamental balancing feature of all nature human and otherwise Jeff Jarvis professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism wrote At a roundtable on the future convened by Union Square Ventures a few years ago I heard this economic goal presented We need to see the marginal cost of teaching another student fall to zero to see true innovation come to education allowing change to occur outside the tax based and thus safe confines of public education I don t think we ll ever reach zero MOOCs are not the solution But we will likely see a radical economic disruption in education using new tools and means to learn and certify learning and that is the way by which we will manage to train many more people in many new skills Cory Doctorow activist in residence at MIT Media Lab and co owner of Boing Boing boingboing net responded There is for the immediate and medium term a huge shortage of IT talent of course especially security researchers and professionals In part this is driven by the legal and educational framework that takes a zero tolerance approach to the hacking that kids historically engaged in on their way to becoming security researchers If a kid today hacks her school s censoring firewall to look at a blocked site she is expelled and possibly arrested not streamed into an Advanced Placement computer science class We also have a poorly constituted math curriculum for understanding algorithms which is really understanding the statistics of machine learning models An earlier and more enduring focus on stats and statistical literacy which can readily be taught using current affairs for example analyzing the poll numbers from elections the claims made by climate change scientists or even the excellent oral arguments in the Supreme Court Texas abortion law case would impart skills that transferred well into IT programming and especially security Amy Webb futurist and CEO at the Future Today Institute commented Gill Pratt a former program manager of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA recently warned of a Cambrian Explosion of robotics About 500 000 years ago Earth experienced its first Cambrian Explosion a period of rapid cellular evolution and diversification that resulted in the foundation of life as we know it today We are clearly in the dawn of a new age one that is marked not just by advanced machines but rather machines that are starting to learn how to think Soon those machines that can think will augment humankind helping to unlock our creative and industrial potential Some of the workforce will find itself displaced by automation That includes anyone whose primary job functions are transactional bank tellers drivers mortgage brokers However there are many fields that will begin to work alongside smart machines doctors journalists teachers The most important skill of any future worker will be adaptability This current Cambrian Explosion of machines will mean diversification in our systems our interfaces our code Workers who have the temperament and fortitude to quickly learn new menu screens who can find information quickly and the like will fare well I do not see the wide scale emergence of training programs during the next 10 years due to the emergence of smart machines alone If there are unanticipated external events environmental disasters new pandemics and the like that could devastate a country s economy and significantly impact its workforce which might catalyze the development of online learning opportunities Mike Roberts Internet Hall of Fame member and first president and CEO of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN responded MOOCs and related efforts are in their infancy so yes there will be considerable expansion as more is learned about what works and what doesn t work These developments are contributing to a crisis of self confidence in higher ed where traditional scholarship is being challenged on many fronts including the basic definition of education Human brains are complex and it becomes tiresome to see simplistic approaches to education issues Generally an educated person possesses a level of knowledge about the world that allows him or her to use analytical skills induction deduction probability etc to arrive at conclusions that guide behavior The jury is very much out on the extent to which acquisition of knowledge and reasoning skills requires human interaction We now have empirical evidence that a substantial percentage half or more can be gained through self study using computer assisted techniques The path forward for society as a whole is strewn with obstacles of self interest ignorance flawed economics etc If one believes in the singularity it doesn t matter because human machine symbiosis will bury the problem Judith Donath of Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society replied A lot has been written about the need for STEM science technology engineering and mathematics education Here I want to focus on other areas 1 Teaching and Healing As computers robots and other machines take over many jobs we need to reposition the social status of jobs that involve interpersonal care day care teachers nurse elderly coach The issue is not just training but cultural re evaluation of teaching and healing as highly respected skills While technology can assist with this work we mustn t lose sight of the importance of human connections as an end in and of themselves 2 Craft and Repair For the benefit of both the individual and the environment we need to strongly support learning design craft building repair Few of us make anything we use from the building we live in to the objects we own and these things are mostly manufactured as cheaply as possible to be easily bought discarded and bought again in a process of relentless acquisition that often brings little happiness Education here should be integrated into everyday life not just for when one is in school E g much rental housing is in bad repair with tenants waiting weeks months years for even simple fixes a running toilet broken lights a hole in a wall Very easily accessible learning for how to fix these things themselves and making it economically rewarding in the case of a common good is a simple basic example of the kind of ubiquitous craft learning that at scale would be enormously valuable Some of this can be taught online a key component is also online coordination 3 An Informed Citizen What should people know what skills should they have to be informed participants in a democracy Certainly science and technology are important but we need to refocus liberal education not ignore it History in all its complexity Critical thinking how to debate how to recognize persuasive techniques how to understand multiple perspectives how to mediate between different viewpoints Key skill how to research how to evaluate what you see and read David Weinberger a senior researcher at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society said Judging from what we re seeing happening now on the web it seems likely that many of the innovative platforms will be peer to peer Sites like Stack Overflow for software engineers demonstrate a new moral sense that learning in private is selfish Public learning is becoming the norm Brad Templeton chair for computing at Singularity University wrote We will see the start of these technologies but they will not be widespread at the hard problem of adult retraining in 10 years Instead most focus will be on childhood education for the poorer sectors of the world The most important skill flexibility won t be taught easily this way but must become a focus of K 12 education John Markoff former senior writer at The New York Times said We have now passed through the first generation of MOOCs and a new generation of online learning technology is beginning to emerge Udacity is a good example of the trajectory Sebastian Thrun was one of the inventors of the MOOC concept After starting a company to pursue the idea he pivoted focusing specifically on skill oriented education that is coupled directly to the job market Vint Cerf vice president and chief internet evangelist at Google and an Internet Hall of Fame member noted The internet can support remote training and learning These need not be MOOCs Even mobiles can be sources of education I hope we will see more opportunities arising for sharing this kind of knowledge Marcel Bullinga trend watcher and keynote speaker futurecheck replied The future is cheap and so is the future of education I saw an ad already for 1 000 bachelor s level training with an app of course Schools and universities will transform in the same way as shops have done in the past 10 years from analog human first to digital mobile AI first New online credential systems will first complement then gradually replace the old ones The skills of the future Those are the skills a robot cannot master yet Leadership design human meta communication critical thinking motivating cooperating innovating In my black and white moments I say Skip all knowledge training in high schools Main teaching goal We enable you to survive in an ever changing world with ever changing skills and not yet existing jobs of the future We make you better than a robot We let you cooperate with robots We build your self trust We turn you into a decent polite social person And most importantly we do not mix education with religion never Anil Dash entrepreneur technologist and advocate AnilDash predicted These credentials will start to become widespread but acceptance and quality of the training programs will map to the existing systemic biases that inform current educational and career programs Henning Schulzrinne Internet Hall of Fame member and professor at Columbia University wrote Training programs have had the problem that short duration generic programs are often not very effective except as a way to incrementally add very specific skills learn how to operate the new industry specific tool X in a week to the existing repertoire The subject matter specific part of a B S degree in a technical or scientific field takes at least two years often more and these are high intensity full time years often without other responsibilities such as family mostly for students at an age where learning is still natural and easy A large part of this time is spent not in a classroom but becoming fluent through monitored practice including group work internships and other high intensity high interaction apprentice like programs It is hard to see how workers can afford to spend two years without income support while still fulfilling their adult responsibilities such as taking care of their family or elderly parents There are possibilities for adding limited skill sets to otherwise qualified workers e g the ability to program in Python for somebody who already has an economics degree increasing their ability to get their work done The MOOC style programs have shown themselves to be most effective for this delta learning for practicing professionals not turning a high school graduate into somebody who can compete with a college graduate Jamais Cascio distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future responded We will certainly see attempts to devise training and education to match workers to new jobs but for the most part they re likely to fall victim to two related problems 1 The difficulty of projecting what will be the jobs of the future in a world where the targets keep shifting faster and faster Jobs that seem viable may fall victim to a surprising development in automation see for example filmmaking new categories of work may not last long enough to support large numbers of employees 2 We re in an era of general purpose computing which means that our systems are not physically or procedurally limited to a narrow type of work Automation and semi automation e g self checkout stands don t need to completely eliminate a job to make it unable to support large numbers of workers As learning systems improve we will soon if we re not already be at a point where adaptive algorithms can learn new jobs faster than humans Kate Crawford a well known internet researcher studying how people engage with networked technologies wrote We clearly need new educational and training programs to address the deepening precarity of the labor market But to make it successful in that the right training could be developed to make it possible that everyone will have jobs is very unlikely Paul Jones clinical professor and director at the University of North Carolina replied We learn more today by training and information sipping than in the past Training is useful but not the end of education only a kind of education As for sipping you need not know the name of every bear to know you should avoid bears Yet the continual construction of knowledge and cultures requires more from us So far training formally as in Kahn Academy and Lynda com are unarguably effective for continual updates for basic skills No programmer or developer could keep up without the informal training of Stack Overflow Wikipedia hasn t destroyed bar trivia but it has made a dent in our conversational expertise Who played guitar lead on All or Nothing No need for debate A little information sip will let us know We re fine and informed but not educated or learned But what is left out Collaborative construction of knowledge in new areas deeper investigation into known areas and the discovery of entirely new areas of knowledge This is our challenge how to create wisdom from knowledge not just jobs from training and information Bob Frankston internet pioneer and software innovator commented This is a nuanced question We trained generations of people to be phone operators by making it easy to operate the phone aka dialing Today programming is increasingly become a trade The problem with many websites is not so much the training of the programmers as much as getting managers and C level people who understand the new concepts of a world being redefined by software And that s even more true for policymakers We need to think about co evolving work and workers And as always critical thinking will remain the biggest challenge Frank Pasquale author of The Black Box Society The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information and professor of law at the University of Maryland said The biggest danger for the United States educational system is premature vocationalism Rigorous science and humanities courses help students learn how to learn Skills training all too often does not Of course it can complement core academic courses and is likely to be part of a lifetime of learning for those switching occupations But turning high school and college into narrow vocational education programs would make their graduates more vulnerable to robotic replacement not less We need to invest in higher education shoring up support for traditional universities and colleges lest they eventually become bastions for reproduction of an elite leaving the rest of society to untested experiments or online programs Online learning is a good complement for existing colleges but cannot replace them Online only programs emphasize the upside of high tech approaches but rarely grapple with the downside Big data surveillance will track the work students do ostensibly in order to customize learning Get stuck on a lesson Just keep interfacing with a keyboard camera and perhaps haptic sensors Or perhaps IM some reserve army of tutorial labor via digital labor platforms like Mechanical Turk or TaskRabbit Want to prove you aren t faking exams Just let cameras record your every move and keystroke perhaps your eye movements and facial expressions too With new platforms Silicon Valley has lured some universities into giving away lectures for free The colleges think they re establishing good karma with the public but disrupters hope for a more chaotic endgame students deciding to watch free courses then proving their credentials to certifiers who give out badges to signify competence in a skill set The certifiers most likely won t be burdened with any of the teaching research community service counseling career or otherwise recreation social events extracurriculars or other long standing features of residential university communities They will just verify that student X can do task Y It could be a very profitable business If students pay less for actual instruction by experts they have more money to spend on badges This is the for profit model shift money away from instruction and amenities and toward administrator salaries and marketing Unburdened by legacy staff and faculty ed tech firms could muster a just in time workforce to develop new educational technologies Investors could continue unbundling the university into least cost providers of content units student surveillance and badge granting That vision may draw capital but it probably won t be attractive to many students There are serious worries about rapid centralization and reuse of student data by under regulated firms For instance black boxed instructional technology is often run by algorithms that can t be accessed by the students it is assessing Tom Ryan CEO of eLearn Institute Inc responded The degree and perhaps the prestige of the institution gets you the first interview but it is your ability to do good work that keeps the job and move s you to the next level How individuals develop the skills will be less important than having the skills As mastery learning evolves so will our performance based assessment systems providing universities and businesses a greater set of evidence and qualifications then is currently available Our traditional educational systems are burdened by legacy bureaucratic practices that don t contribute to mastery of learning and distract from great teaching and learning People in rural areas don t have physical access to a higher education campus or highly skilled trainers Current job responsibilities don t allow flexible work schedules to seek skills to improve their position K 12 teachers are constantly pulled from class time with students for professional development or during class are required to take attendance complete grade assessments fill out grade checks practice fire drills all degrading quality teaching time If online systems just removed these barriers they would be a great benefit but there is so much more these systems can offer Many of the new skills necessary for jobs of the future require digital skills to be successful Too often education leaders and politicians make unilateral decisions about the interaction between teacher and learner instead of building and maintaining an environment for great teaching and learning to take place Large school systems can t scale major improvements in current systems without leveraging the tools that society and industry are using to transform their practice Barry Chudakov founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp replied One serious drawback to fast tracking needed educational and training programs the people who are creating the jobs of the future have so little time to reflect and gain perspective on the people they will need and how adding these people to their corporate culture changes that culture These entrepreneurs are so busy building technology infrastructures filing patents testing beta incarnations of ideas and processes not to mention navigating the thicket of regulations and restrictions that surround many emerging technologies and industries that they simply don t have time to look around and see the implications of the changes their companies are creating In the near future we will explode the notion of education as a rite of passage for youth happening within the walls of an institution Educational institutions will not disappear but they will change in ways that make them almost unrecognizable by today s models Just as Pokemon Go lifts people out of their chairs into real world environments to explore imaginary captures we will change learning from a passive to an active dynamic experience Three dynamics that will affect all learning and retraining efforts 1 Newer tools are changing our sense of identity 2 We are moving from the fixed point of view that the book gave us to a multiple simultaneous narrative of flow in a networked environment 3 Again since what we think is what we think through we are applying that logic of visual presentation to our presentation and sense of self The first skill needed to succeed in the workforce of the future will be the ability to understand manage and manipulate data Everyone in a technology based profession will need to be a quant quantitative analyst or keep up with the quants Because all human processes and activities can now be quantified and there is considerable exploration and technology development in the application of quantification to everything from our sleep patterns and shopping habits to our emotions and online behaviors many new and important business models are emerging from quantification and the learning algorithms that drive it The second and much more important skill needed to succeed in the workforce of the future will be the ability to find meaning and value in data combined with the problem condition or opportunity the data is outlining Said simply the greatest skill will be the ability to think through the cloud of facts data experience and strategic direction that products and services require Design thinking or visual thinking will be a critical part of managing a data driven world Data mining and management can be taught effectively Thinking problem solving reflection and visioning are difficult to teach at scale Elisabeth Gee professor at Arizona State University and author of What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy commented First many jobs of the future won t require workers with a lot of training Second degrees and credentials have been increasingly promoted by institutions more driven by profit than an interest in preparing students in any meaningful way for employment If the government doesn t step in to restrict such institutions we ll continue to see students graduate with huge debt and little prospect of decent employment Lastly we don t need large scale training of workers we need real education not job focused and opportunities for people to pursue diverse pathways for career development and lifelong learning Patrick Tucker technology editor at Defense One and author of The Naked Future observed Online education offers the opportunity to gather data on student performance continuously or telemetrically What telemetric education offers is the opportunity to continuously and constantly evaluate a student to gain a much more comprehensive understanding of ability retention of information even how other behaviors and factors such as time of day other calendar items nutrition amount of time on Pokemon Go influence learning It offers a more true moving score Learning will become easier and much more of it will happen outside of school settings all of which will diminish the importance of schools and teachers as we know them today But platforms like Coursera can amplify the talents of gifted and effective instructors and reduce the cost of education in the coming decade for all Some schools and colleges will thrive and prosper at a level not seen in their history But they will do so only by transitioning away from today s classroom model toward something else like data driven skills workshops at the high school level and startup incubators or problem solving workshops at the college level We may be conflicted about replacing classes with platforms but if we are to be honest with ourselves we know that we can t prepare coming generations for the challenges of a technological and globalized economy the same way we prepared previous generations to be factory workers The greatest thinker of the 21st century whoever he or she is will understand more about how she thinks and learns than any student in any previous generation and all before ever stepping foot inside a schoolhouse Imagine for a moment the power of knowing beforehand how well you would perform on a test Laura Matzen of Sandia National Laboratory and some of her colleagues have demonstrated that the brain s electrical activity detectable via electroencephalogram EEG predicts how well studied material has been incorporated into memory and thus how well a subject will perform on memory tests Telemetric education also offers the opportunity for everyone to raise his or her hand and be heard That opportunity doesn t come easily in a crowded classroom especially not for women or minority students many of whom feel that if they ask the wrong question or display ignorance they ll confirm some unflattering broadly held perception about their social group David Golumbia associate professor of digital studies at Virginia Commonwealth University commented As an educator I am completely unconvinced by the current rhetoric that says our educational system is unable to meet the needs of current or future workforces This whole argument is a sham meant to attack the fundamental purpose and basis of education Most empirical evidence shows that the premises of this question are incorrect most high skilled jobs of the sort implied here have an oversupply of qualified talent We need more of an emphasis on the fundamental purpose of education not on skills Stephen Downes researcher at the National Research Council of Canada commented We will see educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers because for the most part mechanisms will be in place that enable them to train themselves Within 10 years we should be beginning to see that the idea of providing training education or training is misguided because it s overly expensive and less effective than self managed learning I find it interesting even that the question itself presumes that skills must be taught Which of these skills can be taught effectively via online systems It s not that the skills are taught per se but rather that the skills are learned A wide range of activities may enable skills to be learned especially multidisciplinary skills such as critical thinking or social interaction without specifically teaching those skills There are very few skills that require specific and personal instruction from an expert to learn frankly I can t think of any which means that within 10 years we should at least be able to countenance the possibility that all or nearly all educational programs may be automated Of course they will continue to require the time and participation of the individual learner and in many cases social interaction with other learners but the labor intensive learning industry we have developed to this point will not be required I see no major objections to this argument 1 It may be argued that personal interaction is required in order to get to know a student and therefore anticipate what they need However in 10 years it will be arguable and probably demonstrable that your own computer networks will know you better than any individual instructor could even an instructor who worked with you your entire life Sure there are disasters like the Facebook news stream but people are already amazed at how much Google knows about them And we know that with enough data analytics can outperform humans even in complex tasks 2 It may be argued that personal interaction is required in order to evaluate a student s level of achievement Most actual assessment not to be confused with multiple choice tests in school or professional programs is based on expert recognition The submitted behavior an essay performance in surgery piloting an aircraft in a simulation is not assessed according to whether a set of indicators is achieved this would possibly be a necessary but never a sufficient condition The expert looks at the overall behavior and assesses whether that competency has been met The expert is serving as a proxy for the community at large With modern communications technology this proxy is no longer required Through the course of any given day as a person goes through various activities they interact with dozens of other people either in person or through online interaction Each person responds to them in some way not by testing them but by for example engaging them in conversation asking questions following advice etc These responses over time form a comprehensive and constantly changing assessment of the person An anonymous postdoctoral fellow at Rice University s Humanities Research Center observed So much has been said and challenged over the past three decades about online education I d like to answer this by asking a different set of questions which address recent developments in robotics and artificial intelligence How will autonomous factories in Chicago U S share what they ve learned with factories in Pingdingshan China What credentialing system will self driving cars require How will artificially intelligent laborers learn the skills needed to run a household business government institution or political organization When will universities allow artilect nonhuman artificial intelligence students to enroll in their traditional undergraduate and graduate degree programs and how would students learn the more ephemeral skills like critical thinking from a thinking machine

centuries experts have predicted that machines would make workers obsolete That moment may finally be arriving Could that be a good thing 1 Youngstown U S A The end of work is still just a futuristic concept for most of the United States but it is something like a moment in history for Youngstown Ohio one its residents can cite with precision September 19 1977 For much of the 20th century Youngstown s steel mills delivered such great prosperity that the city was a model of the American dream boasting a median income and a homeownership rate that were among the nation s highest But as manufacturing shifted abroad after World War II Youngstown steel suffered and on that gray September afternoon in 1977 Youngstown Sheet and Tube announced the shuttering of its Campbell Works mill Within five years the city lost 50 000 jobs and 1 3 billion in manufacturing wages The effect was so severe that a term was coined to describe the fallout regional depression Youngstown was transformed not only by an economic disruption but also by a psychological and cultural breakdown Depression spousal abuse and suicide all became much more prevalent the caseload of the area s mental health center tripled within a decade The city built four prisons in the mid 1990s a rare growth industry One of the few downtown construction projects of that period was a museum dedicated to the defunct steel industry This winter I traveled to Ohio to consider what would happen if technology permanently replaced a great deal of human work I wasn t seeking a tour of our automated future I went because Youngstown has become a national metaphor for the decline of labor a place where the middle class of the 20th century has become a museum exhibit Youngstown s story is America s story because it shows that when jobs go away the cultural cohesion of a place is destroyed says John Russo a professor of labor studies at Youngstown State University The cultural breakdown matters even more than the economic breakdown In the past few years even as the United States has pulled itself partway out of the jobs hole created by the Great Recession some economists and technologists have warned that the economy is near a tipping point When they peer deeply into labor market data they see troubling signs masked for now by a cyclical recovery And when they look up from their spreadsheets they see automation high and low robots in the operating room and behind the fast food counter They imagine self driving cars snaking through the streets and Amazon drones dotting the sky replacing millions of drivers warehouse stockers and retail workers They observe that the capabilities of machines already formidable continue to expand exponentially while our own remain the same And they wonder Is any job truly safe Futurists and science fiction writers have at times looked forward to machines workplace takeover with a kind of giddy excitement imagining the banishment of drudgery and its replacement by expansive leisure and almost limitless personal freedom And make no mistake if the capabilities of computers continue to multiply while the price of computing continues to decline that will mean a great many of life s necessities and luxuries will become ever cheaper and it will mean great wealth at least when aggregated up to the level of the national economy But even leaving aside questions of how to distribute that wealth the widespread disappearance of work would usher in a social transformation unlike any we ve seen If John Russo is right then saving work is more important than saving any particular job Industriousness has served as America s unofficial religion since its founding The sanctity and preeminence of work lie at the heart of the country s politics economics and social interactions What might happen if work goes away The U S labor force has been shaped by millennia of technological progress Agricultural technology birthed the farming industry the industrial revolution moved people into factories and then globalization and automation moved them back out giving rise to a nation of services But throughout these reshufflings the total number of jobs has always increased What may be looming is something different an era of technological unemployment in which computer scientists and software engineers essentially invent us out of work and the total number of jobs declines steadily and permanently This fear is not new The hope that machines might free us from toil has always been intertwined with the fear that they will rob us of our agency In the midst of the Great Depression the economist John Maynard Keynes forecast that technological progress might allow a 15 hour workweek and abundant leisure by 2030 But around the same time President Herbert Hoover received a letter warning that industrial technology was a Frankenstein monster that threatened to upend manufacturing devouring our civilization The letter came from the mayor of Palo Alto of all places In 1962 President John F Kennedy said If men have the talent to invent new machines that put men out of work they have the talent to put those men back to work But two years later a committee of scientists and social activists sent an open letter to President Lyndon B Johnson arguing that the cybernation revolution would create a separate nation of the poor the unskilled the jobless who would be unable either to find work or to afford life s necessities The job market defied doomsayers in those earlier times and according to the most frequently reported jobs numbers it has so far done the same in our own time Unemployment is currently just over 5 percent and 2014 was this century s best year for job growth One could be forgiven for saying that recent predictions about technological job displacement are merely forming the latest chapter in a long story called The Boys Who Cried Robot one in which the robot unlike the wolf never arrives in the end The end of work argument has often been dismissed as the Luddite fallacy an allusion to the 19th century British brutes who smashed textile making machines at the dawn of the industrial revolution fearing the machines would put hand weavers out of work But some of the most sober economists are beginning to worry that the Luddites weren t wrong just premature When former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers was an MIT undergraduate in the early 1970s many economists disdained the stupid people who thought that automation was going to make all the jobs go away he said at the National Bureau of Economic Research Summer Institute in July 2013 Until a few years ago I didn t think this was a very complicated subject the Luddites were wrong and the believers in technology and technological progress were right I m not so completely certain now 2 Reasons to Cry RobotWhat does the end of work mean exactly It does not mean the imminence of total unemployment nor is the United States remotely likely to face say 30 or 50 percent unemployment within the next decade Rather technology could exert a slow but continual downward pressure on the value and availability of work that is on wages and on the share of prime age workers with full time jobs Eventually by degrees that could create a new normal where the expectation that work will be a central feature of adult life dissipates for a significant portion of society After 300 years of people crying wolf there are now three broad reasons to take seriously the argument that the beast is at the door the ongoing triumph of capital over labor the quiet demise of the working man and the impressive dexterity of information technology Labor s losses One of the first things we might expect to see in a period of technological displacement is the diminishment of human labor as a driver of economic growth In fact signs that this is happening have been present for quite some time The share of U S economic output that s paid out in wages fell steadily in the 1980s reversed some of its losses in the 90s and then continued falling after 2000 accelerating during the Great Recession It now stands at its lowest level since the government started keeping track in the mid 20th century A number of theories have been advanced to explain this phenomenon including globalization and its accompanying loss of bargaining power for some workers But Loukas Karabarbounis and Brent Neiman economists at the University of Chicago have estimated that almost half of the decline is the result of businesses replacing workers with computers and software In 1964 the nation s most valuable company AT T was worth 267 billion in today s dollars and employed 758 611 people Today s telecommunications giant Google is worth 370 billion but has only about 55 000 employees less than a tenth the size of AT T s workforce in its heyday The spread of nonworking men and underemployed youth The share of prime age Americans 25 to 54 years old who are working has been trending down since 2000 Among men the decline began even earlier the share of prime age men who are neither working nor looking for work has doubled since the late 1970s and has increased as much throughout the recovery as it did during the Great Recession itself All in all about one in six prime age men today are either unemployed or out of the workforce altogether This is what the economist Tyler Cowen calls the key statistic for understanding the spreading rot in the American workforce Conventional wisdom has long held that under normal economic conditions men in this age group at the peak of their abilities and less likely than women to be primary caregivers for children should almost all be working Yet fewer and fewer are Economists cannot say for certain why men are turning away from work but one explanation is that technological change has helped eliminate the jobs for which many are best suited Since 2000 the number of manufacturing jobs has fallen by almost 5 million or about 30 percent Young people just coming onto the job market are also struggling and by many measures have been for years Six years into the recovery the share of recent college grads who are underemployed in jobs that historically haven t required a degree is still higher than it was in 2007 or for that matter 2000 And the supply of these non college jobs is shifting away from high paying occupations such as electrician toward low wage service jobs such as waiter More people are pursuing higher education but the real wages of recent college graduates have fallen by 7 7 percent since 2000 In the biggest picture the job market appears to be requiring more and more preparation for a lower and lower starting wage The distorting effect of the Great Recession should make us cautious about overinterpreting these trends but most began before the recession and they do not seem to speak encouragingly about the future of work The shrewdness of software One common objection to the idea that technology will permanently displace huge numbers of workers is that new gadgets like self checkout kiosks at drugstores have failed to fully displace their human counterparts like cashiers But employers typically take years to embrace new machines at the expense of workers The robotics revolution began in factories in the 1960s and 70s but manufacturing employment kept rising until 1980 and then collapsed during the subsequent recessions Likewise the personal computer existed in the 80s says Henry Siu an economist at the University of British Columbia but you don t see any effect on office and administrative support jobs until the 1990s and then suddenly in the last recession it s huge So today you ve got checkout screens and the promise of driverless cars flying drones and little warehouse robots We know that these tasks can be done by machines rather than people But we may not see the effect until the next recession or the recession after that Some observers say our humanity is a moat that machines cannot cross They believe people s capacity for compassion deep understanding and creativity are inimitable But as Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee have argued in their book The Second Machine Age computers are so dexterous that predicting their application 10 years from now is almost impossible Who could have guessed in 2005 two years before the iPhone was released that smartphones would threaten hotel jobs within the decade by helping homeowners rent out their apartments and houses to strangers on Airbnb Or that the company behind the most popular search engine would design a self driving car that could soon threaten driving the most common job occupation among American men In 2013 Oxford University researchers forecast that machines might be able to perform half of all U S jobs in the next two decades The projection was audacious but in at least a few cases it probably didn t go far enough For example the authors named psychologist as one of the occupations least likely to be computerisable But some research suggests that people are more honest in therapy sessions when they believe they are confessing their troubles to a computer because a machine can t pass moral judgment Google and WebMD already may be answering questions once reserved for one s therapist This doesn t prove that psychologists are going the way of the textile worker Rather it shows how easily computers can encroach on areas previously considered for humans only After 300 years of breathtaking innovation people aren t massively unemployed or indentured by machines But to suggest how this could change some economists have pointed to the defunct career of the second most important species in U S economic history the horse For many centuries people created technologies that made the horse more productive and more valuable like plows for agriculture and swords for battle One might have assumed that the continuing advance of complementary technologies would make the animal ever more essential to farming and fighting historically perhaps the two most consequential human activities Instead came inventions that made the horse obsolete the tractor the car and the tank After tractors rolled onto American farms in the early 20th century the population of horses and mules began to decline steeply falling nearly 50 percent by the 1930s and 90 percent by the 1950s Humans can do much more than trot carry and pull But the skills required in most offices hardly elicit our full range of intelligence Most jobs are still boring repetitive and easily learned The most common occupations in the United States are retail salesperson cashier food and beverage server and office clerk Together these four jobs employ 15 4 million people nearly 10 percent of the labor force or more workers than there are in Texas and Massachusetts combined Each is highly susceptible to automation according to the Oxford study Technology creates some jobs too but the creative half of creative destruction is easily overstated Nine out of 10 workers today are in occupations that existed 100 years ago and just 5 percent of the jobs generated between 1993 and 2013 came from high tech sectors like computing software and telecommunications Our newest industries tend to be the most labor efficient they just don t require many people It is for precisely this reason that the economic historian Robert Skidelsky comparing the exponential growth in computing power with the less than exponential growth in job complexity has said Sooner or later we will run out of jobs Is that certain or certainly imminent No The signs so far are murky and suggestive The most fundamental and wrenching job restructurings and contractions tend to happen during recessions we ll know more after the next couple of downturns But the possibility seems significant enough and the consequences disruptive enough that we owe it to ourselves to start thinking about what society could look like without universal work in an effort to begin nudging it toward the better outcomes and away from the worse ones To paraphrase the science fiction novelist William Gibson there are perhaps fragments of the post work future distributed throughout the present I see three overlapping possibilities as formal employment opportunities decline Some people displaced from the formal workforce will devote their freedom to simple leisure some will seek to build productive communities outside the workplace and others will fight passionately and in many cases fruitlessly to reclaim their productivity by piecing together jobs in an informal economy These are futures of consumption communal creativity and contingency In any combination it is almost certain that the country would have to embrace a radical new role for government 3 Consumption The Paradox of LeisureWork is really three things says Peter Frase the author of Four Futures a forthcoming book about how automation will change America the means by which the economy produces goods the means by which people earn income and an activity that lends meaning or purpose to many people s lives We tend to conflate these things he told me because today we need to pay people to keep the lights on so to speak But in a future of abundance you wouldn t and we ought to think about ways to make it easier and better to not be employed Frase belongs to a small group of writers academics and economists they have been called post workists who welcome even root for the end of labor American society has an irrational belief in work for work s sake says Benjamin Hunnicutt another post workist and a historian at the University of Iowa even though most jobs aren t so uplifting A 2014 Gallup report of worker satisfaction found that as many as 70 percent of Americans don t feel engaged by their current job Hunnicutt told me that if a cashier s work were a video game grab an item find the bar code scan it slide the item onward and repeat critics of video games might call it mindless But when it s a job politicians praise its intrinsic dignity Purpose meaning identity fulfillment creativity autonomy all these things that positive psychology has shown us to be necessary for well being are absent in the average job he said The post workists are certainly right about some important things Paid labor does not always map to social good Raising children and caring for the sick is essential work and these jobs are compensated poorly or not at all In a post work society Hunnicutt said people might spend more time caring for their families and neighbors pride could come from our relationships rather than from our careers The post work proponents acknowledge that even in the best post work scenarios pride and jealousy will persevere because reputation will always be scarce even in an economy of abundance But with the right government provisions they believe the end of wage labor will allow for a golden age of well being Hunnicutt said he thinks colleges could reemerge as cultural centers rather than job prep institutions The word school he pointed out comes from skhol the Greek word for leisure We used to teach people to be free he said Now we teach them to work Hunnicutt s vision rests on certain assumptions about taxation and redistribution that might not be congenial to many Americans today But even leaving that aside for the moment this vision is problematic it doesn t resemble the world as it is currently experienced by most jobless people By and large the jobless don t spend their downtime socializing with friends or taking up new hobbies Instead they watch TV or sleep Time use surveys show that jobless prime age people dedicate some of the time once spent working to cleaning and childcare But men in particular devote most of their free time to leisure the lion s share of which is spent watching television browsing the Internet and sleeping Retired seniors watch about 50 hours of television a week according to Nielsen That means they spend a majority of their lives either sleeping or sitting on the sofa looking at a flatscreen The unemployed theoretically have the most time to socialize and yet studies have shown that they feel the most social isolation it is surprisingly hard to replace the camaraderie of the water cooler Most people want to work and are miserable when they cannot The ills of unemployment go well beyond the loss of income people who lose their job are more likely to suffer from mental and physical ailments There is a loss of status a general malaise and demoralization which appears somatically or psychologically or both says Ralph Catalano a public health professor at UC Berkeley Research has shown that it is harder to recover from a long bout of joblessness than from losing a loved one or suffering a life altering injury The very things that help many people recover from other emotional traumas a routine an absorbing distraction a daily purpose are not readily available to the unemployed The transition from labor force to leisure force would likely be particularly hard on Americans the worker bees of the rich world Between 1950 and 2012 annual hours worked per worker fell significantly throughout Europe by about 40 percent in Germany and the Netherlands but by only 10 percent in the United States Richer college educated Americans are working more than they did 30 years ago particularly when you count time working and answering e mail at home In 1989 the psychologists Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Judith LeFevre conducted a famous study of Chicago workers that found people at work often wished they were somewhere else But in questionnaires these same workers reported feeling better and less anxious in the office or at the plant than they did elsewhere The two psychologists called this the paradox of work many people are happier complaining about jobs than they are luxuriating in too much leisure Other researchers have used the term guilty couch potato to describe people who use media to relax but often feel worthless when they reflect on their unproductive downtime Contentment speaks in the present tense but something more pride comes only in reflection on past accomplishments The post workists argue that Americans work so hard because their culture has conditioned them to feel guilty when they are not being productive and that this guilt will fade as work ceases to be the norm This might prove true but it s an untestable hypothesis When I asked Hunnicutt what sort of modern community most resembles his ideal of a post work society he admitted I m not sure that such a place exists Less passive and more nourishing forms of mass leisure could develop Arguably they already are developing The Internet social media and gaming offer entertainments that are as easy to slip into as is watching TV but all are more purposeful and often less isolating Video games despite the derision aimed at them are vehicles for achievement of a sort Jeremy Bailenson a communications professor at Stanford says that as virtual reality technology improves people s cyber existence will become as rich and social as their real life Games in which users climb into another person s skin to embody his or her experiences firsthand don t just let people live out vicarious fantasies he has argued but also help you live as somebody else to teach you empathy and pro social skills But it s hard to imagine that leisure could ever entirely fill the vacuum of accomplishment left by the demise of labor Most people do need to achieve things through yes work to feel a lasting sense of purpose To envision a future that offers more than minute to minute satisfaction we have to imagine how millions of people might find meaningful work without formal wages So inspired by the predictions of one of America s most famous labor economists I took a detour on my way to Youngstown and stopped in Columbus Ohio 4 Communal Creativity The Artisans RevengeArtisans made up the original American middle class Before industrialization swept through the U S economy many people who didn t work on farms were silversmiths blacksmiths or woodworkers These artisans were ground up by the machinery of mass production in the 20th century But Lawrence Katz a labor economist at Harvard sees the next wave of automation returning us to an age of craftsmanship and artistry In particular he looks forward to the ramifications of 3 D printing whereby machines construct complex objects from digital designs The factories that arose more than a century ago could make Model Ts and forks and knives and mugs and glasses in a standardized cheap way and that drove the artisans out of business Katz told me But what if the new tech like 3 D printing machines can do customized things that are almost as cheap It s possible that information technology and robots eliminate traditional jobs and make possible a new artisanal economy an economy geared around self expression where people would do artistic things with their time In other words it would be a future not of consumption but of creativity as technology returns the tools of the assembly line to individuals democratizing the means of mass production Something like this future is already present in the small but growing number of industrial shops called makerspaces that have popped up in the United States and around the world The Columbus Idea Foundry is the country s largest such space a cavernous converted shoe factory stocked with industrial age machinery Several hundred members pay a monthly fee to use its arsenal of machines to make gifts and jewelry weld finish and paint play with plasma cutters and work an angle grinder or operate a lathe with a machinist When I arrived there on a bitterly cold afternoon in February a chalkboard standing on an easel by the door displayed three arrows pointing toward bathrooms pewter casting and zombies Near the entrance three men with black fingertips and grease stained shirts took turns fixing a 60 year old metal turning lathe Behind them a resident artist was tutoring an older woman on how to transfer her photographs onto a large canvas while a couple of guys fed pizza pies into a propane fired stone oven Elsewhere men in protective goggles welded a sign for a local chicken restaurant while others punched codes into a computer controlled laser cutting machine Beneath the din of drilling and wood cutting a Pandora rock station hummed tinnily from a Wi Fi connected Edison phonograph horn The foundry is not just a gymnasium of tools It is a social center Alex Bandar who started the foundry after receiving a doctorate in materials science and engineering has a theory about the rhythms of invention in American history Over the past century he told me the economy has moved from hardware to software from atoms to bits and people have spent more time at work in front of screens But as computers take over more tasks previously considered the province of humans the pendulum will swing back from bits to atoms at least when it comes to how people spend their days Bandar thinks that a digitally preoccupied society will come to appreciate the pure and distinct pleasure of making things you can touch I ve always wanted to usher in a new era of technology where robots do our bidding Bandar said If you have better batteries better robotics more dexterous manipulation then it s not a far stretch to say robots do most of the work So what do we do Play Draw Actually talk to each other again You don t need any particular fondness for plasma cutters to see the beauty of an economy where tens of millions of people make things they enjoy making whether physical or digital in buildings or in online communities and receive feedback and appreciation for their work The Internet and the cheap availability of artistic tools have already empowered millions of people to produce culture from their living rooms People upload more than 400 000 hours of YouTube videos and 350 million new Facebook photos every day The demise of the formal economy could free many would be artists writers and craftspeople to dedicate their time to creative interests to live as cultural producers Such activities offer virtues that many organizational psychologists consider central to satisfaction at work independence the chance to develop mastery and a sense of purpose After touring the foundry I sat at a long table with several members sharing the pizza that had come out of the communal oven I asked them what they thought of their organization as a model for a future where automation reached further into the formal economy A mixed media artist named Kate Morgan said that most people she knew at the foundry would quit their jobs and use the foundry to start their own business if they could Others spoke about the fundamental need to witness the outcome of one s work which was satisfied more deeply by craftsmanship than by other jobs they d held Late in the conversation we were joined by Terry Griner an engineer who had built miniature steam engines in his garage before Bandar invited him to join the foundry His fingers were covered in soot and he told me about the pride he had in his ability to fix things I ve been working since I was 16 I ve done food service restaurant work hospital work and computer programming I ve done a lot of different jobs said Griner who is now a divorced father But if we had a society that said We ll cover your essentials you can work in the shop I think that would be utopia That to me would be the best of all possible worlds 5 Contingency You re on Your Own One mile to the east of downtown Youngstown in a brick building surrounded by several empty lots is Royal Oaks an iconic blue collar dive At about 5 30 p m on a Wednesday the place was nearly full The bar glowed yellow and green from the lights mounted along a wall Old beer signs trophies masks and mannequins cluttered the back corner of the main room like party leftovers stuffed in an attic The scene was mostly middle aged men some in groups talking loudly about baseball and smelling vaguely of pot some drank alone at the bar sitting quietly or listening to music on headphones I spoke with several patrons there who work as musicians artists or handymen many did not hold a steady job It is the end of a particular kind of wage work said Hannah Woodroofe a bartender there who it turns out is also a graduate student at the University of Chicago She s writing a dissertation on Youngstown as a harbinger of the future of work A lot of people in the city make ends meet via post wage arrangements she said working for tenancy or under the table or trading services Places like Royal Oaks are the new union halls People go there not only to relax but also to find tradespeople for particular jobs like auto repair Others go to exchange fresh vegetables grown in urban gardens they ve created amid Youngstown s vacant lots When an entire area like Youngstown suffers from high and prolonged unemployment problems caused by unemployment move beyond the personal sphere widespread joblessness shatters neighborhoods and leaches away their civic spirit John Russo the Youngstown State professor who is a co author of a history of the city Steeltown USA says the local identity took a savage blow when residents lost the ability to find reliable employment I can t stress this enough this isn t just about economics it s psychological he told me Russo sees Youngstown as the leading edge of a larger trend toward the development of what he calls the precariat a working class that swings from task to task in order to make ends meet and suffers a loss of labor rights bargaining rights and job security In Youngstown many of these workers have by now made their peace with insecurity and poverty by building an identity and some measure of pride around contingency The faith they lost in institutions the corporations that have abandoned the city the police who have failed to keep them safe has not returned But Russo and Woodroofe both told me they put stock in their own independence And so a place that once defined itself single mindedly by the steel its residents made has gradually learned to embrace the valorization of well rounded resourcefulness Karen Schubert a 54 year old writer with two master s degrees accepted a part time job as a hostess at a caf in Youngstown early this year after spending months searching for full time work Schubert who has two grown children and an infant grandson said she d loved teaching writing and literature at the local university But many colleges have replaced full time professors with part time adjuncts in order to control costs and she d found that with the hours she could get adjunct teaching didn t pay a living wage so she d stopped I think I would feel like a personal failure if I didn t know that so many Americans have their leg caught in the same trap she said Among Youngstown s precariat one can see a third possible future where millions of people struggle for years to build a sense of purpose in the absence of formal jobs and where entrepreneurship emerges out of necessity But while it lacks the comforts of the consumption economy or the cultural richness of Lawrence Katz s artisanal future it is more complex than an outright dystopia There are young people working part time in the new economy who feel independent whose work and personal relationships are contingent and say they like it like this to have short hours so they have time to focus on their passions Russo said Schubert s wages at the caf are not enough to live on and in her spare time she sells books of her poetry at readings and organizes gatherings of the literary arts community in Youngstown where other writers many of them also underemployed share their prose The evaporation of work has deepened the local arts and music scene several residents told me because people who are inclined toward the arts have so much time to spend with one another We re a devastatingly poor and hemorrhaging population but the people who live here are fearless and creative and phenomenal Schubert said Whether or not one has artistic ambitions as Schubert does it is arguably growing easier to find short term gigs or spot employment Paradoxically technology is the reason A constellation of Internet enabled companies matches available workers with quick jobs most prominently including Uber for drivers Seamless for meal deliverers Homejoy for house cleaners and TaskRabbit for just about anyone else And online markets like Craigslist and eBay have likewise made it easier for people to take on small independent projects such as furniture refurbishing Although the on demand economy is not yet a major part of the employment picture the number of temporary help services workers has grown by 50 percent since 2010 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Some of these services too could be usurped eventually by machines But on demand apps also spread the work around by carving up jobs like driving a taxi into hundreds of little tasks like a single drive which allows more people to compete for smaller pieces of work These new arrangements are already challenging the legal definitions of employer and employee and there are many reasons to be ambivalent about them But if the future involves a declining number of full time jobs as in Youngstown then splitting some of the remaining work up among many part time workers instead of a few full timers wouldn t necessarily be a bad development We shouldn t be too quick to excoriate companies that let people combine their work art and leisure in whatever ways they choose Today the norm is to think about employment and unemployment as a black and white binary rather than two points at opposite ends of a wide spectrum of working arrangements As late as the mid 19th century though the modern concept of unemployment didn t exist in the United States Most people lived on farms and while paid work came and went home industry canning sewing carpentry was a constant Even in the worst economic panics people typically found productive things to do The despondency and helplessness of unemployment were discovered to the bafflement and dismay of cultural critics only after factory work became dominant and cities swelled The 21st century if it presents fewer full time jobs in the sectors that can be automated could in this respect come to resemble the mid 19th century an economy marked by episodic work across a range of activities the loss of any one of which would not make somebody suddenly idle Many bristle that contingent gigs offer a devil s bargain a bit of additional autonomy in exchange for a larger loss of security But some might thrive in a market where versatility and hustle are rewarded where there are as in Youngstown few jobs to have yet many things to do 6 Government The Visible HandIn the 1950s Henry Ford II the CEO of Ford and Walter Reuther the head of the United Auto Workers union were touring a new engine plant in Cleveland Ford gestured to a fleet of machines and said Walter how are you going to get these robots to pay union dues The union boss famously replied Henry how are you going to get them to buy your cars As Martin Ford no relation writes in his new book The Rise of the Robots this story might be apocryphal but its message is instructive We re pretty good at noticing the immediate effects of technology s substituting for workers such as fewer people on the factory floor What s harder is anticipating the second order effects of this transformation such as what happens to the consumer economy when you take away the consumers Technological progress on the scale we re imagining would usher in social and cultural changes that are almost impossible to fully envision Consider just how fundamentally work has shaped America s geography Today s coastal cities are a jumble of office buildings and residential space Both are expensive and tightly constrained But the decline of work would make many office buildings unnecessary What might that mean for the vibrancy of urban areas Would office space yield seamlessly to apartments allowing more people to live more affordably in city centers and leaving the cities themselves just as lively Or would we see vacant shells and spreading blight Would big cities make sense at all if their role as highly sophisticated labor ecosystems were diminished As the 40 hour workweek faded the idea of a lengthy twice daily commute would almost certainly strike future generations as an antiquated and baffling waste of time But would those generations prefer to live on streets full of high rises or in smaller towns Today many working parents worry that they spend too many hours at the office As full time work declined rearing children could become less overwhelming And because job opportunities historically have spurred migration in the United States we might see less of it the diaspora of extended families could give way to more closely knitted clans But if men and women lost their purpose and dignity as work went away those families would nonetheless be troubled The decline of the labor force would make our politics more contentious Deciding how to tax profits and distribute income could become the most significant economic policy debate in American history In The Wealth of Nations Adam Smith used the term invisible hand to refer to the order and social benefits that arise surprisingly from individuals selfish actions But to preserve the consumer economy and the social fabric governments might have to embrace what Haruhiko Kuroda the governor of the Bank of Japan has called the visible hand of economic intervention What follows is an early sketch of how it all might work In the near term local governments might do well to create more and more ambitious community centers or other public spaces where residents can meet learn skills bond around sports or crafts and socialize Two of the most common side effects of unemployment are loneliness on the individual level and the hollowing out of community pride A national policy that directed money toward centers in distressed areas might remedy the maladies of idleness and form the beginnings of a long term experiment on how to reengage people in their neighborhoods in the absence of full employment We could also make it easier for people to start their own small scale and even part time businesses New business formation has declined in the past few decades in all 50 states One way to nurture fledgling ideas would be to build out a network of business incubators Here Youngstown offers an unexpected model its business incubator has been recognized internationally and its success has brought new hope to West Federal Street the city s main drag Near the beginning of any broad decline in job availability the United States might take a lesson from Germany on job sharing The German government gives firms incentives to cut all their workers hours rather than lay off some of them during hard times So a company with 50 workers that might otherwise lay off 10 people instead reduces everyone s hours by 20 percent Such a policy would help workers at established firms keep their attachment to the labor force despite the declining amount of overall labor Spreading work in this way has its limits Some jobs can t be easily shared and in any case sharing jobs wouldn t stop labor s pie from shrinking it would only apportion the slices differently Eventually Washington would have to somehow spread wealth too One way of doing that would be to more heavily tax the growing share of income going to the owners of capital and use the money to cut checks to all adults This idea called a universal basic income has received bipartisan support in the past Many liberals currently support it and in the 1960s Richard Nixon and the conservative economist Milton Friedman each proposed a version of the idea That history notwithstanding the politics of universal income in a world without universal work would be daunting The rich could say with some accuracy that their hard work was subsidizing the idleness of millions of takers What s more although a universal income might replace lost wages it would do little to preserve the social benefits of work The most direct solution to the latter problem would be for the government to pay people to do something rather than nothing Although this smacks of old European socialism or Depression era makework it might do the most to preserve virtues such as responsibility agency and industriousness In the 1930s the Works Progress Administration did more than rebuild the nation s infrastructure It hired 40 000 artists and other cultural workers to produce music and theater murals and paintings state and regional travel guides and surveys of state records It s not impossible to imagine something like the WPA or an effort even more capacious for a post work future What might that look like Several national projects might justify direct hiring such as caring for a rising population of elderly people But if the balance of work continues to shift toward the small bore and episodic the simplest way to help everybody stay busy might be government sponsorship of a national online marketplace of work or alternatively a series of local ones sponsored by local governments Individuals could browse for large long term projects like cleaning up after a natural disaster or small short term ones an hour of tutoring an evening of entertainment an art commission The requests could come from local governments or community associations or nonprofit groups from rich families seeking nannies or tutors or from other individuals given some number of credits to spend on the site each year To ensure a baseline level of attachment to the workforce the government could pay adults a flat rate in return for some minimum level of activity on the site but people could always earn more by taking on more gigs Although a digital WPA might strike some people as a strange anachronism it would be similar to a federalized version of Mechanical Turk the popular Amazon sister site where individuals and companies post projects of varying complexity while so called Turks on the other end browse tasks and collect money for the ones they complete Mechanical Turk was designed to list tasks that cannot be performed by a computer The name is an allusion to an 18th century Austrian hoax in which a famous automaton that seemed to play masterful chess concealed a human player who chose the moves and moved the pieces A government marketplace might likewise specialize in those tasks that required empathy humanity or a personal touch By connecting millions of people in one central hub it might even inspire what the technology writer Robin Sloan has called a Cambrian explosion of mega scale creative and intellectual pursuits a generation of Wikipedia scale projects that can ask their users for even deeper commitments There s a case to be made for using the tools of government to provide other incentives as well to help people avoid the typical traps of joblessness and build rich lives and vibrant communities After all the members of the Columbus Idea Foundry probably weren t born with an innate love of lathe operation or laser cutting Mastering these skills requires discipline discipline requires an education and an education for many people involves the expectation that hours of often frustrating practice will eventually prove rewarding In a post work society the financial rewards of education and training won t be as obvious This is a singular challenge of imagining a flourishing post work society How will people discover their talents or the rewards that come from expertise if they don t see much incentive to develop either Modest payments to young people for attending and completing college skills training programs or community center workshops might eventually be worth considering This seems radical but the aim would be conservative to preserve the status quo of an educated and engaged society Whatever their career opportunities young people will still grow up to be citizens neighbors and even episodically workers Nudges toward education and training might be particularly beneficial to men who are more likely to withdraw into their living rooms when they become unemployed 7 Jobs and CallingsDecades from now perhaps the 20th century will strike future historians as an aberration with its religious devotion to overwork in a time of prosperity its attenuations of family in service to job opportunity its conflation of income with self worth The post work society I ve described holds a warped mirror up to today s economy but in many ways it reflects the forgotten norms of the mid 19th century the artisan middle class the primacy of local communities and the unfamiliarity with widespread joblessness The three potential futures of consumption communal creativity and contingency are not separate paths branching out from the present They re likely to intertwine and even influence one another Entertainment will surely become more immersive and exert a gravitational pull on people without much to do But if that s all that happens society will have failed The foundry in Columbus shows how the third places in people s lives communities separate from their homes and offices could become central to growing up learning new skills discovering passions And with or without such places many people will need to embrace the resourcefulness learned over time by cities like Youngstown which even if they seem like museum exhibits of an old economy might foretell the future for many more cities in the next 25 years On my last day in Youngstown I met with Howard Jesko a 60 year old Youngstown State graduate student at a burger joint along the main street A few months after Black Friday in 1977 as a senior at Ohio State University Jesko received a phone call from his father a specialty hose manufacturer near Youngstown Don t bother coming back here for a job his dad said There aren t going to be any left Years later Jesko returned to Youngstown to work but he recently quit his job selling products like waterproofing systems to construction companies his customers had been devastated by the Great Recession and weren t buying much anymore Around the same time a left knee replacement due to degenerative arthritis resulted in a 10 day hospital stay which gave him time to think about the future Jesko decided to go back to school to become a professor My true calling he told me has always been to teach One theory of work holds that people tend to see themselves in jobs careers or callings Individuals who say their work is just a job emphasize that they are working for money rather than aligning themselves with any higher purpose Those with pure careerist ambitions are focused not only on income but also on the status that comes with promotions and the growing renown of their peers But one pursues a calling not only for pay or status but also for the intrinsic fulfillment of the work itself When I think about the role that work plays in people s self esteem particularly in America the prospect of a no work future seems hopeless There is no universal basic income that can prevent the civic ruin of a country built on a handful of workers permanently subsidizing the idleness of tens of millions of people But a future of less work still holds a glint of hope because the necessity of salaried jobs now prevents so many from seeking immersive activities that they enjoy After my conversation with Jesko I walked back to my car to drive out of Youngstown I thought about Jesko s life as it might have been had Youngstown s steel mills never given way to a steel museum had the city continued to provide stable predictable careers to its residents If Jesko had taken a job in the steel industry he might be preparing for retirement today Instead that industry collapsed and then years later another recession struck The outcome of this cumulative grief is that Howard Jesko is not retiring at 60 He s getting his master s degree to become a teacher It took the loss of so many jobs to force him to pursue the work he always wanted to do A new short documentary seeks to understand the viewpoints of those who support and

online died on Saturday from massive brain swelling after being hospitalized for an infection according to her family She was 37 Evans leaves behind two little kids a husband and four books to her name Her death has been met with an up swelling of grief and appreciation from loyal readers famous pastors who sparred with her and especially young people who saw her as a mentor This bevy of tributes is a testament to the distinctive role Evans developed over her decade and a half long writing career She was part of a vanguard of progressive Christian women who fought to change the way Christianity is taught and perceived in the United States Especially for people who have felt hurt by or unwelcome in the Church Evans provided a safe shore full of encouragement and defiant acceptance Many of those who befriended her and followed her work have in turn become well known figures in the progressive Christian world such as Reverend Jes Kast and Austin Channing Brown Evans helped forge new space for diverse voices who are denied authority or power in the Christian world a legacy that will last far beyond her death As the Hungarian prime minister systematically

were splayed out in front of us Credentialed authorities are comically bad at predicting the future But reliable forecasting is possible The bet was on and it was over the fate of humanity On one side was the Stanford biologist Paul R Ehrlich In his 1968 best seller The Population Bomb Ehrlich insisted that it was too late to prevent a doomsday apocalypse resulting from overpopulation Resource shortages would cause hundreds of millions of starvation deaths within a decade It was cold hard math The human population was growing exponentially the food supply was not Ehrlich was an accomplished butterfly specialist He knew that nature did not regulate animal populations delicately Populations exploded blowing past the available resources and then crashed In his book Ehrlich played out hypothetical scenarios that represented the kinds of disasters that will occur In the worst case scenario famine rages across the planet Russia China and the United States are dragged into nuclear war and the resulting environmental degradation soon extinguishes the human race In the cheerful scenario population controls begin Famine spreads and countries teeter but the major death wave ends in the mid 1980s Only half a billion or so people die of starvation I challenge you to create one more optimistic Ehrlich wrote adding that he would not count scenarios involving benevolent aliens bearing

waging war in Yemen after vetoing a congressional call to end the U S military s participation in that country s civil war He has kept U S forces in Afghanistan Iraq and Syria And high ranking officials in his administration are asserting their willingness to wage new wars of choice without the approval of Congress showing disregard for the Constitution and the public s anti war sentiments Commentary on New York s elite high schools has focused wrongly on access over preparation Is there something racist in the way the chattering classes discuss the low number of black students admitted to New York City s most selective public high schools The figures are depressing indeed This year only seven out of 895 admits to Stuyvesant were black as opposed to 587 Asian and 194 white kids Only 12 out of the 803 students admitted to the Bronx High School of Science were black and only 95 out of 1 825 admitted to Brooklyn Tech This is all in a city in which 26 percent of public school students are black Since 1971 admission to the eight most selective public schools in the city has been based solely on performance on a single test the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test or SHSAT The na ve observer of the current circumstances say a foreigner new to the country or an inquisitive 10 year old might suppose that the main question would be how New York its parents and teachers can help black students to do better on that test Media coverage depicted the president as a brilliant deal maker but he claimed more than a billion dollars in losses over the course of a

our lives for centuries and it does so today more than ever But a new generation of thinkers insists there is an alternative By Andy BeckettFri 19 Jan 2018 00 45 EST Last modified on Mon 22 Jan 2018 12 58 ESTWork is the master of the modern world For most people it is impossible to imagine society without it It dominates and pervades everyday life especially in Britain and the US more completely than at any time in recent history An obsession with employability runs through education Even severely disabled welfare claimants are required to be work seekers Corporate superstars show off their epic work schedules Hard working families are idealised by politicians Friends pitch each other business ideas Tech companies persuade their employees that round the clock work is play Gig economy companies claim that round the clock work is freedom Workers commute further strike less retire later Digital technology lets work invade leisure In all these mutually reinforcing ways work increasingly forms our routines and psyches and squeezes out other influences As Joanna Biggs put it in her quietly disturbing 2015 book All Day Long A Portrait of Britain at Work Work is how we give our lives meaning when religion party politics and community fall away And yet work is not working for ever more people in ever more ways We resist acknowledging these as more than isolated problems such is work s centrality to our belief systems but the evidence of its failures is all around us As a source of subsistence let alone prosperity work is now insufficient for whole social classes In the UK almost two thirds of those in poverty around 8 million people are in working households In the US the average wage has stagnated for half a century As a source of social mobility and self worth work increasingly fails even the most educated people supposedly the system s winners In 2017 half of recent UK graduates were officially classified as working in a non graduate role In the US belief in work is crumbling among people in their 20s and 30s says Benjamin Hunnicutt a leading historian of work They are not looking to their job for satisfaction or social advancement You can sense this every time a graduate with a faraway look makes you a latte Work is increasingly precarious more zero hours or short term contracts more self employed people with erratic incomes more corporate restructurings for those still with actual jobs As a source of sustainable consumer booms and mass home ownership for much of the 20th century the main successes of mainstream western economic policy work is discredited daily by our ongoing debt and housing crises For many people not just the very wealthy work has become less important financially than inheriting money or owning a home Whether you look at a screen all day or sell other underpaid people goods they can t afford more and more work feels pointless or even socially damaging what the American anthropologist David Graeber called bullshit jobs in a famous 2013 article Among others Graeber condemned private equity CEOs lobbyists PR researchers telemarketers bailiffs and the ancillary industries dog washers all night pizza delivery that only exist because everyone is spending so much of their time working The argument seemed subjective and crude but economic data increasingly supports it The growth of productivity or the value of what is produced per hour worked is slowing across the rich world despite the constant measurement of employee performance and intensification of work routines that makes more and more jobs barely tolerable Unsurprisingly work is increasingly regarded as bad for your health Stress an overwhelming to do list and long hours sitting at a desk the Cass Business School professor Peter Fleming notes in his new book The Death of Homo Economicus are beginning to be seen by medical authorities as akin to smoking Work is badly distributed People have too much or too little or both in the same month And away from our unpredictable all consuming workplaces vital human activities are increasingly neglected Workers lack the time or energy to raise children attentively or to look after elderly relations The crisis of work is also a crisis of home declared the social theorists Helen Hester and Nick Srnicek in a paper last year This neglect will only get worse as the population grows and ages And finally beyond all these dysfunctions loom the most discussed most existential threats to work as we know it automation and the state of the environment Some recent estimates suggest that between a third and a half of all jobs could be taken over by artificial intelligence in the next two decades Other forecasters doubt whether work can be sustained in its current toxic form on a warming planet Like an empire that has expanded too far work may be both more powerful and more vulnerable than ever before We know work s multiplying problems intimately but it feels impossible to solve them all Is it time to start thinking of an alternative Our culture of work strains to cover its flaws by claiming to be unavoidable and natural Mankind is hardwired to work as the Conservative MP Nick Boles puts it in a new book Square Deal It is an argument most of us have long internalised But not quite all The idea of a world freed from work wholly or in part has been intermittently expressed and mocked and suppressed for as long as modern capitalism has existed Repeatedly the promise of less work has been prominent in visions of the future In 1845 Karl Marx wrote that in a communist society workers would be freed from the monotony of a single draining job to hunt in the morning fish in the afternoon rear cattle in the evening criticise after dinner In 1884 the socialist William Morris proposed that in beautiful factories of the future surrounded by gardens for relaxation employees should work only four hours a day In 1930 the economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that by the early 21st century advances in technology would lead to an age of leisure and abundance in which people might work 15 hours a week In 1980 as robots began to depopulate factories the French social and economic theorist Andr Gorz declared The abolition of work is a process already underway The manner in which it is to be managed constitutes the central political issue of the coming decades Since the early 2010s as the crisis of work has become increasingly unavoidable in the US and the UK these heretical ideas have been rediscovered and developed further Brief polemics such as Graeber s bullshit jobs have been followed by more nuanced books creating a rapidly growing literature that critiques work as an ideology sometimes labelling it workism and explores what could take its place A new anti work movement has taken shape Graeber Hester Srnicek Hunnicutt Fleming and others are members of a loose transatlantic network of thinkers who advocate a profoundly different future for western economies and societies and also for poorer countries where the crises of work and the threat to it from robots and climate change are they argue even greater They call this future post work For some of these writers this future must include a universal basic income UBI currently post work s most high profile and controversial idea paid by the state to every working age person so that they can survive when the great automation comes For others the debate about the affordability and morality of a UBI is a distraction from even bigger issues Post work may be a rather grey and academic sounding phrase but it offers enormous alluring promises that life with much less work or no work at all would be calmer more equal more communal more pleasurable more thoughtful more politically engaged more fulfilled in short that much of human experience would be transformed To many people this will probably sound outlandish foolishly optimistic and quite possibly immoral But the post workists insist they are the realists now Either automation or the environment or both will force the way society thinks about work to change says David Frayne a radical young Welsh academic whose 2015 book The Refusal of Work is one of the most persuasive post work volumes So are we the utopians Or are the utopians the people who think work is going to carry on as it is One of post work s best arguments is that contrary to conventional wisdom the work ideology is neither natural nor very old Work as we know it is a recent construct says Hunnicutt Like most historians he identifies the main building blocks of our work culture as 16th century Protestantism which saw effortful labour as leading to a good afterlife 19th century industrial capitalism which required disciplined workers and driven entrepreneurs and the 20th century desires for consumer goods and self fulfillment The emergence of the modern work ethic from this chain of phenomena was an accident of history Hunnicutt says Before then All cultures thought of work as a means to an end not an end in itself From urban ancient Greece to agrarian societies work was either something to be outsourced to others often slaves or something to be done as quickly as possible so that the rest of life could happen Even once the new work ethic was established working patterns continued to shift and be challenged Between 1800 and 1900 the average working week in the west shrank from about 80 hours to about 60 hours From 1900 to the 1970s it shrank steadily further to roughly 40 hours in the US and the UK Trade union pressure technological change enlightened employers and government legislation all progressively eroded the dominance of work Sometimes economic shocks accelerated the process In Britain in 1974 Edward Heath s Conservative government faced with a chronic energy shortage caused by an international oil crisis and a miners strike imposed a national three day working week For the two months it lasted people s non work lives expanded Golf courses were busier and fishing tackle shops reported large sales increases Audiences trebled for late night BBC radio DJs such as John Peel Some men did more housework the Colchester Evening Gazette interviewed a young married printer who had taken over the hoovering Even the Daily Mail loosened up with one columnist suggesting that parents experiment more in their sex lives while the children are doing a five day week at school The economic consequences were mixed Most people s earnings fell Working days became longer Yet a national survey of companies for the government by the management consultants Inbucon AIC found that productivity improved by about 5 a huge increase by Britain s usual sluggish standards Thinking was stimulated inside Whitehall and some companies the consultants noted on the possibility of arranging a permanent four day week Nothing came of it But during the 60s and 70s ideas about redefining work or escaping it altogether were commonplace in Europe and the US from corporate retreats to the counterculture to academia where a new discipline was established leisure studies the study of recreations such as sport and travel In 1979 Bernard Lefkowitz then a well known American journalist published Breaktime Living Without Work in a Nine to Five World a book based on interviews with 100 people who had given up their jobs He found a former architect who tinkered with houseboats and bartered an ex reporter who canned his own tomatoes and listened to a lot of opera and a former cleaner who enjoyed lie ins and a sundeck overlooking the Pacific Many of the interviewees were living in California and despite moments of drift and doubt they reported new feelings of wholeness and openness to experience By the end of the 70s it was possible to believe that the relatively recent supremacy of work might be coming to an end in the more comfortable parts of the west Labour saving computer technologies were becoming widely available for the first time Frequent strikes provided highly public examples of work routines being interrupted and challenged And crucially wages were high enough for most people to make working less a practical possibility Instead the work ideology was reimposed During the 80s the aggressively pro business governments of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan strengthened the power of employers and used welfare cuts and moralistic rhetoric to create a much harsher environment for people without jobs David Graeber who is an anarchist as well as an anthropologist argues that these policies were motivated by a desire for social control After the political turbulence of the 60s and 70s he says Conservatives freaked out at the prospect of everyone becoming hippies and abandoning work They thought What will become of the social order It sounds like a conspiracy theory but Hunnicutt who has studied the ebb and flow of work in the west for almost 50 years says Graeber has a point I do think there is a fear of freedom a fear among the powerful that people might find something better to do than create profits for capitalism During the 90s and 00s the counter revolution in favour of work was consolidated by centre left politicians In Britain under Tony Blair s government the political and cultural status of work reached a zenith Unemployment was lower than it had been for decades More women than ever were working Wages for most people were rising New Labour s minimum wage and working tax credits lifted and subsidised the earnings of the low paid Poverty fell steadily The chancellor Gordon Brown one of the country s most famous workaholics appeared to have found a formula that linked work to social justice A large part of the left has always organised itself around work Union activists have fought to preserve it by opposing redundancies and sometimes to extend it by securing overtime agreements With the Labour party the clue is in the name says Chuka Umunna the centre left Labour MP and former shadow business secretary who has become a prominent critic of post work thinking as it has spread beyond academia The New Labour governments were also responding Umunna says to the failure of their Conservative predecessors to actually live up to their pro work rhetoric There had been such high levels of unemployment under the Tories our focus was always going to be pro job In this earnest purposeful context the anti work tradition when it was remembered at all could seem a bit decadent One of its few remaining British manifestations was the Idler magazine which was set up in 1993 and acquired a cult status beyond its modest circulation In its elegantly retro pages often rather posh men wrote about the pleasures of laziness while on the side busily producing books and newspaper articles and running a creative consultancy with corporate clients Idle Industries By the early 21st century the work culture seemed inescapable The work culture has many more critics now In the US sharp recent books such as Private Government How Employers Rule Our Lives and Why We Don t Talk About It by the philosopher Elizabeth Anderson and No More Work Why Full Employment Is a Bad Idea by the historian James Livingston have challenged the dictatorial powers and assumptions of modern employers and also the deeply embedded American notion that the solution to any problem is working harder In the UK even professionally optimistic business journals have begun to register the extent of work s crises In his 2016 book The Wealth of Humans Work and its Absence in the 21st Century the Economist columnist Ryan Avent predicted that automation would lead to a period of wrenching political change before a broadly acceptable social system emerges Post work ideas are also circulating in party politics Last April the Green party proposed that weekends be lengthened to three days In 2016 shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour was developing a proposal for a UBI in the UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told his party conference last September that automation can be the gateway for a new settlement between work and leisure a springboard for expanded creativity and culture It felt like a watershed moment says Will Stronge head of Autonomy a British thinktank set up last year to explore the crisis of work and find ways out of it We re in contact with Labour and we re going to meet the Greens soon Like most British post workists he is leftwing in his politics part of the new milieu of ambitious young activist intellectuals that has grown up around Corbyn s leadership We haven t talked to people on the right Stronge admits No one s got in contact with us Yet post work has the potential to appeal to conservatives Some post workists think work should not be abolished but redistributed so that every adult labours for roughly the same satisfying but not exhausting number of hours We could say to people on the right You think work is good for people So everyone should have this good thing says James Smith a post workist whose day job is lecturing in 18th century English literature at Royal Holloway University of London Working less also ought to be attractive to conservatives who value the family Outside the insular intense working cultures of Britain and the US the reduction of work has long been a mainstream notion In France in 2000 Lionel Jospin s leftwing coalition government introduced a maximum 35 hour week for all employees partly to reduce unemployment and promote gender equality under the slogan Work less live more The law was not absolute some overtime was permitted and has been weakened since but many employers have opted to keep a 35 hour week In Germany the largest trade union IG Metall which represents electrical and metal workers is campaigning for shift workers and people caring for children or other relatives to have the option of a 28 hour week Even in Britain and the US the vogues for downshifting and work life balance during the 90s and 00s represented an admission that the intensification of work was damaging our lives But these were solutions for individuals and often wealthy individuals the rock star Alex James attracted huge media attention for becoming a cheesemaker in the Cotswolds rather than society as a whole And these were solutions intended to bring minimal disruption to a free market economy that was still relatively popular and functional We are not in that world any more And yet the difficulty of shedding the burdens and satisfactions of work is obvious when you meet the post workists Explorers of a huge economic and social territory that has been neglected for decades like Keynes and other thinkers who challenged the rule of work they alternate between confidence and doubt I love my job Helen Hester a professor of media and communication at the University of West London told me There s no boundary between my time off and on I m always doing admin or marking or writing something I m working the equivalent of two jobs Later in our interview which took place in a cafe among other customers working on laptops a ubiquitous modern example of leisure s colonisation by work she said knowingly but wearily Post work is a lot of work Yet the post workists argue that it is precisely their work saturated lives and their experience of the increasing precarity of white collar employment that qualify them to demand a different world Like many post workists Stronge has been employed for years on poorly paid short term academic contracts I ve worked as a breakfast cook I ve been a Domino s delivery driver he told me I once worked in an Indian restaurant while I was teaching My students would come in to eat and see me cooking and say Hi is that you Will Unconsciously that s why Autonomy came about James Smith was the only post workist I met who had decided to do less work I have one weekday off and cram everything into the other days he said as we sat in his overstuffed office on the Royal Holloway campus outside London I spend it with our one and a half year old It s a very small post work gesture But it was a strange sensation at first almost like launching myself off the side of a swimming pool It felt alien almost impossible to do without the moral power of having a child to look after Defenders of the work culture such as business leaders and mainstream politicians habitually question whether pent up modern workers have the ability to enjoy or even survive the open vistas of time and freedom that post work thinkers envisage for them In 1989 two University of Chicago psychologists Judith LeFevre and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi conducted a famous experiment that seemed to support this view They recruited 78 people with manual clerical and managerial jobs at local companies and gave them electronic pagers For a week at frequent but random intervals at work and at home these employees were contacted and asked to fill in questionnaires about what they were doing and how they were feeling The experiment found that people reported many more positive feelings at work than in leisure At work they were regularly in a state the psychologists called flow enjoying the moment by using their knowledge and abilities to the full while also learning new skills and increasing self esteem Away from work flow rarely occurred The employees mainly chose to watch TV try to sleep and in general vegetate even though they did not enjoy doing these things US workers the psychologists concluded had an inability to organise their psychic energy in unstructured free time To the post workists such findings are simply a sign of how unhealthy the work culture has become Our ability to do anything else only exercised in short bursts is like a muscle that has atrophied Leisure is a capacity Frayne says Graeber argues that in a less labour intensive society our capacity for things other than work could be built up again People will come up with stuff to do if you give them enough time I lived in a village in Madagascar once There was this intricate sociability People would hang around in cafes gossiping having affairs using magic It was a very complex drama the kind that can only develop when you have enough time They certainly weren t bored In western countries too he argues the absence of work would produce a richer culture The postwar years when people worked less and it was easier to be on the dole produced beat poetry avant garde theatre 50 minute drum solos and all Britain s great pop music art forms that take time to produce and consume The return of the drum solo may not be everyone s idea of progress But the possibilities of post work like all visions of the future walk a difficult line between being too concrete and too airy Stronge suggests a daily routine for post work citizens that would include a provocative degree of state involvement You get your UBI payment from the government Then you get a form from your local council telling you about things going on in your area a five a side football tournament say or community activism Big Society stuff almost Other scenarios he proposes may disappoint those who dream of non stop leisure I m under no illusion that paid work is going to disappear entirely It just may not be directed by someone else You take as long as you want have a long lunch spread the work though the day Town and city centres today are arranged for work and consumption work s co conspirator and very little else this is one of the reasons a post work world is so hard to imagine Adapting office blocks and other workplaces for other purposes would be a huge task which the post workists have only just begun to think about One common proposal is for a new type of public building usually envisaged as a well equipped combination of library leisure centre and artists studios It could have social and care spaces equipment for programming for making videos and music record decks says Stronge It would be way beyond a community centre which can be quite depressing This vision of state supported but liberated and productive citizens owes a lot to Ivan Illich the half forgotten Austrian social critic who was a leftwing guru during the 70s In his intoxicating 1973 book Tools for Conviviality Illich attacked the serfdom created by industrial machinery and demanded Give people tools that guarantee their right to work with high independent efficiency from power drills to mechanised pushcarts Illich wanted the public to rediscover what he saw as the freedom of the medieval artisan while also embracing the latest technology There is a strong artisan tendency in today s post work movement As Hester characterises it Instead of having jobs we re going to do craft to make our own clothes It s quite an exclusionary vision to do those things you need to be able bodied She also detects a deeper conservative impulse It s almost as if some people are saying Since we re going to challenge work other things have to stay the same Instead she would like the movement to think more radically about the nuclear home and family Both have been so shaped by work she argues that a post work society will redraw them The disappearance of the paid job could finally bring about one of the oldest goals of feminism that housework and raising children are no longer accorded a lower status With people having more time and probably less money private life could also become more communal she suggests with families sharing kitchens domestic appliances and larger facilities There have been examples of this before she says like Red Vienna in the early 20th century when the social democratic city government built housing estates with communal laundries workshops and shared living spaces that were quite luxurious Post work is about the future but it is also bursting with the past s lost possibilities Now that work is so ubiquitous and dominant will today s post workists succeed where all their other predecessors did not In Britain possibly the sharpest outside judge of the movement is Frederick Harry Pitts a lecturer in management at Bristol University Pitts used to be a post workist himself He is young and leftwing and before academia he worked in call centres he knows how awful a lot of modern work is Yet Pitts is suspicious of how closely the life post workists envisage creative collaborative high minded resembles the life they already live There is little wonder the uptake for post work thinking has been so strong among journalists and academics as well as artists and creatives he wrote in a paper co authored last year with Ana Dinerstein of Bath University since for these groups the alternatives to traditional work require little adaptation Pitts also argues that post work s optimistic visions can be a way of avoiding questions about power in the world A post work society is meant to resolve conflicts between different economic interest groups that s part of its appeal he told me Tired of the never ending task of making work better some socialists have latched on to post work he argues in the hope that exploitation can finally be ended by getting rid of work altogether He says this is both defeatist and naive Struggles between economic interest groups can t ever be entirely resolved Yet Pitts is much more positive about post work s less absolutist proposals such as redistributing working hours more equally There has to be a major change to work he says In that sense these people want the right thing Other critics of post work are also less dismissive than they first sound Despite being a Tory MP from the most pro business wing of his party Nick Boles accepts in his book that a future society may redefine work to include child rearing and taking care of elderly relatives and finally start valuing these contributions properly Post work is spreading feminist ideas to new places Hunnicutt the historian of work sees the US as more resistant than other countries to post work ideas at least for now When he wrote an article for the website Politico in 2014 arguing for shorter working hours he was shocked by the reaction it provoked It was a harsh experience he says There were personal attacks by email and telephone that I was some sort of communist and devil worshipper Yet he senses weakness behind such strenuous efforts to shut the work conversation down The role of work has changed profoundly before It s going to change again It s probably already in the process of changing The millennial generation know that the Prince Charming job that will meet all your needs has gone After meeting Pitts in Bristol I went to a post work event there organised by Autonomy It was a bitter Monday evening but liberal Bristol likes social experiments and the large city centre room was almost full There were students professionals in their 30s even a middle aged farmer They listened attentively for two hours while Frayne and two other panellists listed the oppressions of work and then hazily outlined what could replace it When the audience finally asked questions they all accepted the post workists basic premises An appetite for a society that treats work differently certainly exists But it is not so far overwhelming the evening s total attendance was less than 70 And yet as Frayne points out in some ways we re already in a post work society But it s a dystopic one Office employees constantly interrupting their long days with online distractions gig economy workers whose labour plays no part in their sense of identity and all the people in depressed post industrial places who have quietly given up trying to earn the spectre of post work runs through the hard shiny culture of modern work like hidden rust Last October research by Sheffield Hallam University revealed that UK unemployment is three times higher than the official count of those claiming the dole thanks to people who come under the broader definition of unemployment used by the Labour Force Survey or are receiving incapacity benefits When Frayne is not talking and writing about post work or doing his latest temporary academic job he sometimes makes a living collecting social data for the Welsh government in former mining towns There is lots of worklessness he says but with no social policies to dignify it Creating a more benign post work world will be more difficult now than it would have been in the 70s In today s lower wage economy suggesting people do less work for less pay is a hard sell As with free market capitalism in general the worse work gets the harder it is to imagine actually escaping it so enormous are the steps required But for those who think work will just carry on as it is there is a warning from history On 1 May 1979 one of the greatest champions of the modern work culture Margaret Thatcher made her final campaign speech before being elected prime minister She reflected on the nature of change in politics and society The heresies of one period she said always become the orthodoxies of the next The end of work as we know it will seem unthinkable until it has happened Main illustration Nathalie Lees Follow the Long Read on Twitter at gdnlongread or sign up to the long read weekly email

cusp of a world in which artificial intelligence robotics and other technologies will make a large portion of today s jobs obsolete They might be wrong of course but the consequences if they re right would be huge potentially a defining challenge of the decades ahead and one that would demand political attention Some of the potential answers are big bold ideas that have gained traction in particular ideological circles A universal basic income the idea that the government simply give each citizen enough money every month to support basic needs has fans among both free market libertarians and socialists But other ideas starting to percolate in economic policy circles may have advantages in terms of cost and political viability One interesting entry in this discussion is a paper published Tuesday by the Roosevelt Institute a liberal think tank called Don t Fear the Robots The economist Mark Paul writes that a series of policy steps that are in isolation not all that radical would go a long way toward ensuring that the benefits of technological advancement would be widely enjoyed As an example he says the Federal Reserve and other policymakers should commit more energetically to pursuing a maximum employment goal set in federal law even if it means being willing to tolerate a bit more risk of inflation Mr Paul argues for overhauling intellectual property law so that the companies that develop valuable patents and trademarks don t have such a lengthy monopoly on their innovations Over time this would probably mean that more of the benefits of technology would accrue to labor rather than capital And he sees promise in work sharing programs like those that have been used to help keep unemployment low in Germany even during economic downturns The idea is that if a company needs to cut 20 percent of its work force because of new innovations it is better for society if it cuts each worker s hours by 20 percent rather than laying off 20 percent of its staff Mr Paul argues that rapid shifts in the skills and technologies demanded by the modern economy strengthen the case for publicly funded higher education and training to help workers adapt This set of proposals is based on the idea that the emerging wave of digital disruption won t result in a permanent loss of demand for workers but rather shifts in what types of work the economy needs It s not unlike early 20th century America s shift from an agricultural economy to an industrial one or its shift from an industrial to an information economy over the last half century In this context the goal is not to stymie that evolution but to try to tilt the balance toward workers as the transition takes place We want a growing robust economy Mr Paul said We just need proper policies in place to ensure that workers don t bear the burden of that transition While these ideas are coming from a decidedly left of center place it s striking how some of them overlap with the goals of centrist business interests and even some conservative thinkers The McKinsey Global Institute the research arm of the consulting giant that has produced extensive analysis suggesting that advances in information technology and robotics will endanger millions of jobs in the coming decade often emphasizes the role of subsidized education and training Susan Lund a partner in the firm says it is increasingly crucial that people continually upgrade their skills to keep up with changing technology whether through community colleges traditional universities or narrowly targeted online training Lifelong learning accounts would be interesting Ms Lund said and they could be federally funded or they could be funded by employers but what you want is for people to be able to avail themselves of a two month leave to take courses so that they can keep up with change Ms Lund and her McKinsey colleagues also recommend new approaches to making job benefits like health insurance and retirement funds more portable so that people who work as independent contractors or who change jobs frequently can have more stability To the degree that many of these ideas imply a more activist government role conservatives tend to be more leery But Michael Strain a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute says the risks of disruption are high enough that some flexibility may be needed In particular we could be headed toward a bifurcated labor market where people with advanced skills earn higher wages but where workers without those skills see technology drive down demand for their services depressing their pay I tend to think that conservatives should be open to new policies for a new economic reality Mr Strain said So if we end up in a world where the market wages for large groups of workers really are well below the wages they would be willing to work for one way to combat that if you re serious about the importance of work would be significantly larger earnings subsidies than conservatives have been comfortable with By expanding the earned income tax credit or creating similar programs for example the government could increase the effective pay of jobs that otherwise would pay so little that Americans might choose to sit at home rather than take them Mr Strain says liberals have blind spots on these issues as well Raising the minimum wage as many on the left have advocated could well be counterproductive if technology causes market wages to fall for certain workers for example The unemployment rate is currently at its lowest level in 18 years and the bigger challenge for the economy now is that productivity is too low not that technology is causing productivity to be so high as to drive people out of jobs So this discussion over potential policy responses to a future that may or may not arrive remains speculative all the more so in an era of congressional dysfunction But there s a recent lesson worth learning from Globalization and automation caused upheaval in the manufacturing industry from the 1980s through the early 2000s and millions of factory workers lost their jobs The disruption to communities is still being felt and is arguably at the root of a lot of the biggest social and economic problems of this era If a similar technological wave is about to wash over millions of service workers we would all do well to try to keep

reshape society By RYAN AVENTJanuary February 2018Ryan Avent is senior editor and columnist at the Economist and author of The Wealth of Humans Work Power and Status in the Twenty first Century For those of us who have lived in relatively placid times it is hard to believe that American politics could become more chaotic than it is today But far beyond allegations of criminal acts in the executive branch the unending reality show trash talk of the president on his Twitter feed or even nuclear brinkmanship something else will push us into a new and uncertain era of politics likely far stranger and possibly more dangerous than anything in memory The force is technology It s easy to think we re living through a disruptive period now but we re only scratching the surface of what true technological change can do to a society The industrialization of the 19th century reoriented human life on a vast scale shifting production radically from villages and farms toward huge centralized factories powered by coal and steam And politics had to adapt just as radically as humans figured out how to make industrial societies work Institutions shaped around village life strained and broke under the pressures of the millions of people who moved to work in the new factories Story Continued BelowThe result was decades of what would now feel like chaos in the world s most developed nations Getting politicians attention took strikes riots and threats of revolution Comfortable elites were reluctant to give any ground Some disenchanted people fell under the sway of bold new ideologies like communism Nationalists and fascists pitched themselves as the saviors of society from destitution or corruption or the communists From the world wars to the horrors of collectivization in China and the Soviet Union tens of millions of people died as governments worked to manage an alien world built on technologies unlike anything humans had previously seen It was not until decades after World War II that industrial societies figured out how to function well to generate rapid economic growth and rising living standards for rich and poor alike By comparison technological change over the past half century has been almost trivial Cars have gotten better and televisions flatter but computers and the internet haven t yet changed the world into something an American from the 1960s would not recognize Now however a new pivot may be coming Within just a few years driverless cars will be plying the streets in great numbers multilingual artificial intelligence programs will take over many customer service roles and algorithms chewing over the massive amounts of data we emit will manage everything from our day to day health to the contents of our refrigerators Robots are becoming more dexterous and less likely to trip over themselves and gene editing may trigger a transformation that starts with the treatment of disease and could easily end up with the transformation of humans themselves At the moment it is easy and comforting to imagine that the machines will mostly be complementary to human workers whose common sense and human touch will still be necessary But over the next half century AI will get better faster than humans can learn new skills While we are probably still a very long way away from an AI with humanlike general intelligence we are much closer to a world where particular machines can perform specific tasks as well as humans and at far less cost precisely the kind of change that reshaped nations 150 years ago Long before we find ourselves dealing with malevolent AIs or genetically engineered superhumans and perhaps just 10 to 20 years from now we will have to deal with the threat technology poses to our social order and to our politics Long before we find ourselves dealing with malevolent AIs we will have to deal with the threat technology poses to our social order and to our politics Right now it s hard to know just how deep the change will cut One analysis published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development concludes that roughly 10 percent of jobs in advanced economies face automation but widely cited work by scholars at Oxford University puts the share of jobs at risk in America far higher at nearly 50 percent Even at the low end that means that millions or tens of millions of jobs will be lost and as many displaced workers will be forced to seek new work Even tech leaders are warning of the threat in increasingly somber tones Elon Musk is among the Silicon Valley bigwigs to declare support for a universal basic income for example and Bill Gates has proposed taxing robots to help fund programs for displaced workers As new technologies transform the economy wages fall and displaced workers compete with those already employed for available jobs We can see this effect around us now Conventional economics suggests that low unemployment drives wages up But that s not happening this time Despite very low unemployment of just 4 1 percent average earnings are growing at an unusually slow pace Low pay might discourage companies from automating away as many jobs as technology might allow for a time But it also would lead a lot of people to give up the job search And technology would allow a small percentage of uniquely skilled people and well positioned firms to do phenomenally well pushing inequality to unprecedented levels The Friday CoverBy NANCY SCOLAThis world in which technology is improving rapidly and great wealth is being created but a large share of working age adults are not strictly necessary to keep the economy humming at full tilt is one in which unprecedented prosperity should be possible Automation of critical tasks in medicine for example should dramatically reduce the cost of health care while improving accessibility and the quality of treatment at the expense however of vast numbers of jobs Realizing this potential prosperity then means moving to an economy in which work plays a much different role from the one it plays now Politicians instincts will be to focus on bringing back lost work rather than allowing people to do less much like recent populists including President Donald Trump have promised But adapting to a world of powerful AI means enabling far fewer people to work full time and revising full time to something much less than 40 hours per week To do that governments will need to provide more benefits directly and the overall level of redistribution might need to rise considerably Meanwhile we will be faced with a social crisis as people search for purpose and for ways to spend their time and as countries fight over which people should bear the cost burden of providing for which others That s the optimistic version Imagine the social political and legislative changes needed to make such a world a reality Then reflect on how governments have operated over the past decade or so particularly the U S government and it quickly becomes clear what kind of battles we are in for It s hard to build majorities in favor of radical reforms so in the short run the machinery of government will keep failing to address the problem adequately People will grow more frustrated That frustration will all but surely fuel populist and radical movements which will feed off each other and jointly erode the norms and institutions that hold society together a process that we can already see underway in the United States and elsewhere But over time as pressure builds our politics will face much graver challenges We will be back in the early 20th century struggling to understand what needs to change and how to make those changes without grave errors What might we be in for History suggests there are four directions in which society might turn Automation is transforming American society and politics in unprecedented ways no question But humans actually have a long history of fearing the rise of the machines and visualizing that anxiety Here POLITICO s resident Pulitzer Prize winning cartoonist and illustrator Matt Wuerker compiled a selection of magazine covers and political cartoons capturing that theme going back to the 1800s Clockwise from top Winsor McCay San Francisco Examiner 1933 William Heath The March of Intellect series 1829 Science and Invention 1924 Ron Cobb Los Angeles Free Press 1969 Oliver Patent political cartoon 1882 Credits Library of Congress Flickr Ron Cobb Alamy Trustees of the British museumThe best case scenario is one in which American society experiences a great awakening leading to a flowering of social movements that provide the political support for significant reforms This is not an impossibility During the Industrial Revolution social reformers pushed governments to end child labor and provide more support to the poor to build systems of public education and to address mass social ills as in the temperance movement which led the charge for Prohibition not all radical reform efforts worked out as hoped Social pressure was crucial to expanding the franchise it drove the civil rights movement Society can prove surprisingly malleable even over short time horizons as dramatic recent changes in norms regarding gay rights drug decriminalization and sexual harassment indicate Politicians love invoking jobs on the campaign trail Could that change in a future where Americans work less 1968 Richard Nixon In the next four years we must help create 15 million new jobs And I mean jobs with futures jobs that give a man s work meaning not government make work jobs 1976 Gerald Ford One test of a healthy economy is a job for every American who wants to work 1980 Ronald Reagan We cannot support our families unless there are jobs and we cannot have jobs unless people have both money to invest and the faith to invest it 1988 Michael Dukakis It s not about overthrowing governments in Central America it s about creating jobs in middle America 1992 Bill Clinton This country desperately needs a jobs program And my first priority would be to pass a jobs program to introduce it on the first day I was inaugurated 2008 Barack Obama You go into these small towns in Pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the Midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing s replaced them And it s not surprising then they get bitter 2012 Mitt Romney So if the president wants to talk about jobs and I hope he does we ll be comparing my record with his record And he comes up very very short 2016 Hillary Clinton First which candidate has a real plan to create good paying jobs 2016 Donald Trump I will be the greatest jobs president God has ever created Credit APSuch dramatic reforms are harder to come by when they involve large scale changes to welfare states but perhaps we will see new institutions through which those without work can contribute their time and labor to society That could include improved access to and funding for early childhood and adult education or perhaps more ambitiously the charge for a universal state provided basic income which would allow those who can only contribute through volunteer efforts to earn the purchasing power they need to enjoy a normal life In America in particular community action has long been the first line of defense against social hardship from the Granger movement promoting agricultural communities after the Civil War to the Volunteers of America looking after those battered by the Depression A new sense of community and social obligation might be just the thing to help shake government out of a dangerous complacency If not however a second more dire scenario might come to pass that of creeping authoritarianism This too was a feature of industrial history from government efforts to crush trade unions to the totalitarianism of some communist and fascist regimes A gridlocked America has already shown a worrying tendency to respond to crisis with strong law bending executive power in response to the threat of terrorism economic weakness and legislative dysfunction Intense partisan disagreement over how to respond to the economic challenges thrown up by the digital revolution might lead to permanent gridlock in America or to a constant succession of fragile coalitions in multiparty Europe If such governments are placed under pressure by economic crisis or threats real or imagined like hacking terrorism or revolutionary elements society at large will tolerate the application of greater ever more extra legal authority by the executive That s because while creeping authoritarianism would do nothing to solve the underlying economic troubles created by the digital era it could help manage them Powerful corporate and military forces could be coopted by an authoritarian regime and would thereby have an incentive not to resist the forces remaking society Dissenters could be oppressed Unfortunately new technologies often provide would be tyrants with new and powerful tools to keep society in line It is all too easy to imagine how large tech companies could be compelled by the carrot of state favor and the stick of aggressive antitrust action to help monitor dissidents punish enemies and reward friends Authoritarianism has enjoyed a revival of sorts in recent years as countries like Russia and Turkey have slipped back toward despotism Poland and Hungary have taken steps in this direction This is in many ways the path of least resistance in the face of unmanageable economic change If democracy cannot respond effectively and authoritarianism does not keep the peace then a third scenario becomes more probable state failure That might entail secession The more that resources are shared between rich places and poor ones the more that richer places like Catalonia which only recently voted for independence from Spain will find themselves drawn to breaking away It is difficult to imagine such a movement gaining momentum in America which has its own ugly experience with secession and civil war Yet even now large and economically powerful states like California are charting their own courses to the extent legally possible Were in some future the federal government to repeatedly resist or the Supreme Court to nullify measures deemed critical within California to meet the challenges of the new economy and if California were then to mount massive public resistance how much violence would Washington actually risk to keep citizens from going their own way If democracy cannot respond effectively and authoritarianism does not keep the peace then a third scenario becomes more probable state failure State failure might also end in revolution America has its own revolutionary history too and revolutions were a relatively common part of industrial history and still are outside of advanced economies Now and even in the depths of the last recession there was no appetite for such radicalism Neither did the crisis weaken most rich world governments enough to make them vulnerable to such political upheaval But imagine a world two decades hence in which inequality has grown significantly the government can scarcely manage to keep itself operating perhaps because of severe budget disagreements or a cyberattack young and healthy adults face a high rate of chronic unemployment and living standards seriously deteriorate in economically battered communities Perhaps under such circumstances a new ideological movement which had struggled to attract followers outside a committed core finds itself winning converts within the military while enjoying surprising electoral success not enough to break the gridlock but enough to claim a mandate to govern Such a movement might be idealistically utopian in nature promising to deliver the better technological future that existing institutions cannot But it might also be ruthlessly pragmatic in nature committed to keep society functioning by creating new rigid social hierarchies isolating military leaders and the high priests of technology from a repressed rabble There is a fourth possible future the deus ex machina the external shock that creates the conditions for radical but democratic change Across much of the industrialized world including the United States it took the brutal years of 1914 to 1945 the Depression and World War II in particular to foster broad acceptance of high tax rates to weaken the power of established elites and to build consensus in favor of a strong social safety net One of the most important and disturbing facts of modern economic history is that this bloody destructive period and its immediate aftermath represent the one time in which most advanced economies were able to reduce inequality significantly It may be that the social cohesion needed to build a truly inclusive economy which puts technology to work to the benefit of all is impossible to build in the absence of such dire threats Dept of the FutureBy DANNY VINIKThese scenarios might sound like fantasy because most of us have never experienced anything like them But most of us have never experienced the sort of dramatic economic change that turns existing ways of life on their head Soon we will If we could find a way to do a better job of meeting the needs of those hurt by economic change and seizing available opportunities to strengthen the economy like capitalizing on low interest rates to invest in infrastructure and training then the worst possible outcomes might be avoided But if we cannot if technological change means that governments fail to meet the needs of their citizens and if those citizens grow less content as a result pressure will build until a solution appears one way

to today s employment report Employers added 163 000 jobs last month the largest increase since February The unemployment rate remained essentially unchanged at 8 3 percent A notable aspect of the July employment report is the decline in public sector employment In fact public sector employment i e federal state and local government jobs declined in 10 of the past 12 months in sharp contrast to 29 consecutive months of private sector job growth Indeed falling public employment has been among the largest contributors to unemployment in the United States since the end of the Great Recession In this month s employment analysis The Hamilton Project examines public sector employment trends over the last three decades and finds that government employment contracted both in absolute numbers and as a share of the population during the Great Recession and throughout the current recovery Additionally we report on the results of a new analysis that finds that the cuts in public school teachers are projected to reduce the future earnings of today s students by more than five times as much as the current budget savings We also continue to explore the nation s jobs gap or the number of jobs that the U S economy needs to create in order to return to pre recession employment levels Declining Government EmploymentRelated Books Demystifying Rising Inequality in Asia Edited by Bihong Huang

necessary to turn to the Current Population Survey the below table uses the data to assess the occupations where some of the key reductions in the public sector workforce occurred In raw numbers the

128 6 831 28 5 A look at the last four decades indicates that we are in unchartered territory with regard to government employment From 1980 to 2012 9 6 percent of adults were employed by the public sector with a slightly higher fraction 9 7 percent employed by the government in the years 2001 2007 The below chart reveals that once the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ARRA began to phase down and state and local governments struggled to balance their budgets government employment dropped precipitously and now stands at 9 0 percent As the graph illustrates this is the lowest level of public sector employment in over 30 years The Short Run Consequences of Government LayoffsIn the short term reducing government employment particularly during recessions adds workers directly to the unemployment rolls In addition fewer workers translates into fewer paychecks which dampens consumption and further spreads through the economy magnifying the effects of the recession To examine the direct consequences of lower government employment consider the case in which employment had hewed to its historical level Between 2001 and 2007 the average ratio of government employment to population was 9 7 percent Had that share remained steady government employment would have been more than 23 6 million in June 2012 as compared to its actual level of 21 9 million That is employment would be 1 7 million jobs higher today if the share had remained constant and the unemployment rate would be 7 1 percent instead of the current rate of 8 2 percent see graph below The Long Run Impact of the Reduction in Public EmploymentOf course it is always critical for governments to assess whether taxpayers money is being well spent It also goes without saying that many public sector employees provide health care maintain state and local infrastructure provide protective services and help educate the next generation of workers One area where there is a sound body of literature to draw upon is the returns to education specifically the impact of class size on student achievement and lifetime earnings Drawing on this evidence we quantify the impact of reductions in the number of public school teachers on our country s future In 2011 there were over 220 000 fewer teachers in America s classrooms than in 2009 a reduction accounting for nearly forty percent of the decrease in public sector jobs during this period This decline in the number of teachers increased the student teacher ratio by 5 9 percent To determine the consequences of these reductions we assumed that class size increases were applied equally across all grades in K 12 schools We then drew from recent research that links future earnings with class size to assess the wage impacts for today s children when they become working age adults 1 All of this is explained in more detail here but the bottom line is that this research suggests that the Great Recession will live on for decades through the lower future wages for our children Of course an important test for the efficiency of government spending is whether the benefits exceed the costs The savings from these cuts in terms of teacher salaries and benefits are 11 8 billion per year nationwide While a significant figure it is substantially smaller than the estimated present value in foregone earnings of 49 3 billion dollars for the children whose education is affected by larger class sizes To put a fine point on these findings this translates into a per student per year loss of nearly 1 000 in future earnings In summary the foregone benefits are more than four times larger than the current budget savings The July Jobs GapAs of July our nation faces a jobs gap of 11 3 million jobs The chart below shows how the jobs gap has evolved since the start of the Great Recession in December 2007 and how long it will take to close under different assumptions of job growth The solid line shows the net number of jobs lost since the Great Recession began The broken lines track how long it will take to close the jobs gap under alternative assumptions about the rate of job creation going forward If the economy adds about 208 000 jobs per month which was the average monthly rate for the best year of job creation in the 2000s then it will take until June 2020 or eight years to close the jobs gap Given a more optimistic rate of 321 000 jobs per month which was the average monthly rate of the best year of job creation in the 1990s the economy will reach pre recession employment levels by September 2016 not for another four years ConclusionThe private sector continues to be an engine for growth as the United States recovers from the Great Recession However tight budgets force a number of difficult decisions on policymakers especially state and local ones who are forced to lay off workers in order to meet their bottom lines The result is that public sector employment has been in sharp decline This has worsened the current economic situation and the nation s unemployment rate These cuts at least in the case of public school teachers have also compromised our children s future in ways that fail the even the strictest cost benefit test As state and local governments continue to face challenging budgets a real risk is that they will be forced to make decisions that are both penny and pound foolish

Vol 24 Issue 1 February 2014 pgs 26 44AbstractThere is growing concern that emerging technologies such as computers robotics and artificial intelligence are displacing human jobs creating an epidemic of technological unemployment While this projection has yet to be confirmed if true it will have major economic and social repercussions for our future It is therefore appropriate to begin identifying policy options to address this potential problem This article offers an economic and social framework for addressing this problem and then provides an inventory of possible policy options organized into the following six categories a slowing innovation and change b sharing work c making new work d redistribution e education and f fostering a new social contract The Luddite fear and prediction that technology will displace many workers and lead to widespread unemployment may after many false alarms finally be coming true At the same time the utopian vision of humans being liberated from a life filled mostly with the drudgery of manual or mindless labor to enjoy a productive happier and more meaningful level of existence through art music literature and rich social relationships such as that suggested by behavioral psychologist B F Skinner 1948 in Walden Two may also be closer to realization Navigating the tension between these negative and positive perspectives on the growing displacement of human labor by technology requires a calculated and delicate effort to manage this critical period of transformation If handled poorly the widespread displacement of workers by technology could result in rapidly expanding economic divergence between rich and poor economic poverty and social unrest for growing numbers of dislocated workers backlashes against technology and social institutions and economic and social decline If properly managed the use of technology to replace mundane lackluster repetitive dangerous or strenuous labor could free us to live more enjoyable meaningful and leisurely lives Over the years technologyhas consistently been anet enhancer of employment Past innovations in industries such as the automobile agricultural chemical energy computer and telecommunications sectors have sparked rapid growth in quality gainful jobs In fact a 1968 paper that perhaps recognized for the first time the impact of the computer for communications by two leading computer scientists predicted that as a result of the growing role of computers u nemployment would disappear from the face of the earth forever Licklider and Taylor 1968 40 While the computer has indeed had an enormous impact on communications those early experts were overly optimistic about the long term impact on employment But there is no doubt that the general effect of technology on employment over the years has been positive As the National Academy of Sciences NAS concluded in a 1998 report h istorically technological change and productivity growth have been associated with expanding rather than contracting total employment and rising earnings National Academy of Sciences 1998 5 The same report had a positive prediction for the future of technology and employment The future will see little change in this pattern Rather than producing mass unemployment technological change will make its maximum contribution to higher living standards wages and employment levels if appropriate public and private policies are adopted to support the adjustment to new technologies National Academy of Sciences1998 3 5 emphasis added The if here is an important caveat and the objective of this paper is to address the appropriate public and private policies that should be pursued to guide the transition into an era where machines do more and more of the jobs that humans have traditionally undertaken Policy intervention appears necessary While the evidence is only suggestive and not conclusive to date the argument has been made that in this jobless recovery machines are now resulting in net job loss perhaps at an accelerating rate Rotman 2013 Deane 2013 Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2011 call this the great uncoupling where economic growth has become detached from employment growth for the first time in the modern era Other experts vociferously disagree with this prognosis contending it is just the latest of a long history of false alarms about the impact of technology on jobs going all the way back to Ned Ludd and his Luddite followers in the 19th century Miller and Atkinson 2013 Bessen 2013 Just as the major loss of agricultural jobs lead to increases in manufacturing jobs and the loss of manufacturing jobs led to increased jobs in digital industries technological optimists point to new industries and jobs that are already developing even as machines replace many existing jobs examples include app development and additive manufacturing Wadhwa 2012 While it may be too soon to definitely conclude whether technology replaces jobs we can see anecdotal evidence all around us in our daily lives as human beings are replaced by automated technology to perform the functions once done by gas station attendants bank tellers travel agents tax preparers farmers secretaries call service centers and grocery store cashiers Artificial intelligence is empowering robots and computers to replace more complex job functions such as assembly line worker surgeon barista and legal practitioner Markoff 2012 In the legal field for instance in order to predict the likely outcome of a case computer scientists and engineers are developing software programs that have the ability to execute some of the work done by attorneys thereby establishing a niche called quantitative legal prediction Lu 2012 The appeal to employers of replacing workers with machines is considerable given that machines require no wages or benefits take no sick days or vacations provide a consistent highly reliable quality of work for up to twenty four hours a day seven days a week if needed and incur no injuries They also require no workers compensation do not complain or disclose proprietary information and do not quit retire strike or take coffee breaks It is said that a robot can be operated 160 hours a week Even assuming competition from nimble fingered humans putting in 12 hour shifts a single robot might replace two workers and possibly as many as four Larson2012 This most recent quote is supported by Andrew McAfee when he emphasizes the massive increases in productivity brought on by digital technology Regalado 2012 Rapid advances expected in robotics and artificial intelligence will be the primary drivers of technology driven unemployment However other technologies will also contribute For example 3D printers nano manufacturing and autonomous vehicles will all displace thousands if not millions of workers Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee argue in their provocative book Race Against the Machine that Computers are now doing many things that used to be the domain of people only The pace and scale of this encroachment into human skills is relatively recent and has profound economic implications Perhaps the most important of these is that while digital progress grows the overall economic pie it can do so while leaving some people or even a lot of them worse off Brynjolfsson and McAfee2011 9 A recent study from the James Martin 21st Century School at Oxford University estimated that approximately 47 percent of U S employment was at high risk of being replaced by computerization over the next couple decades Frey and Osborne 2013 This concern is not new Back in in 1930 economist John Maynard Keynes 1930 predicted this problem in his essay entitled Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren where he posited that a new malady called technological unemployment is on the horizon toreplace and outrun human labor with more efficient fast paced innovations Like Skinner Keynes maintained that an age of leisure would be part of our future a future he foresaw as being replete with social and other repercussions If these projections of increasing job loss to technology are accurate and the predictions of widespread technological unemployment are finally coming true the consequences could be dire Accordingly the time is overdue to seriously consider what potential policy interventions are available to address this emerging problem Our objective in this article is to inventory and briefly evaluate the policy options that might be considered in an attempt to mitigate orhelp society adapt to the growing dislocation of jobs by technology We start with a more theoretical framing of the problem in Part II and then describe potential policies in Part III grouped into six categories of potential policy options If we assume for the purpose of this analysis that technology is indeed in the process of widespread displacement or elimination of human jobs there are two aspects of the consequent problem an economic and a social dimension from both an individual and collective perspective Deane 2013 First from the economic side growing prevalence and permanence of unemployment and underemployment presents the challenge of howaffected individualswill support their existence and that of their families As Martin Ford in The Lights in the Tunnel has warned Jobs are the primary mechanism through which income and hence purchasing power is distributed to the people who consume everything the economy produces If at some point machines are likely to permanently take over a great deal of the work now performed by human beings then that will be a threat to the very foundation of our economic system Ford 2009 5 The economic problems from unemployment do not just affect those who are unemployed and their families If a significant and growing proportion of the working age population is unable to find adequate work to sustain themselves with a reasonable lifestyle this problem would not only represent an individual tragedy for those persons but would also represent a major burden on the overall economy if the unemployed cannot actively participate as consumers of products and purchasers of services This second order effect limiting economic activity will have a spiraling negative effect on the economy leading to additional loss of jobs and generating further impedimentsto economic growth Over and above what machines are currently and ultimately able to provide there is much productive and useful work that can be done by human workers restoring infrastructure and inner cities cleaning up the environment taking better care of the sick and elderly orhelping people in developing countries among many other priorities The problem is finding an economic structure to compensate for or acknowledge such work Our current political economic system seems unwilling or unable to reward or remunerate people to undertake these worthy functions Second for most people a job ensures not only a livelihood but is also linked to identity self worth and focus Deane 2013 Even if we could find ways for people to pay for the basic necessities of life if jobs and careers disappear it may cause or contribute to major psychological and social stresses due to stigmatization or an inability to cope with the reality of long term unemployment including depression anxiety poor self esteem divorce substance abuse increased chronic diseases suicide and mortality Baker and Hassett 2012 American Psychological Association 2013 For the purpose of this essay we posit that people must do some kind of work Being productive is essential to human well being Vardi 2012 This is reiterated by Leon Kass in The Other War on Poverty where he states that Unemployment even if compensated is demoralizing degrading and dehumanizing We need to consider work as Dorothy Sayers put it as not primarily a thing one does to live but the thing one lives to do Kass2012 6 Widespread unemployment may also cause collective disruptions The strains presented by the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011 and the 99 vs 1 percent protest theme are but a minor and relatively mild early indicator of the type of social disruptions that are likely to occur if successful people continue to thrive and prosper while a growing percentage of the population is left behind in permanent poverty and despair An important aspect of the technology unemployment problem is determining whose jobs will be eliminated by technology A recurring theme among researchers economists political and social scientistssuch as Charles Murray Tyler Cowen Erik Brynjolfsson Andrew McAfee David Autor and Lawrence Katz see Rotman 2013 is that the middle skilled class based on nowadays requirements has all but disappeared and what is leftis a polarization between the highly skilled wealthy and the low skilled poor This hollowing out of the economy by removing middle class jobs and pushing workers into either low paying manual labor that cannot be done by machines e g restaurant and construction workers or higher end jobs involving higher skills and pay would tend to polarize the population into two disparate classes Autor and Dorn 2013 However more recent analyses suggest thatthe impact of technological unemployment might concentrate primarily on low income workers Frey and Osborne 2013 Under either economic model there will be a new urgency to improve the education and training of workers to be able to perform skilled high paying jobs which at least at this time are sometimes going unfilled When considering the near future and its economic and social repercussions we must also consider the generationsaffected by the inevitable displacement If mostly elderly workers are affected the economic dimension may be the most important Individuals who have worked for many years have already established their social status and have mostly performed their duty to society to be productive For those who wish to continue to work re education and re training will be critical For others who may be unable or uninterested in continuing to work the focus will be on how they can retire with dignity and a good quality of life This primarily depends on the establishment of economic safeguards derived from personal savings or from other sources of external support If on the other hand technology s destruction of jobs primarily affects young people the problem may now be both acutely economic and social The lack of any employment opportunity for young people who are likely to have recently completed the most updated educational training is likely to cause tremendous disenchantment and frustration which could lead to social disruption It is worthwhile noting that gender may also play a role with regard topredictions relating to unemployment or displacement In a paper prepared for the National Science Foundation David H Autor and Lawrence F Katz boldly state that technological advances breed winners and losers The authors explain that in the long run technological progress affects the composition of jobs not the number of jobs Autor and Katz 2010 1 According to Autor and Katz women in most industrialized countries have greatly exceeded men in the attainment of higher education and are thus better positioned to obtain higher paying occupations Not surprisingly the recurring theme derived from various lines of research is that the impacts of technological unemployment will not be spread evenly While machines will eliminate many jobs resulting in unemployment or displacement most of the people who will fall victim to this phenomenon will be the less educated whose current job functions are more susceptible to replacement by machines Perhaps the issue initially ishow tounequally but not unfairly sustain the lower and middle skilled class while incentivizing them tovoluntarily become more educated or contribute to society in other compensable and meaningful ways As the capabilities of artificial intelligence robotics and other technologies continue to advance more and more job functions will become automated leaving fewer and fewer jobs where humans are essential and thus raising broader longer term questions about what type of future society and lives we want The efficiency and wealth created by technologies even as they may reduce employment create a window of opportunity to enact policies that can use that wealth to help all citizens achieve enough material support to enjoy a good life with greater leisure and satisfaction Newman 2010 Policy interventions must address both shorter and longer term goals and ensure that short term actions are aligned with longer term objectives Policymakers in the U S and other industrialized nations have struggled for many decades to develop effective policies to address cyclical unemployment generally by trying to stimulate innovation and economic activity and hence boost job retention and creation Today s situation is different increased innovation and economic activity may not lead to more jobs It in fact could acceleratereplacement of human jobs by machines New and different policy interventions are therefore needed to address this new era of technological unemployment Perry 2013 Below we identify six potential categories of policy interventions and begin the task of populating those categories with specific proposals The six categories are a slowing innovation and change b sharing work c making new work d redistribution e education and f fostering a new social contract Not all six categories of interventions are likely to be equally desirable and effective and we do not shy away from offering our own preferences and recommendations We recognize though that views on the merits of different options may vary and thus try to identify as many policy options within each category as possible whether we personally think they are good bad or indifferent There may also be differences in effectiveness appeal and feasibility between policy options within a given category varying along dimensions such as the relative roles they give to governments versus individuals or whether they are static or dynamic None of the categories of policy approaches are mutually exclusive as optimal public policy is likely to involve mixtures of policies drawn from several or perhaps most or even all of the categories The optimal mix of categories is also likely to shift over time with some types of policies more effective and feasible in the short term while others more salient and necessary in the longer term Experimentation with different mixes of these policy options will also be valuable to better evaluate the individual options and their interactions These policy options seek to use legal interventions to protect jobs that might otherwise be lost due to technology innovation and development A 1 Place Limits on Technological Development If technology is the problem that is displacing many jobs then one solution might be to try to slow or block new technological developments This was the Luddite strategy and was most recently resurrected by Bill Joy s famous essay in 2000 on a policy of relinquishment for technologies such as genomics nanotechnology and robotics Joy2000 Such policies often encapsulated by stronger versions of the precautionary principle are doomed to fail for several reasons First restrictions on technology innovation would make a nation anticompetitive in the increasing global marketplace as other countries would step in to displace the laggards and achieve technological economic and military predominance Second emerging technologies are being developed and commercialized so rapidly in large part because of demand for and benefits of those technologies Therefore foregoing such technologies would likely be counter productive to overall social welfare Finally stopping progress has never been a successful or politically feasible strategy and runs counter tohuman nature and aspirations A 2 Mandating Human Workers Throughout history legislators regulators and trade unionists have attempted to protect jobs by prohibiting displacement of human jobs with technology Perhaps the iconic example of trying to preserve jobs by legal mandates is New Jersey s and Oregon s current law prohibiting consumers from pumping their own gasoline thus protecting the employment of gas station attendants to pump gasoline This anachronistic policy simply increases costs deprives consumers of convenience and artificially prolongs jobs that are low payingand of declining relevance Yglesias 2013 Trade unions have responded to automation with things like work preservation clauses or Bills of Rights which are intended to protect employees jobs when technology is integrated into the work environment This approach has the same objective as New Jersey s gas pumping law in that specific duties that could be performed by a machine are required to be executed by a human being Moon 2004 Although such clauses may have temporarily preserved some jobs they also promoted inefficiency and stalled innovation to the long term detriment of both the companies and workers in those sectors Japan is a good demonstration of this where companies facing changing markets and technologies are competitively harmed by outdated laws preventing them from laying off workers assigning such workers to chasing out rooms where the company tries to force the employee to voluntarily quit by creating boring job conditions Tabuchi 2013 These types of antiquated policies simply delay the inevitable by mandating inefficiency Dau Schmidt 2001 A 3 Regulatory Restraint Regulation has become a controversial political subject in the United States with respect to its impact on employment with conservatives making regulatory retrenchment a key part of their jobs strategy while liberals argue that regulation does not harm and may even benefit employment For example Arizona a state with a conservative government has enacted by Executive Order a moratorium on new regulations with certain enumerated exceptions in order to promote job creation and retention in the state Brewer 2013 The empirical record on this issue is equivocal and disputed with most but not all studies finding that any net impact of regulations on employment to be relatively minor Lee 2013 Not all regulations may have the same effect and therefore reducing regulations that have less important benefits or that particularly burden small businesses may have a beneficial impact on employment A 4 Employment Impact Statement for Regulations and Legislation While wholesale reductions in government regulation may not be effective or politically feasible for increasing employment selective study of the impact of regulations may help minimize regulatory burdens on job creating businesses and activities Impact statements have become a useful tool for anticipatory governance and are frequently mandated for governmental actions that may affect the environment privacy or other important social priorities This approach could also be extended to employment impacts While differing in scope and manner of execution several state legislatures currently require employment or economic impact statements with regard to proposed bills Rappa 2011 Employment impact statements consider factors such as the nature of the impact affected numbers and categories adverse impact regions and mitigation Additional considerations may apply based on the rules regulations and laws of each state NYS Department of State 2013 The objective of the analysis is to determine whether a proposed action will have an adverse impact on jobs and job opportunities and to consider the relative employment impacts of policy alternatives Such a requirement could be expanded to include federal legislation and federal and state regulations Although impact statements are criticized as being just paper exercises where the evaluating body simply goes through the motions to comply with the procedural requirement without affecting the pre determined choice to proceed with the chosen policy they do have the beneficial effect of forcing legislatures and agencies to incorporate in house expertise on employment impacts which can have subtle beneficial influences Impact assessments also inform the public and media of such impacts which can have an indirect influence on policymaking all of which helps to elevate the priority given to considering and ameliorating to the extent feasible adverse employment impacts These policy options seek to minimize the frequency of unemployment by sharing the paid work that is available across more workers Although these policies are mostly short term they may help delay or lessen the impact of technological unemployment B 1 Mandatory Retirement Age One straightforward way to share the diminishing supply of work among more people is to impose a mandatory retirement age Some employers e g airlines already impose such a limit but it could be applied more broadly across the economy The main advantage of such a policy is that it would free up more jobs to the benefit of young people who are increasingly being blocked out of the workforce by the lack of open jobs However such a policy would have significant detrimental impacts on individuals and society As people live longer many want to continue working past the typical retirement age for both economic and psychological reasons Also it does not appear to be in society s best interest to compel the retirement of skilled and experienced workers who have many healthy productive years of potential work remaining B 2 Shorter Work Week A shorter work week could help spread work among more workers and possibly lead to a better quality of life for workers who would have more time for leisure retraining and other activities Some Silicon Valley employers are now using a reduced work week as a perk of employment to attract the best and brightest young talent Tracy 2013 According to one European expert a 25 hour work week will allow younger people to spend more time with their children take better care of their health which will help raise average life expectancy and improve their over all quality of life while for the older population many of whom have more time on their hands than they know what to do with work can serve as both a psychological and physical outlet Ebdrup 2013 quoting James W Vaupel This proposal for reduced hours could take a couple of forms Many states take part and have established programs in what is commonly referred to as shared work work sharing or short time compensation In an effort not to cut jobs some companies often taking part in state run programs have reduced employees hours and have assisted them with obtaining prorated benefits for lost time This differs from the traditional view of job sharing in that it does not increase employed numbers but it helps keep people employed when companies have to trim labor costs Other positive aspects of such a strategy include a when businesses recover they may once again increase employees hours without having to retrain them a costly and time consuming enterprise b it helps avoid long term unemployment which often has a negative effect on re employment c it provides security for older workers who may not be as likely to find work if laid off instead of having their hours reduced and d the employee may appreciate the employer s efforts to avoid layoffs and reward the employer with greater loyalty commitment and performance In addition to the above the traditional work share model where two or more employees share the same job by limiting the hours each employee may work is another form of work sharing This may allow an employer to cut back on certain benefits and results in more workers being employed It may have some negative repercussions however if it is perceived by employees as an attempt to reduce benefit payments rather than to minimize unemployment There are also inefficiencies and extra burdens in having more employees do the same amount of overall work including the extra training monitoring and evaluation costs and the loss of consistency and continuity of work between two workers sharing the same job function Moreover as machines take over more and more jobs it is unlikely that there will be enough available human work hours to even justify a shorter work week and so such a strategy may help in the short term but just delay the inevitable in the long term Vardi2012 B 3 More Vacation Time Another way of achieving the same objective of hiring more workers to do the same amount of overall work is to provide more vacation time For example U S workers currently enjoy much less vacation time than their contemporaries in Europe If the U S was to mandate a minimum of four weeks of vacation this could create the need for hiring additional workers especially in larger facilities where work is more fungible Of course such a requirement would impose a burden on employers who would be required to pay for the additional vacation time thus increasing payroll costs and creating some inefficiency It would have the benefit of providing a more enjoyable life for most employees in addition to the impact in increasing employment Such a policy could be implemented now or later as technological employment becomes more severe Another variant would be to give employees a paid sabbatical which would not only create the need for more hiring to fill the gaps but would also give employees an opportunity to engage in retraining or other beneficial pursuits in their time off Ford 2009 These policy options seek to use governmental and other non market interventions to create additional employment that would not otherwise be available under existing market conditions C 1 Government Work Programs Government created work programs were successful to help lift the nation out of the great depression in the 1930s and may be needed to help get us out of the current great recession For example Kevin A Hassett recently made the following proposal in Congressional testimony The stigma of long term unemployment may be ameliorated by a short run jobs program that recruits the long term unemployed to assist with the normal functions of government This may allow individuals to look for a new job while employed a change that may have a large impact on placement Hassett 2013 10 Interestingly when it comes to government training programs Hassett claims they are a national embarrassment and the unemployed would be better off if the monies were available to individuals who themselves chose the skills they wish to acquire Hassett 2013 11 A government assisted program might include a a relocation service and subsidy to serve geographic areas or sectors that are experiencing a shortage b lump sum payment to an unemployed worker who secures employment c low interest loan to start a promising business d visa or other permit to retain highly educated and skilled foreign students or workers and e reduction of red tape and tax implications involved in establishing and maintaining new businesses Strain 2013 C 2 National Service Two kinds of national service exist namely mandatory or voluntary Whether one is preferable to the other is a matter of opinion however it has been pointed out that A republic to survive needed not only the consent of the governed but also their active participation It was not a machine that would go of itself free societies do not stay free without the involvement of their citizens Stengel 2007 In an article published by Time magazine Richard Stengel well known journalist editor and author noting the importance of national service nonetheless recommends that such a system should be voluntary Stengel cites the American mindset as the main reason mandatory service would not be successful because Americans do not enjoy being told what to do In terms of the components of an incentive basedvoluntary plan these could include a establishment of a national service baby bond whereby the federal government would invest a fixed amount of money in the name of each U S born child in a fund At and between a certain age range the child would be entitled to the money in the fund provided he or she commits one or two years to national service In addition the funds could only be used for specific worthy expenditures e g education down payment on a home etc b expansion and increased awareness of existing national service programs e g AmeriCorps that would benefit from additional membership derived from an incentive based voluntary program and c creation of additional entities that would serve as options for national service such as corps directed toward education student summer service health environment and emergency response Stengel 2007 Conceivably the list is virtually endless limited only by the creativity of the planners and framers of a national service system Providing incentives in exchange for the execution of respectable and valuable work which in turn also results in skills and other professional enhancements certainly appears to create a win win situation In terms of mandatory national service IlyaSomin Professor of Law at George Mason University School of Law has said that Mandatory national service which would require young people to do government mandated work is pretty clearly involuntary servitude under any reasonable definition of the word In response to whether a national service requirement may violate the 13th Amendment s restriction on involuntary servitude Somin replied I think that the answer is pretty clearly yes especially if you take the text of the Constitution seriously Note that the Amendment forbids not only slavery but also involuntary servitude a provision deliberately inserted to prevent state governments from in effect reenslaving blacks by imposing temporary forced labor systems Somin 2009 The article in The New Americanthat references Somin s comments provides that National service is just another costly and wasteful big government program Like most federal government programs it will be top heavy slow reacting expensive ineffective and administered from D C To get a good idea of what these new corps will be doing one only has to review what AmeriCorps has been up to since its inception Krey 2009 With regard to the implied failings of the AmeriCorps program Krey maintains that the effects of AmeriCorps activity have been inconsequential citing comical volunteerism and mismanagement with no tangible results He further addresses the repercussions of a forced system which according to Krey are destruction of private charity government indoctrination and tax increases and inflation Krey 2009 C 3 Guaranteed Employment The purpose of a job guarantee program JGP is to lift the burden off the private sector s shoulders during periods of slow economic growth and provide all the unemployed with a job Pay would be based on the federal minimum wage and legislated benefits would also be provided The system would work like a pendulum in a boom economy workers would move from a JGP to the private sector and back to a JGP during times of economic bust The benefits of a JGP include the elimination of unemployment benefits and the need for other costly social safety nets job security ongoing skills training and development poverty reduction less economic pressure on the healthcare system economic and social stability and increased production of goods and services coupled with a solid consumer base In essence a JGP may be viewed as a genuine bottom up approach to economic recovery It is a program that trickles up and stabilizes the rest of economic activity Strong and stable demand means strong and stable profit expectations A program that stabilizes employment and purchasing power is a program that stabilizes cash flow and earnings Stable incomes through employment also mean stable repayments of debts and greater overall balance sheet stability Tcherneva 2011 On the negative side it may be argued that implementing and running a program like the JGP would be extremely costly However if the government can thereby eliminate many of the costs currently associated with paying people who are not working it may not be a bad proposal Unemployment may be viewed as a policy tool to regulate inflation because when cost pressures rise during a slow unemployment ridden economy interest rates are tightened and wage demands are reduced which together ensure inflation is kept in check On the other hand it has been argued that the back and forth between private and public sector employment and a fixed JGP wage are enough to control inflation This is the view of William F Mitchell Professor of Economics at Newcastle University and Charles Darwin University Australia who has published extensively in the areas of wage and price inflation and unemployment Mitchell 1998 C 4 Tax Credits A long standing proposal to increase employment is to use the tax system to give companies incentives to hire more workers Spence and Hlatshwayo 2011 For example Alan Blinder former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve has proposed giving companies a tax credit equal to ten percent of the increase in their wage payments over the previous year Blinder 2013 Other experts have proposed using tax policy to benefit young people who may be disproportionately affected by technological unemployment Sachs and Kotlikoff 2012 C 5 Greater Priority for Traditional Job Creating Factors Over time we have learned that certain societal factors and forces create new jobs such as technology innovation entrepreneurship and stable social environments Although these forces may not be capable of completing compensating for technological unemployment they may help stall and mitigate the severity of such unemployment Policies such as supporting research and development providing additional financing and reducing regulatory burdens on small business entrepreneurs increasing international trade and promoting stable family environments should therefore be given higher priority in this time of potentially runaway unemployment Baker and Hassett 2012 Spence and Hlatshwayo 2011 Universities are centers of innovation and entrepreneurial start up companies all of which generate high quality jobs and therefore should also be a priority for funding Florida 2013 These policy options seek to redistribute wealth in order to blunt the human and social costs of widespread technological unemployment D 1 Minimum Guaranteed Income MGI One common policy proposal to the problem of technological unemployment is for the government to guarantee a minimum income to each citizen While this proposal seeks to address some of the humanitarian problems associated with chronic unemployment it is also the case that government conferred benefits without demanding work from those who are able undermines the work ethic attenuates social bonds creates an alienated underclass and breeds resentment among those who have to pay assuming the employed are being taxed to assist with subsidization This is the lesson learned from previous welfare programs Of course these impacts would be mitigated somewhat by the government not having to pay for some existing drains on the public purse such as unemployment benefits food stamps and social security that could be replaced by a MGI Nonetheless a MGI would likely have a corrosive effect on the social fabric would not address the need for people to have a meaningful purpose to their lives and would likely be politically infeasible in this era of government cut backs and retrenchment Switzerland s upcoming national referendum on a proposal for a guaranteed national income will be an interesting test case for the political feasibility of the MGI if it is not approved in that nation it is unlikely to be adopted in countries like the USA that historically and culturally have a smaller role for government involvement D 2 Smart Social Programs The human impacts of long term unemployment are real and tragic and from a humanitarian perspective cannot be ignored if we are entering an era of growing technological unemployment Painful lessons from the past half century of social programs have taught us that simply providing disadvantaged individuals with a monthly check does not usually help those people to get back on their feet and become self supporting Rather such handouts tend to create cycles of dependency lethargy and lack of self and external respect While the ethical case for some type of support to ensure a minimal standard of life is strong such support should be structured to include incentives and training provisions Martin Ford for example has suggested a system based on government provided income that is fed by taxation on businesses who will not have to pay wages benefits vacation pay and so forth and consumer goods and services Ford 2009 The model involves incentives that if fulfilled would have a positive effect on one s income the greater the response to the incentives the greater the incomethe individual will receive Such incentives might include participation in environmental stewardship continuing education child care art music volunteer work and other laudable activities Ford s proposal arguably eliminates the often negative effects of having idle hands low self esteem associated with job loss social stigma and unproductivity Under this incentive model the individual incomes received while unequal would not be unfair These policy options seek to revise our educational system to make workers more adept in succeeding in an increasingly technology focused and changing world E 1 Lifelong Education Policies The traditional model of education in which young people spend the first quarter or so of their life getting educated and then are done with education is quickly becoming obsolete In such a rapidly changing world there is a need for continuous life long education rather than the current once and done approach to education today Education will need to become more dispersed and delivered in a multitude of ways throughout a person s life Governments educational establishments and employers will all need to work together to create a new ethos of lifelong learning This shift could be encouraged by a mix of tax credits employee incentives and new online educational technologies to create consumer demand for lifelong learning Michael Spence for example has argued that the education system should be given greater value and to provide access for as many people as possible in order for the U S workforce to remain competitive Spence2011 39 He argues that this focus should go hand in hand with tax reform and government investment in infrastructure and technologySimilarly the NAS reported in 1987 that a key factor in sustaining American living standards and employment thus is continued private and public investment in new knowledge National Academy of Sciences1987 3 The NAS also underscored the importance of establishing training focused adjustment policies for effective worker transitions in the wake of technological displacement The source of funding for this revised educational policy wasdeemed to be beyond the NAS panel s charge One barrier to ongoing training through the workplace is that shorter job durations that many employees now experience provides less incentive for employers to pay for ongoing training since that employer will not get the benefit of that training once the employee has moved on to another job Dau Schmidt 2001 E 2 Updated Education Curriculum In addition to becoming life long the content of education must also change to align with a rapidly changing world At a time of unprecedented global change teaching static views of the world focused on facts and information all of which is now readily available online is obsolete In a world dominated by technology greater emphasis must be given to science technology engineering and mathematics STEM education as has been well recognized recently but slow to be implemented More importantly the type of adaptive and forecasting skills that will be essential in a time of rapid change must be taught including study of the possibilities and probabilities of human change awareness of fluctuations and alternatives a menu of skills for emerging jobs and coping skills flexibility and adaptability to change As Abdul Raheem Yusuf has suggested the era of rapid technological change necessitates that humans of the future be educated thinkers who are problem solvers leaving the mundane tasks to technology Yusuf 2007 Similarly Frank Levy and Richard Murnane predict that The major consequence of computerization will not be mass unemployment but a continued decline in the demand for moderately skilled and less skilled labor Job opportunities will grow but job growth will be greatest in higher skilled occupations in which computers complement expert thinking and complex communication to produce new products and services Levy and Murnane 2004 79 Levy and Murnane further maintain that while better education is not a perfect tool it is the best one we have to prepare workers for the unpredictable and ever changing employment market The authors conclude that many of the jobs already lost will not return and that our dynamic environment requires new policies and the first step in creating those policies is to recognize the new realities Levy and Murnane 2004 82 In a subsequent report prepared for the Organization for Economic Co operation and Development OECD Levy distinguishes among inductive deductive rule based skills expert thinking and complex communication only the first of which can be performed by a computer Jobs requiring expert thinking and complex communication on the other hand require a robust educational foundation and are thus not easily replaced with automation To remain successful in the future job market Levy recommends that workers must stay abreast of job market trends and hone skills that complement technology rather than skills that may be eliminated by same Levy2010 E 3 Greater Educational Experimentation Given the many stresses and changes affecting education this is an opportune time for more experimentation in education to try to find what strategies and approaches work best in the era of evolving technologies and jobs One track to try might be greater emphasis on the type of trade school model used more in the United Kingdom and some other European nations where some students may opt for a more practical and skills oriented training rather than attending traditional college While studies consistently show that young people with a university degree do much better than those without in terms of finding quality jobs Berger and Fisher 2013 Pielke 2012 a growing number of university graduates are not finding worthy jobs despite having gone deeply into debt to pay for their college education and may have fared better with a more focused skills based or trade school education Silva 2013 For example a recent poll conducted by Accenture found that forty one percent of recent college graduates say they are underemployed and sixty three percent say they will need more training in order to get their desired job Accenture 2103 The advent of online education and massive open online courses MOOCs is another opportunity for experimentation Even more radical are promising existing programs to develop robotics for teaching such as RUBI at the University of California San Diego Simon at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Cosmobot developed by AnthroTronix Different models of funding education including private enterprise training and block grants to states can also be tried In all these various experiments in educational innovation careful metrics should be kept to evaluate the success and strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches E 4 Mental Upgrading Brynjolfssonand McAfee 2011 consider ways to directly upgrade the human brain using brain computer interfaces thereby allowing us to better keep pace with technological change Unemployment here is viewed as the result of people not being able to keep pace with technology An enhanced existence may therefore help to eliminate unemployment as our altered state of mind would be better prepared for anything the future throws our way Relatedly our superior cognitive capabilities might induce us to either reject a market economy or alternatively spark new industries to keep employment vibrant These policy options seek to alter the existing social model in which an individual s economic livelihood social status and personal self worth are based on their employment F 1 Health Care Not Tied to Job In the new culture of the future flexibility will be paramount to allow individual workers to adapt to new technologies industries and opportunities Moreover the concept of having a single job is increasingly outmoded for many people who by choice or necessity cobble together their own portfolio of contractual tasks part time jobs short term jobs freelance jobs commissioned projects entrepreneurial initiatives and other income earning opportunities to make their livelihood This pattern will become more and more common going forward The regulatory and social benefit approaches to employment must adjust to this changing model Dau Schmidt 2001 Most people now have their health care tied to a specific employer which constrains the employment flexibility and adaptation that will be needed for the future As Ford writes o ne thing that is abundantly clear is that in a world where traditional jobs are disappearing access to healthcare insurance cannot be coupled to employment Ford 2009 New models of health care will be needed for the future whereby health insurance is not tied to a single employer Health care exchanges such as those that are being established under the Affordable Care Act in the United States health care coops or universal health care are models that will better fit the changing workplace of the future F 2 Alternative Valuation System For hundreds of years our society has been structured on an economic model in which people earn their income through employment and then use that income to pay for their living costs This model may be facing collapse if technological unemployment results in a significant proportion perhaps even a majority of the population eventually unable to support themselves because of the shrinking employment opportunities A new social order will be needed to both provide basic essentials for such people to live a good life as well as to live of life of dignity respect and accomplishment As discussed above simply giving handouts to affected persons undercuts their respect to both themselves and the members of their community Healthy happy living requires the sense that one is making a contribution to something meaningful Traditionally but not always that source of meaning and achievement has often been associated with one s job But that has never been the case for everyone as some find meaning and respect outside of the employment context whether it is as a caregiver for children or elder relatives a volunteer for a charitable organization an advocate for a cause or as a serious hobbyist The problem of technological unemployment means that more people will need to find their meaning or value in life outside of the employment relationship and there will be a need to incentivize and reward such activities when they are socially valuable in a way that can allow those people to obtain the amenities shelter food clothing health care etc necessary to live a full and satisfactory life In the long term this may mean moving beyond the existing economic model where dollars earned are used to recognize and reward effort to a broader and more flexible metric to recognize and reward social value Perhaps some type of online social contribution index will eventually need to be created whereby individuals score points for traditional work volunteer efforts caregiving activities creative inventions good deeds and other socially valuable contributions Compensation and entitlements would be based on each individual s social contribution score The era of Big Data and the massive amount of information collected daily on each person would be used to generate the rankings needed to administer such a system While such a post economic schememay seem far fetched and infeasible at this time such social engineering to restructure our social expectations and reward systems may be needed over the long term to address both the economic and social dimensions of the technology unemployment problem Although such systems go beyond our current market system the fact is that the market system is dependent on customers and if large numbers of consumers perhaps even a majority are without any means to purchase goods and services the market economy cannot succeed Change always brings with it risk and opportunity The rapid emergence of a growing number of technologies that can replace human work presents both risks and opportunities The real possibility of widespread and chronic technological unemployment could result in unacceptable individual and societal instability and adversity But those same technologies also have the potential to enrich our lives and to free us from the drudgery and danger of manual boring labor and to enjoy a higher quality of life To make this happen our laws policies assumptions and social contract must evolve as quickly as our technologies will There is thus an urgent need to identify evaluate and implement policies that can help manage and smooth our transition into the new technological era Perry 2013 Shorter term policies need to focus on preserving and creating as many jobs as possible to counter and delay as much as possible the trend towards technological unemployment and then to use redistribution and government support to ensure that individuals who are replaced from their existing or future jobs by technology have the material means to live a decent life and the incentive to improve themselves and live with dignity and respect Over the longer term more radical social engineering policies will be needed moving eventually to a new social contract that recognizes and rewards people for their contributions to society within and outside the employment context We hope to contribute to the effort to ensure an appropriate policy response by inventorying an initial list of potential policy initiatives to address the emerging technological unemployment problem We plan to post this list online and update it on a regular basis and welcome suggestions from readers for additional ideas of policy interventions that we can add with appropriate attribution to our evolving list There will be no single silver bullet that will solve this problem but rather what is needed is experimentation with a constantly shifting portfolio of policies such as some of the ones provide here The more ideas and proposals are available for policymakers to choose from the more successful and effective their policy experimentation is likely to be Accenture 2013 2013 College Graduate

ParadaI want to tell you straight off what this story is about Sometime in the next 40 years robots are going to take your job I don t care what your job is If you dig ditches a robot will dig them better If you re a magazine writer a robot will write your articles better If you re a doctor IBM s Watson will no longer assist you in finding the right diagnosis from its database of millions of case studies and journal articles It will just be a better doctor than you And CEOs Sorry Robots will run companies better than you do Artistic types Robots will paint and write and sculpt better than you Think you have social skills that no robot can match Yes they can Within 20 years maybe half of you will be out of jobs A couple of decades after that most of the rest of you will be out of jobs In one sense this all sounds great Let the robots have the damn jobs No more dragging yourself out of bed at 6 a m or spending long days on your feet We ll be free to read or write poetry or play video games or whatever we want to do And a century from now this is most likely how things will turn out Humanity will enter a golden age But what about 20 years from now Or 30 We won t all be out of jobs by then but a lot of us will and it will be no golden age Until we figure out how to fairly distribute the fruits of robot labor it will be an era of mass joblessness and mass poverty Working class job losses played a big role in the 2016 election and if we don t want a long succession of demagogues blustering their way into office because machines are taking away people s livelihoods this needs to change and fast Along with global warming the transition to a workless future is the biggest challenge by far that progressive politics not to mention all of humanity faces And yet it s barely on our radar We Already Have a Solution for the Robot Apocalypse It s 200 Years Old That s kind of a buzzkill isn t it Luckily it s traditional that stories about difficult or technical subjects open with an entertaining or provocative anecdote The idea is that this allows readers to ease slowly into daunting material So here s one for you Last year at Christmas I was over at my mother s house and mentioned that I had recently read an article about Google Translate It turns out that a few weeks previously without telling anyone Google had switched over to a new machine learning algorithm Almost overnight the quality of its translations skyrocketed I had noticed some improvement myself but had chalked it up to the usual incremental progress these kinds of things go through I hadn t realized it was due to a quantum leap in software But if Google s translation algorithm was better did that mean its voice recognition was better too And its ability to answer queries Hmm How could we test that We decided to open presents instead of cogitating over this But after that was over the subject of erasers somehow came up Which ones are best Clear Black Traditional pink Come to think of it why are erasers traditionally pink I ll ask Google I told everyone So I pulled out my phone and said Why are erasers pink Half a second later Google told me Not impressed You should be We all know that phones can recognize voices tolerably well these days And we know they can find the nearest caf or the trendiest recipe for coq au vin But what about something entirely random And not a simple who where or when question This was a why question and it wasn t about why the singer Pink uses erasers or why erasers are jinxed Google has to be smart enough to figure out in context that I said pink and that I m asking about the historical reason for the color of erasers not their health or the way they re shaped And it did In less than a second With nothing more than a cheap little microprocessor and a slow link to the internet In case you re curious Google got the answer from Design Sponge The eraser was originally produced by the Eberhard Faber Company The erasers featured pumice a volcanic ash from Italy that gave them their abrasive quality along with their distinctive color and smell Still not impressed When Watson famously won a round of Jeopardy against the two best human players of all time it needed a computer the size of a bedroom to answer questions like this That was only seven years ago What do pink erasers have to do with the fact that we re all going to be out of a job in a few decades Consider Last October an Uber trucking subsidiary named Otto delivered 2 000 cases of Budweiser 120 miles from Fort Collins Colorado to Colorado Springs without a driver at the wheel Within a few years this technology will go from prototype to full production and that means millions of truck drivers will be out of a job Automated trucking doesn t rely on newfangled machines like the powered looms and steam shovels that drove the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century Instead like Google s ability to recognize spoken words and answer questions self driving trucks and cars and buses and ships rely primarily on software that mimics human intelligence By now everyone s heard the predictions that self driving cars could lead to 5 million jobs being lost but few people understand that once artificial intelligence software is good enough to drive a car it will be good enough to do a lot of other things too It won t be millions of people out of work it will be tens of millions This is what we mean when we talk about robots We re talking about cognitive abilities not the fact that they re made of metal instead of flesh and powered by electricity instead of chicken nuggets In other words the advances to focus on aren t those in robotic engineering though they are happening too but the way we re hurtling toward artificial intelligence or AI While we re nowhere near human level AI yet the progress of the past couple of decades has been stunning After many years of nothing much happening suddenly robots can play chess better than the best grandmaster They can play Jeopardy better than the best humans They can drive cars around San Francisco and they re getting better at it every year They can recognize faces well enough that Welsh police recently made the first ever arrest in the United Kingdom using facial recognition software After years of plodding progress in voice recognition Google announced earlier this year that it had reduced its word error rate from 8 5 percent to 4 9 percent in 10 months All of this is a sign that AI is improving exponentially a product of both better computer hardware and software Hardware has historically followed a growth curve called Moore s law in which power and efficiency double every couple of years and recent improvements in software algorithms have been even more explosive For a long time these advances didn t seem very impressive Going from the brainpower of a bacterium to the brainpower of a nematode might technically represent an enormous leap but on a practical level it doesn t get us that much closer to true artificial intelligence However if you keep up the doubling for a while eventually one of those doubling cycles takes you from the brainpower of a lizard who cares to the brainpower of a mouse and then a monkey wow Once that happens human level AI is just a short step away This can be hard to imagine so here s a chart that shows what an exponential doubling curve looks like measured in petaflops quadrillions of calculations per second During the first 70 years of the digital era computing power doubled every couple of years and that produced steadily improving accounting software airplane reservation systems weather forecasts Spotify and the like But on the scale of the human brain usually estimated at 10 to 50 petaflops it produced computing power so minuscule that you can t see any change at all Around 2025 we ll finally start to see visible progress toward artificial intelligence A decade later we ll be up to about one tenth the power of a human brain and a decade after that we ll have full human level AI It will seem like it happened overnight but it s really the result of a century of steady but mostly imperceptible progress Are we really this close to true AI Here s a yardstick to think about Even with all this doubling going on until recently computer scientists thought we were still years away from machines being able to win at the ancient game of Go usually regarded as the most complex human game in existence But last year a computer beat a Korean grandmaster considered one of the best of all time and earlier this year it beat the highest ranked Go player in the world Far from slowing down progress in artificial intelligence is now outstripping even the wildest hopes of the most dedicated AI cheerleaders Unfortunately for those of us worried about robots taking away our jobs these advances mean that mass unemployment is a lot closer than we feared so close in fact that it may be starting already But you d never know that from the virtual silence about solutions in policy and political circles I m hardly alone in thinking we re on the verge of an AI Revolution Many who work in the software industry people like Bill Gates and Elon Musk have been sounding the alarm for years But their concerns are largely ignored by policymakers and until recently often ridiculed by writers tasked with interpreting technology or economics So let s take a look at some of the most common doubts of the AI skeptics 1 We ll never get true AI because computing power won t keep doubling forever We re going to hit the limits of physics before long There are several pretty good reasons to dismiss this claim as a roadblock To start hardware designers will invent faster more specialized chips Google for example announced last spring that it had created a microchip called a Tensor Processing Unit which it claimed was up to 30 times faster and 80 times more power efficient than an Intel processor for machine learning tasks A huge array of those chips are now available to researchers who use Google s cloud services Other chips specialized for specific aspects of AI image recognition neural networking language processing etc either exist already or are certain to follow What s more this raw power is increasingly being harnessed in a manner similar to the way the human brain works Your brain is not a single superpowerful computing device It s made up of about 100 billion neurons working in parallel i e all at the same time to create human level intelligence and consciousness At the lowest level neurons operate in parallel to create small clusters that perform semi independent actions like responding to a specific environmental cue At the next level dozens of these clusters work together in each of about 100 sub brains distinct organs within the brain that perform specialized jobs such as speech visual processing and balance Finally all these sub brains operate in parallel and the resulting overall state is monitored and managed by executive functions that make sense of the world and provide us with our feeling that we have conscious control of our actions Modern computers also yoke lots of microprocessors together As of 2017 the fastest computer in the world uses roughly 40 000 processors with 260 cores each That s more than 10 million processing cores running in parallel Each one of these cores has less power than the Intel processor on your desktop but the entire machine delivers about the same power as the human brain This doesn t mean AI is here already Far from it This massively parallel architecture still presents enormous programming challenges but as we get better at exploiting it we re certain to make frequent breakthroughs in software performance In other words even if Moore s law slows down or stops the total power of everything put together more use of custom microchips more parallelism more sophisticated software and even the possibility of entirely new ways of doing computing will almost certainly keep growing for many more years 2 Even if computing power keeps doubling it has already been doubling for decades You guys keep predicting full on AI but it never happens It s true that during the early years of computing there was a lot of naive optimism about how quickly we d be able to build intelligent machines But those rosy predictions died in the 70s as computer scientists came to realize that even the fastest mainframes of the day produced only about a billionth of the processing power of the human brain It was a humbling realization and the entire field has been almost painfully realistic about its progress ever since We ve finally built computers with roughly the raw processing power of the human brain although only at a cost of more than 100 million and with an internal architecture that may or may not work well for emulating the human mind But in another 10 years this level of power will likely be available for less than 1 million and thousands of teams will be testing AI software on a platform that s actually capable of competing with humans 3 Okay maybe we will get full AI But it only means that robots will act intelligent not that they ll really be intelligent This is just a tedious philosophical debating point For the purposes of employment we don t really care if a smart computer has a soul or if it can feel love and pain and loyalty We only care if it can act like a human being well enough to do anything we can do When that day comes we ll all be out of jobs even if the computers taking our places aren t really intelligent 4 Fine But waves of automation steam engines electricity computers always lead to predictions of mass unemployment Instead they just make us more efficient The AI Revolution will be no different This is a popular argument It s also catastrophically wrong The Industrial Revolution was all about mechanical power Trains were more powerful than horses and mechanical looms were more efficient than human muscle At first this did put people out of work Those loom smashing weavers in Yorkshire the original Luddites really did lose their livelihoods This caused massive social upheaval for decades until the entire economy adapted to the machine age When that finally happened there were as many jobs tending the new machines as there used to be doing manual labor The eventual result was a huge increase in productivity A single person could churn out a lot more cloth than she could before In the end not only were as many people still employed but they were employed at jobs tending machines that produced vastly more wealth than anyone had thought possible 100 years before Once labor unions began demanding a piece of this pie everyone benefited The AI Revolution will be nothing like that When robots become as smart and capable as human beings there will be nothing left for people to do because machines will be both stronger and smarter than humans Even if AI creates lots of new jobs it s of no consequence No matter what job you name robots will be able to do it They will manufacture themselves program themselves repair themselves and manage themselves If you don t appreciate this then you don t appreciate what s barreling toward us In fact it s even worse In addition to doing our jobs at least as well as we do them intelligent robots will be cheaper faster and far more reliable than humans And they can work 168 hours a week not just 40 No capitalist in her right mind would continue to employ humans They re expensive they show up late they complain whenever something changes and they spend half their time gossiping Let s face it We humans make lousy laborers If you want to look at this through a utopian lens the AI Revolution has the potential to free humanity forever from drudgery In the best case scenario a combination of intelligent robots and green energy will provide everyone on Earth with everything they need But just as the Industrial Revolution caused a lot of short term pain so will intelligent robots While we re on the road to our Star Trek future but before we finally get there the rich are going to get richer because they own the robots and the rest of us are going to get poorer because we ll be out of jobs Unless we figure out what we re going to do about that the misery of workers over the next few decades will be far worse than anything the Industrial Revolution produced Wait wait skeptics will say If all this is happening as we speak why aren t people losing their jobs already Several sharp observers have made this point including James Surowiecki in a recent issue of Wired If automation were in fact transforming the US economy he wrote two things would be true Aggregate productivity would be rising sharply and jobs would be harder to come by than in the past But neither is happening Productivity has actually stalled since 2000 and jobs have gotten steadily more plentiful ever since the Great Recession ended Surowiecki also points out that job churn is low average job tenure hasn t changed much in decades and wages are rising though he admits that wage increases are meager by historical standards True enough But as I wrote four years ago since 2000 the share of the population that s employed has decreased middle class wages have flattened corporations have stockpiled more cash and invested less in new products and new factories and as a result of all this labor s share of national income has declined All those trends are consistent with job losses to old school automation and as automation evolves into AI they are likely to accelerate That said the evidence that AI is currently affecting jobs is hard to assess for one big and obvious reason We don t have AI yet so of course we re not losing jobs to it For now we re seeing only a few glimmers of smarter automation but nothing even close to true AI Remember that artificial intelligence progresses in exponential time This means that even as computer power doubles from a trillionth of a human brain s power to a billionth and then a millionth it has little effect on the level of employment Then in the relative blink of an eye the final few doublings take place and robots go from having a thousandth of human brainpower to full human level intelligence Don t get fooled by the fact that nothing much has happened yet In another 10 years or so it will So let s talk about which jobs are in danger first Economists generally break employment into cognitive versus physical jobs and routine versus nonroutine jobs This gives us four basic categories of work Routine physical digging ditches driving trucksRoutine cognitive accounts payable clerk telephone salesNonroutine physical short order cook home health aideNonroutine cognitive teacher doctor CEORoutine tasks will be the first to go and thanks to advances in robotics engineering both physical and cognitive tasks will be affected In a recent paper a team from Oxford and Yale surveyed a large number of machine learning researchers to produce a wisdom of crowds estimate of when computers would be able to take over various human jobs Two thirds said progress in machine learning had accelerated in recent years with Asian researchers even more optimistic than North American researchers about the advent of full AI within 40 years But we don t need full AI for everything The machine learning researchers estimate that speech transcribers translators commercial drivers retail sales and similar jobs could be fully automated during the 2020s Within a decade after that all routine jobs could be gone Nonroutine jobs will be next surgeons novelists construction workers police officers and so forth These jobs could all be fully automated during the 2040s By 2060 AI will be capable of performing any task currently done by humans This doesn t mean that literally every human being on the planet will be jobless by then in fact the researchers suggest it could take another century before that happens but that s hardly any solace By 2060 or thereabouts we ll have AI that can do anything a normal human can do which means that nearly all normal jobs will be gone And normal jobs are what almost all of us have 2060 seems a long way off but if the Oxford Yale survey is right we ll face an employment apocalypse far sooner than that the disappearance of routine work of all kinds by the mid 2030s That represents nearly half the US labor force The consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers recently released a study saying much the same It predicts that 38 percent of all jobs in the United States are at high risk of automation by the early 2030s most of them in routine occupations In the even nearer term the World Economic Forum predicts that the rich world will lose 5 million jobs to robots by 2020 while a group of AI experts writing in Scientific American figures that 40 percent of the 500 biggest companies will vanish within a decade Not scared yet Kai Fu Lee a former Microsoft and Google executive who is now a prominent investor in Chinese AI startups thinks artificial intelligence will probably replace 50 percent of human jobs When Within 10 years Ten years Maybe it s time to really start thinking hard about AI And forget about putting the genie back in the bottle AI is coming whether we like it or not The rewards are just too great Even if America did somehow stop AI research it would only mean that the Chinese or the French or the Brazilians would get there first Russian President Vladimir Putin agrees Artificial intelligence is the future not only for Russia but for all humankind he announced in September Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world There s just no way around it For the vast majority of jobs work as we know it will come steadily to an end between about 2025 and 2060 So who benefits The answer is obvious the owners of capital who will control most of the robots Who suffers That s obvious too the rest of us who currently trade work for money No work means no money But things won t actually be quite that grim After all fully automated farms and factories will produce much cheaper goods and competition will then force down prices Basic material comfort will be cheap as dirt Still not free though And capitalists can only make money if they have someone to sell their goods to This means that even the business class will eventually realize that ubiquitous automation doesn t really benefit them after all They need customers with money if they want to be rich themselves One way or another then the answer to the mass unemployment of the AI Revolution has to involve some kind of sweeping redistribution of income that decouples it from work Or a total rethinking of what work is Or a total rethinking of what wealth is Let s consider a few of the possibilities The welfare state writ large This is the simplest to think about It s basically what we have now but more extensive Unemployment insurance will be more generous and come with no time limits National health care will be free for all Anyone without a job will qualify for some basic amount of food and housing Higher taxes will pay for it but we ll still operate under the assumption that gainful employment is expected from anyone able to work This is essentially the bury our heads in the sand option We refuse to accept that work is truly going away so we continue to punish people who aren t employed Jobless benefits remain stingy so that people are motivated to find work even though there aren t enough jobs to go around We continue to believe that eventually the economy will find a new equilibrium This can t last for too long and millions will suffer during the years we continue to delude ourselves But it will protect the rich for a while Universal basic income 1 This is a step further down the road Everyone would qualify for a certain level of income from the state but the level of guaranteed income would be fairly modest because we would still want people to work Unemployment wouldn t be as stigmatized as it is in today s welfare state but neither would widespread joblessness be truly accepted as a permanent fact of life Some European countries are moving toward a welfare state with cash assistance for everyone Universal basic income 2 This is UBI on steroids It s available to everyone and the income level is substantial enough to provide a satisfying standard of living This is what we ll most likely get once we accept that mass unemployment isn t a sign of lazy workers and social decay but the inevitable result of improving technology Since there s no personal stigma attached to joblessness and no special reason that the rich should reap all the rewards of artificial intelligence there s also no reason to keep the universal income level low After all we aren t trying to prod people back into the workforce In fact the time will probably come when we actively want to do just the opposite provide an income large enough to motivate people to leave the workforce and let robots do the job better Silicon Valley perhaps unsurprisingly is fast becoming a hotbed of UBI enthusiasm Tech executives understand what s coming and that their own businesses risk a backlash unless we take care of its victims Uber has shown an interest in UBI Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg supports it Ditto for Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield A startup incubator called Y Combinator is running a pilot program to find out what happens if you give people a guaranteed income There are even some countries that are now trying it Switzerland rejected a UBI proposal in 2016 but Finland is experimenting with a small scale UBI that pays the unemployed about 700 per month even after they find work UBI is also getting limited tryouts by cities in Italy and Canada Right now these are all pilot projects aimed at learning more about how to best run a UBI program and how well it works But as large scale job losses from automation start to become real we should expect the idea to spread rapidly A tax on robots This is a notion raised by a draft report to the European Parliament and endorsed by Bill Gates who suggests that robots should pay income tax and payroll tax just like human workers That would keep humans more competitive Unfortunately there s a flaw here The end result would be to artificially increase the cost of employing robots and thus the cost of the goods they produce Unless every country creates a similar tax it accomplishes nothing except to push robot labor overseas We d be worse off than if we simply let the robots take our jobs in the first place Nonetheless a robot tax could still have value as a way of modestly slowing down job losses Economist Robert Shiller suggests that we should consider at least modest robot taxes during the transition to a different world of work And where would the money go Revenue could be targeted toward wage insurance he says In other words a UBI Socialization of the robot workforce In this scenario which would require a radical change in the US political climate private ownership of intelligent robots would be forbidden The market economy we have today would continue to exist with one exception The government would own all intelligent robots and would auction off their services to private industry The proceeds would be divided among everybody Progressive taxation on a grand scale Let the robots take all the jobs but tax all income at a flat 90 percent The rich would still have an incentive to run businesses and earn more money but for the most part labor would be considered a societal good like infrastructure not the product of individual initiative Wealth tax Intelligent robots will be able to manufacture material goods and services cheaply but there will still be scarcity No matter how many robots you have there s only so much beachfront property in Southern California There are only so many original Rembrandts There are only so many penthouse suites These kinds of things will be the only real wealth left and the rich will still want them So if robots make the rich even richer they ll bid up the price of these luxuries commensurately and all that s left is to tax them at high rates The rich still get their toys while the rest of us get everything we want except for a view of the sun setting over the Pacific Ocean A hundred years from now all of this will be moot Society will adapt in ways we can t foresee and we ll all be far wealthier safer and more comfortable than we are today assuming of course that the robots don t kill us all Skynet fashion But someone needs to be thinking hard about how to prepare for what happens in the meantime Not many are Last year for example the Obama White House released a 48 page report called Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence That sounds promising But it devoted less than one page to economic impacts and concluded only that policy questions raised by AI driven automation are important but they are best addressed by a separate White House working group Regrettably the coming jobocalypse has so far remained the prophecy of a few Cassandras mostly futurists academics and tech executives For example Eric Schmidt chairman of Google s parent company believes that AI is coming faster than we think and that we should provide jobs to everyone during the transition The country s goal should be full employment all the time and do whatever it takes he says Another sharp thinker about our jobless future is Martin Ford author of Rise of the Robots Mass joblessness he warns isn t limited to low skill workers Nor is it something we can fight by committing to better education AI will decimate any job that s predictable which means nearly all of them Many of us might not like to hear this but Ford is unsentimental about the work we do Relatively few people he says are paid primarily to engage in truly creative work or blue sky thinking All this is bad enough but it s made worse by the fact that income inequality has already been increasing for decades The frightening reality Ford says is that we may face the prospect of a perfect storm where the impacts from soaring inequality technological unemployment and climate change unfold roughly in parallel and some ways amplify and reinforce each other Unsurprisingly he believes the only plausible solution is some form of universal basic income So how do we get these ideas into the political mainstream One thing is certain The monumental task of dealing with the AI Revolution will be almost entirely up to the political left After all when the automation of human labor begins in earnest the big winners are initially going to be corporations and the rich Because of this conservatives will be motivated to see every labor displacement as a one off event just as they currently view every drought every wildfire and every hurricane as a one off event They refuse to see that global warming is behind changing weather patterns because dealing with climate change requires environmental regulations that are bad for business and bad for the rich Likewise dealing with an AI Revolution will require new ways of distributing wealth In the long run this will be good even for the rich but in the short term it s a pretty scary prospect for those with money and one they ll fight zealously Until they have no choice left conservatives are simply not going to admit this is happening let alone think about how to address it It s not in their DNA Other candidates are equally unlikely The military thinks about automation all the time but primarily as a means of killing people more efficiently not as an economic threat The business community is a slave to quarterly earnings and in any case will be too divided to be of much help Labor unions have good reason to care but by themselves they re too weak nowadays to have the necessary clout with policymakers Nor are we likely to get much help from governments which mostly don t even understand what s happening Google s Schmidt puts it bluntly The gap between the government in terms of their understanding of software let alone AI is so large that it s almost hopeless he said at a conference earlier this year Certainly that s true of the Trump administration Asked about AI being a threat to jobs Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stunningly waved it off as a problem that s still 50 or 100 years in the future I think we re like so far away from that he said Not even on my radar screen This drew a sharp rebuke from former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers I do not understand how anyone could reach the conclusion that all the action with technology is half a century away he said Artificial intelligence is transforming everything from retailing to banking to the provision of medical care So who s left Like it or not the only real choice to sound the alarm outside the geek community is the Democratic Party along with its associated constellation of labor unions think tanks and activists Imperfect as it is and its reliance on rich donors makes it conspicuously imperfect it s the only national organization that has both the principles and the size to do the job Unfortunately political parties are inherently short term thinkers Democrats today are absorbed with fighting President Donald Trump saving Obamacare pushing for a 15 minimum wage and arguing about all those things They have no time to think hard about the end of work Nonetheless somebody on the left with numbers clout power and organizing energy hopefully all the above had better start Conventional wisdom says Trump s victory last year was tipped over the edge by a backlash among working class voters in the Upper Midwest When blue collar workers start losing their jobs in large numbers we ll see a backlash that makes 2016 look like a gentle breeze Either liberals start working on answers now or we risk voters rallying around far more effective and dangerous demagogues than Trump Despite the amount of media attention that both robots and AI have gotten over the past few years it s difficult to get people to take them seriously But start to pay attention and you see the signs An Uber car can drive itself A computer can write simple sports stories SoftBank s Pepper robot already works in more than 140 cellphone stores in Japan and is starting to get tryouts in America too Alexa can order replacement Pop Tarts before you know you need them A Carnegie Mellon computer that seems to have figured out human bluffing beat four different online poker pros earlier this year California suffering from a lack of Mexican workers is ground zero for the development of robotic crop pickers Sony is promising a robot that will form an emotional bond with its owner These are all harbingers the way a dropping barometer signals a coming storm not the possibility of a storm but the inexorable reality The two most important problems facing the human race right now are the need for widespread deployment of renewable energy and figuring out how to deal with the end of work Everything else pales in comparison

with financial compensation during temporary absences following the birth or adoption of a child Private companies often provide paid leave and the federal government mandates 12 weeks of job protected unpaid leave but recently policymakers and advocates have become dissatisfied with the status quo Proponents of federal intervention argue that the private market does not or cannot provide sufficient paid leave Moreover proponents believe government supported leave would improve labor market outcomes and reduce gender and labor market inequality This study provides evidence that suggests otherwise First ample data show that the private market provides paid leave at rates about 30 to 50 percentage points higher than proponents claim Private paid leave provision has grown three or fourfold over 50 years and continues to grow This trend indicates industry is responsive to employee demands Second workers may not be better off under federal paid leave and may be worse off Government intervention provides new incentives and individuals are likely to adapt accordingly Evidence suggests government supported leave may result in wage or benefit reductions female unemployment or reduced professional opportunities for women Government intervention is also unlikely to correct gender or labor market inequality in ways proponents desire For example families may respond to the policy by increasing women s household work contributions relative to men s Redistributive effects of government intervention are likely to harm workers This study concludes that policymakers should not adopt paid parental leave policies Instead they should consider improving workers lives through reforms that increase economic efficiency remove barriers to flexible work and increase choice Continue to full versionPaid parental leave provides financial compensation when employees are temporarily away from work following the birth or adoption of a child Companies can provide benefits voluntarily or government can mandate or subsidize leave 1 When government mandates or subsidizes parental leave it is considered government supported leave In the United States paid parental leave is provided voluntarily by many employers In addition most workers qualify for 12 weeks of unpaid job protected leave through the Family and Medical Leave Act FMLA of 1993 But there is no federal paid leave program or mandate Some policymakers believe the status quo is lacking and have pushed for further government action Five states and the District of Columbia have established paid parental leave programs since 2002 and many states have studied or introduced legislation 2 In 2017 the Trump administration proposed providing paid parental leave through state unemployment insurance 3 and congressional Democrats proposed federal subsidized leave funded through taxes on businesses and workers 4Proponents of these measures often argue the private market cannot sufficiently provide paid leave due to collective action problems They claim that government supported leave would markedly improve workers lives by improving labor market outcomes and reducing gender inequality In this paper I provide economic research and federal data that suggest otherwise First abundant data show that the private market provides paid leave at much higher rates than advocates have acknowledged Over the past 50 years the private sector has substantially increased paid leave offerings this suggests the private market responds to employee demands At the same time mothers labor force engagement increased without government intervention Second workers may not be better off overall with government supported leave and many may be worse off Most advocates assume a static economic model where parental benefits are provided and nothing else changes That is unlikely because individuals respond to incentives In the simplest case employers may offset the cost of government supported leave by reducing worker wages or employee benefits If employers cannot fully offset costs through wage reductions then side effects such as increased female unemployment or reduced female professional opportunities may occur even when leave is available to both genders Workers may also adjust their behavior in ways that do not meet advocates goals For example government supported leave may increase women s household work contributions relative to men s Because higher income working women with children are most likely to use parental leave government supported leave is likely to redistribute to this group and away from other groups This study concludes that policymakers should eliminate government rules that reduce economic efficiency and interfere with worker s choices including relevant labor and childcare regulations This would make integrating work and family life easier while sidestepping perverse efficiency and redistributive effects associated with government supported leave Proponents of government supported leave are skeptical about the private market s ability to provide adequate paid leave and believe that employees and employers face a collective action problem in obtaining or providing paid leave They claim that 15 percent of workers have access to paid leave based on a Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS figure But the BLS figure does not include all paid leave options and benefits 5The functional consequence of firms policies is that workers can take time off for family matters In that sense other survey evidence is likely to be a better guide than measures of official maternity or paternity leave programs Using more comprehensive metrics the Census Bureau s Survey of Income and Program Participation SIPP Pew Research polling and the National Survey of Working Mothers find that more than 60 percent of mothers or workers have access to paid leave Table 1 6 Other government surveys estimate that the number is between 45 and 57 percent substantially higher than the BLS figure 7Table 1 Estimates of access to paid leaveSource Barbara Gault et al Figure 1 Paid Parental Family Leave Access and Usage Statistics from Five Federal

Proponents of government supported leave also worry that employers are not sufficiently responsive to employees paid leave preferences But access to paid leave has grown substantially over time and has accelerated as U S female labor force participation declined post 2000 The share of first time mothers who reported using paid leave and or disability grew from 16 to 61 percent over 50 years Figure 1 8 This represents a 280 percent increase and suggests the private market is responsive to employee demands Although the Census Bureau discontinued asking mothers about paid leave in 2014 there is reason to think paid leave provision continued to grow Over 100 large name brand companies have created or expanded paid family leave policies over the last three years 9 and a long list of major companies including Walmart Walgreens Home Depot Target Starbucks Amazon FedEx and McDonald s have created or expanded paid leave programs since late 2017 alone Appendix A The latter expansions apply to low wage or hourly workers not just high wage or educated workers Working mothers labor market engagement has also increased without government intervention The share of first time mothers who quit working declined significantly in past decades from over 60 percent in 1961 to just over 20 percent in 2008 Figure 2 This represents a 66 percent decline in first time mothers who quit their

mothers in the workforce U S companies are already spending sub stantial resources on paid leave benefits Thirty two percent of an average U S worker s total compensation is nonwage benefits Figure 3 and more than 14 percent of workers compensation is paid leave and legally required social insurance programs 10 Employers spent an estimated 1 25 trillion on paid leave and other legally required benefits in 2016 11Advocates of government supported leave seem to believe paid leave can be provided and nothing else in the economy will change But whether the program takes the form of an employer mandate or is funded through a payroll tax employers and employees will change their behavior in response to new incentives In the simplest case employers offset the cost of government supported leave by reducing worker wages or employee benefits Imagine an employer that is currently paying an employee 10 per hour The employer is indifferent toward providing compensation as wages or benefits but is interested in limiting business costs for a given productivity level One way she can offset the effects of a mandate or new tax is by reducing wages but maintaining total compensation see Figure 3 12 In this case government supported leave rearranges worker compensation but the new benefit is not free to the worker Figure 3 Breakdown of compensation for average U S worker in 2017Source U S Bureau of Labor Statistics Employer Costs for Employee Compensation Archived News Releases BLS Economic News Release 2017 https www bls gov bls news release ecec htm current Note Includes private and public sector workers except federal government employees and farm or private household workers Academic research supports this idea Economist Lawrence Summers studied the effects of mandating government benefits and concluded that women s wages would be reduced to reflect the cost Summers states that if wages could freely adjust these differences in expected costs would be offset by differences in wages If not there will be efficiency consequences as employers seek to hire workers with lower benefit costs 13Summers s predictions have been borne out in the real world Economist Jonathan Gruber studied maternity benefit mandates in Illinois New York and New Jersey and his findings consistently suggest women s wages were reduced to reflect the cost of benefits The estimated reduction in wages was around 100 percent of the cost of benefits 14Government mandated leave has similar effects internationally A study of 16 European countries over a period of around 20 years found that parental leave is associated with reductions in women s relative wages at extended durations 15 Other researchers have noted that work family policies have also contributed to lower wage levels for women relative to men 16Mandated paid leave reduces employee wages indirectly but subsidized paid leave programs reduce employee wages directly Subsidized paid leave programs rely on payroll taxes borne by workers to fund paid leave benefits If government supported leave reduces wages in favor of benefits it may reduce worker s economic utility 17 Cash benefits are flexible and employee benefits are not When employees prefer wages government supported leave makes them worse off Even if firms could fully offset costs by reducing wages there may be business disruption costs associated with employees taking more leave 18 But firms may not be able to fully offset the cost of government supported leave by reducing employee wages because of minimum wage laws union contracts or other reasons As a result government supported leave may produce side effects that reduce economic efficiency These have a direct impact on women because women take the majority of parental leave even when men are eligible This gendered pattern exists even in egalitarian societies like the Nordic countries 19Young women are more expensive than other workers under government supported leave so employers may be less likely to hire women or may limit training and leadership opportunities In this case government supported leave increases gender based discrimination in the labor market Husbands and wives may also change their behavior in ways that reduce efficiency Some research suggests government supported leave increases the amount of household work women do relative to men even when government supported leave is available to both sexes See the section Household Labor Empirical research highlights employment effects A study of California s subsidized leave program found it increased unemployment and unemployment duration for childbearing age women by 5 to 22 percent and 4 to 9 percent respectively 20 A recent review of the literature suggests employers who find leave taking costly may discriminate against female employees by being less likely to hire them 21Although descriptive data do not constitute strong standalone evidence female unemploy ment is lower in the United States compared to non U S OECD Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development countries with government supported leave Figure 4 Labor force participation is higher for U S women than it is in the OECD overall This pattern is consistent with the theory that government supported leave increases discrimination against women in the labor market Government supported leave may also change the type of employment women are engaged in A study that compares the United States with other OECD countries finds that government supported leave is associated with greater segregation in labor markets with men and women more separated by industry The authors find fewer female professionals and fewer women in leadership roles in countries with government supported leave and other mothers work entitlements 22Figure 4 Postrecession U S continues traditionally low female unemploymentSource Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD Labour Force Statistics by Sex and Age Indicators 2000 2016 data https stats oecd org index aspx queryid 54752 Research indicates government supported leave affects female promotions and leadership Economist Jenna Stearns studied two leave expansions in Britain and found that government supported leave and job entitlements led to fewer women holding management positions and promotion track jobs and exacerbate d gender inequality among highly educated workers 23 Stearns also found that mothers with low education were more than 10 percentage points less likely to be promoted within five years after the maternity leave expansion Economists argue that so called family friendly policies may have boomerang effects on women s position in the labor market especially for the more educated women and that women s labor market position has deteriorated in the Nordic countries The policies have inadvertently created a system based glass ceiling 24Figure 5 Higher share of women in the U S are employed as managers than in

26According to OECD and World Bank data the proportion of women employed as managers is three times higher in the United States than in Norway 27 Between 1980 and 2010 4 5 million managers were added to the U S workforce and women filled the majority 58 percent of new positions 28Figure 6 Higher share of managers in the U S are female compared to other OECD countries 2005 2017Source International

women in contrast to other labor markets worldwide Table 2 Female CEOs as a percentage of all CEOsProponents believe government supported leave can help eliminate perceived household inequities Husbands and wives may change their behavior in response to government supported leave but not in the way advocates expect These changes may create inefficiencies Some research suggests long parental leaves create artificial incentives for women to increase time spent on cooking and housework compared with men A study on parental time use in 19 countries over 40 years found men do less and women do more time inflexible housework in nations where parental leave s are long 29 According to the author parental leave makes women available for time inflexible housework during a critical time of household negotiation and it sends a clear message about who should provide family labor As Kimberly Morgan and Kathrin Zippel argue multiyear childcare leave policies common in Europe are likely to reinforce the traditional division of care work in the home and temporary homemaking is institutionalized as the norm for many women 30 Likewise Nima Sanandaji argues in The Nordic Glass Ceiling that government supported leave and a variety of other social welfare policies have turned many Swedish women into part time workers and part time mothers 31In line with this theory government subsidized leave in California raised leave use by almost five weeks for the average covered mother and two to three days for the corresponding father 32 increasing mothers domestic contributions compared to those of fathers According to one estimate women with infant children increased the amount of time spent on childcare by 3 56 hours per day after the implementation of California paid leave 33As male labor force participation has declined in the United States and women outpace men at school reshuffling domestic and professional responsibilities may naturally occur in some partnerships 34 While supporters of traditional gender roles might find government supported leave s impact on household duties appealing encouraging women to stay at home is not likely to be in the interests of all households Government supported leave is likely to redistribute from childless adults to those with children from men to women from male breadwinner households to other household types and from low income to middle or high income workers 35First government supported leave requires childless adults to trade their own wages for parental leave other families will use 36 These costs may be felt more acutely by childless adults over time since government supported leave entitlements tend to grow For example Norway expanded leave from 18 to 35 weeks between 1987 and 1992 which nearly doubled the cost to taxpayers from 12 354 to 24 022 per eligible birth 37Government supported leave also redistributes from male to female workers Men are more likely to be childless than women 25 percent compared to 15 percent at ages 40 to 44 38 and women take parental leave at significantly higher rates than men even when both sexes are eligible 39Partly because men are less likely to take paid leave government supported leave would redistribute from male breadwinner households to dual income and female breadwinner households In the United States male breadwinner households constitute 30 percent of families with children under 18 40Government supported leave is also likely to redistribute from one income class to another In California government subsidized leave use is concentrated among more highly paid workers and the median paid leave recipient earns 10 000 more than the median working woman 41Figure 7 Paid leave does not predict substantially higher U S female labor force participation 10 years after birthSource Claudia Goldin and Joshua Mitchell The New Lifecycle of Women s Employment Disappearing Humps Sagging Middles Expanding Tops NBER No 22913 December 2016 http www nber org papers w22913 Likewise expanding paid leave in Norway from 18 to 35 weeks regressively redistributed from low income to middle and upper income mothers while raising taxes considerably Mothers with higher incomes were more likely to meet eligibility standards for receiving the benefit such as working 6 of the last 10 months But even among eligible mothers the parental leave benefit was regressively distributed In a study of this expansion economists found that Norway s leave amount s to a pure leisure transfer to middle and upper income families at the expense of the least well off in society Expanding benefits had little impact on positive social outcomes including labor force participation in the short or long run fertility marriage or divorce according to the study s authors 42Economic efficiency and redistributive effects indicate women may not be better off overall under government supported leave However proponents insist women s lives could be improved because government supported leave is linked to higher female labor force participation and smaller gender pay gaps Economics can t tell us what the female labor force participation rate or unadjusted pay gap should be but most economists would start from the premise that with some exceptions economic welfare is maximized when families make free choices 43 In a free market individual outcomes and by extension group outcomes are not expected to be equal Moreover there is reason to think metrics wouldn t change in the direction proponents desire or would be perversely impacted by government supported leave A study of five expansions of maternity leave in Germany found that expansions reduced mothers postbirth employment rates in the short run and long run effects on labor market outcomes were small 44Figure 8 The U S gender pay gap is converging with that of other countriesSource Henrik Kleven Camille Landais and Jakob Egholt Sogaard Children and Gender Inequality Evidence from Denmark NBER Working Paper no 24219 January 2018 http www nber org papers w24219 U S research suggests paid leave does not predict substantially higher female labor force participation 10 years after birth Figure 7 It s likely that women offered paid leave by their employer have other characteristics that make them more likely to retain employment In countries where government supported leave is linked to increased female labor force participation it is a result of women doing more part time work Economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn find that women weakly attached to the labor force stay partly engaged as a result of government supported leave 45Women s labor market outcomes also vary for other reasons Economists argue the gender pay gap is converging across all countries and though the United States and Sweden or Denmark feature different public policies and labor markets they are no longer very different in terms of overall gender inequality Figure 8 46The size of the gender pay gap seems to have little to do with government supported leave According to one highly cited study although gender pay gaps are less pronounced in countries with developed family policies the lower gender pay gap should be attributed to their more egalitarian wage structures rather than paid leave entitlements 47In other words government supported leave does not explain smaller gender pay gaps after considering public policies that reduce wage dispersion directly including government rules that strengthen trade unions or limit minimum or maximum wages The private sector has grown its paid leave offerings in response to employee demands and continues to do so Wage restructuring efficiency and redistributive effects may mean workers are no better off or are worse off overall with government supported leave Therefore the federal government should not adopt a paid leave policy Instead policymakers should think broadly about improving workers lives and focus on removing barriers to workers career choices and improving economic efficiency Childcare regulations and existing labor laws impose some of the most significant barriers Childcare expenses are soaring in many states and they are inflated by government policies that reduce the supply of care Childcare expenses occur over many years and are more likely to matter for mothers employment than government supported leave which lasts a few weeks or months According to Rachel Connelly and Jean Kimmel the cost of childcare is a significant factor in single and married mothers decisions to seek work or apply for welfare 48 Kimmel finds child care prices significantly impede married mothers labor force participation behavior 49It has to be economically worth it for mothers to work and regulations drive up the price of childcare According to a study on regulation and the cost of childcare requiring supervising daycare teachers to have at least a high school diploma is associated with an increase in child care costs for infants of between 25 and 46 percent or between 2 370 and 4 350 per year per child 50Policymakers should eliminate regulation that artificially increases staff to child ratios or requires daycare teachers to hold a high school or college degree Lawmakers should also reform labor laws to make work scheduling more flexible Working parents especially working mothers highly value flexibility The 2017 Working Families Flexibility Act would allow interested employees to bank overtime compensation and use it as future time off Government employees can do this but private companies are prevented from compensating employees this way under the Fair Labor Standards Act ostensibly to protect private sector workers 51These policies sidestep negative repercus sions for women related to government supported leave and also improve fairness flexibility and choice for working mothers and parents Unlike government supported leave these reforms avoid creating another entitlement at a time when U S public debt is at its second highest level in history 52In short these policy improvements provide many of the promised benefits of government supported leave without the perverse consequences These reforms should be considered instead by policymakers eager to improve workers lives Corporations increase paid leave offerings in early 2018 all numbers in

economic policy of a government and it is partly through the budget that the government exercises its three principal methods of establishing control the allocative function the stabilization function and the distributive function Over time there have been considerable changes in emphasis on these different economic functions of the budget In the 19th century government finance was primarily concerned with the allocative function The job of government was to raise revenue as cheaply and efficiently as possible to perform the limited tasks that it could do better than the private sector As the 20th century began the distribution function acquired increased significance Social welfare benefits became important and many countries introduced graduated tax systems In the later interwar period and more especially in the 1950s and 60s stabilization was central although equity was also a major concern in the design of tax systems In the 1970s and 80s however the pendulum swung back Once more allocative issues came to the fore and stabilization and distribution became less significant in government finance The allocative function in budgeting determines on what government revenue will be spent Because a high proportion of national income is now devoted to public expenditure allocation decisions become more significant in political and economic terms At all times and in all countries the calls for expenditure on specific services or activities or for more generous transfer payments will always exceed the amount that can reasonably be raised in taxation or by borrowing The debate about how these scarce resources should be allocated has continued for hundreds of years and although numerous methods of deciding on priorities have emerged it has never been satisfactorily resolved In practice most democracies contain a number of different factions that disagree on the proper allocation of resources and indeed the proper level of public sector involvement in the economy the frequent change of national governments is related to the constant search for the right answers Economists have sought to provide objective criteria for public expenditures through the so called theory of public goods It is generally recognized that some goods needed by the public cannot be provided through the private market Lighthouses are a classic example The costs of a lighthouse are such that no one shipowner will want to finance it on the other hand if a lighthouse is provided for one shipowner it can be made available to all for no additional cost Indeed it must be available to all since there is no practical means of excluding ships from using the facility provided by the lighthouse even if their owners have refused to pay for it The only practical method of providing such services is by collective action If goods are to be provided in this way rather than through the private market it is immediately necessary to confront the twin problems of deciding how much to provide and who should pay for that provision Even if all individuals wanted the service equally as perhaps with lighthouses their views on the extent of the service would be influenced by the allocation of the costs Where different households may have different preferences and some may not want the service at all as for example with defense by nuclear weapons these difficulties are compounded Economists have tried to devise abstract voting schemes that would reconcile these difficulties but these appear to have little practical application Moreover others would challenge this whole approach to the problem It would be absurd to say that the consumer has a taste for national defense and that it is the job of the government to satisfy it The task of national leaders is to evolve a defense policy and persuade the public to accept it Similarly conservationists must attempt to awaken the public to the importance of parks and wildlife In the context of public policy the efficient allocation of resources consists not merely of distributing funds in the pursuit of given objectives but also involves determining the objectives themselves Genuine public goods pose severe problems for the national budget it is very difficult to decide how far particular goods the arts national parks even defense should be supplied and therefore no formal procedure of determination is likely to evolve What should be given to each will continue to be the subject of intense political debate with allocation changing as the government changes The concept of merit goods assists governments in deciding which public or other goods should be supplied Merit goods are commodities that the public sector provides free or cheaply because the government wishes to encourage their consumption Goods such as subsidized housing or social services which predominantly help the poor or health care services which help the poor and elderly are generally regarded as having considerable merit and therefore have a strong claim on government resources Other examples include the provision of retraining schemes or urban regeneration programs Once decisions have been made on how the limited national budget should be divided between different groups of activities or even before this public authorities need to decide which specific projects should be undertaken One method that has been used is cost benefit analysis This attempts to do for government programs what the forces of the marketplace do for business programs to measure and compare in terms of money the discounted streams of future benefits and future costs associated with a proposed project If the ratio of benefits to costs is considered satisfactory the project should be undertaken Satisfactory means among other things that the project is superior to any available public or private alternative Or if funds are limited public investment projects may be assigned priorities according to their cost benefit ratios One difficulty with cost benefit analysis is that every government agency has an incentive to estimate favourable ratios for its own projects It must after all compete with other agencies for funds No one can be certain as to the returns to be expected from an irrigation canal or a highway Private investors have also been known to exaggerate their claims in appealing to stockholders but they are generally subject to market sanctions that encourage them to err on the side of caution In addition to the possibility that cost benefit analysis may be biased by the preformed views of those commissioning the study there are other more fundamental difficulties Almost all proposals have effects that are difficult to value in monetary terms The siting of a new airport brings problems of noise and property blight to local people and increases the risk that civilians may die in an accident Putting a sensible value on human life has been a continuing difficulty for those carrying out cost benefit analyses even though every project does in fact affect probabilities of life and death These problems are of course not confined to cost benefit analysis Additional expenditure on health service or on road safety or better housing or heating old people s homes in winter all affect the number of people who die prematurely The failure of cost benefit analysis to provide answers to the problems of valuing life or the quality of life is a reflection of the wider problem confronting all decisions on public expenditure the influence of subjective judgment Until the mid 1970s the proportion of economic activity controlled by the government and the share of taxes in national income tended to increase in most countries Since then however challenges to this growth in the role of government have become increasingly influential and moves to privatization have been common There are several types of privatization One involves the sale to private owners of state owned assets and this is most correctly called privatization Publicly owned houses may be sold to their occupants Commodity stockpiles may be reduced or disbanded Increasingly however attention has been turned to the sale of publicly owned industries thus reversing the move to nationalization that occurred particularly in western Europe around and after World War II Where the privatized industry operates in a competitive environment no new problems arise Singapore has privatized its airline system for example which now competes with a mixture of privately and publicly owned international airlines Where privatization occurs but monopoly continues however there are new difficulties Both Japan and the United Kingdom have privatized their telecommunications networks Although in certain limited areas of telecommunications competition is possible and has been allowed to develop in both the United States and Britain technical and legal restrictions inhibit competition in many sectors of the industry Regulation is necessary therefore to restrict the freedom of privatized monopolies or near monopolies to raise prices and to exploit consumers in other ways In the United States which has by far the longest history of regulating private utilities such regulation has normally limited the rate of return that they earn to what is considered a fair level A disadvantage of this is that it may give the industry no greater incentive to increased efficiency than would exist in public ownership since higher costs can be passed directly onto consumers There have been experiments therefore with other forms of regulation which seek to strike a balance between incentives for better performance and the ability to exploit consumers A further problem for such regulation is that utilities and similar industries normally operate in both competitive and monopoly markets They may be inclined to use their monopoly power in some areas to gain unfair competitive advantages in others Despite these difficulties an increasingly wide range of industries ranging from water supply to airports are now considered candidates for privatization Privatization can also mean the dismantling of existing statutory restrictions on competition State activities are often protected by legal prohibitions on competing private enterprise German railways for example are entirely state owned and the law not only prevents competing railroads but severely restricts coach services and limits competitive trucking The dismantling of such restrictions is seen as one method of improving the efficiency of state concerns Another demand of privatization is the contracting out of publicly provided services U S municipalities have often entrusted activities such as refuse collection and in some cases even fire service to private contractors and European countries are increasingly experimenting with similar schemes These possibilities demonstrate that a service may be government financed but not necessarily provided by the government if extended more widely the concept could yield a different view of the economic role of the state While the objective of privatization is often to increase the efficiency of government activities its implementation may also have important effects on government revenue Any savings that result from lower costs lead directly to lower tax rates Where budgeting procedures do not distinguish between capital and current transactions the proceeds of privatization sales provide a once and for all boost to revenues The availability of this source of funding for state activity has given an artificial attractiveness to privatization especially in the United Kingdom If an industry is sold for the present value of its expected earnings and if these earnings are the same in public and private ownership privatization should have no net impact on public finances If it is expected to be more efficient in the private sector government finance on balance gains If it is sold for less than the maximum revenue that would be obtained and this is often the case either because of the difficulty of selling assets as large as nationalized industries or because the government wishes to secure a wide dispersion of share ownership the impact is likely to be negative Government spending is not the only way in which government allocates resources Its regional policies will determine whether domestic and overseas investors build factories in particular places while its taxation policies will determine whether they build them at all Government competition and merger policies affect the structure of industry and commerce while regulatory activities setting the number of hours shops may be open or who may buy cigarettes have profound effects on commercial activities Government also affects allocations by setting the legal and administrative framework within which the economy functions It may specify minimum wage levels or control the siting of new ventures and the activities of existing ones Such activities of government profoundly affect the allocation of resources but they are rarely monitored or subject to serious control Stabilization of the economy e g full employment control of inflation and an equitable balance of payments is one of the goals that governments attempt to achieve through manipulation of fiscal and monetary policies Fiscal policy relates to taxes and expenditures monetary policy to financial markets and the supply of credit money and other financial assets The use of fiscal and monetary policy as a means of stabilizing the economy is relatively recent for the most part a development of the period after World War II During the 19th century the only stabilization policy was that associated with the international gold standard Under the gold standard if a deficit occurred in a country s balance of payments gold tended to flow out of the country To counteract this process the monetary authorities would raise interest rates and stiffen credit requirements causing a fall in prices income and employment this in turn led to a reduction in imports and an expansion of exports thus improving the balance of payments If a country had a surplus in its balance of payments gold tended to flow in this meant that the interest rate fell and the supply of money and credit was increased As a consequence imports were stimulated and exports discouraged so that the surplus in the balance of payments tended to disappear The adjustment mechanism also included another important element capital movements between countries When interest rates fell in surplus countries and rose in deficit countries mobile international financial capital tended to flow from the former to the latter contributing to the elimination of deficits and surpluses in the balance of payments The working of this mechanism was partly automatic and partly the result of deliberate actions by the monetary authorities in each country In this form of stabilization policy external stability was achieved at the cost of stability in the domestic economy fluctuations in domestic prices incomes and employment functioned as the levers for bringing about equilibrium in the balance of payments Occasionally governments attempted to reduce the impact of this mechanism on the domestic economy particularly on the price level In particular governments in some surplus countries took sterilization actions to prevent the gold inflow from increasing the supply of money and credit to the maximum extent This could be done if the central bank offset its purchases of foreign exchange and gold with sales of government securities on the domestic credit market A somewhat more ambitious type of stabilization policy emerged in the period after World War I During the late 1920s and early 1930s the need to reduce unemployment acquired more urgency Previously the exchange rate the balance of payments and occasionally the price level had been considered more important than the situation in the labour market During the 1920s unemployment in Great Britain rose to very high levels between 20 and 30 percent of the labour force Consequently there was much discussion of whether employment could be increased by actions of the public authorities At first the discussion in Great Britain centred on the feasibility of public works programs as a means of putting men to work there was a growing belief that these programs might also be a good means of raising the general level of economic activity through their effect on purchasing power Some maintained that budget deficits would also raise the level of economic activity An active part in this discussion was taken by the economist J M Keynes and also by the Liberal Party which in 1928 published proposals for government intervention entitled Britain s Industrial Future The first countries to adopt the new policies were Sweden and Germany When the Nazi Party took power in Germany in 1933 its rearmament policies helped to reduce unemployment and to stimulate the economy In Sweden the new Social Democratic government attempted in more modest ways to expand the economy and ease unemployment through increased government expenditures in 1932 33 In the United States a very limited attempt was made by the administration of Pres Herbert Hoover but Franklin D Roosevelt made a more aggressive effort with such projects as the Works Progress Administration WPA which carried on its payroll an average of more than 2 000 000 workers per year from 1935 to 1941 Unemployment however persisted at a high level until World War II although there was a significant drop from a level of about 25 percent in 1933 The new stabilization policy needed a theoretical rationale if it was ever to win general acceptance from the leaders of public opinion The main credit for providing this belongs to Keynes In his General Theory of Employment Interest and Money 1935 36 he endeavoured to show that a capitalist economy with its decentralized market system does not automatically generate full employment and stable prices and that governments should pursue deliberate stabilization policies There has been much controversy among economists over the substance and meaning of Keynes s theoretical contribution Essentially he argued that high levels of unemployment might persist indefinitely unless governments took monetary and fiscal action At that time he believed that fiscal action was likely to be more effective than monetary measures In the deep depression of the 1930s interest rates had ceased to exert much influence on the ways in which owners of wealth disposed of their funds they might choose to hold larger cash balances instead of spending more money as the traditional theory had suggested Nor were investors inclined to take advantage of low interest rates if they could not find profitable uses for borrowed funds particularly if their firms were already suffering from excess capacity Keynes s pessimistic view of monetary policy had a strong influence on economists and governments during and immediately after World War II with the result that monetary policy was not tried very much during the 1940s It was often forgotten during the policy discussions of the time that Keynes s views on the efficacy of monetary policy were related to the particular situation of the 1930s Another influential idea embodied in Keynes s writing was that of economic stagnation He suggested that in the advanced industrial countries people tended to save more as their incomes grew larger and that private consumption tended to be a smaller and smaller part of the national income This implied that investment would have to take a continually larger share of the national income in order to maintain full employment Since he doubted that investment would rise sufficiently to do this Keynes was rather pessimistic about the possibility of achieving full employment in the long run He thus suggested that there might be some permanent tendency to high levels of unemployment This also had considerable influence on economic policy during the early postwar period it was some time before those in decision making positions realized that inflation rather than stagnation and unemployment was to be the main problem confronting them The desirability of pursuing policies to maintain high levels of employment was generally accepted in most industrial countries after the war In 1944 the British government stated in its White Paper on Employment Policy that the government accept as one of their primary aims and responsibilities the maintenance of a high and stable level of employment after the war One of the most influential British economists at this time was Sir William Beveridge whose book Full Employment in a Free Society had a strong impact on general thinking Similar ideas were expressed in the United States in the Employment Act of 1946 which stated The Congress hereby declares that it is the continuing policy and responsibility of the Federal Government to promote maximum employment production and purchasing power The Employment Act was less specific as to policy than the British government s White Paper but it established a council of economic advisers to assist the president and called upon him to present to every regular session of Congress a report on the state of the economy The president was also required to present a program showing ways and means of promoting a high level of employment and production Similar programs were adopted in other countries In Sweden in 1944 the Social Democrats published a document somewhat similar to the British White Paper and other such declarations were made in Canada and Australia Fiscal policy attempts to control the actions of individuals and companies by means of spending and taxation decisions On the expenditure side it can achieve this by spending money in ways for example on construction projects that stimulate other activity while on the taxation side it can affect work investment or production decisions by changing tax rates and levels Fiscal policy thus has two major components an overall effect generated by the balance between the resources the government puts into the economy through expenditures and the resources it takes out through taxation charges or borrowing and a microeconomic effect generated by the specific policies it adopts Both are important in stabilizing the economy Overall fiscal policy involves the government in deciding whether it should spend more than it receives or less The development of countercyclical fiscal policies in the post World War II period reflected the explicit attempt by some governments to protect their population from world recessions by deliberately spending additional money at appropriate times Experience with countercyclical fiscal policy has been disappointing in many cases the lag between identifying the problem and fiscal response has been too long with the result that a fiscal boost coincided with the next boom while a contraction might coincide with the next recession Fiscal policies that were intended to be countercyclical could end up exacerbating the original problems Another facet to fiscal policy is a government s attempt to guide the development of the economy by more specifically targeted policies Thus most countries have from time to time attempted to cushion particular areas from the effects of a decline in their dominant industry by regional policies to affect labour supply and demand by taxation and to change the pattern of consumer purchases by changes to indirect taxes These policies sometimes backfire as unforeseen consequences and interactions occur The simple notion of budget balance although widespread can be seriously misleading to one who attempts to decide whether a government is being expansionary or contractionary at a particular time If nothing else were happening and there were no inflation no changes in unemployment or exchange rates and the country were to have a constant population of all ages then the government s fiscal position or stance might be said to be neutral neither expansionary nor contractionary if spending were an exact match of taxation charges and profits on public sector activities Even in such a case however if it were pursuing specific microeconomic policies its neutrality might hide significant effects on the behaviour of the economy This notion has led many countries to believe that fiscal position is appropriately measured by the size of public borrowing because this measures the difference between the amount government spends and the amount it receives The recognition that simple budget balance not accounting for inflation may not in fact be neutral when other things are changing has led to a number of suggestions for more sophisticated measures of fiscal position The full employment budget surplus suggested by the Council of Economic Advisers in the United States for instance attempts to adjust the simple measure of budget deficit or surplus in reaction to the effects of deviations from a level of unemployment that it regards as normal or full The argument for this kind of adjustment is that high levels of unemployment cause increased benefit payments and reduced tax receipts that are abnormal and if the government were to try to maintain a simple budget balance at times of high employment this would require a large contraction in the other activities it supports A simple deficit then may be a surplus on a full employment basis and government action may be severely contractionary despite positive levels of borrowing Another type of suggested adjustment recognizes that inflation erodes the real value of public debt The neutral simple budget balance it is argued only requires that the government maintain its real asset position If inflation is eroding the real value of existing debt then the government may borrow to an adjusted or revised level before its actions actually reduce public assets Although it has come to be recognized that a simple budget deficit or surplus does not adequately reflect a government s fiscal position no country directly employs measures revised for unemployment and inflation in deciding on countercyclical policies This is partly because they are more difficult for politicians to understand and partly because it is genuinely difficult to decide on the precise form they should take Whatever the reason many countries even at times of high inflation and unemployment continue to focus on the simple budget balance measures The United Kingdom for example continued in 1980 81 to attempt to reduce public borrowing during a serious world recession and ran an adjusted surplus This procyclical policy is blamed by many as a cause of the high levels of unemployment that subsequently prevailed in that country The heyday of fiscal stabilization policies was however the 1950s and 60s In the 1970s governments became increasingly concerned about inflationary pressures and important disturbances particularly the oil crisis disrupted world economies Stabilization became a less important policy goal and one that governments were increasingly unable to achieve Monetarist economic theories acquired increased influence The primary economic issues determining fiscal policies once again became the more traditional concerns of allocation and distribution Although the governmental budget is primarily concerned with fiscal policy defining what resources it will raise and what it will spend the government also has a number of tools that it can use to affect the economy through monetary control By managing its portfolio of debt it can affect interest rates and by deciding on the amount of new money injected into the economy it can affect the amount of cash in circulation and therefore indirectly affect prices and other economic variables In recent years governments discouraged by past failures with fiscal manipulation have turned to monetarist policies to attempt control of the economy At its simplest monetarist theory postulates that in the economy there is a fixed amount of money which circulates at a given velocity This money is then available to finance the various transactions carried out in the economy at the prevailing prices Under these circumstances according to the theory control of the price level can be maintained by controlling the amount of available money Although a desire to control inflation has been at the heart of the recent rise to prominence of monetary policies in many countries monetary policy can be used to affect a number of different facets of economic behaviour In time of unemployment the central bank may stimulate private investment expenditure and possibly also household spending on consumer goods by reducing interest rates and taking measures to increase the supply of credit liquid assets and money The customary tools for doing this are open market operations the discount rate of the central bank and cash reserve requirements for commercial banks In open market operations the central bank buys government securities bonds and treasury bills from the private sector The effect is to reduce interest rates by bidding up bond prices The sellers of the government securities obtain cash that they deposit in the banks thus increasing the cash reserves of the banks and enabling them to expand credit to private borrowers this in turn causes interest rates in the private sector to fall and the terms of credit to become easier In response firms are likely to increase their investment expenditures and households are likely to spend more on consumer goods The second tool of monetary policy the discount rate of the central banks is often used together with open market operations This is the interest rate at which commercial banks can borrow funds from the central bank If the discount rate is reduced banks become more willing to extend credit to private borrowers because they can obtain funds themselves on easier terms In many countries changes in the discount rate tend to be followed by similar changes in the interest rates charged by banks to their borrowers The third tool of monetary policy that of the cash reserve requirements and in some countries certain types of government securities for commercial banks provides that banks must maintain money balances in the form of deposits in the central bank at a certain proportion of their liabilities This means that the banks cannot expand their earning assets such as government securities and private loans beyond that point If the government reduces the reserve requirements the banks can expand their loans further thus increasing the total volume of credit outstanding Monetary policy like fiscal policy may also be used to combat inflationary tendencies by reversing the above measures the central bank will then sell government securities thereby increasing interest rates and reducing the supply of private credit and money raise the discount rate or increase reserve requirements A broad distinction may be made between two types of stabilization policies discretionary and automatic Discretionary policies involve deliberate actions taken by the authorities such as open market operations changes in discount rates and reserve requirements and changes in tax rates or government expenditures Automatic policies put reliance on built in stabilizers that function without any deliberate intervention by the authorities In the monetary field for example an increase in commodity prices tends to reduce the real value of financial assets and if the government does nothing to offset this by increasing the volume of financial assets in the system private spending will tend to decline On the fiscal side the main automatic stabilizer is the relation between tax revenues and cyclical changes in the economy During booms tax revenues rise and the need for expenditures on unemployment compensation decreases channeling a larger proportion of the national income into government coffers these effects are accentuated if the tax system is progressive because tax revenues rise more rapidly than money incomes Provided that the government does not raise its expenditures along with the increased revenues the budget tends to have a braking effect on private expenditure in boom times and an expansionary effect in times of recession There has been much discussion over the merits of discretionary policies as against automatic stabilizers One advantage of automatic stabilizers is that the effects occur without the necessity of government action which means that there is no delay or lag because of political controversies administrative problems or difficulties in determining whether the time has come to act There are three types of lag in economic policy the recognition lag the decision lag and the effect lag The recognition lag is the time it takes for the authorities to discover the need to make a change in economic policy The reasons for this type of lag are that statistical information is often somewhat behind the event and that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between random fluctuations and fundamental shifts in economic trends Governments prefer to wait until there is certainty that say an increase in unemployment is not a passing thing The decision lag is the period between the time when the need for action is recognized and the time when action is taken Although the recognition lag is presumably of about the same duration for both monetary and fiscal policies the decision lag is usually considerably shorter for monetary policy than for fiscal policy The central bank can change monetary policy almost overnight whereas a change in fiscal policy is more complex both politically and administratively In many countries changes in income taxes for example can be made only at the beginning of a calendar year such changes are often complicated by political discussions in the legislative body The effect lag is the amount of time between the time action is taken and an effect is realized Monetary policy involves longer delays than fiscal policy the time between a change in monetary policy and its ultimate effect on private investment may be between one and two years Some economists argue that the sum of all the lags is so long and uncertain that the best strategy is not to take any action by the time the effects occur the economic situation may be radically different Some countries have tried to shorten the lags in fiscal and monetary policy One way to reduce the recognition lag is to improve the forecasting techniques for example by using sophisticated questionnaires or computerized econometric models In order to reduce the decision lag in fiscal policy some countries have given the authorities power to take limited action without the prior consent of the legislature In the United Kingdom the government introduced a regulation that allowed it to make immediate changes in tax policy In Belgium and West Germany the governments also have some discretionary powers to change tax rates without first asking the legislature In most countries however the legislative bodies have been reluctant to give up control of the budget and increasing skepticism about the effectiveness of stabilization policy has led to a retreat from frequent small adjustments to fiscal policy Attempts to shorten the effect lag of fiscal policy have produced new policy tools Some countries now use systems of taxes or subsidies to influence business investment within a relatively short time Attempts have also been made to reduce the effect lag in monetary policy Some countries have tried using various tools of credit rationing rather than relying on traditional measures such as open market operations But the effect lag is still a serious problem for monetary policy Perhaps the most serious unsolved problem of stabilization policy is the multiplicity of goals that policymakers must consider Every government has aims other than stabilizing the economy First it must stay in power a need that is likely to limit the alternatives open to stabilization policy particularly in periods of prosperity immediately before elections Second some monetary and fiscal actions impinge on particular groups in society and governments may wish to avoid what appear to be discriminatory policies Third a policy designed to achieve one element of stabilization such as full employment may prevent the achievement of another The conflict between full employment and price stability seems to arise in two different sets of circumstances Often wage increases that are made in the normal collective bargaining process are greater than the increases in labour productivity or output per man hour such wage increases tend to increase the cost of production and to force prices upward The government is then confronted with a choice between two unpleasant alternatives One is to allow the general price level to rise approximately in proportion to the increase in production costs the other alternative is to try to hold prices down by taking measures to restrict aggregate demand thus making it difficult for firms to shift their increased costs to the consumer through higher prices The latter alternative means increased unemployment Many governments have been confronted with exactly this choice of alternatives Wage gains made in collective bargaining have forced them to choose between allowing prices to move upward or attempting to hold prices stable at the cost of greater unemployment Another reason for the conflict between full employment and price stability is the tendency of wage increases to accelerate when the level of employment rises and the number of job vacancies increases In other words as the economy approaches full employment wages tend to rise at an increasing speed As prices begin to rise the conflict between full employment and price stability may be further exacerbated by the expectation that they will rise still further this may for example induce employees and their organizations to press for greater wage increases than they otherwise would in order to compensate for the expected price increases Another conflict in policy may arise with respect to the balance of payments When the economy is in a period of boom there is a tendency for imports to increase and sometimes for exports to decrease as well with obvious difficulties for the balance of payments The crisis may be heightened by short term capital movements if buyers and sellers of foreign exchange expect that there may be a devaluation of the country s currency This has caused much difficulty for many countries in the period since World War II In Britain and Denmark notably periods of boom have usually been accompanied by balance of payments problems When that occurs the government must sooner or later take restrictive actions that slow the economy down and increase unemployment if speculation in the currency is already under way it may be necessary to pursue the restrictive policy far into the next recession The problem is accentuated if there have been substantial price increases during the boom that have reduced the country s ability to compete with other countries It is ironic that a temporary improvement in the employment situation may if it leads to an accelerated increase in the price level serve to create greater unemployment in the future when restrictive actions become necessary for balance of payments reasons Attempts have been made to eliminate these conflicts of policy One remedy is incomes policy direct efforts by the government to prevent employers and unions from raising prices and wages Various methods have been tried The most moderate is the so called guideposts system under which the government announces the need for restraints on wage increases and perhaps also sets targets to guide unions and management this was attempted in the United States in the early 1960s In Sweden responsibility for limiting wage increases has been assigned to labour management organizations where bargaining takes place in a centralized fashion A more interventionist approach is for the government to enter the bargaining process and try to persuade unions to limit their wage demands The government may go still further and announce a wage freeze or even a system of wage and price control In the Netherlands the courts have occasionally been empowered to set wages but the resulting decisions have often been uncoordinated with the rest of stabilization policy Incomes policies have sometimes succeeded for short periods Generally however public refusal to accept the restraints has eventually led to their collapse In the United States the guideposts broke down during the boom of the mid 1960s and attempts at incomes policy in Sweden and Britain have not been notable for their success Even in the Netherlands later attempts to impose the system have failed to limit the rate of wage increase Governments have displayed serious deficiencies in their ability to handle stabilization policy Political leaders often lack economic information and understanding and their economic advisers find it difficult to explain the economic situation to them and to apprise them of the relevant tools There are also a variety of political inhibitions against taking action One consequence is that what is designed to be a countercyclical policy becomes a procyclical one instead of stabilizing the economy it tends to destabilize it The postwar experience in Britain is held by some to demonstrate the deficiencies of government in handling monetary and fiscal policy In time of boom the government often followed an expansionary course when a balance of payments crisis developed it then took restrictive action too late and pushed the economy into deeper recession than would otherwise have occurred On the basis of this experience some economists have argued that a policy that did not attempt to counter the short run swings in the economy would have been more successful in achieving stabilization They maintain that the authorities should concentrate on letting the volume of money and credit increase steadily at a rate dictated by the long term growth trend of the economy Those who hold this view believe that capitalist economies are inherently stable that crises are usually the result of bad policies on the part of the public authorities Most economists do not share their optimism as to the stability of the economy if left alone they continue to believe that governments must seek better tools for the purpose of short run stabilization The application of full employment policies after World War II was made more difficult by the fact that the postwar situation was radically different from that of the 1930s when much of the policy thinking had been done Most governments and their advisers expected a depression after the war but it never materialized One explanation is that the reallocation of resources from military to civilian uses proceeded more smoothly than expected Another explanation is that the consumers spent a larger part of their disposable income than they had been observed to do in the 1930s upsetting some of the statistical projections based on empirical data from those years A third explanation which applies perhaps to the years after 1948 was the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union which raised defense spending in many countries The period of the late 1940s and early 1950s proved to be characterized by tendencies to inflation rather than to unemployment Governments were slow to realize this and to shift their emphasis from employment creating policies to anti inflationary policies The fact that governments had accepted to a large extent the belief that monetary policy was not very important made it difficult for them to combat the tendencies to inflation In most countries a passive even expansionary monetary policy was in effect interest rates were kept down and the supply of money was allowed to grow faster than would have been consistent with stable prices Inflationary tendencies were further stimulated by the Korean War and the great increases in raw material prices that accompanied it During the 1950s several important developments influenced the attitudes of governments toward stabilization policy Most of the economic controls engendered by the war were removed particularly in international trade and finance The western European countries were in a period of rapid economic growth With the removal of direct controls on prices imports and building investment governments began to develop and refine the tools of monetary and fiscal policy In most countries the passive attitude toward monetary policy disappeared during the early 1950s there was increased interest in more flexible monetary management Interest also grew in developing a systematic fiscal policy that would offset the cyclical swings in production and employment The most energetic attempts to devise a countercyclical fiscal policy were made in Britain and Sweden Other European countries and the United States placed more reliance on monetary policy In the United States a contributing factor in the revival of monetary policy was a theoretical reformulation that took place among monetary and banking experts This was the so called availability theory of credit it held that monetary policy had its effect on spending not only directly through interest rates but also by restricting the general availability of credit and liquid funds It was argued that even rather small changes in the rate of interest for government securities could have a considerable impact on the supply of private credit if the supply diminished this would induce banks and other financial institutions to stiffen their credit standards and ration credit to their customers this in turn it was argued would tend to curb investment and thus have a braking effect on the economy Similar ideas were at work in other countries but with more emphasis on limiting the availability of credit through credit rationing loan ceilings control of private bond issues regulation of installment credit for the purchase of durable consumer goods and so on Serious attempts have been made to put a countercyclical monetary policy into practice in most advanced industrialized countries since the middle of the 1950s In some such as the United States the emphasis has been as suggested above on changes in the interest rate and in the supply of money and credit in others such as France Italy and Japan the emphasis has been on the rationing of credit by the central bank Fiscal policy has found less use than monetary policy in efforts to control cyclical fluctuations in the economy It has been most favoured in Britain the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands There are specific situations in which fiscal measures have been used to stimulate the economy in other countries as in Belgium and West Germany during the recessions of 1958 and 1962 Another example is the postponement of certain military expenditures in the United States as an anti inflationary measure during the boom of the mid 1950s and most notably the tax cuts passed by Congress in 1964 and 1981 as a stimulus to economic expansion Several countries have taken restrictive fiscal actions to overcome balance of payments crises including France and Finland on various occasions During the later 20th century there was an increasing tendency to employ fiscal policies in the short run partly in order to assist monetary policy in solving cyclical problems Our editors will review what you ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article ", "productivity": "Government spending even in a time of crisis is not an automatic boon for an economy s growth A body of empirical evidence shows that in practice government outlays designed to stimulate the economy may fall short of that goal In response to the financial crisis and its impact on the economy the federal government has increased government spending markedly in order to stimulate economic growth With billions of taxpayer dollars appropriated toward this effort policy makers should examine whether federal spending actually promotes economic growth Although the studies are not all consistent historical evidence suggests an undesirable long run effect from government spending it crowds out private sector spending and uses money in unproductive ways Policy makers should use the best literature available to analyze government spending designed to spur growth for the likelihood of achieving that effect Where the assumptions or data are uncertain the analysis should fully explore the potential consequences of different assumptions or different potential values for the uncertain data Proponents of government spending claim that it provides public goods that markets generally do not such as military defense enforcement of contracts and police services 1 Standard economic theory holds that individuals have little incentive to provide these types of goods because others tend to use them without paying John Maynard Keynes one of the most significant economists of the 20th century advocated government spending even if government has to run a deficit to conduct such spending 2 He hypothesized that when the economy is in a downturn and unemployment of labor and capital is high governments can spend money to create jobs and employ capital that have been unemployed or underutilized Keynes s theory has been one of the implicit rationales for the current federal stimulus spending it is needed to boost economic output and promote growth 3These views of spending assume that government knows exactly which goods and services are underutilized which public goods will be value added and where to redirect resources However there is no information source that allows the government to know where goods and services can be most productively employed 4 Federal spending is less likely to stimulate growth when it cannot accurately target the projects where it would be most productive In addition to this information problem the political process itself can stunt economic growth For example Professor Emeritus of Law at George Mason University Gordon Tullock suggests that politicians and bureaucrats try to gain control of as much of the economy as possible 5 Moreover demand for government resources by the private sector leads to misallocation of resources through rent seeking the process by which industries and individuals lobby the government for money Rather than spend money where it is most needed legislators instead allocate money to favored groups 6 Though this may yield a high political return for incumbents seeking reelection this process does not favor economic growth The data support the theory A 1974 paper by Stanford s Gavin Wright found that political attempts to maximize votes explained between 59 and 80 percent of the difference in per capita federal spending to the states during the Great Depression 7 Ultimately spending under the Democratic Congress and the president was much more concentrated in Western states where elections were much tighter than in the Democratically controlled South Wright s analysis indicates that instead of allocating spending based purely on economic need during a crisis the party in power may distribute funding based on the prospect of political returns Proponents of government spending often point to the fiscal multiplier as a way that spending can fuel growth The multiplier is a factor by which some measure of economy wide output such as GDP increases in response to a given amount of government spending According to the multiplier theory an initial burst of government spending trickles through the economy and is re spent over and over again thus growing the economy A multiplier of 1 0 implies that if government created a project that hired 100 people it would put exactly 100 100 x 1 0 people into the workforce A multiplier larger than 1 implies more employment and a number smaller than 1 implies a net job loss In its 2009 assessment of the job effects of the stimulus plan the incoming Obama administration used a multiplier estimate of approximately 1 5 for government spending for most quarters This would mean that for every dollar of government stimulus spending GDP would increase by one and a half dollars 8 In practice however unproductive government spending is likely to have a smaller multiplier effect In a September 2009 National Bureau of Economic Research NBER paper Harvard economists Robert Barro and Charles Redlick estimated that the multiplier from government defense spending reaches 1 0 at high levels of unemployment but is less than 1 0 at lower unemployment rates Non defense spending may have an even smaller multiplier effect 9Another recent study corroborates this finding NBER economist Valerie A Ramey estimates a spending multiplier range from 0 6 to 1 1 10 Barro and Ramey s multiplier figures far lower than the Obama administration estimates indicate that government spending may actually decrease economic growth possibly due to inefficient use of money Taxes finance government spending therefore an increase in government spending increases the tax burden on citizens either now or in the future which leads to a reduction in private spending and investment This effect is known as crowding out In addition to crowding out private spending government outlays may also crowd out interest sensitive investment 11 Government spending reduces savings in the economy thus increasing interest rates This can lead to less investment in areas such as home building and productive capacity which includes the facilities and infrastructure used to contribute to the economy s output An NBER paper that analyzes a panel of OECD countries found that government spending also has a strong negative correlation with business investment 12 Conversely when governments cut spending there is a surge in private investment Robert Barro discusses some of the major papers on this topic that find a negative correlation between government spending and GDP growth 13 Additionally in a study of 76 countries the University of Vienna s Dennis C Mueller and George Mason University s Thomas Stratmann found a statistically significant negative correlation between government size and economic growth 14Though a large portion of the literature finds no positive correlation between government spending and economic growth some empirical studies have For example a 1993 paper by economists William Easterly and Sergio Rebelo looked at empirical data from approximately 100 countries from 1970 1988 and found a positive correlation between general government investment and GDP growth 15This lack of consensus in the empirical findings indicates the inherent difficulties with measuring such correlations in a complex economy However despite the lack of empirical consensus the theoretical literature indicates that government spending is unlikely to be as productive for economic growth as simply leaving the money in the private sector In 2009 Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act which authorized 787 billion in spending to promote job growth and bolster economic activity 16 The budgetary consequences of this legislation and other government spending initiatives aimed at improving the economic outlook for the federal budget can readily be seen in recent federal outlays As seen in figure 1 total federal outlays have risen steadily over time and a sharp increase occurred after 2007 As seen in figure 2 total federal spending as a percentage of GDP has risen sharply in the last two years to nearly 30 percent As explained above this spending may have countervailing effects that could actually hamper economic growth by crowding out private investment Government spending even in a time of crisis is not an automatic boon for an economy s growth A body of empirical evidence shows that in practice government outlays designed to stimulate the economy may fall short of that goal Such findings have serious consequences as the United States embarks on a massive government spending initiative Before it approves any additional spending to boost growth the government should use the best peer reviewed literature to estimate whether such spending is likely to stimulate growth and report how much uncertainty surrounds those estimates These analyses should be made available to the public for comment prior to enacting this kind of legislation 1 Richard E Wagner Fiscal Sociology and the Theory of Public Finance An Explanatory Essay Cheltenham Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd

Discounted ValueAppendix D The Expenditure Output ModelChapter 20 Economic GrowthSustained long term economic growth comes from increases in worker productivity which essentially means how well we do things In other words how efficient is your nation with its time and workers Labor productivity is the value that each employed person creates per unit of his or her input The easiest way to comprehend labor productivity is to imagine a Canadian worker who can make 10 loaves of bread in an hour versus a U S worker who in the same hour can make only two loaves of bread In this fictional example the Canadians are more productive Being more productive essentially means you can do more in the same amount of time This in turn frees up resources to be used elsewhere What determines how productive workers are The answer is pretty intuitive The first determinant of labor productivity is human capital Human capital is the accumulated knowledge from education and experience skills and expertise that the average worker in an economy possesses Typically the higher the average level of education in an economy the higher the accumulated human capital and the higher the labor productivity The second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change Technological change is a combination of invention advances in knowledge and innovation which is putting that advance to use in a new product or service For example the transistor was invented in 1947 It allowed us to miniaturize the footprint of electronic devices and use less power than the tube technology that came before it Innovations since then have produced smaller and better transistors that that are ubiquitous in products as varied as smart phones computers and escalators The development of the transistor has allowed workers to be anywhere with smaller devices These devices can be used to communicate with other workers measure product quality or do any other task in less time improving worker productivity The third factor that determines labor productivity is economies of scale Recall that economies of scale are the cost advantages that industries obtain due to size Read more about economies of scale in Cost and Industry Structure Consider again the case of the fictional Canadian worker who could produce 10 loaves of bread in an hour If this difference in productivity was due only to economies of scale it could be that Canadian workers had access to a large industrial size oven while the U S worker was using a standard residential size oven Now that we have explored the determinants of worker productivity let s turn to how economists measure economic growth and productivity To analyze the sources of economic growth it is useful to think about a production function which is the process of turning economic inputs like labor machinery and raw materials into outputs like goods and services used by consumers A microeconomic production function describes the inputs and outputs of a firm or perhaps an industry In macroeconomics the connection from inputs to outputs for the entire economy is called an aggregate production function Economists construct different production functions depending on the focus of their studies Figure 1 presents two examples of aggregate production functions In the first production function shown in Figure 1 a the output is GDP The inputs in this example are workforce human capital physical capital and technology We discuss these inputs further in the module Components of Economic Growth An economy s rate of productivity growth is closely linked to the growth rate of its GDP per capita although the two are not identical For example if the percentage of the population who holds jobs in an economy increases GDP per capita will increase but the productivity of individual workers may not be affected Over the long term the only way that GDP per capita can grow continually is if the productivity of the average worker rises or if there are complementary increases in capital A common measure of U S productivity per worker is dollar value per hour the worker contributes to the employer s output This measure excludes government workers because their output is not sold in the market and so their productivity is hard to measure It also excludes farming which accounts for only a relatively small share of the U S economy Figure 2 shows an index of output per hour with 2009 as the base year when the index equals 100 The index equaled about 106 in 2014 In 1972 the index equaled 50 which shows that workers have more than doubled their productivity since then According to the Department of Labor U S productivity growth was fairly strong in the 1950s but then declined in the 1970s and 1980s before rising again in the second half of the 1990s and the first half of the 2000s In fact the rate of productivity measured by the change in output per hour worked averaged 3 2 per year from 1950 to 1970 dropped to 1 9 per year from 1970 to 1990 and then climbed back to over 2 3 from 1991 to the present with another modest slowdown after 2001 Figure 3 shows average annual rates of productivity growth averaged over time since 1950 In recent years a controversy has been brewing among economists about the resurgence of U S productivity in the second half of the 1990s One school of thought argues that the United States had developed a new economy based on the extraordinary advances in communications and information technology of the 1990s The most optimistic proponents argue that it would generate higher average productivity growth for decades to come The pessimists on the other hand argue that even five or ten years of stronger productivity growth does not prove that higher productivity will last for the long term It is hard to infer anything about long term productivity trends during the later part of the 2000s because the steep recession of 2008 2009 with its sharp but not completely synchronized declines in output and employment complicates any interpretation While productivity growth was high in 2009 and 2010 around 3 it has slowed down since then Productivity growth is also closely linked to the average level of wages Over time the amount that firms are willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce If a few employers tried to pay their workers less than what those workers produced then those workers would receive offers of higher wages from other profit seeking employers If a few employers mistakenly paid their workers more than what those workers produced those employers would soon end up with losses In the long run productivity per hour is the most important determinant of the average wage level in any economy To learn how to compare economies in this regard follow the steps in the following Work It Out feature The Organization for Economic Co operation and Development OECD tracks data on the annual growth rate of real GDP per hour worked You can find these data on the OECD data webpage Labour productivity growth in the total economy at this website Step 1 Visit the OECD website given above and select two countries to compare Step 2 On the drop down menu Variable select Real GDP Annual Growth in percent and record the data for the countries you have chosen for the five most recent years Step 3 Go back to the drop down menu and select Real GDP per Hour Worked Annual Growth Rate in percent and select data for the same years for which you selected GDP data Step 4 Compare real GDP growth for both countries Table 2 provides an example of a comparison between Australia and Belgium Step 5 Consider the many factors can affect growth For example one factor that may have affected Australia is its isolation from Europe which may have insulated the country from the effects of the global recession In Belgium s case the global recession seems to have had an impact on both GDP and real GDP per hours worked between 2009 and 2013 though productivity does seem to be recovering Nothing is more important for people s standard of living than sustained economic growth Even small changes in the rate of growth when sustained and compounded over long periods of time make an enormous difference in the standard of living Consider Table 3 in which the rows of the table show several different rates of growth in GDP per capita and the columns show different periods of time Assume for simplicity that an economy starts with a GDP per capita of 100 The table then applies the following formula to calculate what GDP will be at the given growth rate in the future For example an economy that starts with a GDP of 100 and grows at 3 per year will reach a GDP of 209 after 25 years that is 100 1 03 25 209 The slowest rate of GDP per capita growth in the table just 1 per year is similar to what the United States experienced during its weakest years of productivity growth The second highest rate 3 per year is close to what the U S economy experienced during the strong economy of the late 1990s and into the 2000s Higher rates of per capita growth such as 5 or 8 per year represent the experience of rapid growth in economies like Japan Korea and China Table 3 shows that even a few percentage points of difference in economic growth rates will have a profound effect if sustained and compounded over time For example an economy growing at a 1 annual rate over 50 years will see its GDP per capita rise by a total of 64 from 100 to 164 in this example However a country growing at a 5 annual rate will see almost the same amount of growth from 100 to 163 over just 10 years Rapid rates of economic growth can bring profound transformation See the following Clear It Up feature on the relationship between compound growth rates and compound interest rates If the rate of growth is 8 young adults starting at age 20 will see the average standard of living in their country more than double by the time they reach age 30 and grow nearly sevenfold by the time they reach age 45 The formula for growth rates of GDP over different periods of time as shown in Figure 2 is exactly the same as the formula for how a given amount of financial savings grows at a certain interest rate over time as presented in Choice in a World of Scarcity Both formulas have the same ingredients Recall that compound interest is interest that is earned on past interest It causes the total amount of financial savings to grow dramatically over time Similarly compound rates of economic growth or the compound growth rate means that the rate of growth is being multiplied by a base that includes past GDP growth with dramatic effects over time For example in 2013 the World Fact Book produced by the Central Intelligence Agency reported that South Korea had a GDP of 1 67 trillion with a growth rate of 2 8 We can estimate that at that growth rate South Korea s GDP will be 1 92 trillion in five years If we apply the growth rate to each year s ending GDP for the next five years we will calculate that at the end of year one GDP is 1 72 trillion In year two we start with the end of year one value of 1 67 and increase it by 2 Year three starts with the end of year two GDP and we increase it by 2 and so on as depicted in the Table 4 Another way to calculate the growth rate is to apply the following formula Where future value is the value of GDP five years hence present value is the starting GDP amount of 1 64 trillion g is the growth rate of 2 and n is the number of periods for which we are calculating growth Productivity the value of what is produced per worker or per hour worked can be measured as the level of GDP per worker or GDP per hour The United States experienced a productivity slowdown between 1973 and 1989 Since then U S productivity has rebounded the current global recession notwithstanding It is not clear whether the current growth in productivity will be sustained The rate of productivity growth is the primary determinant of an economy s rate of long term economic growth and higher wages Over decades and generations seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita An aggregate production function specifies how certain inputs in the economy like human capital physical capital and technology lead to the output measured as GDP per capita Compound interest and compound growth rates behave in the same way as productivity rates Seemingly small changes in percentage points can have big impacts on income over time Answers to Self Check Questions20 2 Labor Productivity and Economic Growth by Rice University is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4 0

are critical to achieving economic growth Tax rate cuts may encourage individuals to work save and invest but if the tax cuts are not financed by immediate spending cuts they will likely also result in an increased federal budget deficit which in the long term will reduce national saving and raise interest rates The net impact on growth is uncertain but many estimates suggest it is either small or negative Base broadening measures can eliminate the effect of tax rate cuts on budget deficits but at the same time they reduce the impact on labor supply saving and investment and thus reduce the direct impact on growth They may also reallocate resources across sectors toward their highest value economic use resulting in increased efficiency and potentially raising the overall size of the economy Results in the literature suggest that not all tax changes will have the same impact on growth Reforms that improve incentives reduce existing distortionary subsidies avoid windfall gains and avoid deficit financing will have more auspicious effects on the long term size of the economy but may also create trade offs between equity and efficiency Policy makers and researchers have long been interested in how potential changes to the personal income tax system affect the size of the overall economy In 2014 for example Representative Dave Camp R MI proposed a sweeping reform to the income tax system that would reduce rates greatly pare back subsidies in the tax code and maintain revenue levels and the distribution of tax burdens across income classes Committee on Ways and Means 2014 In this paper we focus on how tax changes affect economic growth We focus on two types of tax changes reductions in individual income tax rates and income tax reform We define the latter as changes that broaden the income tax base and reduce statutory income tax rates but nonetheless maintain the overall revenue levels and the distribution of tax burdens implied by the current income system Our focus is on individual income tax reform leaving consideration of reforms to the corporate income tax for which see Toder and Viard 2014 and reforms that focus on consumption taxes for other analyses By economic growth we mean expansion of the supply side of the economy and of potential Gross Domestic Product GDP This expansion could be an increase in the annual growth rate a one time increase in the size of the economy that does not affect the future growth rate but puts the economy on a higher growth path or both Our focus on the supply side of the economy in the long run is in contrast to the short term phenomenon also called economic growth by which a boost in aggregate demand in a slack economy can raise GDP and help align actual GDP with potential GDP The importance of the topics addressed here derive from the income tax s central role in revenue generation its impact on the distribution of after tax income and its effects on a wide variety of economic activities The importance is only heightened by concerns about the long term economic growth rate Gordon 2016 Summers 2014 and concerns about the long term fiscal status of the federal government Auerbach and Gale 2016 We find that while there is no doubt that tax policy can influence economic choices it is by no means obvious on an ex ante basis that tax rate cuts will ultimately lead to a larger economy in the long run While rate cuts would raise the after tax return to working saving and investing they would also raise the after tax income people receive from their current level of activities which lessens their need to work save and invest The first effect normally raises economic activity through so called substitution effects while the second effect normally reduces it through so called income effects Related T On The Record The Pros and Cons of a Consumption Tax Len Burman and William G Gale Thursday March 3 2005 G Op Ed Good Reasons for Taxes Diane Lim Rogers Sunday April 16 2006 Taxation Effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act A preliminary analysis William G Gale Hilary Gelfond Aaron Krupkin Mark Mazur and Eric Toder Thursday June 14 2018The financing of tax cuts significantly affects its impact on long term growth Tax cuts financed by immediate cuts in unproductive government spending could raise output but tax cuts financed by reductions in government investment could reduce output If they are not financed by spending cuts tax cuts will lead to an increase in federal borrowing which in turn will reduce long term growth The historical evidence and simulation analyses suggest that tax cuts that are financed by debt for an extended period of time will have little positive impact on long term growth and could reduce growth Tax reform is more complex as it involves tax rate cuts as well as base broadening changes There is a theoretical presumption that such changes should raise the overall size of the economy in the long term though the effect and magnitude of the impact are subject to considerable uncertainty One fact that often escapes unnoticed is that broadening the tax base by reducing or eliminating tax expenditures raises the effective tax rate that people and firms face and hence will operate in that regard in a direction opposite to rate cuts and mitigate their effects on economic growth But base broadening has the additional benefit of reallocating resources from sectors that are currently tax preferred to sectors that have the highest economic pre tax return which should increase the overall size of the economy A fair assessment would conclude that well designed tax policies have the potential to raise economic growth but there are many stumbling blocks along the way and certainly no guarantee that all tax changes will improve economic performance Given the various channels through which tax policy affects growth a tax change will be more growth inducing to the extent that it involves i large positive incentive substitution effects that encourage work saving and investment ii small or negative income effects including a careful targeting of tax cuts toward new economic activity rather than providing windfall gains for previous activities iii reductions in distortions across economic sectors and across different types of income and consumption and iv minimal increases in or reductions in the budget deficit

as follows Section II provides a conceptual framework by discussing the channels through which tax changes can affect economic performance including the many ways in which a positive substitution effect in response to a tax rate cut might be dissipated or even reversed by other factors Section III provides an empirical starting point We show that growth rates over long periods of time in the United States have not changed in tandem with the massive changes in the structure and revenue yield of the tax system that have occurred We also report findings from Piketty Saez and Stantcheva 2014 that across advanced countries even large changes in the top marginal income tax rate over time do not appear to be strongly correlated with rates of growth Section IV explores empirical evidence on taxes and growth from studies of major income tax changes in the United States Consistent with the discussion in Section III the studies find little evidence that tax cuts or tax reform since 1980 have impacted the long term growth rate significantly Section V examines the new narrative approach to identifying tax changes that are exogenous to current economic conditions stemming from the seminal work of Romer and Romer 2010 The literature which generally uses vector autoregression VAR models finds that tax cuts that meet the exogeneity criteria raise short term output and other economic activity The narrative literature does not speak to the long term effects though Section VI discusses the results from the literature on simulation models which has generated two main results First debt financed tax cuts will tend to boost short term growth as in standard Keynesian models and in the literature using the narrative approach but also tend to reduce long term growth if they are financed eventually by higher taxes Second revenue neutral income tax reform can provide a modest boost to economic growth Section VII concludes 1Authors William G Gale The Arjay and Frances

2017Download PDFPress releaseThe United States economy has suffered from two glaring macroeconomic problems over the past decade The first is a severe and chronic shortfall of spending by households businesses and governments relative to the economy s productive potential or a shortfall of aggregate demand This demand shortfall has kept growth in both jobs and wages too slow The second problem is a rapid deceleration in the pace of productivity growth Productivity is the amount of income or output generated in an average hour of work in the economy Productivity growth in turn provides the potential ceiling on how fast average income can rise These are both serious problems and policymakers should be concerned with each One policy instrument that can address both is a large sustained increase in infrastructure investment Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump mentioned infrastructure investment as an economic priority during their presidential campaigns last year so there is some hope that proposals to boost this investment could have bipartisan support This brief assesses the effectiveness of an increase in the nation s investment effort in infrastructure as a means to close the aggregate demand shortfall as well as a means to boost productivity growth Its key findings are There is no fixed definition of what infrastructure investment includes Generally however it includes capital investments in transportation utilities and environmental projects Sometimes investments in the construction and maintenance of schools and hospitals are included in measures of infrastructure investment A defining feature of infrastructure investment in the United States is the prominent public role in investment Public funds directly finance more than half of infrastructure investment in the United States and even private infrastructure investments often receive substantial direct or indirect public subsidies including tax breaks CBO 2008 2015 Infrastructure investment that is publicly owned is often referred to as the public capital stock This capital stock is simply the roads buildings bridges ports utilities airports and other structures and equipment that are financed by public funds and whose ultimate owners are governments There are a number of compelling rationales for such a strong public role in infrastructure provision Many of the capital projects undertaken for infrastructure investment would result in a natural monopoly For example once the enormous upfront effort of building a new highway is made the marginal cost of allowing an extra car on it is trivial This provides an entry barrier to any profit seeking economic agent thinking about building a competing highway Given the resulting monopoly a strong public role in either the provision or regulation of the sector is necessary to promote economic efficiency Further many of the spillover benefits of infrastructure investments are hard to precisely allocate to individual economic agents For example the construction of a dam provides benefits to farmers homeowners who are protected from floods fishermen who can use the reservoirs and so on This makes charging precise fees based on the use of infrastructure difficult and it argues that the public benefits of infrastructure should simply be paid for with public funds Finally some infrastructure investment provides services that society has decided should be available to all as basic rights safe drinking water for example even if some customers are not profitable to serve for a strictly private entity In 2014 federal state and local governments combined spent 416 billion just on transportation and water infrastructure projects 1 The federal government spent 96 billion of that and state and local governments spent 320 billion The federal role is strongest in new capital spending as opposed to operation and maintenance Nearly 40 percent of all state and local capital spending on transportation and water infrastructure is financed by grants from the federal government In addition federal revenues foregone by providing tax exemptions for bond financing of infrastructure projects averages roughly 30 billion annually In short governments at all levels but particularly the federal government are big players every year in infrastructure investment Overall spending on infrastructure as a share of gross domestic product GDP has been in long term decline Figure A shows a broad measure of infrastructure investment as a share of the nation s potential GDP The first lower line shows public investment in water and transportation The second higher line includes public investments in the construction of educational and hospital structures as well as investments in conservation development

to keep the quality of infrastructure intact Figure B shows two measures of transportation and water infrastructure taken from a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office CBO One deflates the transportation spending by the overall deflator for gross domestic product while the other deflates it by an infrastructure specific deflator The latter measure which more accurately reflects the

2015Copy the code below to embed this chart on your website Given the large role the federal government plays in providing resources for infrastructure investment and given that this investment effort has fallen in recent decades recent calls to boost the rate of infrastructure investment would seem to have prima facie merit The rest of this paper highlights the near term and long term potential benefits from an increased federal infrastructure investment effort Since the Great Recession began increased infrastructure investment has been suggested as a primary tool to restore the economy to full health Infrastructure was not part of the first stimulus package meant to fight the Great Recession the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 despite some calls for it to be included Mishel Eisenbrey and Irons 2008 The rationale at the time for excluding infrastructure was that stimulus must be timely targeted and temporary Elmendorf and Furman 2008 Infrastructure investment apparently violated the timely part of this mantra policymakers were worried that the recession would come and go so fast and that recovery would be so quick that the economy would be back at full health before meaningful infrastructure investments could be mobilized Some of this logic even persisted with the writing of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ARRA which had a smaller infrastructure component than is commonly recognized only about 15 percent of total spending in ARRA was on infrastructure CEA 2010 The debates surrounding ARRA and infrastructure often centered on whether or not enough viable infrastructure projects were shovel ready meaning again that policymakers worried that infrastructure investment could not be mobilized quickly enough to help the economy while it was still in its unrecovered state Given that unemployment in 2016 was still significantly higher 4 9 percent than its 4 6 percent average in 2006 and 2007 the years immediately preceding the Great Recession this fear was obviously not well founded Infrastructure projects started in 2008 2009 or even in 2013 could have helped the economic recovery Even as of March 2017 many measures of economic slack indicate that the economy could benefit from a boost in aggregate demand The share of prime age age 25 54 adults who were employed for example was 1 4 percentage points lower in March 2017 than the average share in 2006 and 2007 This may not sound like a lot but this translates into roughly 1 9 million workers just in this age group who need to find jobs before the economy can be declared as having returned to pre Great Recession health The clearest evidence that demand growth remains too slow relative to the economy s potential capacity is the unusually slow growth of nominal wages this deep into a recovery Despite unemployment in March 2017 essentially matching its 2007 average nominal wage growth for production and supervisory workers for the year ending in March 2017 was 2 3 percent In 2007 this wage growth was 4 0 percent This sluggish wage growth has in turn made it hard for the Federal Reserve to maintain price inflation at their 2 percent target Finally the agonizingly slow recovery from the Great Recession and the anemic economic recovery and expansion following the 2001 recession even as it was aided by an enormous housing market bubble have raised fears that the shortfall in aggregate demand relative to the economy s productive capacity could be a chronic problem moving forward This problem often referred to somewhat confusingly as secular stagnation suggests that macroeconomic policy including fiscal policy will need to adopt a more expansionary stance in the future see Krugman 2013 and Summers 2016 on this point So far the lessons of these analyses have not been heeded For example fiscal policy has not been more expansionary during the recovery from the Great Recession relative to past recoveries In fact the recovery from the Great Recession has seen the most austere path of spending during any post World War II recovery a fact that explains most of the recovery s slowness Bivens 2016 A renewed push to increase infrastructure investment could move fiscal policy from being a drag on growth to being a boost to growth in coming years Perhaps relevant to upcoming fiscal policy debates infrastructure investment is routinely estimated to be a much more efficient fiscal stimulus than almost any form of tax cut and it is significantly more efficient than those tax cuts whose benefits fall mostly on high income households To determine relative efficiency we look at the additional economic output generated by each 1 added to the federal budget deficit from a given fiscal policy intervention Table 1 provides a range of comparisons of various types of fiscal policy interventions Many of these are taken from the research literature that existed before ARRA Since then most research on fiscal stimulus undertaken when monetary policy is accommodating has found even higher multipliers most famously perhaps in Blanchard and Leigh 2013 But the relative ranking of various fiscal policy interventions has largely been confirmed 2To give a quick sense of the employment consequences of infrastructure investment in the near term note that an output multiplier of 1 5 means that each 100 billion in infrastructure spending would boost GDP by 150 billion This increase in GDP would in turn boost employment by a bit over 1 million workers see Bivens 2011 for the relationships between output and employment Note The bang for the buck is estimated by the one year dollar change in gross domestic product GDP for a given dollar reduction in federal tax revenue or increase in spending Multiplier indicates how much total output GDP changes in response to a 1 increase in deficit resulting from the fiscal policy change Source Zandi 2010 Table 4Copy the code below to embed this chart on your website The primary virtue of infrastructure investment as fiscal stimulus is that it is spent Tax cuts and even direct transfer payments can be saved by households Because transfer payments tend to be directed toward low income and hence cash constrained households they tend to not be saved and hence rival infrastructure investment as stimulus But infrastructure investment is guaranteed always and everywhere to be spent Since 2008 research on the causal effect of infrastructure spending on short run output and employment has been bolstered by the examination of large exogenous fiscal events the large fiscal boost provided by ARRA in the United States the large but quite variable fiscal contraction undertaken by countries in the European Union EU and anti corruption efforts in Italy Acconcia Corsetti and Simonelli 2014 examine the fiscal shock that occurs in Italian provinces when public construction projects are halted in response to findings of Mafia involvement A law issued to combat public corruption provides for forceful and sudden halts to construction activity when local police find evidence of Mafia involvement This provides an exogenous shock to fiscal spending that can be linked to subsequent changes in economic output Such exogeneity is needed in studies of fiscal stimulus because of the ever present possibility of two way causality fiscal changes can affect economic growth but economic growth can also in theory affect fiscal changes Using this high quality instrument that isolates exogenous fiscal changes i e fiscal changes uncorrelated with changes in economic output Acconcia Corsetti and Simonelli 2014 estimate multipliers on public investment of between 1 5 and 1 9 Blanchard and Leigh 2013 examine the large but varied fiscal adjustments undertaken by EU members in response to the Euro crisis of 2009 2010 They regress the fiscal adjustments against the predicted pace of output growth in the next two years 2011 and 2012 They find a systematic and negative relationship between the fiscal adjustments and the forecast error of subsequent output growth suggesting that fiscal multipliers are substantially larger than forecasters assumed a priori They interpret their results as indicating an overall fiscal multiplier of 1 5 They also find that spending adjustments matter more than revenue adjustments in restraining output growth Jovanovic 2017 extends Blanchard and Leigh s 2013 results by examining the fiscal adjustment in government consumption and government investment separately They find that reductions in government investment have significantly larger negative effects on subsequent output growth than reductions in consumption spending Finally Leduc and Wilson 2014 and Wilson 2012 assess the impact of increased infrastructure spending under ARRA Wilson 2012 uses the fact that much of the ARRA highway spending across states was allocated according to formulas that were exogenous to economic conditions for example miles of highway lanes per resident or the share of youth in each state s population Wilson s preferred estimate indicates that each 125 000 in announced highway spending was associated with one added job If this highway spending created jobs across economic sectors in exact proportion to existing employment shares this would be consistent with an output multiplier of 1 3 If instead employment generated by this spending were more concentrated in higher productivity sectors it would be consistent with a larger output multiplier Figure C shows the trajectory of employment from December 2007 to June 2011 in the highest fifth of states ranked by ARRA highway funds versus the lowest fifth of states Employment fell less stabilized sooner and began growing more rapidly in states that saw a larger influx of ARRA funds The data below can be saved

Bivens 2017 notes that recent rapid decelerations in productivity growth are likely symptoms of the extended period of slack between aggregate demand and the economy s productive capacity that characterized the post 2007 period Productivity is a measure of average income or output generated in an hour of work in the economy One key determinant of productivity growth is capital deepening supplying the economy s workforce with more and better tools For example as construction workers moved from working with shovels and pickaxes to working with cranes and earthmovers productivity growth in that sector naturally increased A key reason for the rapid deceleration of productivity growth in recent years has been a long period of weak private investment As labor markets normalize and begin putting upward pressure on wage growth there is strong reason to believe that firms will begin searching harder for ways to reduce upward labor cost pressure and will begin investing in labor saving capital and technology Figure D replicates a table from Bivens 2017 showing the relationship between lagged values of real compensation growth and private fixed investment It shows a strong positive

series Table 1 16 and unpublished data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Total Economy Productivity databaseCopy the code below to embed this chart on your website By taking up the last of any remaining demand slack an increase in infrastructure investment could have an immediate effect in restoring productivity growth to more normal levels More importantly there remains a strong economic rationale for investing in infrastructure even after the economy reaches and settles into full employment Much of the nation s capital stock is comprised of public capital Highways airports dams sewer systems and utilities are all necessary inputs for private production but they are largely supplied with public funds When the public capital stock is allowed to degrade through lack of investment this could in theory lead to slower private sector productivity growth Before delving into evidence assessing this effect however it is important to note that improving private sector productivity is just one reason to support expanded public investment If for example public investment had no impact at all on private sector productivity but allowed public goods to be delivered more efficiently there would be a benefit If we were to receive clean water and air safe food and medicine and transportation services for less money than we spend currently this would be a perfectly fine way to enjoy the economic returns to expanded public investment even if they do not boost private sector productivity Further the possibility that the benefits of public investment are more broadly shared than the benefits of private sector investment constitutes another compelling reason to support it While studies examining the link between inequality and public investment are few several methodologically sound papers have suggested that countries with larger public capital stocks tend to have greater equality of incomes see for example Calder n and Serv n 2004 This should not be a shock by its nature public capital is more broadly based in its ownership than private capital in the United States the wealthiest 1 percent of households own more than 40 percent of private wealth and so its benefits should be more broadly distributed Getachew 2008 Finally it should be remembered that many possible benefits of public investment may not show up as increases in cash incomes Clean water and air and shorter commute times provide clear economic benefits but these benefits do not generally show up in measurable cash incomes Serious research on the productivity of public investment was begun almost singlehandedly by David Aschauer in a series of papers in the late 1980s and early 1990s see Aschauer 1989 1990 for two of these The Aschauer findings were generally based on a time series estimation of public investment in the theoretical context of an aggregate production function model Aschauer 1989 estimated these aggregate production functions augmented with public capital stocks an innovation relative to much empirical growth literature and found that the elasticity of private sector output with respect to public capital was between 0 24 and 0 36 The implication of this finding was that the rate of return to public capital was roughly three times higher than that of private capital Aschauer s work was buttressed by that of Munnell 1990 1992 who would later become an undersecretary for the Treasury under President Clinton as well as by the work of Holtz Eakin 1988 and Lynde and Richmond 1992 1993 However the approach pioneered by Aschauer soon came under criticism from a variety of angles Critics of the time series component particularly Aaron 1990 and Gramlich 1994 argued that the link between public capital and productivity suffered from problems of both causality and simultaneity The causality criticism is that faster output growth may simply allow for stepped up investments in public capital rather than increased public investment driving faster output growth The simultaneity criticism is that neither public investment nor productivity is a stationary time series and therefore the simple regression of one upon the other may yield an apparent relationship that is in reality spurious That is maybe both series just happened to be rising over time and the correlation between the two simply reflected these contemporaneous trends without indicating an actual economic relationship between the series One suggested econometric fix for the problem of simultaneity is the transformation of the public capital and productivity data into first differences essentially looking at the year over year change in each series While this transformation does produce two stationary series and is hence a plausible statistical fix Munnell 1992 correctly points out that this fix does not allow one to examine long run relationships between public capital formation and productivity growth and that the economic hypothesis of the relationship between the two which is indeed a long run relationship hence cannot be tested if this particular statistical fix is adopted Given that most empirical growth studies are concerned exactly with such long run relationships this makes the first differencing fix fatal to the project of fairly assessing the impact of public capital investments on growth The simultaneity problem is most clearly addressed by Heintz 2010 who uses more advanced econometric techniques specifically a vector error correction model to search for a cointegrating relationship between the two series A cointegrating relationship exists between two nonstationary time series if some linear combination of them is stationary Heintz 2010 confirms that a cointegrating relationship does exist between public capital and private productivity and uses this relationship to estimate a statistically and economically significant long run relationship between public capital stocks and private productivity Heintz 2010 and Everaert and Heylen 2001 also point out that solving the simultaneity problem through error correction models largely solves the causality problem along the way Specifically Heintz allows for the level of public capital to affect both the level and the change in private output He finds a statistically significant relationship between the level of public capital and the change in private productivity If however the direction of causality actually ran from greater private productivity to larger public capital stocks then there should be no such relationship between the level of public capital and the change of productivity Table 2 shows regression results from replicating Heintz s 2010 methodology with more up to date data Data and methods are described in detail in the technical appendix The dependent variable is the ratio of private sector output to capital stock while the coefficient of interest is the lagged ratio of public to private capital For a timespan that mirrors Heintz s 1949 to 2007 we find a coefficient on infrastructure capital of 0 16 quite close to his 0 2 For the period from 1949 2015 i e including more recent years than were available to Heintz the coefficient is essentially the same 0 147 However the 1950s saw a more rapid pace of infrastructure investment than what came thereafter largely due to the construction of the interstate highway system To test whether or not the infrastructure productivity association is driven by this one time burst of spending we look only at the 1959 period Again the coefficient is essentially unchanged The coefficient values imply that a 10 percent increase in the public capital stock boosts private sector output by 1 5 2 percent To provide a more intuitive interpretation one can multiply this coefficient by the current ratio of private to public capital stocks to get the extra output obtained from each 1 increase in the public capital stock This also corresponds tightly to the rate of return to public investment that is often noted in the literature For the results from Table 2 this implied rate of return is very large hovering between 30 and 40 percent Notes The dependent variable is the change in private sector productivity measured as the ratio of private sector output to private sector capital stock Data and methods are discussed in the technical appendix T statistics are in brackets Three

the distribution of their findings focusing strictly on 33 studies they survey that generate estimates of the rate of return to public investment in the United States The results range from 19 percent to 73 percent The average rate of return is 16 7 percent and the median is 12 8 percent If one excludes the top three and bottom three estimates the average return drops slightly to 14 5 percent

examined by Bom and Ligthart 2014 is substantially larger than the gross rate of return used by CBO in its assessment of the macroeconomic effect of federal investment CBO 2016 Thus it seems that CBO estimates of the benefits of public investment particularly infrastructure investment are too low given the other evidence in this literature Finally another striking feature of these estimates are how consistently they tend to rise over time as more up to date data and research methods are used The studies are aligned on the horizontal axis chronologically and the pattern of more recent studies yielding higher estimated rates of return is clearly visible in the chart There is strong evidence that a period of increased infrastructure investment effort could provide large benefits to the American economy It could provide a fiscal expansion in an economy where aggregate demand growth has been stubbornly slow for years even in the face of prolonged expansionary monetary policy It could also aid the capital deepening that is necessary for boosting productivity growth especially during a period that has seen anemic private sector investment In any proposal to boost the nation s infrastructure investment there will be many details to work out but such details seem worth wrestling with given the large potential benefits at stake This paper was made possible by a grant from the

before the U S Congress He earned his Ph D from The New School for Social Research The large estimates of rates of return on public investment found by Aschauer 1989 were subsequently criticized on the grounds that they suffered from problems of simultaneity Essentially the argument was that the statistical relationship between public investment and output found by Aschauer 1989 was spurious driven only by the presence of nonstationarity in one or the other of the series A data series is nonstationary if its mean or other statistical properties change over various parts of the sample in this case if the mean or other statistical properties vary over time If a nonstationary series is used in regression analysis it can yield regression results that are spurious Heintz 2010 however notes that if both series public capital and output have a unit root in levels are nonstationary in the same way but are stationary in growth rates then an error correction model can be used to undertake regression analysis and the simultaneity problem can be dealt with For his output measures he uses private sector GDP and for public capital he uses a measure of core infrastructure essentially in line with how we define it in Figure A He regresses the change in the ratio of output to private capital on lagged values of the dependent variable the private capital stock the labor force and the infrastructure capital stock as well as changes in private and infrastructure capital stocks and the labor force Table A1 confirms that each of the data series has a unit root in levels but is stationary in first differences For each series the hypothesis of a unit root cannot be rejected in levels but it can be rejected at the 5 or 1 percent level of significance for the first

be noted that these are multipliers that hold when monetary policymakers accommodate the fiscal expansion If monetary policymakers instead engage in contractionary measures to offset any fiscal expansion the best estimate of these or any other multiplier is zero 3 Because this is commonly misunderstood it is important to realize that a multiplier of 1 does not mean that stimulus has somehow failed It means it has boosted overall output by exactly the amount of the fiscal impulse Stimulus fails to work in some economic models when the extra output generated by the fiscal impulse leads to an equal and opposite contraction in private sector output resulting in a multiplier of zero Aaron Henry J 1990 Discussion of Why Is Infrastructure Important In Is There a Shortfall in Public Capital

defined as the sustained rise in the quantity of goods and services that an economy produces Predict how population growth will affect the level of capital per workerEconomic growth is the increase in the market value of the goods and services that an economy produces over time It is measured as the percentage rate change in the real gross domestic product GDP Measuring the GDP Economic growth is the percentage rate increase in the GDP Long run growth is directly impacted by the GDP Long run growth is defined as the sustained rise in the quantity of goods and services that an economy produces The GDP of a country is closely tied to the growth of the population in addition to prices and supply and demand There are specific determinants that impact the long run growth of an economy When the economic growth matches the growth of money supply an economy will continue to grow and thrive In this case population growth would increase but the need for goods and services would also increase As a result more jobs would be available and the employment rate would also increase However when economic growth is not balanced the result can include inflation and excessive growth Inflation occurs when the price of goods and services are rising which causes purchasing power to fall if wages don t also rise A decrease in the demand for goods and services will lead to a decrease in revenue and employment A high rate of population growth will cause less capital per worker lower productivity and lower GDP growth Inflation Inflation occurs when the price of goods and services are rising which causes purchasing power to fall if wages don t also rise Inflation is a negative effect of economic growth that is not balanced When the GDP growth is only caused by increases in population not increases in supply demand revenue the growth is excessive In order for an economy to be successful it must meet the needs of the population supply demand revenue and employment When a population grows too fast the economic system cannot support the changes Excessive growth leads to an imbalance in supply and demand and higher levels of unemployment The quality of living decreases when the economy cannot support the population growth The aggregate production function examines how the productivity depends on the quantities of physical capital per worker and human capital per worker Discuss how aggregate production impacts long run growthThe aggregate production function examines how productivity or real GDP per worker depends on the quantities of physical capital per worker and human capital per worker The production function relates the physical outputs of production to the physical inputs or factors of production The aggregate production takes the physical outputs and inputs into account to determine the allocative efficiency of the economy as a whole Aggregate production functions create an estimated framework to determine how much of an economy s growth is related to changes in capital or changes in technology Production functions assume that the maximum output is attainable from a given set on inputs The aggregate production function describes the boundary representing the limit of output attainable from each feasible combination of input To understand how the aggregate production impacts long run growth it is important to understand the stages of production Graphing Production The production function of a firm or economy can be graphed using the total average and marginal products The aggregate production is determined based on the stages of production and the results of the graph The long run growth of a firm can change the scale of operations by adjusting the level of inputs that are fixed in the short run which shifts the production function upward as plotted against the variable input Aggregate production functions study the short run inputs and outputs of a firm or economy The results allow adjustments to be made which improves the long run growth by balancing the inputs and outputs In economics and long run growth worker productivity is influenced directly by fixed capital human capital physical capital and technology Examine the role of human capital in production and economic growthIn economics and long run growth worker productivity is influenced directly by fixed capital The four types of fixed capital include useful machines instruments of the trade buildings as the means of procuring revenue improvements of land and the acquired and useful abilities of all the inhabitants or members of society One way to increase worker productivity is to invest in better machinery for example A worker with a more productive tool in more productive Another way to increase productivity is to find ways to increase the revenue of the product generated by the workers Since productivity is measured in dollars per worker being able to generate more revenue from the same output is reflected in an increase in worker productivity Perhaps most interesting though is how to change worker productivity through human capital Human capital is defined as the stock of competencies knowledge social and personal attributes including creativity embodied in the ability to perform labor so as to produce economic value Many economic theories tie education to economic growth explaining that it is an investment in human capital development Human capital has been shown to increase economic development productivity growth and innovation Education Education increases human capital and worker productivity A human resource is transformed into human capital with the effective inputs of education health and moral values When individuals and societies invest in human capital it strengthens the future of the long run economic growth The qualitative and quantitative progress of a country is inevitable when human development is a priority Over time when worker productivity increases the quality and quantity of the goods and services will also increase When a society invests in human capital it increases worker productivity and economic growth Human capital and increased worker productivity are critical because they are different from the tangible monetary capital or revenue It is important thought that an economy recognizes the importance of monetary capital Worker productivity in the long run is related to real income If the real income falls over time it will negatively impact worker productivity Economic revenue goes up and down due to shocks in the business cycle Human capital grows cumulatively over a long period of time When a society focuses on human capital and in turn worker productivity the long run economic growth will be steady Economic inputs towards education health and worker productivity impacts future generations by ensuring that they will be more advanced and efficient than the current generation The increase in worker efficiency is the direct result of a superior quality of manpower created through increased human capital In economics technological change is a term used to describe the change in a set of feasible production possibilities Assess the value of technology to a nation s economic growthIn economics growth is defined as the increase in output per capita of a country over a long period of time One primary factor that influences the growth of an economy is technological change Technological change is a term used to describe the change in a set of feasible production possibilities Technological improvement has the ability to increase the amount of output an economy can produce even if the level of inputs remains constant Technological Change Technological change causes the production possibility frontier to shift outward and initiate economic growth Technology is defined as the making modification usage and knowledge of tools machines techniques systems and methods of organization in order to solve a problem improve a preexisting solution to a problem or achieve a goal In economics improvements in technology have helped develop more advanced economies for example today s global economy ENIAC ENIAC the first general purpose computer was a technological advancement that affected both productivity and the types of outputs that could be produced In a developing country the government works to ensure that the technologies skills knowledge and methods of manufacturing are tested and developed so that they can be passed on to a broader audience The expansion and sharing of technology leads to the further development of goods processes applications materials and services All of these areas are critical to the advancement of an economy in the long run The field of economics is constantly evolving as is the production of goods and services In order to advance and continue to grow all markets need to make use of new technology to stay competitive In the case of long run economic growth using the most advanced technology provides a market with a competitive advantage Advances in technology creates an increased level of output with the same inputs which improves productivity Government activity and policies have a direct impact on long run growth It can invest and operate through monetary and fiscal policy Discuss the long run implications on growth from government policiesIn macroeconomics long run growth is the increase in the market value of goods and services produced by an economy over a period of time The long run growth is determined by percentage of change in the real gross domestic product GDP In order for an economy to experience positive long run growth its outputs and inputs must be in balance for an increase to occur in supply demand revenue and employment The long run economic growth is determined by short run economic decisions Gross Domestic Product The change in GDP is used to determine economic growth within a country Government activity and policies have a direct impact on long run growth Long run growth can be redirected and improved when changes are made to short run actions When an economy or industry experiences imbalanced in economic growth the government can respond in order to assist in securing the market Examples of possible government activity include Government activity impacts long run growth It is critical that increasing populations have access to productive resources It is also important that markets stay balanced in order to be successful and thrive Economic growth has the potential to make all people richer but may have downsides such as increased inequality and environmental impacts Compare and contrast the consequences of economies in which growth is a goalEconomic growth is defined as the increase in the market value of goods and services produced by an economy over a period of time It is measured as the percentage increase in the real gross domestic product GDP In other words economic growth is an expansion of the economic output of a country Over the long run economists might look at the per capita rate of GDP growth the growth of the ratio of GDP to the population GDP The percentage increase in the GDP of a country is used to measure the country s economic growth There are numerous arguments in support of economic growth that describe its positive impact on society Arguments in favor of economic growth include There are a series of arguments that are opposed to economic growth Arguments opposed to growth include Doris GoodwinFall 1992High growth needn t require a war America s response to World War II was the most extraordinary mobilization of an idle economy in the history of the world During the war 17 million new civilian jobs were created industrial productivity increased by 96 percent and corporate profits after taxes doubled The government expenditures helped bring about the business recovery that had eluded the New Deal War needs directly consumed over one third of the output of industry but the expanded productivity ensured a remarkable supply of consumer goods to the people as well America was the only that saw an expansion of consumer goods despite wartime rationing BY 1944 as a result of wage increases and overtime pay real weekly wages before taxes in manufacturing were 50 percent higher than in 1939 The war also created entire new technologies industries and associated human skills The war brought full employment and a fairer distribution of income Blacks and women entered the workforce for the first time Wages increased so did savings The war brought the consolidation of union strength and far reaching changes in agricultural life Housing conditions were better than they had been before In addition because the mobilization included the ideological argument that the war was being fought for the interests of common men and women social solidarity extended far beyond the foxholes Public opinion held that the veterans should not return jobless to a country without opportunity and education That led to the GI Bill which helped lay the foundation for the remarkable postwar expansion that followed The war also made us more of a middle class society than we had been before It is no exaggeration to say that America won the war abroad and the peace at home at the same time No doubt the historical conditions of America s economic surge during World War II were singular But we have much to learn from that achievement as we face our troubles today Historians economists and politicians have long wondered why this remarkable social and economic mobilization of latent human and physical resources required a war The answer I think is partly ideological World War II provided the ideological breakthrough that finally allowed the U S government to surmount the Clutch Plague Despite the New Deal even President Roosevelt had been constrained from intervening massively enough to stimulate a full recovery By 1938 he had lost his working majority in Congress and a conservative coalition was back stifling the New Deal programs When the economy had begun to bounce back FDR pulled back on government spending to balance the budget which contributed to the recession of 1938 The war was like a wave coming over that conservative coalition the old ideological constraints collapsed and government outlays powered a recovery For a time the government became the purchaser of one half of all the goods produced by the American people A magnificent and little appreciated fact however is that even though the government intervened far more deeply than in World War I by imposing wage and price controls and surtaxes raising funds through war bonds rationing goods and compelling industries to work for war production FDR negotiated a sense of partnership rather than simply imposing the government s will The stereotype of FDR as a regulation lover flies in the face of experience in the 1940s when Roosevelt ended his cold war with business Wartime planning was far more corporatist than New Deal planning with far less class warfare Eleanor Roosevelt was still much more anti business than Franklin and was often furious at him After 1940 antitrust enforcement virtually shut down Liberals were upset that ALCOA was a big bad monopoly But as Secretary of War Stimson observed I d rather have more sinful aluminum now than good aluminum too late for the war Nevertheless the government did finance a competitor in Reynolds Aluminum which helped to motivate ALCOA to produce aluminum and gave the government a second supplier Despite the entente with business FDR was still willing to go forward on the employment of blacks and women in part because he believed that full productivity and wartime morale required it He also continued to advance trade unionism He did insist for example that Ford Motor Company live up to its responsibilities under the Wagner Act When Ford refused Roosevelt cancelled a lucrative government contract This helped to produce the momentum for the big Ford strike in the spring of 1941 that brought the first union into Ford But on other regulatory issues FDR compromised A government that depended on these businesses to mobilize during the war could not be slapping them with antitrust suits at the same time Basically Roosevelt made the decision that he had to mobilize the proprietors of the mines the factories and the shops He realized Congress could provide the money but it could not build the planes design the tanks or assemble the weapons Without the cooperation of industry massive production would never get off the ground So the challenge was to bring the proprietors of the nation s chief economic assets into the defense effort as active participants He recognized also that private business could not find all the capital required for the expansion of the plants nor take the risk that the end of the war would leave them with no orders and excess capacity So the federal government through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation advanced the necessary money to expand the factories often leasing them to industry The government developed new sources of supply for raw materials and created quick mass transportation The government also went into the business of producing synthetic rubber and aluminum as well as other emerging industries and helped stimulate new technologies Contrary to the stereotype of a wartime command economy there was a remarkable entrepreneurial spirit in sharp contrast to the situation in Germany or in socialist centrally planned economies Roosevelt brought in dozens of top business executives as dollar a year men to help run the government commissions so that businesses didn t feel the government was simply telling them what to do He allowed business to realize profits He used government to create markets and to help business set up new plants and equipment which business often leased and later bought cheaply after the war It is hard for us to imagine today how such an entrepreneurial spirit could co exist with war mobilization but one did One reason of course was the opportunity to profit though the wartime tax on excess profits prevented the kind of windfalls made during World War I More fundamentally a spirit developed within each business enterprise to produce better than its competitors to serve the country In his fireside chats Roosevelt explained to the people over and over again why their productive genius had to be mobilized to win the war Buoyed by the strong morale the president fostered business and labor worked together to get the E for excellence citations that he spread around It was not just producing more than your competitor it was producing more than you did the previous quarter and the quarter before that For instance Henry Kaiser s shipyards were able to get the production time for Liberty Ships down from 365 days to 92 62 and finally to one day Overall the economy grew at a rate of 11 or 12 percent annually throughout the war Air Corps aces would visit the factories the pilot would tell the workers that it wasn t the pilots who were heroic it was their planes The war production posters emphasized that factories and GI s were one continuous front a theme that Roosevelt also struck in his speeches The people understood from the start that America s dominant contribution to the war would be its production When he was being urged by his military advisers to function more as a economic czar Roosevelt rejected that role The military was constantly urging him to institute compulsory national service in which people had either to enlist or work in one of the military plants to which the government would assign them Roosevelt successfully resisted that idea throughout the war on the theory that somehow the momentum of democracy would be sufficient If the jobs were out there people would put their mattresses on top of their cars and go to where the jobs were He had this extraordinary vision of the highways filled with people going south going west In one fireside chat he advised people to get maps And the Hammond company in New York sold out their entire stock of 2 000 maps in a single morning Even though the mobilization was chaotic and there were sometimes too many people in some places and too few people in other places it worked And America still produced more than any other country without the regimented manpower that some in the military wanted Roosevelt resisted and delayed most of the decisions that concentrated government power For example in the spring of 1942 when there was a rudimentary system of wage and price control Harold Smith his budget director declared it was time for comprehensive controls But the president was worried that it was adding up to an overly regimented economy and he rejected the proposal In sum one almost totally forgotten lesson of the war is that deep government involvement doesn t have to mean a command economy Despite the mobilization large segments of the economy were unaffected by the controls No one was told where to move or work Production for the government was still freely entered into by producers and government in a contractual arrangement and business ar gued about those contracts all the time Private property remained predominant throughout the country and still there were profits In the World War II experience the things we revere about capitalism the parts that spur energy efficiency and entrepreneurial skill were still in place What the war did was tap that energy not constrain it In the early years of the war Roosevelt consciously pursued a conversion program to shift industry to a wartime footing Lingerie factories began making camou flage netting baby carriages became field hospital food carts Lipstick cases became bomb cases beer cans went to hand grenades adding machines to automatic pistols and vacuum cleaners to gas mask parts Behind these shifts was planning someone had to perceive the similarity between lipstick cases and cartridges Though FDR delayed converting large consumer industries such as autos as long as possible there was a clear and deliberate plan After the war reconversion to civilian industry mostly carried out after FDR s death in April 1945 occurred more abruptly But it was not without a measure of planning To an important degree the Cold War served as an economic stimulus as World War II did in the early 1940s But the Cold War has now ended and there is not even a shred of a conversion policy And one of the dominant lessons of World War II is that unless there is a plan for conversion or reconversion people are subject to the whims of the free market Wartime conversion was not without hardships but most of them resulted from too little planning not too much In 1942 after delaying the government finally had to force the automobile industry to convert their plants to the manufacture of planes Four hundred thousand automobile workers were thrown out on the streets until that conversion could take place All the auto dealers and salespersons were suddenly out of jobs Eleanor Roosevelt had an altercation with General Motors Chairman William Knudsen because he had been unwilling to accept a plan a year earlier What made it finally work was the recognition that there had to be a plan that the government was behind the plan and the plan had public support In 1992 despite all the talk about it there is no collective effort to plan for the aftermath of the Cold War Word War II produced remarkable social gains At war production plants attempts to boost morale such as holding more softball games and building additional canteens and health clubs also fostered a sense of community The logic of mobilization produced a logic of social advance Eleanor Roosevelt in particular was successful in arguing that a fully productive work force requires everyone s talents blacks and women alike and if women are to work in the factories their children require day care She proved that absentee rates were high in the factories because worried women were going home to care for their children She got restaurants to prepare hot meals so women could bring home hot dinners The productivity rates soared as a result of these measures When Henry Kaiser built his big shipyard in California the government paid for a twenty four hour child care center It was a state of the art facility with the best nursery school teachers because it was seen as a pioneering test of early education Workers on every shift could bring their children If they worked at night they could bring their children to sleep If they worked the day shift their children received an education that they had never had before The children especially those from lower class families showed enormous gains But when the war ended all the centers were shut down The day after the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima the teachers got their dismissal notices The war broke down the long resistance to women working outside the home In the 1930s because of the scarcity of jobs many states actually passed laws barring married women from working if their husbands had a job In the Kelsey Hayes strike of 1941 the United Auto Workers went on strike over the hiring of women for men s jobs for fear that it would lower the wage scale Eventually as women were needed to fill vacancies the UAW grasped that the answer was obviously equal pay for equal work Unfortunately that momentum also dissipated with the end of full employment at the end of the war The several facets of the wartime economy worked in tandem The war was financed by a combination of taxes and bonds but FDR s control of the Federal Reserve guaranteed that interest rates would stay low Wage and price control and rationing made sure that full employment and shortages did not create inflation or hoarding as a side effect Public investment provided the capital that the factories needed A labor business entente assured the absence of disruptive strikes It was all of a piece Government was a source of full employment macroeconomic recovery technological breakthrough worker training reindustrialization and a good deal of incidental social progress Can we obtain the same benefits today without a war In retrospect the war economy seems as if it were all neatly planned and somehow inevitable But of course Roosevelt was the great improviser Some of what occurred during the war has no peacetime counterpart the rationing the ten million men in uniform But much of it does For example we could have a great deal more public investment in technology infrastructure and training We do not want or need wage and price controls but to achieve the same restraint we could certainly have what economists call an incomes policy tying wages to real productivity increases We could have an excess profits tax And if they had day care centers in war production plants in 1942 we can certainly have them today With industry short of capital and the banking system reeling a new Reconstruction Finance Corporation would also be sensible Fifty years ago the common desire to win the war and the feeling of revenge against the Japanese and the Nazis created a national sense of community The first task today is to define the common problem facing the nation that requires an overarching vision Absent a war the task of leadership is to create an understanding in the people of our competitive economic position in the world today Leaders must remind the public that we still have the resources and the talent but we must reorganize ourselves and the relationship between the government and the people just as we did during World War II Throughout our nation s history there have been critical moments when the government s relationship to private enterprise had to change allowing both economic expansion and the flourishing of democracy Now is one of those times The World War II experience shows just how bold that effort has to be Americans work longer hours even in multiple part time jobs than their European counterparts Here s how to create a better work life balance As the mainstream consensus on foreign affairs begins to erode it s time to bring economics back into the discussion The overwhelming majority of House Democrats support a 15 federal minimum wage But a centrist bill to institute regional minimum wages is standing in the way To gain free access register your interest here Economic growth has two meanings Firstly and most commonly growth is defined as an increase in the output that an economy produces over a period of time the minimum being two consecutive quarters The second meaning of economic growth is an increase in what an economy can produce if it is using all its scarce resources An increase in an economy s productive potential can be shown by an outward shift in the economy s production possibility frontier PPF The simplest way to show economic growth is to bundle all goods into two basic categories consumer and capital goods An outward shift of a PPF means that an economy has increased its capacity to produce When using a PPF growth is defined as an increase in potential output over time and illustrated by an outward shift in the curve An outward shift of a PPF means that an economy has increased its capacity to produce all goods This can occur when the economy undertakes some or all of the following Investment in new technology increases potential output for all goods and services because new technology is inevitably more efficient than old technology Widespread mechanisation in the 18th and 19th centuries enabled the UK to generate vast quantities of output from relatively few resources and become the world s first fully industrialised economy In recent times China s rapid growth rate owes much to the application of new technology to the manufacturing process An economy will not be able to grow if an insufficient amount of resources are allocated to capital goods In fact because capital depreciates some resources must be allocated to capital goods for an economy to remain at its current size let alone for it to grow A division of labour refers to how production can be broken down into separate tasks enabling machines to be developed to help production and allowing labour to specialise on a small range of activities A division of labour and specialisation can considerably improve productive capacity and shift the PPF outwards See also Adam SmithNew methods of production can increase potential output For example the introduction of team working to the production of motor vehicles in the 1980s reduced wastage and led to considerable efficiency improvements The widespread use of computer controlled production methods such as robotics has dramatically improved the productive potential of many manufacturing firms Growth in the size of the working population enables an economy to increase its potential output This can be achieved through natural growth when the birth rate exceeds the death rate or through net immigration when immigration is greater than emigration Discoveries of key resources such as oil increase an economy s capacity to produce A PPF will shift inwards when an economy has suffered a loss or exhaustion of some of its scarce resources This reduces an economy s productive potential If key non renewable resources like oil are exhausted the productive capacity of an economy may be reduced This happens more quickly as a result of the application of ultra efficient production methods and when countries over specialise in producing goods from non renewable resources Sustainable growth means that the current rate of growth is not so fast that future generations are denied the benefit of scarce resources such as non renewable resources and a clean environment A failure to invest in human and real capital to compensate for depreciation will reduce an economy s capacity Real capital such as machinery and equipment wears out with use and its productivity falls over time As the output from real capital falls the productivity of labour will also fall The quality and productivity of labour also depends on the acquisition of new skills Therefore if an economy does not invest in people and technology its PPF will slowly move inwards A military conflict is likely to destroy factories people communications and infrastructure If there is a natural disaster such as the 2005 boxing day tsunami or the Haiti earthquake of 2010 an economy s PPF will shift inwards Allocating scarce funds to capital goods such as machinery is referred to as real investment If an economy chooses to produce more capital goods than consumer goods at point A in the diagram then it will grow by more than if it allocated more resources to consumer goods at point B below To achieve long run growth the economy must use more of its capital resources to produce capital rather than consumer goods As a result standards of living are reduced in the short run as resources are diverted away from private consumption However the increased investment in capital goods enables more output of consumer goods to be produced in the long run This means that standards of living can increase in the future by more than they would have if the economy had not made such as short term sacrifice Hence economies face a choice between high levels of consumption in the short run and the long run If an economy chooses to produce more capital goods than consumer goods at point A in the diagram then it will grow by more than if it allocated more resources to consumer goods at point B There is a trade off between the short and the long run In the short run the economy must use resources to produce capital rather than consumer goods Standards of living are reduced in the short run as resources are diverted away from private consumption However in the longer run the increased investment in capital goods enables more output of consumer goods to be produced This means that standards of living can increase by more than they would have if the economy had not made the short term sacrifice An economy can grow because of an increase in productivity in one sector of the economy this is called

Domestic Product GDP at constant prices so that the effect of price rises on the value of national output is removed Sustainable economic growth means a rate of growth which can be maintained without creating other significant economic problems especially for future generations There is clearly a trade off between rapid economic growth today and growth in the future Rapid growth today may exhaust resources and create environmental problems for future generations including the depletion of oil and fish stocks and global warming Periods of growth are often triggered by increases in aggregate demand such as a rise in consumer spending but sustained growth must involve an increase in output If output does not increase any extra demand will push up the price level In terms of sustainability it may be argued that growth based on short term public debt rather than long term productivity is unsustainable hence worries about the build up of sovereign debt in Europe For an economy to continue to grow in the future it needs to increase its capacity to grow An increase in an economy s productive potential can be shown by an outward shift in the economy s PPF Gross domestic product per capita is often regarded as the key indicator of the standards of living of the citizens of an economy and of their economic welfare though broader measures of economic welfare are increasingly used in preference to narrow GDP measures GDP is the official base measure of output used in most economies including the UK Gross measurements record the output of all goods and services including capital goods which have been purchased to replace existing capital goods Replacing capital is called capital consumption or depreciation The alternative to Gross output is Net output which indicates that depreciation is taken into account and deducted from the gross measurement Domestic product is the value of all UK goods and services produced including those produced for export It does not include property income which flows into and out of the UK economy Property income refers to income from various types of investment abroad such as profits and dividends When this is added the measure becomes national product called Gross National Product GNP Growth can be measured as an annual percentage increase in real GDP and in terms of a general trend The trend rate of growth is the long term non inflationary average rate of growth for an economy In the UK it is around 2 5 per year If growth rises significantly above or below the trend rate the economy is experiencing excessive growth or low growth If the rate becomes negative for at least 2 quarters in succession the economy is in recession Changes in real national income tend to be cyclical but it is desirable that this cycle is stable rather than unstable Unstable growth is popularly called boom and bust Although an economy s growth is cyclical in nature the underlying trend can be derived from annual growth statistics Trends can be calculated by using a technique called moving averages The UK trend rate over the last 25 years is around 2 5 Goods and service inflationHouse price inflationWage inflationLabour shortagesFalling savingsExcessive creditTrade difficultiesGoods deflationHouse price deflationLabour surplusesUnemploymentExcessive debt burdenPublic sector debtChanges or turning points in the level of national income can be predicted and confirmed using economic indicators Leading indicators typically monitor changes in interest rates business confidence and new housing starts ups all of which provides clues to the next turning point in an economy s growth cycle Changes in these indicate that GDP is likely to change in 12 to 18 months time The OECD s main indicator the Composite Leading Indicator CLI tracks deviations from the long term trend which provides an early warning system for policy makers A short leading indicator can be used to monitor changes in consumer credit and new car registrations A lagging indicator monitors changes in unemployment and real investment and confirms that the turning point has occurred All indicators help policy makers decide when to implement a policy and by what degree UK growth rates can be expressed in an index or as annual percentages Economic growth is associated with a number of material benefits which increase economic welfare These include the following A rise in real national income means that wages and profits are likely to rise Assuming a stable population this will raise GDP per capita A growing economy means that the public sector can receive more tax revenue and more resources can be allocated to public and merit goods such as more roads hospitals and schools Public and merit goods generate considerable external benefits More hospitals and schools mean a healthier and better educated population which generates other economic benefits in terms of the effectiveness of the labour force and increases in long term aggregate supply Growth is clearly likely to stimulate demand for labour and it is likely that more people will be employed and fewer unemployed Economic growth also brings some costs which reduce economic welfare including As production and consumption increase negative externalities such as pollution and congestion are likely to arise There is also the likelihood of increased depletion of non renewable resources such as fossil fuels Too rapid a rate of growth can also lead to two significant economic problems inflationary pressure and a balance of payments deficit as imports rise to satisfy an increasingly active household sector Growth can also widen the distribution of income because some groups may benefit much more than others Certainly in the UK the relative income gap has widened during the growth years of 1992 to 2008 There are several limitations of using GDP statistics for comparing changes in economic well being over time including Average GDP per capita may rise over time but the distribution of income may widen For example a rise in the mean average income per head can be misleading because the average may rise because just a few of the population increase their personal income Indeed the mean average can rise but the median the mid point in a range of numbers can fall People may be working longer hours in which case some of the growth may be through increased work rather than through increased efficiency People may undertake unpaid work and this may not be officially recorded Prices are unlikely to remain constant over time so GDP figures must be converted to at constant prices and measured from a base year This process is called indexing and is required to avoid the distorting effects of inflation The quality of life may suffer as GDP increases although this is not included in GDP statistics For example more driving raises GDP but also adds to CO2 emissions which can reduce the quality of life Over time the quality of products tends to increase so a given amount of income per capita in 2010 may purchase a higher quality product than it did in 2000 This is certainly true with high technology consumer products like PCs laptops and mobile phones Limitations of using GDP statistics for international comparisons include Although two countries may have similar GDP per capita figures the distribution of income in each country may be very different As when comparing a country over time the number of hours worked to generate a given level of income may be quite different For example workers in the UK tend to work longer hours than those in France and this would falsely inflate the GDP figures in the UK relative to France International prices will also vary This is significant because an individual s purchasing power is based on price in relation to income To solve this problem GDP statistics can be re calculated in terms of purchasing power The purchasing power of a currency refers to the quantity of the currency needed to purchase a given unit of a good or common basket of goods and services Purchasing power is clearly determined by the relative cost of living and inflation rates in different countries Achieving purchasing power parity means equalising the purchasing power of two currencies by taking into account cost of living and inflation differences For example if we simply convert GDP in Japan to US dollars using market exchange rates relative purchasing power is not taken into account and the validity of the comparison is weakened By adjusting rates to take into account local purchasing power differences known as PPP adjusted exchange rates international comparisons are more valid The true value of public goods and merit goods such as defence education and transport infrastructure is largely unknown This means that it is difficult to compare two countries with very different levels of spending on these goods and assets Similarly the existence of a large unofficial economy may make comparisons based on official GDP very misleading For example comparing the official GDP of the UK and Russia may be misleading because of the size of Russia s unofficial economy While all countries have unofficial economies their size and significance can vary considerably GDP figures for different countries must be converted to a common currency such as the US dollar and this may give misleading figures For some countries exchange rates against the US dollar may be unrepresentative of the true value of the currency especially where international trade is relatively small In such cases converting to US dollars may significantly under value national output This explains why conversion to purchasing power parity is often preferred to conversion to US dollars In recognising that economic welfare is not simply about economic growth in 1999 the UK government introduced a policy for sustainable development and refined this further in 2005 Sustainable development is considered in four main categories using 20 main indicators and 68 indicators in total The categories are See Measures of Economic WelfareWhat exactly is the most favoured nation rule

guide to the fascinating though often complex elements of the US tax system How do taxes affect the economy in the long run Primarily through the supply side High marginal tax rates can discourage work saving investment and innovation while specific tax preferences can affect the allocation of economic resources But tax cuts can also slow long run economic growth by increasing deficits The long run effects of tax policies thus depend not only on their incentive effects but also their deficit effects Economic activity reflects a balance between what people businesses and governments want to buy and what they want to sell In the short run demand factors loom large In the long run though supply plays the primary role in determining economic potential Our productive capacity depends on the size and skills of the workforce the amount and quality of machines buildings vehicles computers and other physical capital that workers use and the stock of knowledge and ideas By influencing incentives taxes can affect both supply and demand factors Reducing marginal tax rates on wages and salaries for example can induce people to work more Expanding the earned income tax credit can bring more low skilled workers into the labor force Lower marginal tax rates on the returns to assets such as interest dividends and capital gains can encourage saving Reducing marginal tax rates on business income can cause some companies to invest domestically rather than abroad Tax breaks for research can encourage the creation of new ideas that spill over to help the broader economy And so on Note however that tax reductions can also have negative supply effects If a cut increases workers after tax income some may choose to work less and take more leisure This income effect pushes against the substitution effect in which lower tax rates at the margin increase the financial reward of working Tax provisions can also distort how investment capital is deployed Our current tax system for example favors housing over other types of investment That differential likely induces overinvestment in housing and reduces economic output and social welfare Tax cuts can also slow long run economic growth by increasing budget deficits When the economy is operating near potential government borrowing is financed by diverting some capital that would have gone into private investment or by borrowing from foreign investors Government borrowing thus either crowds out private investment reducing future productive capacity relative to what it could have been or reduces how much of the future income from that investment goes to US residents Either way deficits can reduce future well being The long run effects of tax policies thus depend not only on their incentive effects but also on their budgetary effects If Congress reduces marginal tax rates on individual incomes for example the long run effects could be either positive or negative depending on whether the resulting impacts on saving and investment outweigh the potential drag from increased deficits That leaves open questions on how large incentive and deficit effects are and how to model them for policy analysis The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation each use multiple models that differ in assumptions about how forward looking people are how the United States connects to the global economy how government borrowing affects private investment and how businesses and individuals respond to tax changes Models used in other government agencies in think tanks and in academia vary even more The one area of consensus is that the most pro growth policies are those that improve incentives to work save invest and innovate without driving up long run deficits The Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center TPC has developed its own economic model to analyze the long run economic effects of tax proposals In TPC s model simple reduced form equations based on empirical analysis determine the impact of tax policy on labor supply saving and investment TPC used this model to estimate the long run economic and revenue effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Congressional Budget Office 2014 How

Washington DC Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center A citizen s guide to the fascinating though often complex elements of the US tax system How do taxes affect the economy in the short run Primarily through their impact on demand Tax cuts boost demand by increasing disposable income and by encouraging businesses to hire and invest more Tax increases do the reverse These demand effects can be substantial when the economy is weak but smaller when it is operating near capacity Economic activity reflects a balance between what people businesses and governments want to buy and what they want to sell In the short run focusing on the next one or two years economic policy has greater impact on the demand side When the economy is weak for example the Federal Reserve tries to boost consumer and business demand by cutting interest rates or purchasing financial securities Congress for its part can boost demand by increasing spending and cutting taxes Tax cuts increase household demand by increasing workers take home pay Tax cuts can boost business demand by increasing firms after tax cash flow which can be used to pay dividends and expand activity and by making hiring and investing more attractive How much tax cuts boost demand or tax hikes restrain it depends on the sensitivity of household and business behavior for example how households divide increased after tax income between consumption and saving and whether businesses choose to hire and invest more Economists summarize these effects in a simple measure the output multiplier expressing how many dollars of increased economic activity result from a dollar reduction in taxes or a dollar increase in government spending The Congressional Budget Office CBO has estimated such multipliers for a mix of tax and spending policies table 1 As these estimates suggest the stimulus from tax cuts or spending increases depends on the strength of the economy If it is operating close to potential and the Federal Reserve is not constrained by the zero lower bound on interest rates fiscal policies will have a small short run economic effect largely because the Fed will offset fiscal stimulus with interest rate hikes However if the economy is far from potential and short term interest rates are close to zero fiscal stimulus can have significantly more impact because the Fed will not offset it CBO estimates that fiscal multipliers are about three times larger when the economy is very weak than when it is strong CBO s numbers illustrate substantial uncertainty in our understanding of how fiscal policies affect the economy For a two year tax cut aimed at lower and middle income households for example CBO s low estimate of the multiplier 0 3 is just one fifth the size of its high estimate 1 5 But some things are clear CBO s estimates suggest that dollar for dollar tax cuts are often a less effective means of stimulus than are spending increases If the federal government purchases goods and services itself or helps state and local governments do so most or all of the spending will boost demand If the government cuts personal taxes however a substantial amount of the added spending power leaks into saving That dampening effect can be moderated by targeting tax cuts to lower and middle income households which are less likely to save Tax policies can also affect the supply of labor in the short run A cut in payroll taxes could bring some workers into the labor market or encourage those already working to put in more hours Such supply changes have little effect on output if the economy is operating well below potential Under those conditions people have difficulty finding more work even if they want it If the economy is operating near potential however increased labor supply can translate to increased output The Tax Policy Center TPC model of short run economic effects differs slightly in approach compared to CBO s but is designed to produce similar estimates The CBO model estimates direct effects on demand based on generic policy types as in table 1 The TPC model instead derives effects on after tax incomes from TPC s distributional tables TPC used this model to estimate the short run economic and revenue effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Congressional Budget Office 2014 How CBO Analyzes the Effects of Changes in Federal Fiscal Policies on the Economy

our economy in the right direction fiscal and monetary policy When used correctly they can have similar results in both stimulating our economy and slowing it down when it heats up The ongoing debate is which one is more effective in the long and short run Fiscal policy is when our government uses its spending and taxing powers to have an impact on the economy The combination and interaction of government expenditures and revenue collection is a delicate balance that requires good timing and a little bit of luck to get it right The direct and indirect effects of fiscal policy can influence personal spending capital expenditure exchange rates deficit levels and even interest rates which are usually associated with monetary policy Fiscal policy is often linked with Keynesianism which derives its name from British economist John Maynard Keynes His major work The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money influenced new theories about how the economy works and is still studied today He developed most of his theories during the Great Depression and Keynesian theories have been used and misused over time as they are popular and are often specifically applied to mitigate economic downturns In a nutshell Keynesian economic theories are based on the belief that proactive actions from our government are the only way to steer the economy This implies that the government should use its powers to increase aggregate demand by increasing spending and creating an easy money environment which should stimulate the economy by creating jobs and ultimately increasing prosperity The Keynesian theorist movement suggests that monetary policy on its own has its limitations in resolving financial crises thus creating the Keynesian versus the Monetarists debate For related reading see Can Keynesian Economics Reduce Boom Bust Cycles While fiscal policy has been used successfully during and after the Great Depression the Keynesian theories were called into question in the 1980s after a long run of popularity Monetarists such as Milton Friedman and supply siders claimed the ongoing government actions had not helped the country avoid the endless cycles of below average gross domestic product GDP expansion recessions and gyrating interest rates Just like monetary policy fiscal policy can be used to influence both expansion and contraction of GDP as a measure of economic growth When the government is exercising its powers by lowering taxes and increasing their expenditures they are practicing expansionary fiscal policy While on the surface expansionary efforts may seem to lead to only positive effects by stimulating the economy there is a domino effect that is much broader reaching When the government is spending at a pace faster than tax revenues can be collected the government can accumulate excess debt as it issues interest bearing bonds to finance the spending thus leading to an increase in the national debt When the government increases the amount of debt it issues during expansionary fiscal policy issuing bonds in the open market will end up competing with the private sector that may also need to issue bonds at the same time This effect known as crowding out can raise rates indirectly because of the increased competition for borrowed funds Even if the stimulus created by the increased government spending has some initial short term positive effects a portion of this economic expansion could be mitigated by the drag caused by higher interest expenses for borrowers including the government For related reading see What Are Some Examples of Expansionary Fiscal Policy Another indirect effect of fiscal policy is the potential for foreign investors to bid up the U S currency in their efforts to invest in the now higher yielding U S bonds trading in the open market While a stronger home currency sounds positive on the surface depending on the magnitude of the change in rates it can actually make American goods more expensive to export and foreign made goods cheaper to import Since most consumers tend to use price as a determining factor in their purchasing practices a shift to buying more foreign goods and a slowing demand for domestic products could lead to a temporary trade imbalance These are all possible scenarios that have to be considered and anticipated There is no way to predict which outcome will emerge and by how much because there are so many other moving targets including market influences natural disasters wars and any other large scale event that can move markets Fiscal policy measures also suffer from a natural lag or the delay in time from when they are determined to be needed to when they actually pass through Congress and ultimately the president From a forecasting perspective in a perfect world where economists have a 100 accuracy rating for predicting the future fiscal measures could be summoned up as needed Unfortunately given the inherent unpredictability and dynamics of the economy most economists run into challenges in accurately predicting short term economic changes For related reading see Who sets fiscal policy the president or Congress Monetary policy can also be used to ignite or slow the economy and is controlled by the Federal Reserve with the ultimate goal of creating an easy money environment Early Keynesians did not believe monetary policy had any long lasting effects on the economy because At different times in the economic cycle this may or may not be true but monetary policy has proven to have some influence and impact on the economy as well as equity and fixed income markets The Federal Reserve carries three powerful tools in its arsenal and is very active with all of them The most commonly used tool is their open market operations which affect the money supply through buying and selling U S government securities The Federal Reserve can increase the money supply by buying securities and decrease the money supply by selling securities The Fed can also change the reserve requirements at banks directly increasing or decreasing the money supply The required reserve ratio affects the money supply by regulating how much money banks must hold in reserve If the Federal Reserve wants to increase the money supply it can decrease the amount of reserves required and if it wants to decrease the money supply it can increase the amount of reserves required to be held by banks The third way the Fed can alter the money supply is by changing the discount rate which is the tool that is constantly receiving media attention forecasts speculation The world often awaits the Fed s announcements as if any change would have an immediate impact on the global economy The discount rate is frequently misunderstood as it is not the official rate consumers will be paying on their loans or receiving on their savings accounts It is the rate charged to banks seeking to increase their reserves when they borrow directly from the Fed The Fed s decision to change this rate does however flow through the banking system and ultimately determines what consumers pay to borrow and what they receive on their deposits In theory holding the discount rate low should induce banks to hold fewer excess reserves and ultimately increase the demand for money This begs the question which is more effective fiscal or monetary policy This topic has been hotly debated for decades and the answer is both For example to a Keynesian promoting fiscal policy over a long period of time e g 25 years the economy will go through multiple economic cycles At the end of those cycles the hard assets like infrastructure and other long life assets will still be standing and were most likely the result of some type of fiscal intervention Over that same 25 years the Fed may have intervened hundreds of times using their monetary policy tools and maybe only had success in their goals some of the time Using just one method may not be the best idea There is a lag in fiscal policy as it filters into the economy and monetary policy has shown its effectiveness in slowing down an economy that is heating up at a faster than desired but it has not had the same effect when it comes to quickly inducing an economy to expand as money is eased so its success is muted Though each side of the policy spectrum has its differences the United States has sought a solution in the middle ground combining aspects of both policies in solving economic problems The Fed may be more recognized when it comes to guiding the economy as their efforts are well publicized and their decisions can move global equity and bond markets drastically but the use of fiscal policy lives on While there will always be a lag in its effects fiscal policy seems to have a greater effect over long periods of time and monetary policy has proven to have some short term success For related reading see Fiscal Policy vs Monetary Policy Pros Cons

the early 1990s Those dangerous rotas left me low and unable to string a sentence together let alone give sick people what they needed Doctors crazy hours were reduced but it seems they may be returning with the new junior doctors contract Meanwhile David Cameron will head to Brussels for EU negotiations planning to insist that UK workers should continue to be able to opt out of the 48 hour maximum working week Long working hours are on the agenda But what about tackling the issue at its roots What if everyone had a shorter working week We would be healthier and happier and society would be less unequal and more sustainable It has probably never entered the heads of most economists that hours could be shortened and output maintainedA top public health doctor recently said that long working hours was a big cause of mental ill health and a big 2015 study linked long working hours with an increased risk of stroke and heart disease Less time at work would mean more time to care for children and family be a school governor look in on elderly neighbours or organise a game of football It would mean more time to create the community spiderweb of connections and favours and reciprocation that keeps the world going round More than 6 million of us in Britain work more than 45 hours a week while 1 85 million of us are unemployed While it would need to happen gradually alongside some reskilling and training a shorter working week for all would mean fairer distribution of available work It would reduce the number of people working far too many hours and also the number with no work at all For people on lower incomes it would have to go hand in hand with a living wage something that Britain now agrees on across the political spectrum For higher earners it would fulfil pent up demand in London for example only 3 of jobs with average or higher salary levels are advertised as part time according to Timewise Foundation It would help with gender equality too as men would have more time to look after the kids and the house About 85 of in work British men work more than 30 hours a week but only 57 of in work women Shorter hours could also help mitigate climate change According to a report from the US Center for Economic and Policy Research reduced greenhouse gas emissions go hand in hand with shorter working hours for a variety of factors including lower levels of consumption With all these benefits cutting the working week should be at the top of every politician s agenda But it bumps up against some big prejudices Would the economy fall apart How would our open all hours society function And wouldn t we turn into a nation of couch potatoes The quick answer to all this is to look at other countries People in the Netherlands work five hours a week less than in Britain according to the OECD and in Germany six hours less The Dutch and German economies are doing fine and the Dutch people are better known for their love of cycling than their inability to part from their sofas Productivity output per working hour improves with shorter hours Across the world s richest countries higher productivity correlates with lower working hours see also OECD data Ford s original workers were found less productive working more than 40 hours a week a situation likely to be even more the case for people who work with knowledge rather manually who ever had their best ideas when they were exhausted All this means that we may well be able to work a shorter week and get just as much done The 20th century British economist John Hicks said It has probably never entered the heads of most economists that hours could be shortened and output maintained It is true that some workplaces such as restaurants and hospitals for example would not be able to run nine to five Monday to Thursday Tackling this is simply a management issue and the result would be a better sharing of available work Perhaps the biggest obstacle is cultural rooted in the Lutheran work ethic and our self valuation according to how hard we strive It is challenging to tackle such deep rooted social and personal norms But given how exhausted many of us are by the end of the week and how welcome the idea of more time caring for our loved ones our communities and ourselves the side of life that cannot be made more productive it seems like a challenge worth taking on A shorter working week is being tried in Sweden where some care homes and hospitals are experimenting with a six hour day and in companies such as Serps Invaders an Edinburgh digital marketing company where all staff work four days a week and can also work remotely and take a day s leave without notice It s not a new idea John Maynard Keynes predicted in the 1930s that by about now we would all be working a mere 15 hours a week It s about time we got on with it NOTE Document rescinded posted for information purposes onlyFINAL EDITION OCTOBER 1998TABLE OF CONTENTForeward Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION

to the manner in which the work is to be performed or broad imprecise statements of work which preclude an objective assessment of contractor performance It is designed to ensure that contractors are given freedom to determine how to meet the Government s performance objectives that appropriate performance quality levels are achieved and that payment is made only for services that meet these levels This document contains best practices that have proven useful for drafting statements of work solicitations and quality assurance plans and in awarding and administering performance based

nor is it intended to serve as a detailed how to manual Such manuals exist already and citations to them are included at Appendix 1 The purpose of this publication is to assist agencies in developing policies and procedures for implementing PBSC The practices contained herein were derived from the experiences of contracting personnel in both government and industry This information was gathered from interviews articles and existing government guidance We wish to thank the procurement and program officials from the Executive Departments and agencies and those representatives from the private sector who provided information on their experiences with PBSC We especially appreciate the participation of those agency officials who were willing to be innovative in promoting and implementing this

checklist of key elements of PBSC acquisitions PBSC was pioneered within the Department of Defense with a great deal of success However this proven methodology has yet to be fully implemented governmentwide for a variety of reasons including inexperience in writing performance based statements of work cultural inertia and concerns about more open and interactive communication with industry throughout the acquisition process To promote implementation of this policy OFPP initiated in October 1994 a governmentwide pledge pilot project to encourage the use of PBSC Services covered by the pledge ranged from janitorial and guard services to computer maintenance and aircraft and technical support See Appendix 4 for a list of services that provide targets of opportunity for PBSC The governmentwide pledge was further supported by four industry associations representing over 1 000 companies They pledged to utilize conflict resolution mechanisms to avoid protests and disputes identify services convertible to performance based contracting on a fixed price basis work with the government to eliminate obstacles to implementing this initiative and identify commercial contracting practices adaptable for use by the government As a result of the pledge 15 agencies converted 26 contracts with an estimated value of 585 million to performance based methods The agencies reported an average 15 percent reduction in contract price in nominal dollars and an 18 percent improvement in satisfaction with the contractors work Moreover reduced prices and increased customer satisfaction occurred at all price ranges for both nontechnical and professional and technical services and whether the contract remained fixed price or was converted from cost reimbursement to fixed

ARNET www arnet gov As evidenced by the results of the pledge incentives for agencies to implement PBSC are numerous For program personnel PBSC is a tool that offers improved contractor performance For budget offices PBSC has already demonstrated significant cost savings For managers PBSC improves mission attainment and implements the principles of streamlining and innovation of the National Performance Review NPR as well as the Government Performance and Results Act Further personnel who participate on PBSC acquisitions will have the opportunity to attain recognition for their successes In addition contractors who do well on initial PBSC efforts will gain an advantage on future solicitations where past performance is a significant evaluation factor Conversion to performance based contracting for Navy aircraft maintenance resulted in immediate savings of 25 million Additional savings are anticipated through the positive and negative incentives contained in the contract The proposal evaluation and award process took 30 days less than was needed for the previous non performance based competition Working with industry as a team to meet Navy aircraft maintenance requirements resulted in dollars and time savings So far performance is surpassing the contract s minimum required standards The National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA saved enough money from converting a janitorial services contract to PBSC to reinstate several tasks previously cut due to a lack of sufficient funds The Environmental Protection Agency EPA saved enough money from its first PBSC Superfund task order to fully fund the next task order In converting from a traditional Statement of Work SOW to a PBSC Performance Work Statement PWS some agencies have reported an increased initial up front investment However the resulting savings to the agency through the use of PBSC will quickly offset the initial up front costs In addition the quality improvement expected from this type of contract and the resulting expected reduction in overall contract administration costs will again offset the initial up front costs and should provide program offices with additional resource availability PBSC will help to correct problems commonly associated with services contracts and identified in numerous audits including cost overruns schedule delays failure to achieve specified results and other performance problems This document is intended to facilitate implementation of PBSC Appendix 5 lists references used in compiling this document The contract statement of work which is referred to as the PWS is the foundation of performance based services The PBSC PWS describes the effort in terms of measurable performance standards outputs These standards should include such elements as what when where how many and how well the work is to be performed A Quality Assurance Plan QAP which directly corresponds to the performance standards and measures contractor performance is needed to determine if contractor services meet contract PWS requirements Positive and or negative performance incentives based on QAP measurements should be included The PWS Performance Standards QAP and Incentives are interdependent and must be compatible in form style and substance and should be cross referenced For a procurement to be a true PBSC it should contain a PWS QAP and appropriate financial incentives Application of only selected aspects of the total PBSC methodology is not likely to be successful and can even cause a reduction in the value of services provided Agencies have reported negative experiences due to the failure to define work in completion terms to develop or enforce measurable Government quality assurance plans and to place sufficient financial risk on the contractor One agency limited its implementation of PBSC to the fee portion of several major contracts It did not use negative incentives and payment of the cost portion of the contracts was not tied to performance requirements and standards A GAO report found that the agency paid much higher fees yet the contractors performance did not improve Proactive management support and direction from the highest agency levels disseminated throughout the agency including field operations also is important to the success of PBSC Cultural inertia and lack of experience two large detriments to use of PBSC can be overcome by positive agency support for PBSC A directive signed by the Deputy Director of the Defense Logistics Agency DLA was sent to all personnel stressing PBSC and the importance of program and procurement personnel working together The NASA Administrator emphasized the importance of PBSC in a memorandum to all NASA field centers and NASA s Procurement Executive visited each field center to promote the use of PBSC Now each field center is stressing the use and importance of PBSC The Deputy Administrator General Services Administration GSA affirmed the use of PBSC in a memorandum to Senior Management and asked for their help in stressing the use of PBSC to statement of work preparers and contracting personnel involved in service contracting The Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research Development and Acquisition emphasized to the Navy acquisition community the goals of PBSC and indicated that PBSC should be adopted at all contracting activities Signing the PBSC pledge led the Railroad Retirement Board to establish a three person agency executive committee that met with contracting and technical personnel to develop and manage the implementation of PBSC The committee members included the directors of three agency bureaus data processing supply and service and disability Medicare claims processing The three person executive committee provided oversight to the technical and procurement staff involved in the procurement Training for program and contracting personnel that includes how to write both PWSs and QAPs as well as other aspects of PBSC is of equal importance to the success of PBSC Training can be accomplished by internal resources external sources or modifying existing training to include PBSC The Department of Energy DOE modified its project management course to include PBSC and contracted for a prototype training package exclusively for program personnel to help define their duties and roles in implementing PBSC DOE also developed an electronic bulletin board to advertise their best practices and lessons learned on PBSC and other procurement reform efforts DLA distributed diskette copies of the NAVFAC model PWSs and QAPs as guides for its field activities and encouraged them to utilize NAVFAC training courses to develop skills for writing their own PWSs and compatible QAPs To aid agencies in implementing PBSC OFPP has solicited information on training programs or courses covering the development of PWSs and QAPS Appendix 6 contains a list of these sources While inclusion on this list is not an endorsement of any particular course or organization we hope that the information will be helpful to agencies interested in PBSC training and that agencies will utilize these resources Agencies experienced in the use of PBSC have established a process that provides a useful model to follow when implementing PBSC In general the steps in this process are performing a job analysis writing the PWS and QAP concurrently and performing diligent contractor surveillance after contract award This document addresses each of these important steps Job analysis involves determining what the agency s needs are and what kinds of services and outputs are to be provided by the contractor This is of particular importance because the services or outputs identified form the basis for establishing performance requirements developing performance standards and indicators writing the PWS and producing the QAP If the job analysis is done properly writing the PWS and QAP will be facilitated In general job analysis includes agency or activity organization work to be performed by the contractor performance standards directives data gathering and cost Organization AnalysisOrganization analysis involves reviewing the agency s needs and identifying the services and outputs required from the contractor It should emphasize the outputs the contractor will produce but should not dictate how to produce these outputs DOE s analysis of its protective force program resulted in a determination that it no longer needed armed and specially trained security guards The change from armed to unarmed protective forces reduced contract payroll costs significantly Further contract labor hours necessary to support an armed force were eliminated These changes resulted in an approximate annual savings of 500 000 Work AnalysisWork analysis involves further analyzing the required outputs by breaking down the work into its lowest task level and linking tasks in a logical flow of activities Agencies should start with the overall service or output required from the contractor then divide the job into all its parts and subparts and identify the relationships among all the parts One method to accomplish this analysis is a tree diagram It is a chart that divides a job into parts and subparts each of which contributes to a final result or output and demonstrates its relationship to the others Appendix 7 contains a sample tree diagram Identifying all outputs from tasks and subtasks required of the contractor is important Failure to do so will result in incomplete or ambiguous contractual requirements that may be difficult to enforce or lead to contractor misinterpretation and inadequate performance GSA reports that SOW and QAP preparation training provided by NAVFAC to GSA s pledge participants provided an excellent foundation for using job analysis techniques Ft Bragg established a Process Action Team PAT to develop a standard format for the PWS and QAP This was copied on a disk in WordPerfect and given to customers along with instructions on how to complete it All the specifications were numbered and samples for technical exhibits were included The instructions query the customers concerning their requirements The results are then integrated into final form Performance Analysis and StandardsPerformance analysis assigns a performance requirement to each task which involves determining how a service can be measured and what performance standards and quality levels apply The performance standard establishes the performance level required by the government Correspondingly the acceptable quality level AQL establishes a maximum allowable error rate or variation from the standard For example in a requirement for taxi services the performance standard might be pickup within five minutes of an agreed upon time The AQL then might be five percent i e the taxi could be more than five minutes late no more than five percent of the time Failure to perform within the AQL would result in a contract price reduction Under the Navy aircraft maintenance contract requirements are stated in measurable terms such as ground abort rate is less than five percent 100 percent of flight schedules are met and aircraft are 80 percent mission capable Agencies should insure that each standard is necessary is carefully chosen and not unduly burdensome Failure to do so can result in unnecessarily increased contract costs The Railroad Retirement Board converted a contract for data entry services to include a performance based statement of work They experienced approximately 30 percent cost savings By going through the process of developing a PBSC PWS they identified and eliminated unnecessary requirements The estimated type and volume of source documents to be converted decreased by 14 percent Vendor pricing was based on a more accurate and realistic profile of work to be performed Care must be exercised in establishing the quality level at which performance standards are set The minimum acceptable performance standard should rarely be 100 percent since the standard directly affects the cost of the service Conversely if the quality level is too low it may act as disincentive to good contract performance Where appropriate agencies may provide either a specific performance standard or allow the contractor the option to propose different target levels of standards of service along with the appropriate price adjustment This allows contractors an opportunity to propose what they consider to be the most cost effective performance standard level In order to properly evaluate alternative levels of standards proposed by the contractor agencies need to do market research into the feasibility of accepting these alternative levels i e discussing with commercial entities their contracting methods and acceptable levels of standards for the same type of service In a GSA contract for custodial requirements specification writers only identified desired quality levels Offerors technical proposals only identified the frequency and methods to be employed to meet the quality standard The result was maximum flexibility for the contractors Standards may be published or well recognized industry wide standards or may be developed by the agency Agency standards should have industry input to ensure they are realistic and effective This may be done through public meetings public comment on proposed standards or Requests for Information RFIs per FAR 15 405 If there are a number of tasks and deliverables agencies should summarize them in a performance requirements summary PRS A PRS usually lists tasks deliverables standards and quality levels Appendix 8 contains sample PRS tables Directives AnalysisAll potentially relevant agency directives should be screened to determine which should be utilized either in whole or in part Directives that are unnecessary or that apply only in part should not be referenced or included in their entirety Negative effects from excessive or inappropriate application of specifications include confusion or errors in performing work undermining the government s ability to enforce required performance unjustifiable increases in the cost of performance unwarranted dictation of how work is to be performed and discouraging or preventing contractor use of innovative or cost effective performance methods Wherever possible agencies should excerpt required portions of directives and include them in the PWS If this is impractical agencies should incorporate the required portions by reference Entire documents should not be incorporated by reference when only a portion of the document applies Directives may also be an information source for developing task descriptions and quality standards Data GatheringAgencies should provide the contractor an estimate of the workload to be performed and the items and services that the government will furnish to the contractor for the performance of the contract In order to make the workload estimate a determination of the historical workload by the major performance categories must be made In addition agencies must clearly identify the amount and types of items and services that it will provide to the contractor e g electrical equipment furniture The historical workload data gathered may be used in cost estimating and analysis and should be used as a baseline to estimate the future work requirements to be covered in the contract This is especially important so that the offerors in addition to the incumbent can gain sufficient familiarity with the work in order to compete effectively Also the estimate of the future work requirements and government furnished items is critically important as the basis for the offerors to provide realistic cost estimates In preparing a solicitation for telephone hotline services EPA used its extensive workload data as an attachment to the solicitation The data included an analysis of call volume since 1989 This enabled industry to gain a better understanding of the requirement and the magnitude of the workload It also allowed EPA to shift the burden of having the capacity to handle surges to the contractor under a fixed price contract Under the previous cost type contract EPA had been paying to keep extra operators standing by even when they weren t needed Needed workload data is often available from existing management information subsystems or other databases or records such as sampling or on the job observation If workload data is not available various techniques can be used to generate it For example agencies can provide their best estimate of the data or if there is sufficient time before the award of the contract the program personnel can immediately begin collecting workload data for a sufficient period of time to use for projections Some agencies have placed a performance requirement in the PWS for the incumbent contractor to maintain accurate workload data This information can be used to help develop the baseline for future contract work estimates Agencies should place workload data and applicable documentation in a central area e g a reference room where all potential offerors will have access to it and can readily use it in preparing their bids Cost AnalysisEstimated costs must be computed for each service or output based on available data These costs are used in preparing the government estimate evaluating proposals and determining positive and negative performance incentives For commercial services the marketplace should provide a sufficient baseline for cost estimating In the development of their independent government estimates agencies should include consideration of commercial costs of performing work in the private sector IncentivesIncentives should be used when they will induce better quality performance and may be either positive negative or a combination of both They should be applied selectively to motivate contractor efforts that might not otherwise be emphasized and to discourage inefficiency Incentives should apply to the most important aspects of the work rather than every individual task Where negative incentives are used the deduction should represent as close as possible the value of the service lost This amount is usually computed by determining the percentage of contract costs associated with each task For example if a given task represents 10 percent of the contract costs then 10 percent will be the potential maximum deduction in the event of task failure Similarly if a task is not performed to the AQL stated in the quality standards of the contract deductions are computed based upon tables or formulas designed to reflect the value of substandard output For example a task having an AQL of five percent defects would have its unit price reduced incrementally for each percent of defects exceeding the AQL The Navy aircraft maintenance contract contains both positive and negative incentives As a positive incentive the material management function was turned over to the contractor Material is obtained on a cost reimbursable basis but the contractor earns a 15 percent positive incentive for cost avoidance This bonus is calculated by comparing actual material costs with historical material costs adjusted by the Consumer Price Index As a negative incentive the contract is priced at a ready for training rate of 75 percent To the extent this level of performance is not attained the contract price is reduced proportionately For example an actual ready for training rate of 60 percent results in a 20 percent price reduction The definitions of standard performance maximum positive and negative performance incentives and the units of measurement should be established in the solicitation They will vary from contract to contract and are subject to discussion during a source selection Care must be taken to ensure that the incentive structure reflects both the value to the government of the various performance levels and a meaningful incentive to the contractor Performance incentives should be challenging yet reasonably attainable The goal is to reward contractors for outstanding work but not penalize them for fully satisfactorily but less than outstanding work The Tennessee Valley Authority TVA established a cash incentive for a raw water treatment service contract by creating a fee pool to which both TVA and the contractor contribute The TVA business team evaluates the contractor s performance semiannually and if the contractor meets the established performance evaluation criteria they are awarded their contribution to the fee pool If they exceed the established performance evaluation criteria they receive all or a portion of TVA s contribution to the fee pool However before TVA awards any portion of its contribution to the fee pool the contractor must have demonstrated cost savings to TVA in excess of the fee pool incentive payment e g if the contractor is awarded one percent they must have saved TVA two percent or more Incentives are especially useful in efforts that are complex have a high dollar value or have a history of performance or cost overrun problems NASA s cost type Space Station contract provides that the contractor will be docked 25 cents for every dollar of cost overrun but will earn an additional 25 cents for every dollar saved In addition all fee payments are provisional and are subject to recoupment if station hardware fails to perform Incentives should correlate with results Agencies should avoid rewarding contractors for simply meeting minimum standards of contract performance and create a proper balance between cost performance and schedule incentives The incentive amount should correspond to the difficulty of the task required but should not exceed the value of the benefits the government receives Agencies need to follow up to ensure that desired results are realized i e that incentives actually encourage good performance and discourage unsatisfactory performance Verifying the effectiveness of the incentives used is important NASA reduced program costs for the Space Shuttle by approximately 350 million since FY 90 by the use of special contractual incentives These incentives included special incentive fees such as award fees for exceptional cost performance and value engineering provisions The award fee for exceptional cost performance is used to incentivize the contractor to initiate innovations cost management and cost reduction measures that reduce operation costs while maintaining excellent performance The award fee is earned incrementally during performance and is in addition to and separate from any other fees available under the contract and is available only when the contractor earns a performance rating of excellent for the award fee period The amount of the fee earned is based upon a formula established by the contract and no fee can be earned during any period when the actual contract costs exceed the should cost estimate Past performance report cards per FAR 42 15 should reflect adherence to performance requirements when a PWS has been used Performance under PBSC provides better data for evaluation of past performance under other solicitations A powerful incentive of excellence and customer satisfaction is created when contractors know their performance will influence future award decisions The key elements of a PBSC PWS are a statement of the required services in terms of output a measurable performance standard for the output and an AQL or allowable error rate These will have been established during the job analysis phase discussed in Chapter 3 The PWS describes the specific requirements the contractor must meet in performance of the contract It also specifies a standard of performance for the required tasks and the quality level the government expects the contractor to provide ContentAgencies should identify only those outputs that are essential and should be a part of the PRS Agencies should express the outputs in clear concise commonly used easily understood measurable terms Agencies should not repeat material in the PWS that is already included in other parts of the contract Agencies also should not include detailed procedures in the PWS that dictate how work is to be accomplished Instead they should structure the PWS around the purpose of the work to be performed i e what is to be performed rather than how to perform it For example instead of requiring that the lawn be mowed weekly or that trees be pruned each Fall state that the lawn must be maintained between 2 3 or that tree limbs not touch utility wires or buildings A GSA vehicle maintenance specification for service calls was changed from an hourly rate to a price per occurrence This resulted in a noticeable difference in the contract price The Air Force found that it saved 50 percent by specifying that floors must be clean free of scuff marks and dirt and have a uniformly glossy finish rather than requiring that the contractor strip and rewax the floors weekly Under the Navy contract for aircraft maintenance the contractor is held to a standard of performance and is empowered to use best commercial practices and management innovation in performance The contract does not specify how many plane captains mechanics or parachute riggers are required to be in a crew or on the job To the maximum extent practicable the PWS should be a stand alone document with minimal references to regulatory or other guidance Only mandatory requirements should be referenced StyleAgencies should write the PWS using precise terms and clear concise wording Agencies should not use broad or vague statements or overly technical language Agencies should use the active voice task oriented statements verb noun sentence structure and the emphatic form of the verb to establish a binding imperative For example say The contractor shall or must provide X rather than X will be provided To prevent misunderstandings agencies should avoid abbreviations and acronyms as much as possible Agencies should define any abbreviations and acronyms that are used the first time they appear in a document and or include them in a glossary or appendix Agencies should avoid using ambiguous words and phrases For example say keep driveways clear of snow so that depth does not exceed two inches or maintain grass between two and three inches high rather than clear snow as required or mow grass as necessary The PWS should contain consistent terminology Use the same words throughout the PWS when addressing the same thing This is particularly important when referring to technical requirements MethodAgencies should use an interdisciplinary team approach in developing the PWS and include at a minimum the contracting officer and a technical representative The program manager or a designee of the acquisition executive or the Agency head should establish the team Additional team members may include an attorney a writing advisor and a representative from the customer user staff Whenever possible at least one team member should be experienced in PBSC contracting techniques Once established the team should designate a team leader to serve as a facilitator This team approach will result in a better final product and limit the potential for disagreements among agency officials prior to award and during contract performance It also serves to involve program personnel early in the acquisition process This is important because implementation of the PBSC program resides predominantly with the program office Program personnel are primary points of contact for PBSC projects Contracting officers should actively promote the benefits of PBSC to the program offices To this end continued collaboration throughout the acquisition process is important This approach worked well for GSA where SOW preparers and contracting personnel worked as a team from the beginning Together they received PWS training and developed a strategy for implementing PBSC in the pledge They plan to use this approach in addressing future needs EPA assembled a team to develop methods to contract for Superfund remedial projects using PBSC The team consisted of a contracting specialist the Remedial Section chief and the project officer The first project awarded using the techniques developed by the team resulted in a contract award nearly 1 million less than the government estimate for the work Whenever possible agencies should utilize Solicitations for Information Purposes see FAR 15 405 including draft statements of work and requests for comments to refine the PWS Review by and input from potential sources provides an effective way to screen the PWS for accuracy comprehensiveness and clarity It also serves as an excellent tool to identify aspects of the PWS that would unnecessarily restrict competition or raise costs or discourage contractor innovation Early involvement of industry is important Potential sources should be asked whether certain quality requirements are significant cost drivers so the government can consider whether they are worth the extra cost Appendix 9 contains a sample Request for Comment The Department of Health and Human Services HHS had clear success issuing a draft solicitation for computer maintenance They received useful comments from industry which led them to re evaluate some aspects of their technical approach and recognize areas in need of clarification HHS experienced fewer problems with the solicitation as a result The Navy issued a draft RFP which solicited industry inputs or alternatives to military specifications and standards In response to industry s submissions many military specifications and standards were deleted from the work statement Some were deleted with no replacement while others were replaced with commercial standards To the extent possible agencies should disseminate draft RFPs and solicitations electronically This saves time and money and may result in greater competition Many agencies place acquisition information on the INTERNET and have established a link to their agency home pages on the ARNET This information may be accessed at http www arnet gov AcqOpp AcqOpp html The Department of Transportation posted the National Highway and Safety Transportation Administration s property and inventory control system RFP on the Internet This was done in the interest of expediency to save printing costs and to test electronic data interchange NASA s Acquisition Internet Service NAIS includes all synopses and competitive solicitations over 25 000 The address for this site is http procurement nasa gov NAIS also allows interested businesses to designate procurement categories for which they would like to receive automatic E mail notification To the extent available agencies should utilize existing model PWSs particularly those tested in application Agencies often do not have to start from scratch to develop a PWS Appendix 10 contains a list of generic PBSC documents developed by working groups consisting of agency technical and professional personnel to assist agencies in converting selected professional and technical services to PBSC methods Copies of these documents are available from the EOP Publications Office and the ARNET The QAP defines what the government must do to ensure that the contractor has performed in accordance with the PWS performance standards This can range from a one time inspection of a product or service to periodic in process inspections of on going product or service delivery It is needed to ensure the government receives the quality of services called for under the contract and pays only for the acceptable level of services received Since the QAP is intended to measure performance against standards in the PWS these interdependent documents must be coordinated Accordingly writing the two documents simultaneously is both effective and efficient ContentA good QAP should include a surveillance schedule and clearly state the surveillance method s to be used The QAP development establishes how resources will be used to ensure that the government receives what it is paying for Development of the QAP also allows the agency to clearly define the amount of contract administration resources needed The detail in the QAP regarding a particular task should be consonant with the importance of the task The QAP should focus on the quality quantity and timeliness etc of the performance outputs to be delivered by the contractor and not on the steps required or procedures used to provide the product or service StyleThe PWS and QAP may be combined into one document This makes it easier for both the contractor and inspector to understand and administer the contract requirements See Chapter 4 for best practices that are equally applicable to the QAP MethodSelecting the most appropriate surveillance method for the effort involved is important Agencies should take into consideration task criticality task lot size surveillance period performance requirements and standards availability of quality assurance evaluators QAEs surveillance value in relation to task cost criticality and available resources Careful selection of appropriate surveillance methods enables the government to determine the amount of resources and associated costs needed to perform the surveillance task Acceptable surveillance methods include Agencies should discuss the surveillance methods to be used with the contractor to confirm that they are fully understood Whatever form of surveillance used agencies should take care to ensure that no undue interference with contractor operations occurs Agencies also should avoid relying on cumbersome and intrusive process oriented inspection and oversight programs to assess contractor performance The Department of Commerce included the contractor on a grounds maintenance contract as a partner in implementing the contract monitoring and reporting requirements This resulted in a continuing dialogue between the two parties about contract performance focused on results Surveillance must be performed as stated in the QAP for the covered contract It includes scheduling observing documenting accepting service and determining payment due QAE RequirementsQAEs must be fully qualified to meet the major responsibilities of the position maintaining complete and accurate documentation a good relationship with the contractor and thorough knowledge of the contract requirements Experience and training are essential for effective surveillance The QAE should be identified with a letter of assignment that includes a copy of the contract and surveillance plan It should include cautions against making legal interpretations imposing tasks not in the contract supervising contractor employees or waiving contract requirements A copy of the letter should be provided to the Administrative Contracting Officer Ideally the QAE should be dedicated full time to quality assurance activities If this is not possible the QAE aspect of the individual s job should be a critical element in their performance appraisal Surveillance RequirementsContractors should be briefed on surveillance requirements and responsibilities at a post award conference Surveillance should be comprehensive systematic and well documented Reviewing and discussing the contractor s plan for maintaining an acceptable quality level under the contract is important In many cases contractors are required to submit a Quality Control Plan to the government prior to the post award conference One way to document surveillance is through use of a surveillance checklist See Appendix 11 for a sample Techniques include inspections correspondence reviews customer surveys and audits When performance is deficient the contracting officer should notify the contractor promptly and implement the agency s system to track corrective action ExtentThe extent of surveillance is determined by the surveillance schedule established in the QAP It should be systematic and sufficient to fairly evaluate the contractor s total performance throughout the performance period Where surveillance results show good performance consistently the amount of surveillance should be adjusted accordingly This saves the government money reduces oversight burdens on the contractor and recognizes the contractor s achievement of performance Agencies should select contract types that are most likely to motivate contractors to perform optimally PBSC encourages and enables the increased use of fixed price contracts and incentives to encourage optimal performance Fixed PriceFixed price contracts are appropriate for services that can be objectively defined in the solicitation and for which risk of performance is manageable For such acquisitions performance based statements of work measurable performance standards and surveillance plans are ideally suited The contractor is motivated to find improved methods of performance in order to increase its profits Cost ReimbursementCost reimbursement contracts are appropriate for services that can only be defined in general terms or for which the risk of performance is not reasonably manageable To the maximum extent practicable PBSC methods should be used for these contracts Where possible they should include specific incentive provisions in addition to the award fee to insure that contractors are rewarded for good performance as well as quality assurance deduction schedules to assure satisfactory performance Time and Material Labor Hour ContractsWhen the use of time and material labor hour contracts is appropriate agencies should employ PBSC methods to the maximum extent feasible Previously Acquired ServicesWhen acquiring services that previously have been acquired by contract agencies should rely on experience knowledge and historical data gained from the prior contract to incorporate PBSC methods Where appropriate conversion from cost reimbursement to fixed price arrangements should be accomplished The OFPP report on the results of the PBSC pilot project demonstrated that converting cost reimbursement non PBSC contracts to fixed price PBSC contracts resulted in significantly reduced contract prices On average prices for these contracts fell by 21 percent in nominal dollars The Department of Treasury awarded a recurring base operating support services contract using PBSC They converted from a cost reimbursement to a fixed price contract and on a 6 million requirement achieved savings of over 20 percent including the effects of inflation Treasury also believes the government will realize further future savings since a cost type contract would have required at least five audits at a cost of approximately 5 000 per audit In addition a considerable amount of staff time will be saved due to decreased contract administration DOE estimates it annually will save approximately 400 000 from a 2 3M requirement due to the change from its sole source cost plus fixed fee contract to a competitive firm fixed price contract for a site protective services contract Partial Use of PBSC MethodsIn situations where the entire contract is not conducive to PBSC many tasks nevertheless may be defined in performance based terms In these situations PBSC methods should be used to the maximum extent possible A cost reimbursement level of effort term contract could be converted to a fixed price completion contract defining as much of the requirement in performance based terms as possible A labor hour arrangement could be used for the remainder of the requirement that could not be sufficiently defined or to accommodate unpredictable spikes in workload EPA s contract for telephone hotline services was awarded on a fixed price basis The contractor used past history compiled by EPA to determine the amount of work it could expect To provide additional flexibility for an emergency or crisis quantity options fixed price per hour were included Agencies also should consider breaking up large umbrella contracts experiencing cost overruns or performance problems This will often enable the use of PBSC for large portions of the umbrella contract The amount of money saved the improved performance and the reduced contract administration effort often can outweigh the added cost of awarding and administering multiple contracts Agencies should award more performance based task orders competitively when they use task order contracts They should define their requirements in such a manner that performance based task orders can be fixed price Good contract administration is essential to the success of PBSC and requires the cooperation of both program and procurement offices Cooperation is needed to identify any organizational barriers to fostering teamwork Such cooperation should be instilled and reinforced at the executive levels of management in the agency The Customs Service has bi weekly meetings between technical and procurement personnel to discuss procurement issues including PBSC PBSC offers opportunities in line with NPR principles for streamlining and innovation in the contract administration audit process A primary benefit of the PBSC method is that it enables agencies to shift their emphasis from processes to outputs DOE has revamped its audit and appraisal process to bring it in line with PBSC The focus has shifted from process to outputs PBSC streamlining extends to the entire acquisition process It includes requirements definition proposal preparation and contract administration The Air Force used PBSC for a product design procurement On a billion dollar procurement the streamlined process reduced procurement administrative lead time by 66 percent cut program staff by 75 percent and drove costs down by nearly 40 percent The RFP was just 100 pages long compared to an earlier RFP for a similar requirement that was 1 000 pages long The program team was pared from the typical 80 100 people to a cross functional team of 20 people Draft requirements were shared with industry and when the RFP was issued contractors were given just one month to respond which was sufficient due to their prior input Simple performance requirements competition and collaboration were used to create relationships and incentives that produced extraordinary results For other best practices applicable to PBSC see Best Practices for Contract Administration October 1994 Traditionally contracting parties have relied on claims and litigation to resolve disputes However this is often costly and time consuming In the interest of economy and efficiency expeditious and less confrontational resolution procedures are increasingly being utilized Communication and openness throughout the procurement process greatly reduce conflicts The OFPP Pledge Program recognized the value of such procedures by including an agency commitment to institute an informal timely conflict resolution mechanism for resolving pre and post award issues PartneringPartnering is a technique for preventing disputes from occurring Under this concept the agency and contractor perhaps along with a facilitator meet after contract award to discuss their mutual expectations The parties mutually develop performance goals identify potential sources of conflict and establish cooperative ways to resolve any problems that may arise during contract performance Creating a partnership agreement signed by all parties contracting officer QAE COTR program office and contractor creates a buy in to the overall goal of satisfactory performance on time within budget and without claims Within the Department of Defense DOD the Army Corps of Engineers has implemented a partnering program with its contractors and has achieved improved cost schedule and performance goals DOD believes the use of partnering in its contracts improves relationships and communication between government and industry Partnering can transform an adversarial relationship attitude into a professional relationship built on trust and cooperation between the parties Contracting parties that have participated in partnering have experienced the following results more timely performance better cost control significant reductions in paperwork and fewer disputes OmbudsmanSome agencies have established an ombudsman to help resolve concerns or disputes that arise during the acquisition process Typically an ombudsman investigates selected complaints and issues nonbinding reports with recommendations addressing problems or future improvements deemed to be desirable The Army Materiel Command AMC has had an agency ombudsman for several years The ombudsman helps firms to resolve problems they encounter on existing AMC contracts The ombudsman investigates reported complaints or requests for assistance from business industry and ensures that proper action is taken Working directly for the commander the ombudsman is able to cut through organizational red tape and improve the command problem solving process The success of the ombudsman program at Headquarters AMC prompted the establishment of ombudsman programs in all of the subordinate AMC buying commands The AMC wide ombudsman program is a positive force in the timely resolution of problems presented by contractors It contributes to an increased level of sensitivity in the command for handling contractor problems and results in the solution of most problems presented without the need for expensive and time consuming litigation NASA also established an ombudsman program to improve communication between the agency and interested parties The NASA ombudsman hears and works to resolve concerns from actual and potential offerors as well as contractors during the pre and post award acquisition phases Alternative Dispute Resolution ADR ADR means any procedure or combination of procedures used voluntarily to resolve controversies without resorting to litigation Examples of ADR include conciliation facilitation mediation and mini trials ADR can provide an effective and less expensive method for resolving contract disputes Agencies should include an agreement to utilize ADR in their contracts The Navy has used ADR techniques since 1982 and it has been able to resolve issues and controversies in almost 99 percent of the cases in which ADR was used Recently the Navy used ADR to resolve a 1 1 million dispute The hearing on this matter was completed within six hours and a decision was rendered the next day There is no single correct method for conducting ADR Each situation is different and the ADR technique and procedures must be tailored to a particular situation and the needs of the parties The Army has established an acquisition reform working group that meets periodically with industry to discuss upcoming procurements and the use of ADR The DLA has established agency wide guidelines which include consultation with ADR specialists to determine which of the numerous ADR techniques would be appropriate for resolving each dispute situation Several agencies including the Navy the Air Force Army Corps of Engineers and GSA have drafted model ADR agreements These documents can provide useful guidance to agencies in implementing the use of ADR techniques A model agreement is provided at Appendix 12 The best practices included in this document are a first step at providing practical guidance for implementing a performance based approach to service contracting The use of these methods should lead to more cost effective acquisitions better value and greater competition They should have the net effect of shifting some of the manageable performance risk from the government to the contractors Contractors will be given more latitude for determining methods of performance with more responsibility for performance quality The government should experience fewer cost overruns schedule delays and performance problems By using PBSC methods agencies have an opportunity to further the goals of streamlining and reinvention The PBSC process requires agencies to re evaluate their workload to determine what really needs to be done and how best to do it Once a requirement has been subjected to this process future performance based contracting will be easier and agency needs will be better defined and manageable This creates a win win situation for both agencies and contractors The following checklist is provided as a guide that may be used to aid in developing a performance based solicitation contract or task order and to assist in determining whether an existing solicitation contract or task order may be appropriately classified as performance based This checklist is not intended to usurp contracting officer discretion or authority regarding how to structure an acquisition However the more an acquisition departs from adherence to the checklist the less likely the agency will achieve the benefits of improved contractor performance and lower price that PBSC can provide This checklist contains minimum required elements that must be present for an acquisition to be considered performance based To be effective these elements must be communicated to potential offerors in time to be considered when developing their proposals It also contains additional PBSC components important to ensuring the Government obtains the benefits of PBSC and other considerations that are

templates R PRIVATE CORRECTIONAL DETENTION SERVICES POC Timothy L Parry Contracting Officer 202 307 0817 The following is a Request for Comment RFC This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal The President s fiscal year 1996 budget proposes an increase in the use of privatized corrections in the Federal Bureau of Prisons FBOP Specifically the plan is to contract with private corrections concerns to operate the majority of all future Federal pretrial detention minimum and low security CORRECTIONAL facilities The CORRECTIONAL facilities will be Government Owned Contractor Operated and the estimated population capacity of individual prisons is anticipated to be between 800 and 1 600 inmates The purpose of the RFC is to afford industry an opportunity to comment on any perceived issues with regard to the privatization initiative and to allow the Government to receive the benefit of industry comments The Government s purpose in providing an opportunity for industry comment is to identify potential problem areas and provide alternative recommendations in order to enhance the success of the initiative The Government believes industry feedback is important and is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements realizing cost savings or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with the initiative Any comments provided should not be viewed as a vehicle for presenting a specific approach or product intended to be proposed but as an opportunity to improve an eventual solicitation package Comments are solicited regarding the following U S Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Prisons Procurement

intelligence perform more tasks and there is massive disruption of jobs experts say a wider array of education and skills building programs will be created to meet new demands There are two uncertainties Will well prepared workers be able to keep up in the race with AI tools And will market capitalism survive By Lee Rainie and Janna AndersonMachines are eating humans jobs talents And it s not just about jobs that are repetitive and low skill Automation robotics algorithms and artificial intelligence AI in recent times have shown they can do equal or sometimes even better work than humans who are dermatologists insurance claims adjusters lawyers seismic testers in oil fields sports journalists and financial reporters crew members on guided missile destroyers hiring managers psychological testers retail salespeople and border patrol agents Moreover there is growing anxiety that technology developments on the near horizon will crush the jobs of the millions who drive cars and trucks analyze medical tests and data perform middle management chores dispense medicine trade stocks and evaluate markets fight on battlefields perform government functions and even replace those who program software that is the creators of algorithms People will create the jobs of the future not simply train for them and technology is already central It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead Jonathan GrudinMultiple studies have documented that massive numbers of jobs are at risk as programmed devices many of them smart autonomous systems continue their march into workplaces A recent study by labor economists found that one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment to population ratio by about 0 18 0 34 percentage points and wages by 0 25 0 5 percent When Pew Research Center and Elon University s Imagining the Internet Center asked experts in 2014 whether AI and robotics would create more jobs than they would destroy the verdict was evenly split 48 of the respondents envisioned a future where more jobs are lost than created while 52 said more jobs would be created than lost Since that expert canvassing the future of jobs has been at the top of the agenda at many major conferences globally Several policy and market based solutions have been promoted to address the loss of employment and wages forecast by technologists and economists A key idea emerging from many conversations including one of the lynchpin discussions at the World Economic Forum in 2016 is that changes in educational and learning environments are necessary to help people stay employable in the labor force of the future Among the six overall findings in a new 184 page report from the National Academies of Sciences the experts recommended The education system will need to adapt to prepare individuals for the changing labor market At the same time recent IT advances offer new and potentially more widely accessible ways to access education Jobholders themselves have internalized this insight A 2016 Pew Research Center survey The State of American Jobs found that 87 of workers believe it will be essential for them to get training and develop new job skills throughout their work life in order to keep up with changes in the workplace This survey noted that employment is much higher among jobs that require an average or above average level of preparation including education experience and job training average or above average interpersonal management and communication skills and higher levels of analytical skills such as critical thinking and computer skills A central question about the future then is whether formal and informal learning structures will evolve to meet the changing needs of people who wish to fulfill the workplace expectations of the future Pew Research Center and Elon s Imagining the Internet Center conducted a large scale canvassing of technologists scholars practitioners strategic thinkers and education leaders in the summer of 2016 asking them to weigh in on the likely future of workplace training Some 1 408 responded to the following question sharing their expectations about what is likely to evolve by 2026 In the next 10 years do you think we will see the emergence of new educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers in the skills they will need to perform the jobs of the future The nonscientific canvassing found that 70 of these particular respondents said yes such programs would emerge and be successful A majority among the 30 who said no generally do not believe adaptation in teaching environments will be sufficient to teach new skills at the scale that is necessary to help workers keep abreast of the tech changes that will upend millions of jobs See About this canvassing of experts for further details about the limits of this sample Participants were asked to explain their answers and offered the following prompts to consider Several common expectations were evident in these respondents answers no matter how hopeful or fretful they were about the future of skills and capabilities training efforts It is important to note that many respondents listed human behaviors attributes and competencies in describing desirable work skills Although these aspects of psychology cannot be classified as skills and perhaps cannot be directly taught in any sort of training environment we include these answers under the general heading of skills capabilities and attributes A diversifying education and credentialing ecosystem Most of these experts expect the education marketplace especially online learning platforms to continue to change in an effort to accommodate the widespread needs Some predict employers will step up their own efforts to train and retrain workers Many foresee a significant number of self teaching efforts by jobholders themselves as they take advantage of proliferating online opportunities Respondents see a new education and training ecosystem emerging in which some job preparation functions are performed by formal educational institutions in fairly traditional classroom settings some elements are offered online some are created by for profit firms some are free some exploit augmented and virtual reality elements and gaming sensibilities and a lot of real time learning takes place in formats that job seekers pursue on their own A considerable number of respondents to this canvassing focused on the likelihood that the best education programs will teach people how to be lifelong learners Accordingly some say alternative credentialing mechanisms will arise to assess and vouch for the skills people acquire along the way A focus on nurturing unique human skills that artificial intelligence AI and machines seem unable to replicate Many of these experts discussed in their responses the human talents they believe machines and automation may not be able to duplicate noting that these should be the skills developed and nurtured by education and training programs to prepare people to work successfully alongside AI These respondents suggest that workers of the future will learn to deeply cultivate and exploit creativity collaborative activity abstract and systems thinking complex communication and the ability to thrive in diverse environments One such comment came from Simon Gottschalk a professor in the department of sociology at the University of Nevada Las Vegas The skills necessary at the higher echelons will include especially the ability to efficiently network manage public relations display intercultural sensitivity marketing and generally what author Dan Goleman would call social and emotional intelligence This also includes creativity and just enough critical thinking to move outside the box Another example is the response of Fredric Litto a professor emeritus of communications and longtime distance learning expert from the University of S o Paulo We are now in the transitional stage of employers gradually reducing their prejudice in the hiring of those who studied at a distance and moving in favor of such graduates who in the workplace demonstrate greater proactiveness initiative discipline collaborativeness because they studied online Other respondents mentioned traits including leadership design thinking human meta communication deliberation conflict resolution and the capacity to motivate mobilize and innovate Still others spoke of more practical needs that could help workers in the medium term to work with data and algorithms to implement 3 D modeling and work with 3 D printers or to implement the newly emerging capabilities in artificial intelligence and augmented and virtual reality Jonathan Grudin principal researcher at Microsoft commented People will create the jobs of the future not simply train for them and technology is already central It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead Seriously You re asking about the workforce of the future As if there s going to be one Anonymous scientific editorAbout a third of respondents expressed no confidence in training and education evolving quickly enough to match demands by 2026 Some of the bleakest answers came from some of the most respected technology analysts For instance Jason Hong an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University wrote There are two major components needed for a new kind of training program at this scale political will and a proven technology platform Even assuming that the political will and budget existed there s no platform today that can successfully train large numbers of people MOOCs Massive Open Online Courses have a high dropout rate and have serious questions about quality of instruction They are also struggling with basic issues like identification of individuals taking the courses So in short we can train small numbers of individuals tens of thousands per year using today s community colleges and university systems but probably not more Several respondents argued that job training is not a primary concern at a time when accelerating change in market economies is creating massive economic divides that seem likely to leave many people behind An anonymous scientific editor commented Seriously You re asking about the workforce of the future As if there s going to be one Employers either run sweatshops abroad or hire people in the first world to do jobs that they hate while more and more unskilled and skilled people end up permanently on welfare or zero hour contracts And the relatively job secure qualified people who work in the professions are probably a lot closer than they think they are to going over that same cliff The details of how they earn their credentials aren t going to be an issue Most participants in this canvassing wrote detailed elaborations explaining their positions though they were allowed to respond anonymously Their well considered comments provide insights about hopeful and concerning trends These findings do not represent all possible points of view but they do reveal a wide range of striking observations Respondents collectively articulated five major themes that are introduced and briefly explained in the 29 page section below and then expanded upon in more detailed sections Some responses are lightly edited for style or due to length The following section presents a brief overview of the most evident themes extracted from the written responses including a small selection of representative quotes supporting each point Some responses are lightly edited for style or due to length These experts envision that the next decade will bring a more widely diversified world of education and training options in which various entities design and deliver different services to those who seek to learn They expect that some innovation will be aimed at emphasizing the development of human talents that machines cannot match and at helping humans partner with technology They say some parts of the ecosystem will concentrate on delivering real time learning to workers often in formats that are self taught Commonly occurring ideas among the responses in this category are collected below under headings reflecting subthemes Most experts seem to have faith that rapid technological development and a rising wariness of coming impacts of the AI robotics revolution are going to spur the public private and governmental actions needed for education and training systems to be adapted to deliver more flexible open adaptable resilient certifiable and useful lifelong learning Educators have always found new ways of training the next generation of students for the jobs of the future and this generation will be no different Justin ReichJim Hendler a professor of computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute predicted The nature of education will change to a mix of models College education which will still favor multi year residential education will need to be more focused on teaching students to be lifelong learners followed by more online content in situ training and other such elements to increase skills in a rapidly changing information world As automation puts increasing numbers of low and middle skill workers out of work these models will also provide for certifications and training needs to function in an increasingly automated service sector Michael Wollowski an associate professor of computer science at the Rose Hulman Institute of Technology commented We will definitely see a vast increase in educational and training programs We will also see what might be called on demand or on the job kind of training programs We kind of have to as with continued automation we will need to retrain a large portion of the workforce I strongly believe employers will subscribe to this idea wholeheartedly it increases the overall education of their workforce which benefits their bottom line Nevertheless I am a big believer in the college experience which I see as a way to learn what you are all about as a person and in your field of study The confidence in your own self and your abilities cannot be learned in a short course It takes life experience or four years at a tough college At a good college you are challenged to be your best this is very resource intensive and cannot be scaled at this time Justin Reich executive director at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT Teaching Systems Lab observed Educators have always found new ways of training the next generation of students for the jobs of the future and this generation will be no different Our established systems of job training primarily community colleges and state universities will continue to play a crucial role though catastrophically declining public support for these institutions will raise serious challenges David Karger a professor of computer science at MIT wrote Most of what we now call online learning is little more than glorified textbooks but the future is very promising No matter how good our online teaching systems become the current four year college model will remain dominant for quite some time Online teaching will increase the reach of the top universities which will put pressure on lesser universities to demonstrate value One potential future would be for those universities to abandon the idea that they have faculty teaching their own courses and instead consist entirely of a cadre of less well paid teaching assistants who provide support for the students who are taking courses online A few respondents said already established institutions cannot be as fully successful as new initiatives Jerry Michalski founder at REX commented Today s educational and training institutions are a shambles They take too long to teach impractical skills and knowledge not connected to the real world and when they try to tackle critical thinking for a longer time scale they mostly fail The sprouts of the next generation of learning tools are already visible Within the decade the new shoots will overtake the wilting vines and we will see all sorts of new initiatives mostly outside these schooling academic and training institutions which are mostly beyond repair People will shift to them because they work because they are far less expensive and because they are always available Barry Chudakov founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp says education has been liberated because thanks to digital innovation everyone can embed learning continuously in their everyday lives He wrote The key to education in the next 10 years will be the understanding that we now live in a world without walls and so the walls of the school physical and conceptual need to shatter and never go up again In the hopefully near future we will not segregate schooling from work and real world thinking and development They will seamlessly weave into a braid of learning realization exposure hands on experience and integration into students own lives And again the experience of being a student now confined to grade school secondary school and university will expand to include workers those looking for work and those who want or need to retrain as well as what we now think of as conventional education One way we will break down these walls we are already doing so will be to create digital learning spaces to rival classrooms as places where learning happen s Via simulation gaming digital presentations combined with hands on real world experience learning and re education will move out of books and into the world The more likely enhancement will be to take digital enhancements out into the world again breaking down the walls of the classroom and school to inform and enhance experience An anonymous respondent echoed the sentiment of quite a few others who do not think it is possible to advance and enhance online education and training much in the next decade writing These programs have a cost and too few are willing to sacrifice for these programs More such arguments are included in later sections of this report Some respondents expressed confidence in the best of current online education and training options saying online course options are cost effective evolving for the better and game changing because they are globally accessible Those with the most optimism expect great progress will be made in augmented reality AR virtual reality VR and AI While some say 2026 will still be early days for this tech many are excited about its prospects for enhancing learning in the next decade Already today there are quite effective online training and education systems but they are not being implemented to their full potential Edward FriedmanEdward Friedman professor emeritus of technology management at the Stevens Institute of Technology wrote Already today there are quite effective online training and education systems but they are not being implemented to their full potential These applications will become more widely used with familiarity that is gained during the next decade Also populations will be more tech savvy and be able to make use of these systems with greater personal ease In addition the development of virtual reality AI assistants and other technological advances will add to the effectiveness of these systems There will be a greater need for such systems as the needs for new expertise in the workforce increase and the capacity of traditional education systems proves that it is not capable of meeting the need in a cost effective manner The president of a technology LLC wrote Training teaching are all going online partly because of high costs of campus education Richard Adler distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future predicted AI voice response telepresence VR and gamification techniques will come together to create powerful new learning environments capable of personalizing and accelerating learning across a broad range of fields Ray Schroeder associate vice chancellor for online learning at the University of Illinois Springfield commented It is projected that those entering the workforce today will pursue four or five different careers not just jobs over their lifetime These career changes will require retooling training and education The adult learners will not be able to visit physical campuses to access this learning they will learn online I expect that we will see the further development of artificially intelligent teaching specialists such as Jill Watson at Georgia Tech the virtual graduate assistant who was thought to be human by an entire class of computer science students I anticipate the further development and distribution of holoportation technologies such as those developed by Microsoft using HoloLens for real time three dimensional augmented reality These teaching tools will enable highly sophisticated interactions and engagement with students at a distance They will further fuel the scaling of learning to reach even more massive online classes Fredric Litto an professor emeritus of communications and longtime distance learning expert from the University of S o Paulo replied There is no field of work that cannot be learned totally or in great part in well organized and administered online programs either in traditional course formats or in self directed independent learning opportunities supplemented when appropriate by face to face hands on practice situations Tawny Schlieski research director at Intel and president of the Oregon Story Board explained New technologies of human computer interaction like augmented and virtual reality offer the possibility of entirely new mechanisms of education Augmented and virtual reality tools make learning more experiential they engage students with physical movement and they enable interactive and responsive instructional assets As these tools evolve over the next decade the academics we work with expect to see radical change in training and workforce development which will roll into although probably against a longer timeline more traditional institutions of higher learning Many respondents said real world campus based higher education will continue to thrive during the next decade They generally expect that no other educational experience can match residential universities capabilities for fully immersive person to person learning as well as mentoring and socializing functions before 2026 They said a residential university education helps build intangible skills that are not replicable online and thus deepens the skills base of those who can afford to pay for such an education but they expect that job specific training will be managed by employers on the job and via novel approaches Some say major universities core online course content developed with all of the new tech bells and whistles will be marketed globally and adopted as baseline learning in smaller higher education locales where online elements from major MOOCs can be optimally paired in hybrid learning with in person mentoring activities The most important skills to have in life are gained through interpersonal experiences and the liberal arts Human bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion empathy vulnerability and social emotional intelligence Frank ElavskyUta Russmann communications marketing sales professor at the FHWien University of Applied Sciences in Vienna Austria said In the future more and more jobs will require highly sophisticated people whose skills cannot be trained in mass online programs Traditional four year and graduate programs will better prepare people for jobs in the future as such an education gives people a general understanding and knowledge about their field and here people learn how to approach new things ask questions and find answers deal with new situations etc all this is needed to adjust to ongoing changes in work life Special skills for a particular job will be learned on the job Frank Elavsky data and policy analyst at Acumen LLC responded The most important skills to have in life are gained through interpersonal experiences and the liberal arts Human bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion empathy vulnerability and social emotional intelligence These skills are imperative to focus on as the future is in danger of losing these skillsets from the workforce Many people have gained these skills throughout history without any kind of formal schooling but with the growing emphasis on virtual and digital mediums of production education and commerce people will have less and less exposure to other humans in person and other human perspectives Isto Huvila professor at Uppsala University replied The difference between educating to perform and educating to make the future is the difference between vocational education and higher university education Spending four years at a university is not only about learning skills but about bildung self cultivation and socialising in a group that is capable of fostering collaboration much better than an ad hoc group of people But this does not mean that alternative means and paths of learning and accreditation would not be useful as complementary to the traditional system that has limitations as well Dana Klisanin psychologist futurist at Evolutionary Guidance Media R D wrote Educational institutions that succeed will use the tools of social media and game design to grant students access to teachers from all over the world and increase their motivation to succeed Online educational programs will influence the credentialing systems of traditional institutions and online institutions will increasingly offer meet ups and mingles such that a true hybrid educational approach emerges Will training for skills most important in the jobs of the future work well in large scale settings by 2026 Respondents in this canvassing overwhelmingly said yes anticipating that improvements in such education would continue However many believe the most vital skills are not easy to teach learn or evaluate in any education or training setting available today Dozens of descriptive terms were applied by respondents as they noted the skills capabilities and attributes they see as important in workers lives in the next decade The skills needed to succeed in today s world and the future are curiosity creativity taking initiative multi disciplinary thinking and empathy These skills interestingly are the skills specific to human beings that machines and robots cannot do Tiffany ShlainWhile coding and other hard skills were listed as being easiest to teach to a large group in an online setting soft human skills were seen by most respondents as crucial for survival in the age of AI and robotics Devin Fidler research director at the Institute for the Future predicted As basic automation and machine learning move toward becoming commodities uniquely human skills will become more valuable There will be an increasing economic incentive to develop mass training that better unlocks this value Susan Price a digital architect at Continuum Analytics commented Increasingly machines will perform tasks they are better suited to perform than humans such as computation data analysis and logic Functions requiring emotional intelligence empathy compassion and creative judgment and discernment will expand and be increasingly valued in our culture Tiffany Shlain filmmaker and founder of the Webby Awards wrote The skills needed to succeed in today s world and the future are curiosity creativity taking initiative multi disciplinary thinking and empathy These skills interestingly are the skills specific to human beings that machines and robots cannot do and you can be taught to strengthen these skills through education I look forward to seeing innovative live and online programs that can teach these at scale Ben Shneiderman professor of computer science at the University of Maryland observed Students can be trained to be more innovative creative and active initiators of novel ideas Skills of writing speaking and making videos are important but fundamental skills of critical thinking community building teamwork deliberation dialogue and conflict resolution will be powerful A mindset of persistence and the necessary passion to succeed are also critical Louisa Heinrich founder at Superhuman Limited commented Lateral and system thinking skills are increasingly critical for success in an ever changing global landscape and these will need to be re prioritised at all levels of education An anonymous technologist commented Programming and problem solving learning how to work with artificial intelligence and robotics will become more important and more and more workers will be replaced by software hardware based workers Automation will reduce the need for the current workforce and the divide between the upper class and the lower class will continue to eat the middle class Some who are pessimistic about the future of human work due to advances in capable AI and robotics mocked the current push in the U S to train more people in technical skills An anonymous respondent commented Teach a billion people to program and you ll end up with 900 000 000 unemployed programmers An anonymous program director for a major U S technology funding organization predicted We will see training for the jobs of the past and for service jobs The jobs of the future will not need large numbers of workers with a fixed set of skills most things that we can train large numbers of workers for we will also be able to train computers to do better Among the many other skills mentioned were process oriented and system oriented thinking journalistic skills including research evaluation of multiple sources writing and speaking understanding algorithms computational thinking networking and programming grasping law and policy an evidence based way of looking at the world time management conflict resolution decision making locating information in the flood of data storytelling using data and influencing and consensus building A few people mentioned that young adults need to be taught how to have face to face interaction including one who said they seem to be sorely lacking in these skills and can only interact with a cellphone or laptop Because so many intricacies of the workplace the human soft and hard are learned on the job respondents said they expect apprenticeships and forms of mentoring will regain value and evolve along with the 21st century workplace D Yvette Wohn assistant professor of information systems at the New Jersey Institute of Technology wrote Formalized apprenticeships that require both technical skills and interpersonal interaction will become more important Ian O Byrne an assistant professor of literacy education at the College of Charleston replied In the future we ll see more opportunities for online personalized learning This will include open online learning experiences e g MOOCs where individuals can lurk and build up capacity or quench interests I also believe that we ll see a rise in the offering of premium or pay content that creates a space where one to one learning and interaction will allow mentors to guide learners while providing critical feedback We will identify opportunities to build a digital version of the apprenticeship learning models that have existed in the past Alternative credentials and digital badges will provide more granular opportunities to document and archive learning over time from traditional and nontraditional learning sources Through evolving technologies e g blockchain this may provide opportunities for learners to document and frame their own learning pathways An instructional designer with 19 years of experience commented The pattern I m seeing is toward individualized learning almost on the level of tutoring or apprenticeship We ve seen again and again that the broader the audience focus the less the course seems to deliver As for what the skills of the future are they ll be specialized to their fields with a university degree assumed to be a certificate in the ability to learn more about a particular subject specialty You may get a degree in computer software development but the truth is that you still need to be taught how to write software for say the mortgage company or insurance company that hires you The key to the future will be flexibility and personal motivation to learn and tinker with new things As they anticipate the appearance of effective new learning environments and advances in digital accountability systems many of these experts believe fresh certification programs will be created to attest to workers participation in training programs and the mastery of skills Some predict that many more workers will begin using online and app based learning systems Charlie Firestone communications and society program executive director and vice president at The Aspen Institute replied There will be a move toward more precise and better credentialing for skills and competencies e g badging and similar techniques Employers will accept these more as they prove probative And online learning will be more prevalent even as an adjunct to formal classroom learning New industries such as green energy and telemedicine will increase new employment opportunities Despite all of these measures the loss of jobs from artificial intelligence and robotics will exceed any retraining program at least in the short run Sam Punnett research officer at TableRock Media wrote I suspect employers will recognize the new credentialing systems Particularly those certificates awarded for studies in emerging disciplines currently data science appears all the rage and those that reflect an upgrade of previously acquired skills Traditional credentials will continue to hold value but I believe they will be considered in light of a candidates perceived ability in learning how to learn The four year degree and subsequent graduate studies will continue to be less of a guaranty towards employment without work experience Certificates are being viewed more favourably and many universities are lagging in their connection between their pedagogies and working world requirements William J Ward a university communications professor DR4WARD commented Higher Education is doing a poor job of preparing students with the skills they need to succeed in the workforce Online and credentialing systems are more transparent and do a better job on delivering skills People with new types of credentialing systems are seen as more qualified than traditional four year and graduate programs Many workplaces place a higher value on real world work portfolios than they do on a degree or certification yet their hiring systems including AI bots programmed to scan resum s still use the commonly accepted credentials as a basis for interviewing candidates Some respondents hope to see change Schools today turn out widget makers who can make widgets all the same They are built on producing single right answers rather than creative solutions Jeff JarvisA software engineering and system administration professional commented The reliability of the traditional educational system is already being questioned in some fields it s considered common sense that certifications and degrees mean little and that a portfolio references and hands on interviews are much more important for assessing a candidate s ability The unfortunate reality is that many HR departments still post job listings saying degrees and certifications are required as a way of screening candidates Both of those cost a lot of money and neither mean a lot for a candidate s competence I hope this will change both job listings and quality of degrees certifications but don t see it happening soon Meryl Krieger career specialist at Indiana University Bloomington s Jacobs School replied Credentialing systems will involve portfolios as much as resum s resum s simply are too two dimensional to properly communicate someone s skillset Three dimensional materials in essence job reels that demonstrate expertise will be the ultimate demonstration of an individual worker s skills I see credentialing as a piece of a very complex set of criteria these will also incorporate an individual s ability to communicate and work with teams huge in employer requests for new employees which can more readily be documented and tracked through online portfolio tools than through traditional resume formats Thus the educational and training programs of the future will become in their best incarnations sophisticated combinations of classroom and hands on training programs The specific models will necessarily be responding to individual industry requirements Jeff Jarvis a professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism wrote Schools today turn out widget makers who can make widgets all the same They are built on producing single right answers rather than creative solutions They are built on an outmoded attention economy Pay us for 45 hours of your attention and we will certify your knowledge I believe that many not all areas of instruction should shift to competency based education in which the outcomes needed are made clear and students are given multiple paths to achieve those outcomes and they are certified not based on tests and grades but instead on portfolios of their work demonstrating their knowledge While the first three themes found among the responses to this canvassing were mostly hopeful about advances in education and training for 21st century jobs a large share of responses from top experts reflect a significant degree of pessimism for various reasons Some even say the future of jobs for humans is so baleful that capitalism may fail as an economic system The next themes and subthemes examine these responses A large share of respondents predicted that online formats for knowledge transfer will not advance significantly in the next decade The 30 who expressed pessimism were often deeply doubtful about the capabilities of current education systems to adapt to pivot to respond to new challenges as quickly as necessary Interestingly being able to adapt and respond to looming challenges was seen by nearly everyone in this canvassing as one of the most highly prized future capabilities these respondents especially agree that it is important and they say that our human institutions government business education are not adapting efficiently and are letting us down Many of them say that current K 12 or K 16 education programs are incapable of making adjustments within the next decade to serve the shifting needs of future jobs markets Among the other reasons listed by people who do not expect these kinds of transformative advances in job creation and job skill upgrading Some among the 70 of respondents who are mostly optimistic about the future of training for jobs also echoed one or more of the points above mentioning these tension points while hoping for the best Following are representative statements tied to these points and more from all respondents Thomas Claburn editor at large at Information Week wrote I m skeptical that educational and training programs can keep pace with technology Traditional models train people to equate what they do with who they are i e what do you want to be when you grow up rather than to acquire critical thinking and flexible skills and attitudes that fit a rapidly changing world Pamela RutledgeAndrew Walls managing vice president at Gartner wrote Barring a neuroscience advance that enables us to embed knowledge and skills directly into brain tissue and muscle formation there will be no quantum leap in our ability to up skill people Learning takes time and practice which means it requires money lots of money to significantly change the skill set of a large cohort B Remy Cross assistant professor of sociology Webster University commented Lacking a significant breakthrough in machine learning that could lead to further breakthroughs in adaptive responses by a fully online system it is too hard to adequately instruct large numbers of people in the kinds of soft skills that are anticipated as being in most demand As manufacturing and many labor intensive jobs move overseas or are fully mechanized we will see a bulge in service jobs These require good people skills something that is often hard to train online John Bell software developer and teacher at Dartmouth College replied Even today access to information is not the limiting factor in skills education for anyone who can go online While there have been generational gains in the developments of online communities a large scale educational experience either MOOC or on demand broadcasts will not be able to duplicate that Stowe Boyd managing director of Another Voice and a well known thinker on work futures discussed the intangibles of preparing humans to partner with AI and bot systems While we may see the creation and rollout of new training programs he observed it s unclear whether they will be able to retrain those displaced from traditional sorts of work to fit into the workforce of the near future Many of the skills that will be needed are more like personality characteristics like curiosity or social skills that require enculturation to take hold Individual training like programming or learning how to cook may not be what will be needed And employers may play less of a role especially as AI and bot augmented independent contracting may be the best path for many rather than a job Homesteading in exurbia may be the answer for many with forty acres and a bot as a political campaign slogan of 2024 Luis Miron a distinguished university professor and director of the Institute for Quality and Equity in Education at Loyola University in New Orleans wrote Bluntly speaking I have little confidence in the educational sector K 16 having the capacity and vision to offer high quality online educational programs capable of transforming the training needs of the wider society The most important skills are advanced critical thinking and knowledge of globalization affecting diverse societies culturally religiously and politically Pamela Rutledge director of the Media Psychology Research Center wrote The core assumptions driving educational content are not adapting as fast as the world is changing Traditional models train people to equate what they do with who they are i e what do you want to be when you grow up rather than to acquire critical thinking and flexible skills and attitudes that fit a rapidly changing world We have traditional institutions invested in learning as a supply side model rather than demand side that would create proactive self directed learners This bias impacts the entire process from educators to employers It is changing but beliefs are sticky and institutions are cumbersome bureaucracies that are slow to adapt New delivery systems for skills related to technology will be more readily accepted than traditional ones because they avoid much of the embedded bias Successful education models will begin developing mixed methods to leverage technology with traditional delivery and rewrite certification processes with practice relevant standards Justin Reich executive director at the MIT Teaching Systems Lab observed There will continue to be for profit actors in the sector and while some may offer choice and opportunity for students many others will be exploitative with a great er focus on extracting federal grants and burdening students with debt than actually educating students and creating new opportunities John Paine a business analyst commented The competing desires 1 to make educational activity available to all and 2 to monetize the bejeezus out of anything related to the internet will limit the effectiveness of any online learning systems in a more widespread context danah boyd founder of Data Society commented I have complete faith in the ability to identify job gaps and develop educational tools to address those gaps I have zero confidence in us having the political will to address the socio economic factors that are underpinning skill training For example companies won t pay for reskilling and we don t have the political power to tax them at the level needed for public investment in reskilling Furthermore we have serious geographic mismatches underlying discriminatory attitudes and limited opportunities for lower to mid level career advancement What s at stake are not simply skills gaps it s about how we want to architect labor benefits and social safety nets And right now we talk about needing to increase skills but that s not what employers care about It just sounds nice When computer science graduates from CUNY and Howard University can t get a job what s at stake is not skills training Among the future worker capabilities with the highest value in these respondents eyes are the ability to adapt or pivot and the motivation to up skill as needed Many respondents emphasized that the most crucial skill is that people have to learn how to learn and be self motivated to keep learning My biggest concern with self directed learning is that it requires a great deal of internal motivation And I am not confident that individuals will find their way David BersteinDavid Bernstein a former research director wrote The most important skills needed to succeed in the workplace will be flexibility and the ability to adapt and continuously learn My biggest concern with self directed learning is that it requires a great deal of internal motivation And I am not confident that individuals will find their way just as those who enter college today don t know what they want to be when they grow up often until after they graduate So everyone will still need some basic skills interpersonal communications basic arithmetic along with some general culture awareness so they can have that flexibility Any 3 year old can use their parent s smartphone or tablet without reading the manual What I worry about is how well they will adapt when they are 35 or 55 Calton Pu professor and junior chair in software at the Georgia Institute of Technology wrote The most important skill is a meta skill the ability to adapt to changes This ability to adapt is what distinguished Homo sapiens from other species through natural selection As the rate of technological innovation intensifies the workforce of the future will need to adapt to new technology and new markets The people who can adapt the best and fastest will win This view means that any given set of skills will become obsolete quickly as innovations change the various economic sectors precision agriculture manufacturing 4 0 precision medicine just to name a few Therefore the challenge is not only to teach skills but also how to adapt and learn new skills Whether the traditional programs or new programs will be better at teaching adaptive learning remains to be seen Cory Salveson learning systems and analytics lead at RSM US responded The nature of work today and in future is such that if people want to keep increasingly scarce well paying jobs they will need to educate themselves in an ongoing manner for their whole lives Some of these experts say those who aren t motivated to continue to learn and grow will be left behind Scott Amyx CEO of Amyx said online training is advancing and will continue to evolve but The education system is at an inflection point Many ambitious federal and state programs have fizzled to produce dismal to no statistical change in the caliber of K 12 education It s those less educated and less skilled who are most sensitive to technological displacement Online mediums and self directed approaches may be limited in effectiveness with certain labor segments unless supplemented by human coaching and support systems Beth Corzo Duchardt a professor at Muhlenberg College replied Self directed study is a variable that changes the alchemy of teaching and learning It is true that most online courses require self direction Indeed when I advise students I don t recommend that students take online courses unless they have demonstrated an aptitude for self direction But in person courses may also be self directed This works well for some students but not others Students who are self directed often have had a very good foundational education and supportive parents They have been taught to think critically and they know that the most important thing you can learn is how to learn And they are also are more likely to come from economic privilege So not only does the self direction factor pose a problem for teaching at scale the fact that a high degree of self direction may be required for successful completion of coursework towards the new workforce means that existing structures of inequality will be replicated in the future if we rely on these large scale programs Among the 30 of respondents who said they did not think things would turn out well in the future were those who said the trajectory of technology will overwhelm labor markets killing more jobs than it creates They foresee a society where AI programs and machines do most of the work and raise questions about people s sense of identity the socio economic divisions that already distress them their ability to pay for basic needs their ability to use the growing amount of leisure time constructively and the impact of all of this on economic systems It should also be noted that many among the 70 who expect positive change in the next decade also expressed some of these concerns The problem of future jobs is not one of skills training it is one of diminishing jobs How will we cope with a workforce that is simply irrelevant Jennifer ZickermanCory Doctorow activist in residence at MIT Media Lab and co owner of Boing Boing boingboing net responded It s an article of faith that automation begets more jobs than it displaces in the long run but this is a theory free observation based on previous automation booms The current automation is based on general purpose technologies machine learning Turing complete computers a universal network architecture that is equally optimized for all applications and there s good reason to believe that this will be more disruptive and create fewer new jobs than those that came before Glenn Ricart Internet Hall of Fame member and founder and chief technology officer of US Ignite said Up to the present time automation largely has been replacing physical drudgery and repetitive motion things that can and should improve the quality of people s work lives But in the next decade or two there is likely to be a significant amount of technological innovation in machine intelligence and personal assistants that takes a real swipe out of the jobs we want humans to have in education health care transportation agriculture and public safety What are the new jobs we want these people to have If we haven t been able to invent them in response to international trade pacts why are we sure we will be able to create them in the future Richard Stallman Internet Hall of Fame member and president of the Free Software Foundation commented I think this question has no answer I think there won t be jobs for most people a few decades from now and that s what really matters As for the skills for the employed fraction of advanced countries I think they will be difficult to teach You could get better at them by practice but you couldn t study them much Jennifer Zickerman an entrepreneur commented The problem of future jobs is not one of skills training it is one of diminishing jobs How will we cope with a workforce that is simply irrelevant The question isn t how to train people for nonexistent jobs it s how to share the wealth in a world where we don t need most people to work Nathaniel BorensteinNathaniel Borenstein chief scientist at Mimecast replied I challenge the premise of this question that humans will have to be trained for future jobs The jobs of the future are likely to be performed by robots The question isn t how to train people for nonexistent jobs it s how to share the wealth in a world where we don t need most people to work Paul Davis a director based in Australia predicted Whilst such programs will be developed and rolled out on a large scale I question their overall effectiveness Algorithms automation and robotics will result in capital no longer needing labor to progress the economic agenda Labor becomes in many ways surplus to economic requirements This shift will dramatically transform the notion of economic growth and significantly disrupt social contracts labor s bargaining position will be dramatically weakened The nature of this change may require the world to shift to a Post Economic Growth model to avoid societal dislocation and disruption John Sniadowski a systems architect replied The skill sets which could have been taught will be superseded by AI and other robotic technology By the time the training programs are widely available the required skills will no longer be required The whole emphasis of training must now be directed towards personal life skills development rather than the traditional working career based approach There is also the massive sociological economic impact of general automation and AI that must be addressed to redistribute wealth and focus life skills at lifelong learning Tom Sommerville agile coach wrote Our greatest economic challenges over the next decade will be climate change and the wholesale loss of most jobs to automation We urgently need to explore how to distribute the increasing wealth of complex goods and services our civilization produces to a populace that will be increasingly jobless in the traditional sense The current trend of concentrating wealth in the hands of a diminishing number of ultra rich individuals is unsustainable All of this while dealing with the destabilizing effects of climate change and the adaptations necessary to mitigate its worst impacts Some of these experts projected further out into the future imagining a world where the machines themselves learn and overtake core human emotional and cognitive capacities Timothy C Mack managing principal at AAI Foresight said In the area of skill building the wild card is the degree to which machine learning begins to supplant social creative and emotive skill sets This section features responses by several more of the many top analysts who participated in this canvassing Following this wide ranging set of comments on the topic a much more expansive set of quotations directly tied to the set of four themes begins on Page 40 Baratunde Thurston a director s fellow at MIT Media Lab Fast Company columnist and former digital director of The Onion replied Online training and certification will grow significantly in part due to the high expense of formal higher education along with its declining payoffs for certain occupations Why go 100 000 in debt for a four year university when you can take a more targeted course with more guaranteed income generation potential at the end From the employer perspective this type of learning will only grow We are creating a system of on demand labor akin to cloud based labor where companies provision labor resources at will and release them at will not by the year or month but by the job labor unit or small time unit including minutes The automation of human labor will grow significantly And having a workforce trained in discrete and atomizable bits of skills will be seen as a benefit by employers This of course is a terrible soulless insecure life for the workers but since when did that really change anything There will also be a parallel call for benefits professional development and compensation that smooths out the rough patches in this on demand labor life but such efforts will lag behind the exploitation of said labor because big business has more resources and big tech moves too fast for human scale responses of accountability and responsibility To quote Donald Trump Sad Doc Searls journalist speaker and director of Project VRM at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society wrote I don t expect the evolution of work in the connected world to require new educational and training programs Instead I expect we ll see much more adaptive forms of education especially of the self made kind Look at Linux and open source development The world runs on both now and they employ millions of human beings Many or most of the new open source programmers building and running our world today are self taught or teach each other to a higher degree than they are educated by formal schooling Look at Khan Academy and the home schooling movement both of which in many ways outperform formal institutional education The main qualification for programming work isn t a degree It s proven capability This model for employment of self and others will also spread to other professions By the way I don t like the term job It demeans work and reduces the worker to a position in an org chart The great educator John Taylor Gatto who won many awards for his teaching and rarely obeyed curricular requirements says nearly all attempts to reform education make it worse We are by nature learning animals We are each also very different both from each other and from who we were yesterday As a society we need to take advantage of that and nurture our natural hunger for knowledge and productive work while respecting and encouraging our diversity a fundamental balancing feature of all nature human and otherwise Jeff Jarvis professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism wrote At a roundtable on the future convened by Union Square Ventures a few years ago I heard this economic goal presented We need to see the marginal cost of teaching another student fall to zero to see true innovation come to education allowing change to occur outside the tax based and thus safe confines of public education I don t think we ll ever reach zero MOOCs are not the solution But we will likely see a radical economic disruption in education using new tools and means to learn and certify learning and that is the way by which we will manage to train many more people in many new skills Cory Doctorow activist in residence at MIT Media Lab and co owner of Boing Boing boingboing net responded There is for the immediate and medium term a huge shortage of IT talent of course especially security researchers and professionals In part this is driven by the legal and educational framework that takes a zero tolerance approach to the hacking that kids historically engaged in on their way to becoming security researchers If a kid today hacks her school s censoring firewall to look at a blocked site she is expelled and possibly arrested not streamed into an Advanced Placement computer science class We also have a poorly constituted math curriculum for understanding algorithms which is really understanding the statistics of machine learning models An earlier and more enduring focus on stats and statistical literacy which can readily be taught using current affairs for example analyzing the poll numbers from elections the claims made by climate change scientists or even the excellent oral arguments in the Supreme Court Texas abortion law case would impart skills that transferred well into IT programming and especially security Amy Webb futurist and CEO at the Future Today Institute commented Gill Pratt a former program manager of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA recently warned of a Cambrian Explosion of robotics About 500 000 years ago Earth experienced its first Cambrian Explosion a period of rapid cellular evolution and diversification that resulted in the foundation of life as we know it today We are clearly in the dawn of a new age one that is marked not just by advanced machines but rather machines that are starting to learn how to think Soon those machines that can think will augment humankind helping to unlock our creative and industrial potential Some of the workforce will find itself displaced by automation That includes anyone whose primary job functions are transactional bank tellers drivers mortgage brokers However there are many fields that will begin to work alongside smart machines doctors journalists teachers The most important skill of any future worker will be adaptability This current Cambrian Explosion of machines will mean diversification in our systems our interfaces our code Workers who have the temperament and fortitude to quickly learn new menu screens who can find information quickly and the like will fare well I do not see the wide scale emergence of training programs during the next 10 years due to the emergence of smart machines alone If there are unanticipated external events environmental disasters new pandemics and the like that could devastate a country s economy and significantly impact its workforce which might catalyze the development of online learning opportunities Mike Roberts Internet Hall of Fame member and first president and CEO of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN responded MOOCs and related efforts are in their infancy so yes there will be considerable expansion as more is learned about what works and what doesn t work These developments are contributing to a crisis of self confidence in higher ed where traditional scholarship is being challenged on many fronts including the basic definition of education Human brains are complex and it becomes tiresome to see simplistic approaches to education issues Generally an educated person possesses a level of knowledge about the world that allows him or her to use analytical skills induction deduction probability etc to arrive at conclusions that guide behavior The jury is very much out on the extent to which acquisition of knowledge and reasoning skills requires human interaction We now have empirical evidence that a substantial percentage half or more can be gained through self study using computer assisted techniques The path forward for society as a whole is strewn with obstacles of self interest ignorance flawed economics etc If one believes in the singularity it doesn t matter because human machine symbiosis will bury the problem Judith Donath of Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society replied A lot has been written about the need for STEM science technology engineering and mathematics education Here I want to focus on other areas 1 Teaching and Healing As computers robots and other machines take over many jobs we need to reposition the social status of jobs that involve interpersonal care day care teachers nurse elderly coach The issue is not just training but cultural re evaluation of teaching and healing as highly respected skills While technology can assist with this work we mustn t lose sight of the importance of human connections as an end in and of themselves 2 Craft and Repair For the benefit of both the individual and the environment we need to strongly support learning design craft building repair Few of us make anything we use from the building we live in to the objects we own and these things are mostly manufactured as cheaply as possible to be easily bought discarded and bought again in a process of relentless acquisition that often brings little happiness Education here should be integrated into everyday life not just for when one is in school E g much rental housing is in bad repair with tenants waiting weeks months years for even simple fixes a running toilet broken lights a hole in a wall Very easily accessible learning for how to fix these things themselves and making it economically rewarding in the case of a common good is a simple basic example of the kind of ubiquitous craft learning that at scale would be enormously valuable Some of this can be taught online a key component is also online coordination 3 An Informed Citizen What should people know what skills should they have to be informed participants in a democracy Certainly science and technology are important but we need to refocus liberal education not ignore it History in all its complexity Critical thinking how to debate how to recognize persuasive techniques how to understand multiple perspectives how to mediate between different viewpoints Key skill how to research how to evaluate what you see and read David Weinberger a senior researcher at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society said Judging from what we re seeing happening now on the web it seems likely that many of the innovative platforms will be peer to peer Sites like Stack Overflow for software engineers demonstrate a new moral sense that learning in private is selfish Public learning is becoming the norm Brad Templeton chair for computing at Singularity University wrote We will see the start of these technologies but they will not be widespread at the hard problem of adult retraining in 10 years Instead most focus will be on childhood education for the poorer sectors of the world The most important skill flexibility won t be taught easily this way but must become a focus of K 12 education John Markoff former senior writer at The New York Times said We have now passed through the first generation of MOOCs and a new generation of online learning technology is beginning to emerge Udacity is a good example of the trajectory Sebastian Thrun was one of the inventors of the MOOC concept After starting a company to pursue the idea he pivoted focusing specifically on skill oriented education that is coupled directly to the job market Vint Cerf vice president and chief internet evangelist at Google and an Internet Hall of Fame member noted The internet can support remote training and learning These need not be MOOCs Even mobiles can be sources of education I hope we will see more opportunities arising for sharing this kind of knowledge Marcel Bullinga trend watcher and keynote speaker futurecheck replied The future is cheap and so is the future of education I saw an ad already for 1 000 bachelor s level training with an app of course Schools and universities will transform in the same way as shops have done in the past 10 years from analog human first to digital mobile AI first New online credential systems will first complement then gradually replace the old ones The skills of the future Those are the skills a robot cannot master yet Leadership design human meta communication critical thinking motivating cooperating innovating In my black and white moments I say Skip all knowledge training in high schools Main teaching goal We enable you to survive in an ever changing world with ever changing skills and not yet existing jobs of the future We make you better than a robot We let you cooperate with robots We build your self trust We turn you into a decent polite social person And most importantly we do not mix education with religion never Anil Dash entrepreneur technologist and advocate AnilDash predicted These credentials will start to become widespread but acceptance and quality of the training programs will map to the existing systemic biases that inform current educational and career programs Henning Schulzrinne Internet Hall of Fame member and professor at Columbia University wrote Training programs have had the problem that short duration generic programs are often not very effective except as a way to incrementally add very specific skills learn how to operate the new industry specific tool X in a week to the existing repertoire The subject matter specific part of a B S degree in a technical or scientific field takes at least two years often more and these are high intensity full time years often without other responsibilities such as family mostly for students at an age where learning is still natural and easy A large part of this time is spent not in a classroom but becoming fluent through monitored practice including group work internships and other high intensity high interaction apprentice like programs It is hard to see how workers can afford to spend two years without income support while still fulfilling their adult responsibilities such as taking care of their family or elderly parents There are possibilities for adding limited skill sets to otherwise qualified workers e g the ability to program in Python for somebody who already has an economics degree increasing their ability to get their work done The MOOC style programs have shown themselves to be most effective for this delta learning for practicing professionals not turning a high school graduate into somebody who can compete with a college graduate Jamais Cascio distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future responded We will certainly see attempts to devise training and education to match workers to new jobs but for the most part they re likely to fall victim to two related problems 1 The difficulty of projecting what will be the jobs of the future in a world where the targets keep shifting faster and faster Jobs that seem viable may fall victim to a surprising development in automation see for example filmmaking new categories of work may not last long enough to support large numbers of employees 2 We re in an era of general purpose computing which means that our systems are not physically or procedurally limited to a narrow type of work Automation and semi automation e g self checkout stands don t need to completely eliminate a job to make it unable to support large numbers of workers As learning systems improve we will soon if we re not already be at a point where adaptive algorithms can learn new jobs faster than humans Kate Crawford a well known internet researcher studying how people engage with networked technologies wrote We clearly need new educational and training programs to address the deepening precarity of the labor market But to make it successful in that the right training could be developed to make it possible that everyone will have jobs is very unlikely Paul Jones clinical professor and director at the University of North Carolina replied We learn more today by training and information sipping than in the past Training is useful but not the end of education only a kind of education As for sipping you need not know the name of every bear to know you should avoid bears Yet the continual construction of knowledge and cultures requires more from us So far training formally as in Kahn Academy and Lynda com are unarguably effective for continual updates for basic skills No programmer or developer could keep up without the informal training of Stack Overflow Wikipedia hasn t destroyed bar trivia but it has made a dent in our conversational expertise Who played guitar lead on All or Nothing No need for debate A little information sip will let us know We re fine and informed but not educated or learned But what is left out Collaborative construction of knowledge in new areas deeper investigation into known areas and the discovery of entirely new areas of knowledge This is our challenge how to create wisdom from knowledge not just jobs from training and information Bob Frankston internet pioneer and software innovator commented This is a nuanced question We trained generations of people to be phone operators by making it easy to operate the phone aka dialing Today programming is increasingly become a trade The problem with many websites is not so much the training of the programmers as much as getting managers and C level people who understand the new concepts of a world being redefined by software And that s even more true for policymakers We need to think about co evolving work and workers And as always critical thinking will remain the biggest challenge Frank Pasquale author of The Black Box Society The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information and professor of law at the University of Maryland said The biggest danger for the United States educational system is premature vocationalism Rigorous science and humanities courses help students learn how to learn Skills training all too often does not Of course it can complement core academic courses and is likely to be part of a lifetime of learning for those switching occupations But turning high school and college into narrow vocational education programs would make their graduates more vulnerable to robotic replacement not less We need to invest in higher education shoring up support for traditional universities and colleges lest they eventually become bastions for reproduction of an elite leaving the rest of society to untested experiments or online programs Online learning is a good complement for existing colleges but cannot replace them Online only programs emphasize the upside of high tech approaches but rarely grapple with the downside Big data surveillance will track the work students do ostensibly in order to customize learning Get stuck on a lesson Just keep interfacing with a keyboard camera and perhaps haptic sensors Or perhaps IM some reserve army of tutorial labor via digital labor platforms like Mechanical Turk or TaskRabbit Want to prove you aren t faking exams Just let cameras record your every move and keystroke perhaps your eye movements and facial expressions too With new platforms Silicon Valley has lured some universities into giving away lectures for free The colleges think they re establishing good karma with the public but disrupters hope for a more chaotic endgame students deciding to watch free courses then proving their credentials to certifiers who give out badges to signify competence in a skill set The certifiers most likely won t be burdened with any of the teaching research community service counseling career or otherwise recreation social events extracurriculars or other long standing features of residential university communities They will just verify that student X can do task Y It could be a very profitable business If students pay less for actual instruction by experts they have more money to spend on badges This is the for profit model shift money away from instruction and amenities and toward administrator salaries and marketing Unburdened by legacy staff and faculty ed tech firms could muster a just in time workforce to develop new educational technologies Investors could continue unbundling the university into least cost providers of content units student surveillance and badge granting That vision may draw capital but it probably won t be attractive to many students There are serious worries about rapid centralization and reuse of student data by under regulated firms For instance black boxed instructional technology is often run by algorithms that can t be accessed by the students it is assessing Tom Ryan CEO of eLearn Institute Inc responded The degree and perhaps the prestige of the institution gets you the first interview but it is your ability to do good work that keeps the job and move s you to the next level How individuals develop the skills will be less important than having the skills As mastery learning evolves so will our performance based assessment systems providing universities and businesses a greater set of evidence and qualifications then is currently available Our traditional educational systems are burdened by legacy bureaucratic practices that don t contribute to mastery of learning and distract from great teaching and learning People in rural areas don t have physical access to a higher education campus or highly skilled trainers Current job responsibilities don t allow flexible work schedules to seek skills to improve their position K 12 teachers are constantly pulled from class time with students for professional development or during class are required to take attendance complete grade assessments fill out grade checks practice fire drills all degrading quality teaching time If online systems just removed these barriers they would be a great benefit but there is so much more these systems can offer Many of the new skills necessary for jobs of the future require digital skills to be successful Too often education leaders and politicians make unilateral decisions about the interaction between teacher and learner instead of building and maintaining an environment for great teaching and learning to take place Large school systems can t scale major improvements in current systems without leveraging the tools that society and industry are using to transform their practice Barry Chudakov founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp replied One serious drawback to fast tracking needed educational and training programs the people who are creating the jobs of the future have so little time to reflect and gain perspective on the people they will need and how adding these people to their corporate culture changes that culture These entrepreneurs are so busy building technology infrastructures filing patents testing beta incarnations of ideas and processes not to mention navigating the thicket of regulations and restrictions that surround many emerging technologies and industries that they simply don t have time to look around and see the implications of the changes their companies are creating In the near future we will explode the notion of education as a rite of passage for youth happening within the walls of an institution Educational institutions will not disappear but they will change in ways that make them almost unrecognizable by today s models Just as Pokemon Go lifts people out of their chairs into real world environments to explore imaginary captures we will change learning from a passive to an active dynamic experience Three dynamics that will affect all learning and retraining efforts 1 Newer tools are changing our sense of identity 2 We are moving from the fixed point of view that the book gave us to a multiple simultaneous narrative of flow in a networked environment 3 Again since what we think is what we think through we are applying that logic of visual presentation to our presentation and sense of self The first skill needed to succeed in the workforce of the future will be the ability to understand manage and manipulate data Everyone in a technology based profession will need to be a quant quantitative analyst or keep up with the quants Because all human processes and activities can now be quantified and there is considerable exploration and technology development in the application of quantification to everything from our sleep patterns and shopping habits to our emotions and online behaviors many new and important business models are emerging from quantification and the learning algorithms that drive it The second and much more important skill needed to succeed in the workforce of the future will be the ability to find meaning and value in data combined with the problem condition or opportunity the data is outlining Said simply the greatest skill will be the ability to think through the cloud of facts data experience and strategic direction that products and services require Design thinking or visual thinking will be a critical part of managing a data driven world Data mining and management can be taught effectively Thinking problem solving reflection and visioning are difficult to teach at scale Elisabeth Gee professor at Arizona State University and author of What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy commented First many jobs of the future won t require workers with a lot of training Second degrees and credentials have been increasingly promoted by institutions more driven by profit than an interest in preparing students in any meaningful way for employment If the government doesn t step in to restrict such institutions we ll continue to see students graduate with huge debt and little prospect of decent employment Lastly we don t need large scale training of workers we need real education not job focused and opportunities for people to pursue diverse pathways for career development and lifelong learning Patrick Tucker technology editor at Defense One and author of The Naked Future observed Online education offers the opportunity to gather data on student performance continuously or telemetrically What telemetric education offers is the opportunity to continuously and constantly evaluate a student to gain a much more comprehensive understanding of ability retention of information even how other behaviors and factors such as time of day other calendar items nutrition amount of time on Pokemon Go influence learning It offers a more true moving score Learning will become easier and much more of it will happen outside of school settings all of which will diminish the importance of schools and teachers as we know them today But platforms like Coursera can amplify the talents of gifted and effective instructors and reduce the cost of education in the coming decade for all Some schools and colleges will thrive and prosper at a level not seen in their history But they will do so only by transitioning away from today s classroom model toward something else like data driven skills workshops at the high school level and startup incubators or problem solving workshops at the college level We may be conflicted about replacing classes with platforms but if we are to be honest with ourselves we know that we can t prepare coming generations for the challenges of a technological and globalized economy the same way we prepared previous generations to be factory workers The greatest thinker of the 21st century whoever he or she is will understand more about how she thinks and learns than any student in any previous generation and all before ever stepping foot inside a schoolhouse Imagine for a moment the power of knowing beforehand how well you would perform on a test Laura Matzen of Sandia National Laboratory and some of her colleagues have demonstrated that the brain s electrical activity detectable via electroencephalogram EEG predicts how well studied material has been incorporated into memory and thus how well a subject will perform on memory tests Telemetric education also offers the opportunity for everyone to raise his or her hand and be heard That opportunity doesn t come easily in a crowded classroom especially not for women or minority students many of whom feel that if they ask the wrong question or display ignorance they ll confirm some unflattering broadly held perception about their social group David Golumbia associate professor of digital studies at Virginia Commonwealth University commented As an educator I am completely unconvinced by the current rhetoric that says our educational system is unable to meet the needs of current or future workforces This whole argument is a sham meant to attack the fundamental purpose and basis of education Most empirical evidence shows that the premises of this question are incorrect most high skilled jobs of the sort implied here have an oversupply of qualified talent We need more of an emphasis on the fundamental purpose of education not on skills Stephen Downes researcher at the National Research Council of Canada commented We will see educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers because for the most part mechanisms will be in place that enable them to train themselves Within 10 years we should be beginning to see that the idea of providing training education or training is misguided because it s overly expensive and less effective than self managed learning I find it interesting even that the question itself presumes that skills must be taught Which of these skills can be taught effectively via online systems It s not that the skills are taught per se but rather that the skills are learned A wide range of activities may enable skills to be learned especially multidisciplinary skills such as critical thinking or social interaction without specifically teaching those skills There are very few skills that require specific and personal instruction from an expert to learn frankly I can t think of any which means that within 10 years we should at least be able to countenance the possibility that all or nearly all educational programs may be automated Of course they will continue to require the time and participation of the individual learner and in many cases social interaction with other learners but the labor intensive learning industry we have developed to this point will not be required I see no major objections to this argument 1 It may be argued that personal interaction is required in order to get to know a student and therefore anticipate what they need However in 10 years it will be arguable and probably demonstrable that your own computer networks will know you better than any individual instructor could even an instructor who worked with you your entire life Sure there are disasters like the Facebook news stream but people are already amazed at how much Google knows about them And we know that with enough data analytics can outperform humans even in complex tasks 2 It may be argued that personal interaction is required in order to evaluate a student s level of achievement Most actual assessment not to be confused with multiple choice tests in school or professional programs is based on expert recognition The submitted behavior an essay performance in surgery piloting an aircraft in a simulation is not assessed according to whether a set of indicators is achieved this would possibly be a necessary but never a sufficient condition The expert looks at the overall behavior and assesses whether that competency has been met The expert is serving as a proxy for the community at large With modern communications technology this proxy is no longer required Through the course of any given day as a person goes through various activities they interact with dozens of other people either in person or through online interaction Each person responds to them in some way not by testing them but by for example engaging them in conversation asking questions following advice etc These responses over time form a comprehensive and constantly changing assessment of the person An anonymous postdoctoral fellow at Rice University s Humanities Research Center observed So much has been said and challenged over the past three decades about online education I d like to answer this by asking a different set of questions which address recent developments in robotics and artificial intelligence How will autonomous factories in Chicago U S share what they ve learned with factories in Pingdingshan China What credentialing system will self driving cars require How will artificially intelligent laborers learn the skills needed to run a household business government institution or political organization When will universities allow artilect nonhuman artificial intelligence students to enroll in their traditional undergraduate and graduate degree programs and how would students learn the more ephemeral skills like critical thinking from a thinking machine

FACEBOOKTWITTERYOUTUBELINKEDININSTAGRAMFLICKRRSS 2019 The Aspen Institute All Rights ReservedMay 24 2018 Alastair Fitzpayne Ethan PollackSUMMARYDespite today s low unemployment rate workers today face a range of uncertainties and challenges In the post World War II era many workers could expect a stable career at a single company that would assume responsibility for investing in the workers skills over time This stability has now given way to careers consisting of multiple jobs in potentially different occupations and industries 1 For many work is becoming more independent short term and project based At the same time new technologies are demonstrating the ability to perform tasks previously done by workers As these trends continue workers will need to update their existing skills and acquire new skills throughout their careers This new environment demands changes to the outdated education model in which Americans could expect the education and skills they obtain when they are young to last their entire career Updating this model to better serve today s workers requires a variety of approaches Employers play a unique and vital role in workforce training but workers must also be given additional tools to acquire new skills and learning opportunities over the course of their careers This issue brief proposes the creation of worker controlled Lifelong Learning and Training Accounts LLTAs These accounts would be funded by workers employers and government and could be used by workers to pay for education and training opportunities The accounts are not designed to be long term savings vehicles balance limits and limited investment returns are intended to encourage workers to regularly use their LLTA funds for training throughout their careers Based on economic modeling conducted by District Economics Group 23 million Americans would contribute to these accounts to fund training over the next ten years costing the federal government roughly 25 billion over this same time period This proposal is designed to provide significant incentives to low income workers to participate in training given the financial challenges they face participating in savings based programs Consistent with that goal 79 percent of the cost of the proposal would benefit individuals who make under 30 000 BACKGROUNDEducation continues to be vital in today s economyThe ability to acquire post secondary credentials remains critically important in today s economy Higher levels of education correspond with lower unemployment rates and higher median earnings Chart 1 While four year degrees continue to provide an earnings premium other types of credentials also provide considerable economic returns In one study vocational certificates and associate degrees corresponded to more than 30 percent higher earnings than a high school degree alone 2 At the same time there are important differences between racial groups indicating that higher education is not benefiting students equally 3 The advance of automation further suggests that additional education will be important as the economy evolves The McKinsey Global Institute predicts that occupations that currently require a secondary education or less will see a net loss of jobs due to automation while occupations requiring college degrees will experience job growth 4 Lifelong learning and training are increasingly importantTechnology will continue to play a key role in reshaping the economy making it increasingly important that workers have access to education and training Rapid advances in technology including artificial intelligence and automation are transforming industries and jobs Autonomous vehicles are poised to alter the transportation industry the growth of e commerce is transforming retail and the use of data analytics and robotic technologies is restructuring warehouses and factories These changes will impact workers in two primary ways First new technologies will result in changes to the activities workers are being asked to perform in their existing jobs A recent McKinsey report estimated that 23 percent of current work activity hours in the U S could be automated by 2030 and that in about 60 percent of occupations at least one third of the constituent activities could be automated 5 As machines are increasingly capable of doing tasks previously done by humans workers will be required to take on new and different tasks Often this involves machines doing routine tasks that workers had previously done with workers increasingly relied on to perform activities that require core skills that are difficult to automate including critical thinking social skills management decision making planning and innovation 6 For example with the introduction of self service kiosks workers who used to work behind a cash register are now expected to be more customer facing requiring more social skills and knowledge 7 Similarly when Electrolux the world s second largest manufacturer of home appliances automated its production process it asked its workers to focus on the creative task of designing and implementing changes to the factory floor and robot layout to maximize efficiency 8 More broadly the World Economic Forum estimates that by 2020 more than one third of the core skill sets of most occupations will be skills that are not considered crucial to today s workforce 9 At the same time an increasing number of workers will need technology and digital skills ranging from basic digital literacy to advanced computer science in order to interact with new technologies at work The Brookings Institution created a digitalization index to measure changes in the digital content of 545 occupations covering 90 percent of the workforce it found that jobs are increasingly requiring digital skills with the average digitalization index across all occupations rising 57 percent between 2002 and 2016 10 Similarly research by Burning Glass Technologies looked at nearly 27 million job postings and found that 80 percent of all middle skill jobs are digitally intensive and that these jobs are growing twice as fast as those not requiring digital skills 11 As technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning continue to evolve and change the workplace workers will need not only to acquire new skills but also to keep them updated over time Second automation will result in some jobs being eliminated requiring workers to switch occupations or industries entirely The most vulnerable jobs are characterized by repetitive predictable activities like operating machinery preparing fast food and collecting and processing data The impact of this displacement could be significant it is estimated that up to 32 percent of workers may need to transition to entirely different occupations by 2030 12 Some industries that are most susceptible to automation such as retail disproportionately employ low wage workers and provide vital entry level jobs 13 Impacted workers will need to retrain for new jobs which likely would require very different skills from those their current job requires As technology eliminates some jobs it will also create others and helping workers acquire the skills necessary to take advantage of these opportunities is essential 14 Each of these challenges highlights the need to develop better systems to encourage lifelong learning Workers must have the ability to update their existing skills and acquire new skills throughout their careers The current approach is inadequateUnfortunately the country s education and training systems are not up to the task Investment in higher education continues to dwarf the amount spent on training The federal government currently spends over 180 billion on higher education but only about 12 billion on training and employment programs per year 15 While the education system also includes elements of workforce development especially at the community college level it was largely designed for younger students pursuing traditional post secondary degrees rather than for mid career workers looking to quickly develop new skills at an affordable cost Government programs such as Coverdell Accounts and the American Opportunity Tax Credit also require students to be enrolled in school at least half time which is not feasible for many workers At the same time educators face major challenges updating their curricula and integrating work based opportunities to reflect the pace of changing skills needs 16 Traditionally companies have played a significant role in helping workers maintain the skills necessary to succeed in the workforce Unfortunately based on the data available employers have also been investing less in worker training from 1996 to 2008 the percentage of workers receiving employer sponsored training fell 42 percent and on the job training fell 36 percent 17 In 2011 Accenture surveyed U S employees and found that only 21 percent had received any employer provided formal training in the past five years 18 Employer provided tuition assistance has also been falling in recent years from 66 percent of surveyed businesses offering tuition assistance benefits in 2008 19 down to 53 percent in 2017 20 In addition the employer provided training that is provided disproportionately benefits the most educated workers 21 Without intervention business investment in workers is likely to continue to decline In a recent Accenture survey of 1 200 CEOs and other top executives 74 percent said that they plan to use artificial intelligence to automate tasks in their workplace over the next three years Yet only 3 percent reported planning to significantly increase investments in training over the same time period 22 The Aspen Institute s Future of Work Initiative has proposed the creation of a business tax credit similar to the Research and Development credit to encourage further business investment in worker training 23 In addition an employer based system is ill suited for the rising number of workers who are in short term or project based work arrangements and lack stable employers willing to train them over the course of their careers From 2005 to 2015 the percentage of the workforce engaged in alternative work arrangements including independent contracting and temporary on call and contract firm work as their primary source of income rose from 10 7 to 15 8 percent This increase was spread across industries and accounted for 94 percent of net job growth over that period see Chart 2 24 Currently about one third of workers regularly participate in independent work in some capacity 25 and the number of independent workers is predicted to grow 26 As work evolves more of the burden is falling on workers to update their skills throughout their careers A 2012 Accenture survey found that 68 percent of respondents believed strongly that it was their responsibility to keep their skills up to date in their current job rather than their employer s 27 A recent Freelancers Union survey found that 65 percent of independent workers said they were updating their skills to remain competitive in a changing job market with 55 percent participating in skill related education in the past month In contrast 45 percent of traditional workers reported updating their skills and only 30 percent had recently participated in education or training 28 To succeed in a rapidly changing economy workers will need to update and learn new skills over the course of their careers both to adapt to the evolving skills that will be needed to perform in their jobs and to help them transition to new jobs in the event that their industry or occupation faces significant disruption And while some workers will be able to rely on their employers to help them acquire new skills many will not and will need financial assistance and a portable system to access new education and training opportunities PROPOSAL LIFELONG LEARNING AND TRAINING ACCOUNTSBased on these trends policymakers should create tax advantaged Lifelong Learning and Training Accounts which workers could use at any time during their careers to pay for education and training Since these accounts would belong to workers they would be portable from job to job and the decision on how to use the accounts would be made by workers not employers Individual Contributions Beginning at the age of 18 an individual would be eligible to contribute up to 2 000 per year into a Lifelong Learning and Training Account 29 Like 401 k contributions these would be made on a pre tax basis though this tax preference would not be available to workers with an Adjusted Gross Income AGI over 50 000 100 000 married filing jointly or an account balance in excess of 10 000 30 Earnings would be tax deferred as long as the account balance remained below 10 000 If the account balance exceeded 10 000 earnings on that excess would be taxable Government Contributions The government would match individual contributions by providing a direct contribution to these accounts The rate at which contributions would be matched by the government would decline as income rises with a larger contribution for low income workers and a smaller contribution for middle income workers a feature modeled after the Saver s Credit Contributions by high income workers would not be eligible for matching contributions from the government 31 Employer Contributions In order to reinforce the unique and vital role that employers play in workforce training employers would be eligible to contribute to the account up to 2 000 annually For workers who earn under 50 000 in wages employer contributions would be excluded from workers taxable income Moreover workers could receive contributions from multiple employers if they worked for more than one employer at a given time Similar to individual contributions employer contributions could be based on a one year look back basis Contribution Restrictions and Balance Limitation Contributions to the accounts would not be permitted once the account reaches a balance of 10 000 an amount sufficient to pay for the tuition expenses of most two year community college or training programs The balance limitation is intended to encourage workers to use these accounts frequently throughout their careers in contrast to other accounts such as 401 k plans that are designed to be long term savings accounts Once the balance has been drawn down workers could replenish the account up to the overall limit 32 Account Administration and Investment The U S Department of the Treasury would be responsible for determining the lowest cost option to administer the accounts Funds would be required to be held in principal protected assets such as Treasury bonds money market funds or passbook savings style investments Eligible Expenses Funds from the LLTA could be used to pay for any education and training program that results in the attainment of a recognized postsecondary credential which includes industry recognized certificates or certifications and licenses that are approved at the state level 33 LLTA funds could also be used to pay for any program provided by an eligible education institution as defined in Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 HEA 34 Funds could also be used to pay for testing and application fees for industry recognized credentials 35 Withdrawal Process To minimize compliance burdens for the individual account owner and the federal government individuals would be prohibited from making direct withdrawals To use the funds for eligible education and training the individual would need to first enroll in an eligible education or training program To pay for the program the individual would provide their account number which the eligible provider would then use to directly access the funds The funds would transfer from the account to the provider simplifying compliance and reducing the incidence of ineligible withdrawals Denial of Double Benefit If an individual is using an LLTA to pay for an eligible education and training expense then no other education tax benefit e g 529 s American Opportunity Tax Credit tuition and fees tax deduction could be used in connection with the payment for those same education and training expenses that year This treatment is consistent with the current rules around today s education tax benefits that prevent individuals from using more than one tax benefit However non tax education benefits could be used by individuals using an LLTA just as they can with other education tax benefits Non tax education benefits include Pell grants scholarships work study and other grants Encouraging LLTA Usage To encourage workers to use their LLTA accounts employers should present employees with the option to withhold and deposit a portion of their paycheck into their LLTAs Taxpayers who are receiving the Earned Income Tax Credit EITC should be given the option to deposit the tax credit into their LLTA Unused Balances To ensure that these savings are used for training purposes program rules would not allow unused LLTA balances to be rolled over tax free to retirement accounts If individuals wanted to terminate their account they would be required to include the unused balance in ordinary income at this point However unused balances could be rolled over into ABLE accounts which are tax advantaged savings accounts for individuals with disabilities 36 Modeling According to economic modeling conducted by District Economics Group this proposal would result in 23 million workers contributing to LLTA accounts over the next ten years The specific subsidy design makes the proposal highly targeted to lower income individuals in fact individuals who make under 30 000 account for 79 percent of the program s overall cost The cost of the proposal is estimated to be 25 billion over ten years BENEFITSLifelong Learning and Training Accounts would provide several benefits A better trained workforce Workers would have a strong incentive and new opportunity to invest in additional education and training over their careers Low and middle income worker contributions would be matched by the government providing workers with resources to access opportunities to learn new skills or upgrade their existing skills Worker training generally has a high rate of return benefiting workers businesses and the economy as a whole 37 38 Retraining mid career workers Finding the time and resources to seek new training opportunities in the middle of a career is a major challenge and one that the country s current education and training system is not well designed to help facilitate LLTAs could help address this challenge in part by encouraging continuous skill building rather than waiting until it is necessary to make a mid career transition Improving unemployed workers ability to find new jobs Job loss can be traumatic especially when it comes in the context of a wave of outsourcing or automation that affects an entire industry Lifelong Learning and Training Accounts could give laid off workers additional resources to use during periods of unemployment to accumulate new skills better equipping them to find new jobs More flexibility to shift jobs or careers Currently workers career paths are partially dependent on the training they receive from their employers But employers are generally only willing to train workers for the jobs they currently have This creates a lock in effect making it difficult for workers to transition to different occupations or industries Providing workers with an additional tool to obtain the skills necessary to move between occupations and industries will help workers find jobs that better leverage their interests and strengths Less reliance on the safety net About a quarter of wage earners receive benefits from one or more social safety net programs 39 As the LLTA helps more workers upskill and reskill their wages will likely rise lessening their reliance on these programs For example a 1 per hour increase in wages for the bottom 40 percent of workers would reduce the participation rate in public assistance programs by 2 5 percentage points and public expenditures would fall by 7 3 billion annually 40 POLICY CONSIDERATIONSAs policymakers design lifelong learning systems there are additional considerations that could improve the effectiveness of this approach EXAMPLES OF OTHER LIFELONG LEARNING ACCOUNTSOther countries are adopting policies that provide lifelong learning and training opportunities to their workers Singapore recently established individual learning accounts for each citizen over the age of 25 to spend on education and training programs from a list of 500 approved providers 43 The government seeds these accounts with a direct subsidy to individuals of 500 called the SkillsFuture Credit and even higher subsidies for mid career professionals In 2017 over 285 000 Singaporeans benefited from the credit 44 In 2015 France established individual training accounts that workers can use to pay for 24 hours of training per year over eight years in a wide variety of programs 45 Businesses fund this benefit with a one percent tax on payrolls In the United States the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning CAEL has developed and championed Lifelong Learning Account demonstration programs in a handful of states and cities including Maine Washington Chicago and New York City 46 The State of Maine launched a Lifelong Learning Accounts program in 2005 that was coordinated by its Department of Labor The program used its existing Career Center staff and offices to do outreach to employers and workers Additional program support was provided by the Maine Centers for Women Work and Community which assisted workers with their education planning The Lifelong Learning Accounts themselves were established through the state s existing Section 529 college savings program known as NextGen which is administered by the Finance Authority of Maine and which includes a matching contribution for low and middle income workers In addition similar legislation has been introduced in a number of other states 47 This idea has a history of bipartisanship in Washington D C In prior Congresses Sens Cantwell D WA and Snowe R ME and Reps Emanuel D IL Ramstad R MN Larson D CT Polis D CO Kilmer D WA Roskam R IL and Paulsen R MN proposed legislation to create tax advantaged lifelong learning accounts 48 Helping workers access lifelong learning opportunities should be a public policy priority Lifelong Learning and Training Accounts could help reverse the decline in the amount of training that workers are receiving In addition the proposal could help workers better manage their economic future by incentivizing workers

societies together It translates talent into broader economic virtue and lends meaning as well as structure to most people s lives In Europe the majority of workers hold permanent contracts However tectonic shifts are re shaping the ways that work is performed First the very architecture of the corporation is changing profoundly largely powered by the Internet and digital technologies Second the perceived volatility of the economic recovery and the continuous exposure of the private sector to disruptive innovation push businesses to offer short term contracts to respond quickly if a crisis strikes Thus many more job seekers are forced into short term contracts part time work or other forms of labour which they see as undesirable At the same time in the digital economy precarious or temporary do not necessarily mean sub optimal more people voluntarily check out of the traditional 9 to 5 job routine to pursue more independent and flexible work arrangements Autonomy can be experienced as more empowering and satisfactory This rise in freelancing runs parallel to the growth of the gig economy where digital technologies enable teams to be assembled around a given project and often across borders while platforms seamlessly connect buyers with sellers Much of the latter takes place under the heading collaborative economy which is offering opportunity not only for people seeking more flexibility but also to those who have often had fewer chances of landing a permanent job The nature of work and the ways it is performed have changed multiple times and throughout human history However the pace of change has accelerated significantly largely due to digital technologies Many of today s jobs and most sought after skills did not exist a decade ago while routine occupations are vulnerable to automation Job polarisation and job displacement have intensified in advanced economies At the same time technological innovations offer new and flexible opportunities which often include those traditionally at the fringes of the labour markets Policymakers need to manoeuvre between these two trends preserving the core of a social market economy while being open to innovation and technology driven change that impacts organisations and individuals alike Skills continue to be the best guarantor of social mobility and opportunity But skills are not static and need to be updated and fine tuned throughout working lives This too often contrasts with Europe s educational systems which tend to be frontloaded Opportunities for life long learning are critical to support the numerous transitions that will likely characterise future employment Well crafted public policies need to keep track of changes in the world of work using data and digital technologies to better understand evolving trends and offer more targeted support to individuals Active labour market policies will seek to buttress potential fallouts and adapt to new realities For instance they will ease the transition from employment to freelancing and back seeking ways to provide more security to gig economy workers or making greater efforts to provide customised skills and trainings that maximise employment potential Work has always covered a diverse set of economic realities It includes paid employment own account work volunteering as well as unpaid family work Today work is increasingly becoming an umbrella concept for tasks performed under different legal functional and geographic frameworks Jobs are being broken down into projects that may either be outsourced to independent professionals and experts or be reconfigured into projects that assemble physical or virtual teams across borders and time zones Non essential tasks and functions have long been outsourced to allow companies to cut costs and focus their added value on core competences Retail companies have used external contractors for their call centres and 24 7 customer support services for decades Similarly consulting and accounting firms outsource basic research and accounting tasks while publishing houses outsource type setting and editing to production teams on other continents This allows them to benefit from time zone differences to get a speedier turn around on their projects at lower costs Companies have moved from vertical integration to restructured contractual relations allowing them to tap into global value chains and international talent as their needs and growth strategies evolve In fact as a global landscape of abundant and specialised knowledge becomes increasingly accessible companies embrace the open innovation paradigm In short this involves harnessing external ideas and knowledge from multiple sources and combining these with internal capacities and R D The result is the ability to deliver efficient and innovative solutions to the marketplace In today s economy the ability to scale rapidly and internationally is fundamental thereby transforming the crowd into part of the value added chain In addition to its global dimension outsourcing has taken on an added dimension through the rise of the gig economy1 It has created a dynamic environment in which temporary positions are common and organisations contract with independent workers for short term engagements Tasks can be broken down and distributed even more widely through apps and online platforms The bidding style process through which tasks are offered assigned and performed allows for real time interactive and often mutual rating of the performance of service providers both for seller and buyer and the reliability of users Whether it is looking for a babysitter on care com assigning a local house errand on Taskrabbit or turning to 99designs com to get designers from around the world to submit brand logo ideas in a contest round the clock the gig economy offers ways to tap into talent services and expertise at a global level with unprecedented affordability and transparency while rewarding the reputation demand and compensation of the best performers On demand work is on the rise as is a project focused approach to work What has been referred to as the Hollywood model is a discernible trend across numerous sectors How does this work in practice Once a specific project product or assignment is identified a team of different people from different professions with distinct but complementary skills comes together and collaborates in order to accomplish the task Once the project is completed the team disassembles and reconfigures with other members on another project just like in Hollywood teams and artists move on to the production of another film The pharmaceutical industry is an interesting area within which this model has developed For decades the entire process from early stage research to consumer sales was undertaken within one company Recently research is often ceded to startups or research labs where teams of scientists senior executives and or supporting managers and staff work on a single development project with venture capitalist funding If successful the team might sell the medication or its marketing rights to a company disband and move on to another project This short term highly flexible project based business approach assembles people who hold specific skills and expertise for the particular requirements of the project and with a limited time and financial commitment The adaptability of this approach is its advantage particularly in conditions of economic uncertainty It contrasts with the traditional corporate model where employees are hired in longer term open ended jobs In this project based reality there are real concerns that the bidding or competition processes between workers may negatively impact employment protection and safety standards To reap the opportunities offered public policy needs to adapt and better target those who fall through the cracks of the traditional social system which was designed for full time workers with permanent contracts Adam Davidson What Hollywood can teach us about the Future of Work New York Times 5 5 2015 Robert Weisman Pharma gives drug development the Hollywood treatment Boston Globe 27 9 2015While the majority of workers are on permanent contracts the preference for lean teams has led to a marked shift from employees to independent suppliers of services and independent contractors Self employment in the EU constitutes 16 4 percent of the labour market2 with wide variation across Member States Temps3 agency workers on call workers contract company workers independent contractors independent professionals or freelancers as well as part timers have been on the rise4 see Figure 1 In the case of Belgium for example the number of hours worked by agency workers rose by over 11 in 2015 alone 5 Similarly in the USA recent research suggests that all net employment growth since 2005 appears to have occurred in alternative i e non standard work arrangements including temporary gig and contract work The overall percentage of workers engaged in alternative work arrangements rose from 10 1 in February 2005 to 15 8 in late 2014 6 In the post 2008 period companies are much more reluctant to offer full term employment contracts given the volatile economic environment and the accelerating pace of global competition This is more than likely to prevail in the years ahead Source Eurostat These trends are feeding a patchwork of parallel employment realities that characterise today s developed economies Non standard work in its numerous varieties may offer greater flexibility and autonomy At the same time it does tend to be less paid than the full time equivalent and is associated with less access to training It is not the preferred option for many and it also brings greater risks due to frequent periods without or with very little income as well as less favourable conditions in terms of accessing social security and necessary protection healthcare accident coverage and pensions primarily On the other hand these new forms of work can be a great accelerator for individuals who have been persistently shut out of the formal labour market This is not to be under estimated in times of a sluggish economic recovery creating too few jobs and where concerns about the consequences of socio economic marginalisation range from petty crime to the risks of radicalisation Although there is widespread conviction that long term corporate jobs are the norm and that temporary work is a novel form of non standard work the opposite is likely the case Long term corporate jobs guaranteeing full time life long job security and benefits only became dominant in the trentes glorieuses after 19457 These developed as assembly lines and industrial machinery grew more complicated in times of full employment making the need for a stable trained workforce to control quality and maximise production more pressing on the employers side In parallel the urban concentration of workers encouraged the advocacy for better employment conditions and eventually privileges in exchange for loyalty Full time life long corporate jobs that emerged in the post World War II period have been overwhelmingly occupied by prime and working age men The employment trajectories of women younger workers people with a migrant background or also people with disabilities have been rather different characterised by lower rates of employment and higher rates of part time temporary or self employment They have also faced more implicit forms of discrimination in the workplace even though officially the legal framework for equal opportunities and non discrimination should prevent this8 Labour reallocation i e the sum of job creation and job destruction is intensifying As new jobs are created others risk being destroyed 9 Depending on which tasks we currently assume may be replaced estimates on the impact of automation on jobs vary but there are certain telling trends Machines are already capable of answering email and drafting summaries of sports games We may soon see driverless cars at the traffic lights drones delivering goods and algorithms replacing accountants bank staff and legal assistance 10The sectors most at risk of contraction in the future world of work are those that rely heavily on routine tasks such as low skill manufacturing jobs but also some craft and clerical occupations Figure 2 Where tasks are routine automation is likely As the trend towards more service oriented economies is likely to continue11 job growth in the future can be expected to be in the service sector and particularly in non routine elementary occupations such as personal care services Source Future Skills Supply and Demand in Europe Forecast 2012 Cedefop Note Medium risk of automation affects 5 to 70 of tasks High risk of automation affects over 70 of tasks Source Arntz M T Gregory and U Zierahn The Risk of Automation for Jobs in OECD Countries A Comparative Analysis 2016 OECD Automation is by no means a synonym for work extinction Indeed substitution may mean the destruction of certain jobs but not the destruction of employment 12 Certain estimates expect automation to lead to a net loss of more than 5 1 million jobs across 15 major advanced economies see Figure 3 13At the same time the digital revolution has generated a surge in demand for new jobs and occupational categories that did not even exist a decade ago 14These include people with a high technology quotient such as big data specialists social media managers cognitive computing engineers Internet of Things architects and blockchain developers The transformative trends of the digital revolution have also highlighted that some jobs will quite simply always be performed by humans either because of the sort of skills required or simply because of our preferences Child care care for the elderly social work mental health care for instance easily stand out as jobs with low risk of automation The fact that certain tasks can be performed by technology means that time is freed up for workers to perform other tasks and create value As automation and artificial intelligence are leaping into new areas the human robot partnership will further transform the nature of work Until now the challenge for workers was to learn how to operate machines Looking ahead interactions will change with humans monitoring rather than operating machines and creatively defining what needs to be done and how and then using robots to achieve precisely that If recent trends are telling indicators creativity emotional intelligence and transversal skills are undoubtedly what will make the difference in the future Figure 4 Research has shown that occupations requiring strong social interpersonal skills and non routine analytical skills have grown dynamically since 1980 with consistent wage growth 15 Even in the tech industry it is jobs that require both technical and interpersonal skills that are on the rise Source Future Skills Supply and Demand in Europe Forecast 2012 Cedefop Cultures of sharing negotiating with others and finding compromises seems to be what can save us from the robots Europe s advantage in the future highly automated world of work lies in its creativity and highly skilled workforce Figure 5 A 2015 study16 finds that 21 of US employment is highly creative including occupations like artists architects web designers IT specialists and public relations professionals Economies like the UK where creative occupations make up a large proportion around 24 of the workforce may be better placed than others to resist the employment fallouts of automation In this transformative context charting a successful course in the world of work depends to a large extent on the quality of firms Entrants and young firms remain the biggest contributors to employment creation in the OECD countries17 see Figure 6 However it is highly productive and internationally active firms that have an exceptional impact on economic growth and expansion of employment On average about one percent of the internationalised high performing manufacturing firms in Europe produce more than 75 of output or foreign sales 18 The changing world of work means that they will increasingly compete for the pool of available global talent Unweighted average in the non financial business sectorSource Science Technology and Industry Scoreboard 2015 OECD Indeed the most job creating and productive firms the so called frontier firms as well as the younger gazelles a subset of rapidly growing firms are seeking high skilled and digitally savvy workers19 see Table 160 1 As productivity gains result from investments in knowledge based capital it is no coincidence that top growth occupations in employee numbers are mostly high skilled ones including software and sales professionals where ICTs increase the returns to labour for highly skilled workers performing cognitive tasks 20A particular concern for Europe is the projected skills shortage in the area of ICT Information and Communications Technology which is forecast to lead to up to 825 000 unfilled vacancies by 2020 This is not only a lost opportunity for job seekers but also has the potential to be a real break on productivity and innovation as well as the wider modernisation of the economy Source LinkedInThe profound changes underway are also accompanied by substantial transformations in people s working life Until recently there has been a rather linear pattern in the transition from education and training to work and retirement This linearity is now largely a thing of the past Given the changes in the workplace people will have to increasingly learn new skills to remain employable throughout their working life They will be increasingly likely to change employers jobs employment status and professions numerous times and at faster paces than ever before And given that people live longer they will most likely also have to work longer either out of choice or necessity While some have the tools and mindset to embrace this flexibly not all are equipped with the skills competences and support system to be able to respond to these changes At present multiple and divergent realities coexist in Europe s job markets It remains difficult for women to re enter the labour market after they have taken time out to raise children Young graduates who have spent numerous years in full time university education have the hardest time getting their first job and often lack the skills necessary in spite of their formal qualifications Similarly 45 year olds who where laid off due to sectoral restructuring find it difficult to get a new job as they are often deemed too expensive or even too old to retrain In short many people find themselves excluded from gainful employment let alone the opportunity to pursue quality work a challenge which has been accentuated by the crisis For these reasons training and reskilling will matter more throughout people s working lives Education obtained before one s professional life will have to be regularly topped up Transitions will be more frequent and complex particularly with regards to family and care responsibilities on the one hand and employment and training on the other These will have to be better supported than they are today At the same time work life balance preferences are changing Millennials are keen to have more diversity and also more flexibility in their work patterns and commitments They are reinventing the essence of economic exchange professional fulfilment and even consumption itself through the collaborative economy and a growing army of prosumers with products and services being delivered on demand and just in time As for more mature workers especially highly skilled they are less and less interested in retirement and prefer to stay in the workforce for longer albeit with flexible arrangements 21Work tenure is also changing at a rapid pace In the US the median tenure of workers aged 25 to 34 years is 3 years which is three times less than that for workers aged 55 to 64 10 4 years As for the EU 28 the changes for the 25 34 year olds between 2000 and 2014 are telling too Job tenure of 10 years and over decreased from 17 5 to 12 5 while job tenure for 3 5 years increased from 17 7 to 19 4 22 This shorter tenure is not just the result of shorter time spent on the job market it is also a conscious choice It follows that one might soon have 15 20 different jobs in a lifetime As work patterns change and preferences shift one dimension that does remain constant is a rather fundamental human need for belonging to a community Freelancers and independent professionals are forming groups and associations formally informally and virtually One such group is the Freelancers Union based in New York Through associations such as these they exchange experiences seek advice even lobby on work and welfare related issues They also create community co working spaces which allow new businesses to be created and create hubs of innovation that help kick start entrepreneurial ideas In the new world of work attention is increasingly on the individual The de construction of work the multiplication of professional pursuits in one s lifetime the growing burden on individual adaptation to employment driven by automation and competition in the high value segment are some of the more evident manifestations While the jury is out on which of these trends will have positive or negative outcomes resilient skills will be the game changers There s never been a better time to be a worker with special skills or the right education because these people can use technology to create and capture value However there s never been a worse time to be a worker with only ordinary skills and abilities to offer because computers robots and other digital technologies are acquiring these skills and abilities at an extraordinary rate Brynjolfsson E and McAfee A 2014 The Second Machine Age Work Progress and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies New York W W Norton CompanyThe novel fluidity of work puts a premium on personal initiative and professional resilience The link between employer and employee is being loosened and this has repercussions for both For employers who have to operate in a global context of high economic uncertainty investing in the systematic development of their staff is often a challenge This is particularly so in the case of temporary or contract staff At the same time it matters hugely to a company s success to be able to access a workforce with directly usable skills and qualifications As for workers the burden of employment is shifted to her his abilities to adapt and remain relevant and to ensure adequate access to welfare decent and fair work conditions and sustainable employment protection While many are driven by the preference for agency and autonomy not all workers have the tools to be equally self resilient nor to sustainably tackle societal personal and professional risks Access to up and re skilling opportunities that have currency on the job market and to adequate welfare protection are the most fundamental challenges that workers and job seekers are confronted with in the changing world of work In recent years the polarisation of today s workforce between highly skilled well paid jobs and lower paid low skilled ones has intensified 23 Meanwhile the share of the low educated is contracting across all major occupational groups even in elementary occupations where it fell by four percentage points between 2008 and 2012 Such an environment may compound the efficient matching of skills and jobs available in Europe Evidence from Sweden suggests a link between displacement rates and educational level well educated native born prime age men have the highest chances of re employment Workers who are involuntarily separated from their job due to economic or increasingly technological reasons tend to suffer wage losses upon entering a new job typically attributed to a loss of job specific skills 24The risks of growing polarisation and displacement can be addressed by bolstering the resilience of workers through re skilling and up skilling opportunities throughout one s life especially at a time when career transitions and self or temporary employment are increasingly the new normal In work access to training remains highly dependent on the type of contract almost one in two employees on permanent contracts receive training compared to 32 of employees with fixed contracts and 19 of self employed 25 Thus it is often the case that those who need life long training the most are those who have the least access to it Zygmunt Bauman one of the world s leading sociologists has described the current uncertainty and unpredictability as well as the inequalities in the ways risks and opportunities are experienced as living in liquid times 26 The post crisis environment is characterised by particularly high levels of unpredictability for both workers and businesses The transitions that the digital revolution is bringing to all aspects of our work and life both in their challenges and their opportunities are likely to magnify the sense of unpredictability and complexity even further Public policy therefore needs to respond more dynamically to the changing reality of the world of work Rather than being about the anonymous and largely uniform membership of the labour market it needs to respond to the diverse journeys people undertake throughout their life and careers with anticipation and innovation This requires a comprehensive approach that includes refitting education supporting firms in growth and job creation through investing in skills customising and ensuring portability of social rights and developing indicators that enable public investment to lead to effective social outcomes The European Commission s initiative to launch a European Pillar of Social Rights aims to identify the most transformative trends within work and welfare systems the changing needs in employment and social policies and the good practices in meeting these challenges and opportunities In effect a dedicated focus of the on going public consultation process March December 2016 is on the Future of Work The changing world of work requires a multi layered policy response covering the entire life trajectory from cradle to retirement Education training and the opportunity for retraining throughout one s life need to be the starting point The most important capital for the world of work ahead is skills and yet many youths as well as adults across Europe have considerable basic cognitive and non cognitive skills deficits even if they hold formal qualifications 27Percentage of qualification mismatched who are in each literacy mismatch statusSource Skills Outlook 2013 OECD The importance of non cognitive skills for the labour market has been widely recognised Such skills range from achievement motivation perseverance problem solving resilience self control team work initiative the ability to socialise and to follow an ethical code of behaviour 28 However today s education systems are not always proficient in the provision of these sorts of skills In many EU Member States training in basic economic and financial literacy is not part of the standard curriculum and training on digital literacy and entrepreneurship has still much room to cover Note This framework is inspired by the T Skill framework see endnote 31 Refitting education for the demands of the world of work requires novel forms of schooling and teaching with a focus on the application of knowledge Transversal competences such as better management of one s own learning social and interpersonal relations and communication need to be integrated in all learning methods from pre school to training schemes for mature workers Figure 8 29 As David Deming of Harvard University once observed the most advanced preschool classrooms look a lot like the modern work world Children move from art projects to science experiments to the playground in small groups and their most important skills are sharing and negotiating with others 30 Similarly social skills need to be part of the curriculum to create conditions for complementing technology with the human touch In many business and medical schools so called flipped classrooms focus on interactive discussion while lectures are to be followed online outside of the classroom Vocational training schemes that successfully complement vocational skills with instruction in maths science and language like in Germany s dual education system are well equiped for the changing employment landscape while providing flexibility for life long learning Apart from promoting new ways of learning it is equally important to ensure access to world class education and talent to make sure that the EU s younger generation sources from international best practices In the collaborative work culture and economy of the future having broader analytical skills and knowledge and being able to learn fast by linking up different perspectives from different disciplines appears more relevant than ever 31 This competence is often referred to as T shaped skills where the T represents the depth of an expertise in a single field whereas the horizontal bar is the ability to collaborate across disciplines The European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund will inject over EUR 30 billion to support skills development in the period 2014 2020 while the Erasmus programme supports skills development in education and training with nearly EUR 15 billion Moreover through the European Structural and Investment Funds ESIF the EU plans to invest EUR 454 billion in Europe s cities and regions while channelling funding to over 2 million enterprises to support growth increase competitiveness develop projects and most importantly create new jobs In addition to the ESIF bridging the investment gap through the implementation of the European Fund for Strategic Investments EFSI can have a significant impact on improving Europe s job prospects Human capital formation is a core priority area of EFSI while its most successful spending vehicle to date is aimed at SMEs and mid cap companies It is estimated that 1 8 million jobs can be created directly or indirectly through the leveraging effect of the Investment Plan on the assumption that projects selected do not crowd out private investment 32Mainstreaming EFSI to areas with highest unemployment levels can help address labour market disparities across the EU while synergy should also be established with the smart specialisation strategy Complementary support to skill development can generate additional positive gains in the volume of employment Indeed the EFSI regulation states clearly that projects in the field of human capital culture and health should include education training the development of ICT skills and digital education Member States should offer customised training programmes to improve the skills matching performance of the labour market in the sectors benefiting from the EFSI Beyond complementing Member States actions a dedicated human capital investment instrument could be added to the EFSI providing pooled finance for investment in this area in the same way that the framework already does for SMEs The increased likelihood of job changes contractual and on demand work means that it will be more difficult to target training and retraining Therefore the risk of human capital depletion could grow As already mentioned employers may be more selective when investing in their employees training or reskilling This means that new arrangements will have to be crafted to effectively share the burden of regular training between individual workers employers and the state Today publically financed education is mainly directed towards children and young adults not yet in employment In the future such arrangements need to focus just as much on workers and job seekers aiming to fundamentally improve their employability Innovative public private partnerships between schools universities and private training providers should be encouraged to invest in skills development and human capital of a fluid and highly mobile workforce Such a skills endowment could be pre financed through education linked loans that would only have to be paid back when and if the recipient achieves a certain level of income through their subsequent employment This investment approach draws from the English student loans model Re designing employment services and active employment policies for a flexible world of work calls for governments to find more innovative ways of policy intervention Supporting employability can no longer be a one off action It involves a series of measures and instruments that may be personalised at different stages of one s working life As workers are more likely to change employers jobs sectors and even countries benefits and protection must be linked to the individual and not to jobs or unemployment which disadvantages those with non standard employment or risks unwillingly incentivising informal work or inactivityOne way of going about customisation of social policy could be the establishment of notional personal human capital accounts to create a pool of resources for everyone to use throughout their careers Depending on specific requirements the resources could be used for training and retraining purposes related to work assignments Apart from a fraction of their salary being designated for the function workers would be in the position to benefit from tax free contributions to their schemes from employers and or public and private partners The scheme could be relevant for all workers whether holding fixed contracts or being self employed further levelling the field in the world of work Care and non care personal and household services in Europe are increasingly outsourced by households to third parties The care sector which has a notable potential in terms of job creation is largely characterised by undeclared labour and therefore uncertain and even risky working conditions Certain schemes however have been particularly successful in creating formal jobs leading to standard contracts and full social protection coverage The Titres Services voucher model established in Belgium since 2004 is one such successful example Workers are employed by an organisation private or public for profit or not that sells the services to different households Households pre purchase vouchers usually on line and use these to request the services they need cleaning washing ironing gardening shopping meal preparation etc from the company The company then assigns the tasks to a worker The price of each hourly voucher is set by the state which also offers a 30 tax deduction to users of Titres Services thereby providing users with an incentive to prefer a formal arrangement for these services over undeclared work For the worker the accumulation of vouchers by working in different households each day offers them access to a formal labour contract guaranteeing the same rights as any other worker including paid vacation health and pension rights Depending on the number of vouchers collected the worker may choose to work part time or full time and after three consecutive months with the same provider fixed term contracts become open ended Employers can benefit from a reduction in their social contribution if they recruit long term unemployed participating in activation programmes Unemployed persons and recipients of social assistance are targeted by this measure as 60 of jobs under the scheme must be attributed to such categories of people The scheme is quite costly for the public purse due to the tax reduction offered However the direct and indirect advantages far outnumber the costs Among these decrease in unemployment new social contributions new receipts on personal income tax the impact on consumption from new workers the indirect creation of new jobs like administrative jobs in the agencies and freeing up women who use the vouchers to free up time so they can pursue their own careers And of course the societal benefits of creating new jobs particularly for low skilled workers under decent working conditions and social protection and reducing the informal sector ORSEU 2013 Developing personal and household services in the EU A focus on housework activities Report for the DG Employment Social Affairs and Social Inclusion We still know little about the new dynamics described above and how firms and workers cope with them Measuring resilience targeting investment assessing the return and turning public intervention to where it is needed the most requires the use of micro data Big data offers an unprecedented opportunity to track and anticipate gaps in skills map mismatches and polarisation in the job market and marry employers need with employees capabilities It also offers transparency for individuals to understand potential career options education and training requirements and how these are remunerated in the labour market Modernising and expanding job classifications may also be necessary given the transformations underway What is more big data offers policymakers the chance to leverage behavioural insights and avoid inefficiencies in implementation Experience of agencies such as the UK Behavioural Insights Team with the Department for Work and Pensions shows that studying the behaviour of job seekers can substantially increase policy returns There is a case for accelerating and streamlining the adoption of data driven and evidence based policy and decision making A number of ongoing projects yield very promising results including Vacancies for ICT Online Repository Victory project which is a big data related pilot initiative to map online vacancies for jobs and associated skills Another example is data4policy eu which supports big data and other innovative data driven approaches for evidence based policy making Finally combining the potential of big data with more regular labour force surveys would permit to better monitor changes in the pace and nature of work relationships This is fundamental to understand the forces affecting the European economy the working conditions and the quality of life of European workers These precise efforts are already underway in the US with the RAND Princeton Contingent Worker Survey RPCWS in 2015 The Contingent Worker Survey tracks alternative or non standard work relationships in the United States It had not been conducted since 2005 meaning there was a substantial lack of data on on going labour market developments To respond to this data void Lawrence F Katz from Harvard University and Alan B Krueger from Princeton University based themselves on the Bureau s Contingent Worker Survey and expanded it to gain more complete information on work arrangements Having more dynamic data is core to be able to monitor and diagnose developments in Europe s labour markets Effectively investing in people requires that governments make their instruments for social investment user centred Drawing on the pools of available data governments identify future needs for policy intervention as well as emerging vulnerabilities and opportunities that may be better tapped into through early activation measures The world of work is part and parcel of the changing economy heavily influenced by globalisation international value and supply chains more division of labour and digital disruption Work is no longer a static concept but an umbrella term for roles performed in a different manner and under different legal arrangements Public policy needs to adapt to this new situation and benefit from the agility that comes with it while mitigating the downsides Europe has a strong manufacturing base a diverse and talented workforce and a large creative economy that offer a rich backdrop for a future of work with creative and fulfilling jobs By orchestrating more tailor made customised interventions based on granular insights provided by big data sources it can achieve better results and foster the context within which both individuals and firms can thrive Governments need to find more innovative ways to offer life long and personalised support for employment skills and welfare adapted to

in short supply forcing companies to examine their workforce capabilities According to PwC s latest CEO survey 38 of CEOs globally say they re extremely concerned about the availability of key skills as a threat to business growth It s a consequence of living in an era when employers estimate that a third of the desired core skill sets of most occupations will change by 2020 1 To meet the promise of this age mid career upskilling and transition must be a critical focus for both companies and individuals now Gone are the days when you can roll out one size fits all training programs and expect to see results To be effective the experience needs to be as individualized as each worker and as dynamic as the evolving roles And advances need to come faster with a significant buy in from those who will ultimately be responsible for skills employees To meet the promise of this age mid career upskilling and transition must be a critical focus for both companies and individuals now 1 The World

relying on data and predictive analytics for recruiting and performance management HR professionals need technical competencies plus business acumen and communication skills These hybrid roles work across domains and generally demonstrate competency in three areas Business and science skills including domain specialties such as marketing organizational design and finance or specific focus areas across physical and social sciences The ability to share data across domains is contributing to new discoveries and innovations Human or soft skills including communication critical thinking adaptability problem solving leadership creativity and innovation These become even more essential in a digital organization Technology skills including a wide range of information technology skills from basic data literacy to applying artificial intelligence to real world problems This area is most commonly cited as a gap for mid career workers as data and analytics are becoming more democratized and more useful across organizations To compete and thrive in this era CEOs need individuals who have all three sets of skills But where do you find these rare superstars While CEOs are concerned about the availability of digital skills in their workforce they continue to acknowledge that soft skills are also vital and just as hard to find Companies winning the skills battleground are those that focus on the human experience while investing in technology and can attract people who function well in multidisciplinary teams and influence others across the organization While CEOs are concerned about the availability of digital skills in their workforce they continue to acknowledge that soft skills are also vital and just as hard to find Despite a growing awareness of the need for new skills few companies have effective programs in place but more are waking to reskilling 42 of global CEOs we ve surveyed say they are implementing continuous learning initiatives to a large extent 2 Follow the steps below to get your own upskilling initiative started Much of your success will depend on your ability to understand the capabilities you ll need for future success Where do you want your organization to go What do you need to get there Assess the skills and capabilities of your current workforce against the capabilities you ll want in the future not what you need now The goal is to identify gaps so you can help individuals focus on specific areas to reskill or upskill Create a real time system that helps monitor progress over time 2 PwC s 2018 Global CEO Survey January 2018 Explore adjacencies jobs that may seem different but actually share similar skills to give workers options to shift into new roles For example a skills assessment at a software company revealed that the less in demand graphic designer role actually shared many of the same skills as the critically needed digital marketer role Once you have a baseline understanding of skills promote transparency so each of your people understands where they are now against the future skills they ll need to master Sponsor learning paths that allow for individualized learning journeys When learning is fun and paired with coaching lightweight frequent check ins employees and their managers sustain momentum and lessen the risk that the investment in reskilling will be abandoned Productivity and innovation may mean infusing new energy into your workforce Experienced hires with diverse skills and backgrounds change the makeup of your organization and change how work gets done Diversity in approach is especially true in digital transformations where traditional best practices don t lead to needed outcomes Ensure your talent pool is aligned with your business objectives and hire accordingly Integrating people with new ways of thinking into your workforce can help accelerate change and promote innovation across the organization To truly accelerate skill change in your organization you ll need to create new spaces and new experiences More companies are experimenting with incubator or accelerator programs where individuals with diverse skills and mindsets convene in multidisciplinary teams to break through siloed thinking They apply their skills to real challenges the organization faces and create totally new solutions This new way to serve customers patients or end users will change the fabric of how work is done More companies are modernizing the work environment for everyone providing employees with new flexible ways of working and new opportunities to practice skills their organizations value While this can mean piloting chatbots and apps it can also mean raising the level of human interaction in customer service While you are changing from within look outside your organization to academic institutions governments and policy makers Reskilling workers and preparing the workforce for the future will require help from them When it comes to education consider creating partnerships with academic institutions to help revise curriculums and create opportunities for lifelong learning Develop or expand apprenticeship or internship opportunities to build skills through real world experience and to create a talent pipeline for future workers 18 of CEOs globally say they expect to grow their company s workforce through such programs 3Develop or expand apprenticeship or internship opportunities to build skills through real world experience and to create a talent pipeline for future workers When thinking about policy be aware of issues that affect worker flexibility and engage in policy discussions For many workers job mobility retraining and rotation will become a crucial way of improving their employability and earning potential Many people feel tethered to their current job because of the pressures of debt and the need for employer benefits Incentives aimed at encouraging mobility and development of skills will be important All of this work is ongoing continually monitored and revised As you progress ask yourself How is the profile of my staff changing How are my needs changing Find ways to reshape the opportunities for your people to apply new skills in new ways 3 Ibid Gone are the days when education and work were two separate phases in people s lives To succeed in the future individuals need to adopt a continuous learning mindset and proactively engage in reskilling themselves Fortunately the majority of workers appear to understand this already a PwC survey found that 74 say they believe it s their own responsibility to update their skills rather than relying on any employer Here are some steps individuals can take toward reskilling Much of the success of an individual s reskilling efforts will hinge on being self motivated As LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman says embrace a start up of you mentality which means adopting a more entrepreneurial approach and carving your own path

American employers cannot find people with the skills they need even for entry level jobs according to the 2017 report by McKinsey Closing the skills gap Creating workforce development programs that work for everyone It s a growing problem By 2020 management consultancy firm Korn Ferry predicts that the technology media and telecommunications industries may be short of more than 1 1 million skilled workers globally Modern developer skills advanced data science and management cloud based skills and artificial intelligence AI and machine learning are all in great demand Jennifer Byrne chief technology officer at Microsoft US said By 2030 McKinsey predicts that as many as 375 million workers roughly 14 of the global workforce may need to switch occupational categories as digitalisation automation and advances in AI disrupt the world of work So how can businesses prepare for the future find the skills they need and get the most from their current talent pool and processes We need to significantly lower the barrier to skills adoption for every employee in every organisation Byrne said Future workforce strategies that address training and certification coaching and mentoring aligned to broader digital transformation objectives should be a board level initiative Companies that invest in their current and future workforces invest in themselves Byrne urges companies to focus their attention on ongoing skills development and make learning part of the company culture so that employees are empowered to take responsibility for their own education gain confidence in working with new technologies and be more willing to develop beyond what they know right now Creating an environment where learning is a core value and a growth mindset is embedded into every aspect of a company can shift human dynamics towards curiosity and open mindedness about new ways of working she said That reduces the friction often present in technologies rolled out across an organisation and hopefully creates more viral adoption of technology Last year Microsoft customer AT T initiated a retraining effort after discovering that nearly half of its 250 000 employees lacked the necessary science technology engineering and maths skills needed to remain competitive We could go out and try to hire all these software and engineering people and probably pay through the nose to get them but even that wouldn t have been adequate Bill Blase the company s senior executive vice president of human resources told CNBC AT T s answer is an initiative known as Future Ready a US 1 billion web based multiyear effort which includes online courses collaborations with Coursera Udacity and leading universities and a career centre that allows employees to identify and train for future jobs Microsoft partner Siemens meanwhile is also investing significantly in its talent pipeline It spends more than 500 million US 580 million a year on training reskilling and upskilling its employees worldwide New technologies and new knowledge are arising in ever shorter cycles Janina Kugel chief human resources officer at Siemens wrote in a LinkedIn article The digital transformation and the importance of humans These rapid developments mean our workforce has to acquire new skills To remain fit for work and ensure that we ll have marketable skills in the future we have to acquire new qualifications on a constant basis This form of continuing education is a top priority at Siemens As businesses look to instil a mindset of continuous learning across all levels of their organisations then they need to invest more time helping employees expand their knowledge base in a variety of different ways including training mentorship hackathons and other creative forms of skills development Massive open online courses MOOCs and other forms of online training virtual reality and mixed reality for jobsite training and AI for more precise insights into individual learning patterns and potential are all great examples of technology helping itself Byrne said Microsoft aims to not only develop a dynamic learning culture within its own organisation but is doing what it can to prepare its customers workforces for the changes that digital transformation will undoubtedly continue to bring We want to help equip learners with the digital skills that are necessary for 21st century jobs and excite learners about the power of technology Byrne explained Our Digital Literacy programme helps instil learners with confidence in their ability to use technology We also offer MOOCs created by Microsoft and other leading partners that teach key skills and concepts in technology Our Microsoft Professional Program aligns curriculum a specific MOOC content and a capstone project to specific roles in technologies Digital skills are only part of what employers need to develop however They also need to focus on the human capabilities needed to work effectively alongside technology social and emotional skills which computers don t have At a basic level everyone needs more technical skills Byrne said The surprise though is the greater need for human skills Technology can automate most things but the aim of automation has always been to create more operational efficiency in order to free up the workforce for higher value or more qualitative work That work usually requires interpersonal skills creativity and an understanding of human behaviour And one must not forget what all of this progress is actually for It s up to all of us to shape the digital transformation in a way that serves human interests Siemens Kugel said After all ultimately the idea behind the digital transformation is to make the world a better place for people not for technologies Perhaps then as we look to a future where almost two thirds of today s students will do jobs that don t even exist yet we can expect to see the entire notion of work and workplaces change almost beyond recognition Most companies are acutely aware that addressing the needs of their current and future workforces is an imperative Byrne explained Beyond that basic acknowledgment there is a growing understanding that the notion of workforce itself needs to be re imagined When we think about the workforce today the common denominator is people People and jobs are interchangeable in today s conversations However now the conversation is shifting toward skills within jobs and I believe that is the next big evolution in the way we will think about how technology will profoundly impact the workforce of the future Could we redefine the very notion of a job and move toward a more shared and agile approach to accomplishing work where specific skills and competencies are more important than singular career paths Number of views 3195 Comments Sign up here to receive our monthly email newsletter Sign inThe Future of Jobs Report 2018This data is based on the results of a survey which focused on gathering the views of business executives principally Chief Human Resources Officers CHROs facing the workforce changes of today s enterprises Here we present a summary of highlights with a focus on the Australian perspective and argue that the banks and telcos are retrenching over 50 000 people in the next 2 3 suggesting we are not doing enough to retain workers while they upskill or reskill so they can transition to the new roles created The full report from WEF can be accessed hereThe new world of work offers numerous opportunities for individuals and businesses to flourish the economy to prosper and society to progress However in order to make the most of these opportunities we will need to approach them differently to how we have approached opportunities in the past Much has been said about the industries set to lose out with the advent of artificial intelligence AI Yet the Future of Jobs Report shows that the increased demand for new roles will offset the decreasing demand for others However these gains will mean difficult transitions for millions of workers around the world Governments organizations educational institutions and the community will need to collaborative to ensure that workers develop the skills required for these new jobs Sharon Mackie Goh CEO and Chief Customer Officer at Your New Gig says we do not fully understand the extent of job loss to new roles The changes required to participate in the workforce for some will be significant and this is why we need to start having the conversation now so people can reflect adjust and then move forward While individuals must be proactive in their quest to upskill and re skill governments will need to assist by creating environments and systems that rapidly and creatively support these efforts Businesses also need to recognise that investing in their people has many benefits Otherwise skills shortages and gaps may significantly hamper the adoption of new technology by business Whether we like it or not our job market is already being influenced by new technology and for organisations responding to new ways of working In 2018 an average of 71 of total task hours across 12 industries covered in the report are performed by humans compared to 29 by machines By 2022 this average is expected to have shifted to 58 task hours performed by humans and 42 by machines In real terms this means nearly half of companies expect to experience some reduction in their full time workforce by 2022 However 38 of businesses expect to extend their workforce to new productivity enhancing roles while more than 25 expect automation to lead to the creation of new jobs In order to cope with this rapidly changing landscape between one half and two thirds of businesses expect to expand their workforce to include contractors temporary staff and freelancers who will perform specialised work They also intend to engage workers on a more flexible basis and to embrace off site working arrangements While this solution may fill skill gaps it raises other questions including how organisations can best manage a more fluid workforce of contractors and project teams while simultaneously continuing to instill the values culture and purpose to their workforce Two concurrent trends which are driving business growth are the continued rise of tech jobs and skills and human centric jobs and skills those that depend on intrinsic human qualities These trends mean that over the next five years there will be an increasing demand for We can also expect to see new specialist roles such as Roles leveraging those distinctive human skills will include Jobs that are expected to become increasingly redundant over the 2018 2022 period are routine based middle skilled white collar roles which are susceptible to advances in new technologies and process automation These include Mackie Goh suggests that you could add middle management to this list particularly in large businesses who are experiencing structural changes With the rapidly changing world of work it only follows that the demand for skillsets will also change The table below illustrates the kinds of skills that will be in demand and on the decline by 2022 Mackie Goh says this data shows there is a focus on what is often termed soft skills We see them as a combination of attitude communication aptitude and social skills and prefer to call them EQ or non technical skills Also there will be a need for us to have varying levels of digital literacy she says According to the Foundation of Young Australians FYA New Work Order report there are four levels of digital literacy You would think that the majority of people are or will need to work towards becoming a digital citizen or digital worker while many of the roles needed for the future will require a high level of digital building capability says GohBased on this data it s obvious that reskilling our workers will be necessary The Future of Jobs Report indicates that globally by 2022 at least 54 of all employees will require significant re and upskilling Of these around 35 will need training of up to six months 9 will need six to 12 months of training while 10 will require more than a years training According to the report Australian businesses anticipate that nearly half of Australians 49 won t require any reskilling at all with 55 of businesses confident about their strategies to deal with changing technology Mackie Goh says in stark contrast however banks and telcos have announced that they will be releasing thousands of employees over the next two three years While all have programs in place to support these people by paying for outplacement services or courses they are not considering reskilling with the intention that they remain with the company However they will look to hire in areas where there are skill gaps We have to acknowledge that companies cannot be expected to retain all their people however there is an argument to say they can allow people time and allocate more learning dollars to their budgets so they can reskill rather than recruit to solve their needs she says Most of the allocation of a business s learning budget today leans toward senior management You only have to look at the number of Executive coaches and courses offering services today If that is correct then you would have to challenge the reports 49 will not require reskilling In terms of responding to shifting skills needs 87 of businesses were looking to automate the work while 84 planned to hire new permanent staff with skills relevant to new technologies Almost three quarters 74 planned to retrain their employees while 73 are going to hire new temporary staff with the relevant skills Half of businesses surveyed anticipated using their internal departments to retrain their workers while 29 expected to outsource this to private training providers In order to maximise the gains and minimise the losses expected governments companies and community will need to find win win solutions for their workers and their bottom lines The introduction of automation technology has the potential to make or break businesses which is why it s imperative that companies face this challenge head on in order todevelop a motivated agile workforce who are equipped with the right skills for the future job market Businesses will need to invest considerable time and money in reskilling their workforce However the Future of Jobs Report found that most companies intended to limit their skills training provision for the next five years to employees already performing today s in demand jobs instead of thinking more long term and creatively In order to increase the availability of future skills and address an impending skills scarcity it will be necessary for organisations and individuals to take a more inclusive and proactive approach and create a culture of lifelong learning to enable a wider range of workers to be retrained It s important to provide learning opportunities to all potentially displaced workers such as the less skilled or middle managers While some may resist in the short term we need to change mindsets to encourage everyone to embrace new job types and new ways of working Australia Post with their Post People 1st initiative is a great example of reskilling their existing workforce This initiative delivers a range of employment and development opportunities for their people When the company reformed their letters service it made a commitment that there would be no forced redundancy of any employees directly impacted by the restructure Instead Australia Post prioritises and supports their people through retraining or redeployment Ensuring a sufficient pool of appropriately skilled talent will also give companies a distinct competitive advantage Companies who invest in their people will increase productivity and have a motivated workforce The impact of AI is something we need to deal with now rather than an abstract concept of the future While it presents opportunities the Fourth Industrial Revolution also poses a number of challenges that must be addressed Firstly policy makers regulators and educators must commit to help those who are displaced repurpose their skills or retrain to acquire new skills They will need to work together to improve education and training systems in order to secure the skills and talent required for the new world of work Organisations need to think longer term about the types of jobs that will be available within their company the type of talent they need to fill these gaps and how best to secure that talent While moving towards a gig economy may be part of the solution they will still face the challenge on how to manage a transient workforce and keep company values culture and morale intact Individual workers must take personal responsibility for their own life long learning and career development While many individuals will need to be supported through periods of job transition and phases of retraining and upskilling by governments and employers those who are proactive about increasing their skillsets will be in a prime position to take advantage of the numerous opportunities that impending technological developments will bring Mackie Goh says it s time for all of Australia needs to start working together as there is so much to do Business government educational institutions and community must work together so we are ready for the challenges and opportunities that are already on our doorstep she says AI is unlikely to replace human workers However it s still uncertain as to what types of jobs will be created how permanent they will be working as a freelancer or contractor and the changes that can brings and what kind of training they may require To prepare the workforce for these changes Australia must understand the trends that are shaping the future of work and commit to helping workers adapt to rapid economic shifts This will include changing education and training systems labour market policies and developing a new attitude towards the way businesses approach their core business in particular around skills development and employment arrangements While this may not be easy for everyone involved it is imperative to adopt this mindset as we need to be prepared We d
