 Computer-assisted machines, robotics, and 
artificial intelligence (AI) have already spread 
in many industries and automated several parts 
of the production process. However, we are far 
from a consensus on how automation should be 
conceptualized and modeled.

Most economic models formalize technolog-
ical change as factor augmenting (meaning that 
technological progress acts as if it increased the 
effective units of one of the factors of production) 
or as Hicks neutral (which leads to a proportion-
ate increase in the output obtained from any 
input combination). Several authors, including 
Sachs and Kotlikoff (2012), Graetz and Michaels 
(2015), and Nordhaus (2015), also model auto-
mation as  capital-augmenting technological 
change, which assumes that automation should 
be thought of as embodied in more productive 
(or cheaper) capital, which will then substitute 
for labor in a process governed by the elastic-
ity of substitution. Bessen (2017), on the other 
hand, argues that automation mostly increases 
the productivity of labor and models automation 
as  labor-augmenting technological change.

We argue that these approaches miss a distinc-
tive feature of automation: the use of machines 
to substitute for human labor in a widening range 
of tasks (Acemoglu and Restrepo, forthcom-
ing, 2018—henceforth, AR). Partly as a result, 
 factor-augmenting technologies have a limited 
scope to reduce the demand for labor (this never 
happens with  capital-augmenting technologies, 
and can only happen with  labor-augmenting 
technologies for unrealistic parameter values). 
In addition, these approaches relate the impact 
of technology on the labor share to the elasticity

of substitution between capital and labor—an 
object that plays a different role and governs 
how factor prices affect the use of capital and 
labor.

In contrast, in a  task-based framework, auto-
mation, conceptualized as the expansion of the 
set of tasks that can be produced by machines, 
has very different effects. It always reduces the 
labor share and it reduces labor demand and the 
equilibrium wage unless the productivity gains 
from automation are sufficiently large.

A  task-based approach to modeling automa-
tion also brings new ideas to the table. First, it 
clarifies that the technologies most threatening to 
labor are not those that are major breakthroughs 
increasing productivity greatly, but those that 
are “ so-so”—good enough to be adopted but 
not so good that they increase productivity by 
much. Second, it highlights the important role 
of new tasks in which labor has a comparative 
advantage in counterbalancing the effects of 
automation. Third, it enables a discussion of 
the implications of deepening of automation, 
meaning an improvement in the productivity of 
machines in tasks that have already been auto-
mated. Fourth, it clarifies that the role of capital 
accumulation is distinct from the effects of auto-
mation on the labor share and implies that capi-
tal accumulation dampens the negative effects of 
automation on wages (if there are such negative 
effects) and the labor share (if the elasticity of 
substitution is less than one). Finally, this frame-
work can be generalized to study the implica-
tions of shortages of different types of skills and 
the conditions under which there may be exces-
sive automation.

I.  Factor-Augmenting Technologies

Suppose aggregate output is given by

  Y = F(  A K   K,  A L   L ), 

where  K  denotes capital,  L  is labor, and   
A K    and   A L    denote  capital-augmenting and 



VOL. 108 49MODELING AUTOMATION

 labor-augmenting technology, respectively. We 
assume throughout that  F  is continuously differ-
entiable, concave, and exhibits constant returns 
to scale. Let   F K    and   F L    denote the derivatives of  
F  with respect to capital and labor.

We focus on competitive labor markets, which 
implies that the equilibrium wages are equal to 
the marginal product of labor,

  W =  A L    F L   (  A K   K,  A L   L ). 

The labor share in national income is given by

   s L   =   WL _ Y   , 

and because of constant returns to scale, the cap-
ital share is   s K   = 1 −  s L   .

A.  Capital-Augmenting Technological Change

Suppose first that we model automation as 
 capital-augmenting technological change. The 
impact of this type of technological change on 
the equilibrium wage is given by

(1)    d ln W _ 
d ln  A K  

   =    s K   _  ε KL     > 0,  

where

(2)   ε KL   = −   
d ln (K / L)

 ___________ 
d ln ( F K   / F L   )

   > 0 

is the elasticity of substitution between cap-
ital and labor.1 Thus,  capital-augmenting 
 technology always increases labor demand and 
the equilibrium wage.

1 Let us rewrite (2) as
  ε KL   (d ln  F K   − d ln  F L   ) = − [d ln (  A K   K )  − d ln (  A L   L )] . 

Then using the facts that  d ln R = d ln  F K   + d ln  A K   ;  
d ln W = d ln  F L   + d ln  A L   ;  d ln K = d ln L = 0  (because of 
inelastic supplies); and  d ln  A L   = 0  (because technological 
change is capital augmenting), we obtain

  ε KL   (d ln W − d ln R ) = (1 −  ε KL   ) d ln  A K   . 

Also, because  F  exhibits constant returns to scale, we have  
Y = RK + WL . Log differentiating this equation, we obtain

  s K   d ln  A K   =  s K   d ln R +  s L   d ln W. 

Combining these two equations yields (1). 

Mathematically, this result follows because 
of constant returns to scale. Economically, 
 constant returns to scale imposes that capital 
and labor are  q -complements, and anything that 
increases the productivity of capital or makes 
capital effectively more abundant increases the 
marginal product of labor.

The effect of  capital-augmenting technologi-
cal change on the labor share is in turn given by

    
d ln  s L   _ 
d ln  A K  

   =  s K   (  
1 _  ε KL      − 1) , 

which is negative if and only if   ε KL   > 1  .2 Thus, 
 capital-augmenting technology reduces the 
labor share only if the elasticity of substitution 
between capital and labor is greater than one.

There is a debate on whether we should view 
the elasticity of substitution between capital and 
labor as less than or greater than one. Recent 
estimates that exploit  cross-country differences 
put it to be greater than one (Karabarbounis 
and Neiman 2014), while the bulk of the evi-
dence in the literature places it to be between 
0.5 and 1 (see Oberfield and Raval 2014 and 
the references therein). If we follow this broad 
consensus in the literature,  capital-augmenting 
technological progress increases the labor share.

In summary, if automation were to be con-
ceptualized as  capital-augmenting technological 
change, it would never reduce labor demand or 
the equilibrium wage, and it would increase the 
labor share—two predictions that are neither 
intuitively appealing nor always consistent with 
the evidence (see, e.g., AR 2017, for evidence 
that robots have a negative impact on local 
employment and wages).

B.  Labor-Augmenting Technological Change

Let us next turn to the implications of 
 labor-augmenting technologies,   A L   . We have

(3)    d ln W _ 
d ln  A L  

   = 1 −    s K   _  ε KL     ,  

2 Since labor is supplied inelastically, we 

have    
d ln  s L   _ 
d ln  A K  

   =   d ln W _ 
d ln  A K  

   −   d ln Y _ 
d ln  A K  

   . The result is obtained 

by observing that    d ln Y _ 
d ln  A K  

   =  s K    and combining this with (1).

which is positive provided that   ε KL   >  s K   .3 
Thus,  labor-augmenting technological change 
increases the equilibrium wage unless the elas-
ticity of substitution between capital and labor 
is very low. If we take the consensus range 
for the elasticity of substitution between 0.5 
and 1, and a capital share in the range 0. 3–0.4, 
 labor-augmenting technology increases labor 
demand and the equilibrium wage.

The effect of  labor-augmenting technology on 
the labor share is in turn given by

    
d ln  s L   _ 
d ln  A L  

   =  s K   (1 −   
1 _  ε KL    ) , 

which is negative if and only if   ε KL   < 1  .
In summary,  labor-augmenting technologi-

cal change reduces the labor share for realistic 
parameter values, but always increases labor 
demand and the equilibrium wage, which is 
again not consistent with recent empirical evi-
dence on the effects of automation on labor 
demand. In addition, modeling automation as 
directly increasing the productivity of labor 
is not fully satisfactory since automation also 
substitutes capital for labor in tasks previously 
performed by workers (so at the very least it 
would have to change the form of the produc-
tion function).

II. A  Task-Based Approach

Let us next consider an alternative approach 
based on AR (forthcoming) who in turn build 
on Zeira (1998), Acemoglu and Zilibotti (2001), 
and Acemoglu and Autor (2011). Suppose that 
aggregate output is produced by combining the 
services of a range of tasks. We take this com-
bination to be given by a constant elasticity of 
substitution (CES) aggregate and the range of 
tasks to be represented by a continuum. Then

(4)  Y =   ( ∫ N−1  
N
    y  (i)     

σ−1 _ σ    di)    
  σ _ σ−1  

  ,  

where  σ  is the elasticity of substitution between 
tasks and the integration between  N − 1  and  N  

3 The derivation is similar to the one in foot-
note 1. Differentiating  Y = RK + WL  , we obtain   
s L   d ln  A L   =  s K   d ln R +  s L   d ln W . Combining this with   
ε KL   (d ln W − d ln R ) = ( ε KL   − 1 ) d ln  A L    , which again fol-
lows from (2), yields (3). 

ensures that the measure of tasks is normalized 
to 1, simplifying the discussion.

Suppose that tasks  i > I  are technologically 
 non-automated and have to be produced by labor 
with the production function

(5)  y(i ) = γ (i ) l(i ) ,  

where  γ (i)  denotes the productivity of labor in 
task  i . In contrast, tasks  i ≤ I  are technologi-
cally automated and can be produced by either 
labor or capital, that is,

(6)  y(i ) = η(i ) k(i ) + γ (i ) l(i ) ,  

where  η(i)  is the productivity of capital in task  i .  
The fact that the output of task  i  is given by the 
sum of two terms, one with capital and the other 
one with labor, reflects the key aspect of this 
approach—in technologically automated tasks, 
capital and labor are perfect substitutes.

We assume that labor has a comparative 
advantage in  higher-indexed tasks, that is,  
γ (i) / η(i)  is strictly increasing in  i . We also 
assume that

(A1)    γ (I ) _ η(I )   <   
W _ 
R

   ,  

so that it is strictly cheaper to produce tasks in  
[0, I ]  using capital. AR (forthcoming) show that 
this assumption is equivalent to the capital per 
worker,  K / L  , or equivalently the  capital-output 
ratio,  K / Y  , being above a certain threshold,    κ ̅   L    
or    κ ̅   Y   . These assumptions imply that the tasks 
in the range  [0, I ]  will be produced with capi-
tal, and the tasks in  (I, N ]  will be produced with 
labor.

We model automation as an increase in  I . This 
choice makes it clear that automation corre-
sponds to an expansion of the set of tasks where 
machines can substitute for labor.

The following results are established in AR 
(forthcoming).

(i) Aggregate output is given by a CES aggre-
gate of capital and labor,

(7)  Y =  (  ( ∫ N−1

    η  (i)   σ−1  di)

  σ _ σ−1  

  ,



VOL. 108 51MODELING AUTOMATION

where the elasticity of substitution between cap-
ital and labor is given by  σ .

(ii) Under Assumption A1, automation 
increases productivity and aggregate output per 
worker. In particular,

(8)    d ln Y ____ 
dI

   =   1 ____ 1 − σ   [  (  
W ___ γ(I  )  )    

1−σ
  −   (  

R ___ η(I  )  )    
1−σ

 ]  > 0. 

Intuitively, Assumption A1 implies that it is 
cheaper to produce tasks in the neighborhood of  
I  with capital rather than labor. Thus an expan-
sion of the set of tasks that can be produced with 
capital raises productivity.

(iii) Automation changes the share parameters 
of the CES in equation (7). As a consequence, 
automation does not map to a combination of 
 factor-augmenting technological improvements, 
and always makes production less labor inten-
sive and reduces the labor share. Namely, the 
labor share in this case is

   s L   =   1  ______________________   

1 +   
  ( ∫ N−1  

I
    η  (i)   σ−1  di)    

  1 _ σ  
   K

N
   γ  (i)   σ−1  di)    

  1 _ σ  
   L     

σ−1 _ σ   

  

   , 

which is strictly decreasing in  I  regardless of the 
value of the elasticity of substitution between 
capital and labor. Thus the effect of automation 
on the labor share, when modeled in this fash-
ion, is entirely distinct from the effect of capital 
accumulation whose impact on the labor share 
depends on the elasticity of substitution.

(iv) Automation can reduce the equilibrium 
wage, even though it increases productivity. The 
impact of automation on the wage is given by

    d ln W _

   . 

The first term is the productivity effect, which 
results from the increase in aggregate out-
put from automation; it is given by (8) and is 
positive. The second term is the displacement 
effect, which is always negative. To see that 
for realistic parameter values the  displacement 

effect can dominate it suffices to return to 
(8) and note that it becomes very small when  
γ (I ) / η(I ) ≃ W / R . This condition in turn holds 
when the  capital-output ratio,  K / Y  , is close to 
the threshold    κ ̅   Y     .4

(v) Automation increases the demand for cap-
ital and the equilibrium rental rate; that is,

    d ln R _ 
dI

   =   1 _ σ      
d ln Y _ 

dI
   +   1 _ σ     

η  (I)   σ−1 
 ___________ 

 ∫ 
0
  
I

   > 0. 

It is also useful to note that this approach 
further provides a  micro-foundation for several 
models that consider technological changes that 
directly alter the exponents of capital and labor 
in a  Cobb-Douglas production function (e.g., 
Zuleta 2008, and Peretto and Seater 2013). In 
particular, consider the special case of our model 
where  N = 1  and  σ = 1  . Then,5

  Y = B   (  
K _ 
I
  )    

I
    (  

L _ 
1 − I  )    

1−I
  . 

It is also useful to return to Assumption 
A1. If in contrast to this assumption we had  
γ (I ) / η(I ) > W / R  , then tasks near  I  would not 
be produced with machines, because the effec-
tive cost of doing so would be greater than pro-
ducing them with labor. In this case, all tasks in  
[0,  I ̃   ]  for some   I ̃   < I  would be produced with 
capital, and all remaining tasks with labor. In 
this case, an increase in  I  would not affect the 
allocation of tasks to factors. In addition, other 
changes, for example, an increase in the function  
η(i)  , would impact the threshold task   I ̃    , though 
this endogenous change in the set of tasks pro-
duced with capital would have different implica-
tions than an increase in  I  under Assumption A1. 
For example, a rise in   I ̃    triggered by an increase 
in  η(i)  would only have a  second-order effect 
on aggregate output, and the equilibrium wage 

4 It is easy to construct examples for which the dis-
placement effect dominates the productivity effect. If we 
take  σ = 0.7  (the midpoint of most estimates), and set  
γ (i ) = η(i )  = 0.2  for all  i ∈ [0, 1]  , we obtain that the 
threshold    κ ̅   Y    is  2  , and the displacement effect dominates 
when the capital to output ratio satisfies  K / Y ∈ (2, 6.5) .  
This interval comfortably includes the US  capital-output 
ratio which is approximately 3.

would strictly increase because of the direct 
effect of higher  η(i) . This discussion explains 
why we conceptualized automation as a tech-
nological change expanding the set of tasks that 
can be (productively) performed by capital.

III. New Ideas from the  Task-Based Approach

We conclude by emphasizing several ideas 
that are highlighted by our  task-based approach.

The Productivity Effect.—Our analysis 
stressed the central role of the productivity 
effect. Whether automation increases or reduces 
the equilibrium wage depends on how power-
ful the productivity effect is. This observation 
implies that, in contrast to some popular dis-
cussions, the automation technologies that are 
more likely to reduce the demand for labor are 
not those that are “brilliant” and highly produc-
tive, but those that are “ so-so”—just productive 
enough to be adopted but not much more pro-
ductive or  cost-saving than the production tech-
niques that they are replacing (see AR 2018).

New Tasks.—This approach highlights the 
role of the creation of new tasks in which labor 
has a comparative advantage—as captured by 
an increase in  N  in our model. Under natural 
assumptions, new tasks increase productiv-
ity, the demand for labor, and the labor share. 
Our framework clarifies that a balanced growth 
process where the labor share remains constant 
depends on the simultaneous expansion of auto-
mated and new tasks (see AR forthcoming).

Deepening of Automation.—In our model, we 
can think of increases in  I  as capturing “auto-
mation at the extensive margin”—meaning 
extending the set of tasks that can be produced 
by capital. The alternative is “automation at the 
intensive margin” or “deepening of automa-
tion”—meaning increasing the productivity of 
machines in tasks that are already automated, 
which corresponds to an increase in  η(i)  in 
tasks  i ≤ I . The deepening of automation is 
equivalent to  capital-augmenting technologi-
cal change; it always increases the demand for 
labor, though its impact on the share of labor, for 
the same reasons as we have emphasized so far, 
depends on the elasticity of substitution between 
capital and labor.

Automation and Capital Accumulation.—
Because automation increases the demand for 
capital and the rental rate, it encourages capital 
accumulation. It is thus possible to have periods 
of fast automation during which the labor share 
declines and capital accumulation accelerates 
even if the elasticity of substitution between 
capital and labor is less than one. This perspec-
tive also implies that rather than being the cause 
of the decline in the labor share (as argued by 
Piketty 2014), capital accumulation may be a 
response to automation and lessen its negative 
impact on the labor share (when the elasticity of 
substitution is less than one).

The Role of Skills.—A version of this frame-
work with workers with heterogeneous skills 
specializing in different types of tasks can be 
used to study the implications of automation on 
wage inequality as well as the role of a shortage 
of certain types of skills in shaping the impact of 
automation on productivity gains and inequality 
(see AR forthcoming, 2018).

Excessive Automation.—It is difficult to ana-
lyze the issue of excessive automation with 
 factor-augmenting technologies. Modeling 
automation as the substitution of machines for 
tasks previously performed by labor, on the 
other hand, shows that there may be excessive 
automation because of subsidies to capital or a 
divergence between the equilibrium wage rate 
and the social opportunity cost of labor (AR 
forthcoming, 2018).
