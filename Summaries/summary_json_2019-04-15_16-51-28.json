Our net estimates of the impact of productivity growth and innovation on outcomes of interest therefore sum over (1) direct industry-level effects; (2) indirect upstream and downstream effects in linked sectors; and (3) final demand effects accruing through the effect of productivity growth on aggregate value-added. A final contribution of the paper is that, by leveraging more than four decades of harmonized industry by country data, we can assess not only whether productivity growth and innovation appear to be labor-displacing, but whether this relationship has shifted over successive decades.
