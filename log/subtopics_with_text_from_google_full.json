{"automation": "Everyday uses of artificial intelligence that can talk listen and see are coming Is government ready When the 2008 Summer Olympics were about to open in Beijing China government authorities grew increasingly concerned about the city s notorious pollution problem Rather than risk the health of athletes and guests at the games dozens of nearby factories were ordered closed and driving restrictions reduced traffic by 90 percent according to state news reports While the moves were considered radical and impacted the region s economy the Beijing government felt it had little choice Today Beijing is saturated with sensors that can measure CO2 content and other pollutants Data from the sensors is now combined with information from the city s weather service and run through algorithms developed by IBM s Almaden Laboratory in Silicon Valley that help to predict whether or not the city is going to be impacted by high levels of pollution Based on the findings authorities can select which factories need to shut down if they want to reduce the chances of high pollution by 50 percent before the problem emerges The technology behind all this is artificial intelligence By collecting an enormous amount of data and combining it with historical data on weather patterns the city can predict just how bad pollution will be and then modestly dial back the industrial sector and traffic rather than shut down the entire city which is what happened in 2008 This is a practical way of using AI to mitigate a problem minimize the impact on the economy and reduce pollution overall said Jeff Welser vice president and director of the Almaden Laboratory If you re looking for a single word that sums up the status of artificial intelligence today it could be practical While the general public might get excited or alarmed by the concept of computers that can see hear and speak government has become quite bullish on real world applications of AI that can find ways to improve the environment make public spaces safer and most importantly strip out the mundane manual work that clogs up government operations This era of practical AI has already taken root in the private sector In a special report The Economist showcased how AI technology will reshape traditional business functions such as supply chain finance human resources and customer service For example companies will use AI to predict when equipment might fail or when a client is going to pay late Already 30 percent of companies now have standalone bots that can answer questions and solve problems In HR companies are building systems that can predict which job candidates are worth interviewing and can virtually screen candidates to increase diversity in hiring These are just some of the examples of what experts define as narrow AI in which machine learning neural networks and predictive analytics produce an output that is well understood Narrow AI is about intelligent automation of processes that have too much manual intervention as well as questions that require decisions that can be off loaded to the computer said Rick Howard vice president of research at Gartner AI thrives on data Lots of it Until recently trying to store and process that data was a costly endeavor for any organization But there s been a precipitous drop in storage and computer costs according to Benjamin Cheatham a senior partner with McKinsey and Company Those costs were a huge barrier to AI adoption he said Now we re inundated with data but storing and processing it no longer costs so much The result AI adoption has picked up rapidly But so far the adoption of AI in state and local government follows the same arc of adoption as technology in general It s happening at a much slower pace and smaller scale when compared to the private sector About 20 percent of our survey respondents in government CIOs are actively experimenting or have made investments in AI said Howard But compare that to a rate of 50 percent among what Gartner calls top performers in other industries Howard said that government should benchmark its adoption and deployment of AI against similar industries in the private sector such as finance banking and other financial services But when you look at the top performers in those fields 15 percent have made significant investments and have deployed scalable applications versus just 2 percent in government That shows you how big the gap is and more importantly how much quicker government needs to move with AI said Howard Despite what have been modest efforts to use AI in states and localities the desire to try AI is strong and experimentations have become increasingly useful Nowhere has this been more evident than with conversational AI A lot of governments are starting with chatbots said Kim Nelson executive director of state and local government solutions at Microsoft It s one of the emerging areas where AI will have an impact in state and local government and it s where they are experimenting to get comfortable Nelson reeled off a series of examples mostly having to do with bots that provide support by answering routine questions such as registering a business But then she mentioned how the San Diego County Sheriff has launched a bot that helps deputies get crucial information while they are in their cruiser Typically deputies call their dispatcher to run a license plate number or to get a profile check on a possible suspect It can take up to 30 minutes for that information to get back to the deputy in the cruiser she said But the bot known as Coptivity is a voice activated assistant that deputies can access in their cruiser and which is able to pull criminal background information as well as other sources of information from back end databases in real time It will also save dispatchers time on routine calls allowing them to focus on more complex information requests Nelson said the AI application wouldn t be possible without cloud computing which brings together data and cognitive services along with edge computing that allows for the fast response time needed by the deputies Bots are probably the most recognizable form of AI in government For now they tend to be used in very narrow applications answering simple and routine questions But their value increases as they listen to more conversations hear more questions learn from them and provide feedback that can improve customer service Jeff Gallino is the founder and chief technical officer of CallMiner an AI software company We listen to phone calls he said We take every word spoken how it was spoken put it into a database and mine that for insight Those insights include whether or not a customer was satisfied whether there might be a risk in the conversation and other outcomes such as the ability to pay a bill Over time the algorithms that CallMiner has developed can improve the efficiencies of call center agents manyfold saving companies millions of dollars But Gallino sees a real opportunity to use this special form of AI as a way to improve customer service in government particularly 311 call centers Gallino calls 311 an inbound form of phone service The public calls 311 to get answers to questions to request a service or to complain about a problem By collecting all types of calls into a database and then building a machine learning system local governments could start to predict who is calling based on whether the call is from a mobile phone or a landline whether the person has called before and the history of their previous calls By mining that information AI can route particular callers to specific agents who would be able to answer their query or complaint more quickly and with more accuracy Gallino refers to this as call deflection and when done right it can quickly increase caller satisfaction As Gallino and other AI experts point out the value in the technology right now is in its ability to sift through vast amounts of data find certain anomalies or patterns that would take humans far too long to notice and then use alerts or nudges to get agents to ask more pertinent questions or trigger the bot to provide a more targeted and accurate answer When those nudges alerts and intelligent responses are spread across the vast number of government service centers from municipal 311 systems to Medicaid eligibility programs the efficiencies begin to have an outsized impact on operations not to mention a surge in constituent satisfaction Gallino envisions a point in the near future where bots will answer a growing number of the calls queries and complaints on 311 calls and predicts that bots could also siphon off some of the initial questions that may happen on a 911 call before handing it over to a live dispatcher But the technology isn t quite there yet The challenge is to make the conversation with a bot more natural said IBM s Welser Right now bots are pretty good if a person asks a question that it understands and can give an answer to But that s not how human interaction works Phone into any call center and the caller and agent often exchange several questions and answers to clarify the situation Getting to that natural kind of conversation where a bot can replicate how a caller and agent go back and forth to understand a problem is an active part of research he said Welser points to other challenges that can arise as the use of AI spreads One issue is developing a better understanding of where certain correlations are coming from It s one thing to have correlations that might help predict future air pollution patterns but it s quite another when it comes to decision making that affects health and safety or some other important public policy AI should augment what a person is doing not replace them he said That means the human expert who is making a decision based on AI needs to understand where the sources of data came from where the outcome came from and the reasons the system came up with a particular recommendation or connection Keeping bias out of AI results is another ongoing challenge Almaden Labs spends a lot of time figuring out how to make sure unintentional bias hasn t been built into an AI system But Welser admits the problem won t be easy to fix State and local governments face their own particular barriers to deploying AI beyond the fundamental challenges with AI itself Not surprisingly the historically low levels of IT investment in the public sector have slowed the introduction of AI in government If you look at the technology stack in state and local government it s very antiquated said McKinsey s Cheatham The fundamental technology infrastructure hasn t been upgraded at the rate found in the private sector Cheatham also points to the lack of data scientists in the public sector as another reason AI is spreading so slowly Without the knowledge or expertise to craft AI solutions state and local governments will be heavily dependent on others to figure out the best way to use AI Then there is just the public s leeriness about AI What does it mean to have algorithms supporting public policy and decision making he asked As a result government will need to be far more transparent than the private sector when it comes to adopting and using AI In a bullish report on potential uses of AI in government published in 2017 Deloitte Insights predicted that with adequate investment and support AI could free up 30 percent of government workforce s time within five to seven years Just as digital spreadsheets transformed finance departments AI is expected to make routine back office work more efficient reported The Economist That kind of efficiency is expected to ripple throughout state and local government There is a huge value potential for government customers that use AI said Microsoft s Nelson She points to the enormous possibilities to curtail fraud waste and abuse using AI There s two trillion dollars spent annually by government Imagine the potential to save on fraud and waste using cognitive services The best way to get started with AI is by identifying the major pain points in a program that is amenable to AI according to Welser Second you want to make sure there s enough data in that program to train a system effectively The good news for state and local government is that if they have a good candidate for AI and they have the data there are now a number of pre developed cognitive programs out there that can help launch a productive application The vendor community is increasingly turning its attention to the government market as far as AI is concerned To be strategic about AI s future role in government Gartner s Howard suggests that states and localities focus on how they can become more conversational with a greater percentage of citizens It s all about becoming more intelligent he said Given that citizens are already used to interacting with AI in the commercial space and have come to expect to use a digital assistant bot or some type of intelligent service it s important that government not fall too far behind with AI If you let the technology gap window grow more than 30 months you are not doing anything to increase the trust and confidence in public institutions said Howard There is a digital urgency today time is not your friend With more than 20 years of experience covering state and local government Tod previously was the editor of Public CIO e Republic s award winning publication for information technology

thought leadershipABOUTPRIVACYCONTACTADVERTISE 2019 All rights reserved e RepublicAutomating governmentEven as artificial intelligence AI is forecast to exceed human capabilities across a range of industries it is also predicted to augment human labor In finance AI is already helping financial advisors augment financial planning while enhancing investment strategy And in medicine AI diagnostics systems have proven to be far more accurate than doctors in diagnosing heart disease and cancerous growths In fact McKinsey lists some 400 use cases representing 6 trillion in value across 19 industries in which AI will augment human work But what about government What will the impact of AI be on the nature of government Waking Government to AINot surprisingly much of the public sector has already begun experimenting with AI driven technologies At the federal level many agencies are beginning to deploy AI powered interfaces for customer service alongside an expanding use of software to update legacy systems and automate simple tasks Growing investments in infrastructure planning legal adjudication fraud detection and citizen response systems represent the first phase in the ongoing digitization of government Notwithstanding these investments however government remains far behind the private sector in deploying and integrating AI As Silicon Valley s Tim O Reilly has suggested augmenting government through AI is critical to modernizing the public sector AI based applications could potentially reduce backlogs and free workers from mundane tasks while cutting costs According to Deloitte documenting and recording information alone consumes a half billion staff hours each year at a cost of more than 16 billion in wages Add to this an additional 15 billion in the procuring and processing of information and the value of AI in transforming government bureaucracy becomes clear Some now argue that the affordances of technology are critical to remaking government for the 21st century Advancing democracies into the era of Big Data could go a long way towards reducing systemic dysfunction within the public sector Using sensor technologies and machine learning systems to reinforce government oversight could begin to reduce regulation while actually increasing the amount of oversight Coining the term algorithmic regulation for example O Reilly suggests that government regulations should be regarded as algorithms i e a set of rules that can be adjusted based on fresh data The most recent advancement in AI deep learning represents a revolution in the use of machines for supporting decision management forecasting data classification and the synthesis of information Building on deep learning tools AI could mean significantly improving service delivery for citizens and elevating the work of public service professionals while also inspiring a new generation of technocrats to enter government Alternatively AI could also mean remaking government altogether US CapitolDigital LeviathanIn the United States demographic polarization and toxic federal politics have stymied needed action on a host of pressing issues including immigration reform welfare reform gun control and the country s overall faith in government and its institutions More problematically this political polarization lends itself to growing concerns about the very efficacy of democracy itself Outside the US China is clearly pioneering an entirely different model of government Where Soviet style central planning led to scarcity and oppression China s new economic thinking is that Big Data can assist planned economies in shaping markets and potentially leapfrogging democracy Combining Big Data sensor technologies and AI China is introducing a techno utilitarianism that may well outpace participatory decision making Could China s model work in other countries and if so what would that mean for democracy In the West the growing fear is that China will become a kind of digital autocracy on a scale never previously imagined Given China s expanding use of AI and its outsized influence on the developing world this begs the question what systems of government are necessary for managing AI driven societies And what is the potential for exploitation in such a vast system of algorithmic management and control Technocracy or Democracy The worrying question today for many is whether democracy can survive AI The reality is that disruptive technologies like AI cannot be put back in the box AI is becoming a mainstream technology that will need to be effectively integrated into 21st century decision making across all institutions especially government In the wake of this digital revolution some functions of government will necessarily be eliminated But AI will also enable new tools for smart citizenship and open government that can augment democracy Rather than technocracy or democracy the answer will likely be a combination of both What we do know is that we are leaving the era of centralized systems and top down decision making As Beth Noveck former head of President Obama s Open Government Initiative explains representative democracy itself now faces a crisis of legitimacy The rationale for closed systems of decision making in which citizen participation is confined to voting or interest group activism belongs to a different era In an era of networks we now need tools that bridge algorithms with new forms of collaborative decision making Simply put we need digital democracies that build on the capabilities of AI and Big Data Follow me

Passionate about leading teams to guide public performance innovation and service At the recent WEF Annual meeting in Davos much discussion centered around the need for public private collaboration to overcome global challenges ranging from climate change to economic inequality Here we ll outline some ways in which governments can adopt digital technologies pioneered by the private sector and collaborate to deliver beneficial digital services which improve the lives of citizens all around the world These digital technologies can help governments to And yet despite some pockets of excellence in innovation most governments are lagging behind the corporate world in harnessing the power of digital A recent report from the World Economic Forum WEF labels governments the dinosaurs of the digital age slow lumbering and outdated And according to WEF s 2016 Network Readiness Index which assesses digital advancement the gap is widening between the growth in individuals ICT use and governments engagement in the digital economy To build a public sector that is fit for the future government must reinvent itself Digital transformation is not just about new technologies but requires an overhaul of organizational structures governance work processes culture and mindset It also means realizing a wider vision of relationships and business models that will redesign how public services function Only then will governments capture the wider benefits that digital transformation can bring to people and society To create this digitally enabled public sector of the future governments have five critical areas to consider Chapter 1Making it easier to use government services Today s citizens expect public services to be as personalized and responsive as the services they get from the private sector Governments need to reimagine how digital can be used to enhance the citizen s end to end experience of public services This requires the adoption of a citizen first culture and mindset in designing policies and delivering services The ultimate goal is to improve service quality promote transparent and efficient interaction enhance the level of public trust in government and drive better citizen outcomes Social media and mobile platforms are replacing traditional channels as a means to interact with government report concerns and provide feedback Mobile services such as apps and SMS enable people to access the services they need in a more convenient and targeted way These e participation tools also encourage greater collaboration with citizens by involving them in decision making policy setting budget prioritization problem solving and the co design of services The use of advanced analytics allows governments to leverage data continually gathered from people and devices to improve service design and personalize delivery For example patients making online appointments with a health service provider could be guided to additional sources of help with their condition such as a nearby support group or exercise class Already artificial intelligence AI can help deliver services to citizens using chatbots to complete transactions within government websites It can help improve urban planning by optimizing routes for transport operators reducing commuters journey times provide educational support to students based on their individual learning needs and enable online self referral and screening signposting citizens to social services based on their needs and eligibility In New South Wales Australia the last decade has seen a steady rise in the number of children needing protection services The lack of evidence based investment by the government and poor use of data meant that service delivery for child protection was often ineffective and reactive In response the state s Department of Family and Community Services FACS is implementing major reforms to strengthen the system The reforms aim to give children and young people the chance to have a safe loving permanent home for life and help them reach their potential To realize this vision FACS needed an information system that could support decision making and improve collaboration between the network of family carers caseworkers and service providers The department has replaced 14 disparate legacy systems with a single cloud based platform It integrates matches and merges data to provide a holistic single view of every child and young person under care Given the sensitivity strict controls and protocols have been established to govern data sharing The platform puts relevant information about a child in the hands of frontline staff helping them make the right interventions at the right time It also provides the means for service provider organizations family and carers to access and share information and improve collaboration between all those involved in the support of the child Chapter 2Optimizing the return on public investment In an environment of uncertain growth and rising demand governments must find sustainable ways to finance public services and infrastructure Digital technologies create opportunities to explore new models for providing services improve management of resources through smarter spending and link the money invested in programs and services to the outcomes they produce for citizens boosting accountability and trust Blockchain technology can help track how money is spent through the system for example from finance ministry to spending department and then delivery agency With better visibility of spending governments can make better decisions about how to allocate public resources Robotic process automation RPA offers increased speed and efficiency the flexibility to cope with peaks in demand or backlogs and the reduction of manually introduced errors Some governments are already using a virtual workforce to automate routine business processes relieving the burden of high volume repetitive tasks and freeing up time and resources that can be focused on frontline services Predictive analytics and text mining can make an important contribution to the smart management of public resources by anticipating problems and enabling preventative action for example identifying taxpayers at risk of nonpayment 3D printing has the potential to improve turnaround time and reduce construction costs for infrastructure and public transportation projects establish more efficient and lower cost supply chains for defense agencies and facilitate job creation and economic transformation of remote locations through the introduction of new manufacturing capabilities As well as deploying these technologies to boost public value governments must think differently about their role becoming a platform for an ecosystem of partners including agencies private businesses not for profit organizations social enterprises and citizens that together can develop innovative services and business models EY has been working with the City of Edinburgh Council to introduce intelligent automation IA as a way to sustain essential services in a challenging environment The challenge is that citizens needs are getting more complex while at the same time everyone expects councils to do more with less says Shelia Haig the council s Revenues and Benefits Manager Automations developed so far include The council has realized significant benefits Customer service has improved and there is greater availability of services 24 7 in some cases Administrative tasks are being provided with high accuracy and reduced effort In turn employees are freed up to spend less time carrying out routine tasks and more time using their specialist skills Employee engagement and job satisfaction are higher as a result The fundamental question is do you want a social worker spending 80 of their time filling in forms or helping someone says Kirsty Louise Campbell formerly the council s Head of Strategy and Insight After all a desire to help people is why they went into the profession in the first place Chapter 3Keeping people information and strategic interests safe We live in uncertain times The threats from unpredictable states terrorist groups and other non state actors are increasing and made more complex through digital technology Today conflicts are waged not only on the battlefield but on public transport on social media and in cyberspace Governments have a responsibility to safeguard their citizens from a whole range of threats enabling them to live and work without fear Digitalization is both a hindrance and a help in this struggle On the one hand as governments embrace digital technologies and become more interconnected with partner organizations and smart devices new vulnerabilities arise that can be exploited by cyber attackers Terrorists fraudsters and hackers can jeopardize the delivery of essential public services and the smooth running of civil society including the election process On the other hand digital technologies and better data sharing provide a sophisticated means of combating threats Defense organizations are investing in AI and machine learning cyber weapons and threat detection programs cybersecurity apparatus robotics and digital tools to make them nimbler and more effective Police forces are using mobile technologies to reduce incident response times while data analytics is enabling predictive policing models and better threat analysis planning Citizens are becoming increasingly concerned about the way their data is being used So governments are introducing information security management systems to safeguard the data they keep and increasingly rely on Governments must also exploit the power of cloud computing to increase their own computing capacity support secure biometric identification programs and provide safe payment platforms for citizen transactions Our Government Public Sector community brings together more than 20 000 EY people from over 100 countries All of us share a passion to help governments work better for their people Bane NOR Norway s rail infrastructure provider is in the process of replacing its 1950s era technology with a next generation traffic control system It has also introduced other digitalization initiatives aimed at reducing maintenance costs making services more reliable and providing better and faster information for travelers and train operators However it lacked a coherent framework for managing cybersecurity risk The EY team helped Bane NOR develop and implement a risk management process for cybersecurity Introducing new technology such as IP Internet Protocol based traffic management new IoT systems and analytics not only solves problems it introduces fresh challenges and risks that the organization must take into account So it was key to make cyber risk analysis an ongoing part of risk management so that the correct measures can be put in place to help mitigate against emerging threats Bane NOR is now able to manage the risks of its systems and networks in order to deter detect and respond to cyber threats and implement recovery procedures if a cyber incident does occur The government is satisfied with Bane NOR s cybersecurity management which now meets the required standards The cybersecurity improvements have led to more transparency regarding risks making the network more secure passengers safer and data better protected Chapter 4Improving capabilities in the public sector and reimagining work Economic growth social cohesion and equality of opportunity rely on a country s workforce being skilled and ready to embrace the needs of 21st century employers Governments need to build the skills and capabilities of their own employees in order to drive greater efficiencies elevate customer focus and strengthen diversity and inclusion In a competitive labor market the public sector has not always been an employer of choice for top talent Governments need to do more to attract retain and develop people with the required skills and capabilities As they gradually build a more dynamic and responsive environment governments will attract younger workers who are in search of purpose led roles where they can make a difference to society Creating this culture partly relies on governments freeing up employees time to concentrate on more stimulating and value adding tasks This can be done by deploying intelligent automation tools to complement human workers Reducing the amount of manual and repetitive work leads to higher levels of productivity and satisfaction in turn helping to attract and retain high quality candidates and improve citizens experience with government services Mobile technologies can help agencies empower their workforce to do their jobs more effectively As a high proportion of public sector employees regularly work outside the office they can be equipped with devices such as smartphones tablets and laptops to perform their duties wherever they re located While governments prepare their own workforces for the digital age technological changes such as automation and AI have far reaching implications for the future of work economies and society in general Governments must adopt update and strengthen policies to mitigate adverse social and economic consequences such as the displacement of workers in some lower skilled jobs and widening social inequality Smart buildings provide a framework to allow real estate hospitality and construction companies to capitalize on digital innovation To reduce crime and repeat offending police officers need to understand their communities In a key plank of digital transformation undertaken by Greater Manchester Police EY designed and procured new mobile capabilities to allow officers to spend more time in valuable public facing activities and less time processing paperwork back at base Over the course of a nine month deployment 6 500 officers and other staff were equipped with more than 9 000 devices including smartphones tablets and wearable tech For the first time they could use a mobile app to complete key policing procedures on the spot such as taking witness statements logging evidence and consulting the main database This major shift in policing methods was underpinned by a new operating model and an integrated operational policing system that gives users access to better quality information supports citizen interaction and improves information sharing with partners such as fire fighters and paramedics The time and resources saved equate to 66 additional officers in the field per year The project to provide all of my officers with mobile technology has been a resounding success says Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Ian Hopkins Giving officers the modern tools they need to help them solve incidents and problems without needing to return to the police station has improved our performance and efficiency dramatically Chapter 5Helping societies and economies to function better Many of today s most fundamental challenges urbanization globalization pollution water shortages and climate change can be tackled with smart infrastructure developments such as connected cars electric vehicles smart power grids energy efficient buildings Internet of Things IoT networks and open data portals Governments are facing strong pressure to build and upgrade infrastructure particularly in urban centers where expanding populations are putting increasing pressure on aging facilities Many emerging countries need new infrastructure to support their growing populations and increased economic activity while mature markets must renew deteriorating or inefficient infrastructure However the years of underinvestment in infrastructure is now catching up with countries around the world Estimates show that nearly US 100 trillion globally needs to be spent on infrastructure in the next 20 years Smart infrastructure offers a way to harness the latest technologies to obtain maximum value and efficiency and create resilience and sustainability It applies digital technology such as smart devices sensors and software to physical structures from power plants to bridges These intelligent devices enable more efficient and effective monitoring and control of energy and water systems transportation networks human services and public safety operations all core government functions Governments must also pursue policies to encourage a thriving digital economy This involves working with private businesses to provide enhanced 4G and forthcoming 5G networks and data centers create high digital literacy among citizens promote digital inclusion and enable secure access to services through digital identification systems The public sector cannot fund every infrastructure project itself it must find innovative ways of working with other investors The Indian city of Nagpur is expanding rapidly and unplanned urbanization has resulted in slums pollution poor waste management and inadequate public transport Drawing inspiration from the Indian government s Smart City Mission the state of Maharashtra developed a charter for transforming urban centers using technology The first city selected for this transformation was Nagpur Nagpur Municipal Corporation NMC the body responsible for the administration and development of the city wanted to harness the power of technology including digital networks smart sensors advanced analytics and IT solutions to build a better living and working environment for all its citizens The EY team prepared a smart city vision and integration plan Citizens input and ideas were vital and were used to help prioritize the delivery of smart services to tackle key areas of concern such as safety cleanliness and access to the internet The program has been successful and the benefits for citizens are

have not gained many benefits from the datasets Along with an increase in unstructured data there has also been a rise in the number of data formats Administrative data such as notes and articles as the primary data type have expanded to include images audio video and sensors Many organizations fail to consider how quickly a big data project scales Constantly pausing a project to add additional resources cuts into time for data analysis Assessing what data exists and its integrity completeness accuracy bias and trust prolong the analysis effort This challenge is further compounded by

on networked artificial intelligence AI in complex digital systems Some say we will continue on the historic arc of augmenting our lives with mostly positive results as we widely implement these networked tools Some say our increasing dependence on these AI and related systems is likely to lead to widespread difficulties Our question By 2030 do you think it is most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will enhance human capacities and empower them That is most of the time will most people be better off than they are today Or is it most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will lessen human autonomy and agency to such an extent that most people will not be better off than the way things are today Please explain why you chose the answer you did and sketch out a vision of how the human machine AI collaboration will function in 2030 Please consider giving an example of how a typical human machine interaction will look and feel in a specific area for instance in the workplace in family life in a health care setting or in a learning environment Why What is your hope or fear What actions might be taken to assure the best future In answer to Question One Among the key themes emerging in our December 10 2018 report from 979 respondents overall answers were CONCERNS Human Agency Decision making on key aspects of digital life is automatically ceded to code driven black box tools People lack input and do not learn the context about how the tools work They sacrifice independence privacy and power over choice they have no control over these processes This effect will deepen as automated systems become more prevalent and complex Data Abuse Most AI tools are and will be in the hands of companies striving for profits or governments striving for power Values and ethics are often not baked into the digital systems making people s decisions for them These systems are globally networked and not easy to regulate or rein in Job Loss The efficiencies and other economic advantages of code based machine intelligence will continue to disrupt all aspects of human work While some expect new jobs will emerge others worry about massive job losses widening economic divides and social upheavals including populist uprisings Dependence Lock in Many see AI as augmenting human capacities but some predict the opposite that people s deepening dependence on machine driven networks will erode their abilities to think for themselves take action independent of automated systems and interact effectively with others Mayhem Some predict further erosion of traditional sociopolitical structures and the possibility of great loss of lives due to accelerated growth of autonomous military applications and the use of weaponized information lies and propaganda to dangerously destabilize human groups Some also fear cybercriminals reach into economic systems POTENTIAL REMEDIES Global Good is 1 It is vital to improve human collaboration across borders and stakeholder groups Digital cooperation to serve humanity s best interests is the top priority Ways must be found for people around the world to come to common understandings and agreements to join forces to facilitate the innovation of widely accepted approaches aimed at tackling wicked problems and maintaining control over complex human digital networks Values Based Systems Develop policies to assure AI will be directed at the common good Adopt a moonshot mentality to build inclusive decentralized intelligent digital networks imbued with empathy that help humans aggressively ensure that technology meets social and ethical responsibilities Some new level of regulatory and certification process will be necessary Prioritize People Alter economic and political systems to better help humans race with the machines Direct energies to radical human improvement Reorganize economic and political systems toward the goal of expanding humans capacities and capabilities in order to heighten human AI collaboration and staunch trends that would compromise human relevance in the face of programmed intelligence BENEFITS of AI 2030 New Life and Work Efficiencies AI will be integrated into most aspects of like producing new efficiencies and enhancing human capacities It can optimize and augment people s life experiences including the work lives of those who choose to work Health Care Improvements AI can revolutionize medical and wellness services reduce errors and recognize life saving patterns opening up a world of opportunity and options in

to more than half of the world s inhabitants in ambient information and connectivity offering previously unimagined opportunities and unprecedented threats As emerging algorithm driven artificial intelligence AI continues to spread will people be better off than they are today Some 979 technology pioneers innovators developers business and policy leaders researchers and activists answered this question in a canvassing of experts conducted in the summer of 2018 The experts predicted networked artificial intelligence will amplify human effectiveness but also threaten human autonomy agency and capabilities They spoke of the wide ranging possibilities that computers might match or even exceed human intelligence and capabilities on tasks such as complex decision making reasoning and learning sophisticated analytics and pattern recognition visual acuity speech recognition and language translation They said smart systems in communities in vehicles in buildings and utilities on farms and in business processes will save time money and lives and offer opportunities for individuals to enjoy a more customized future Many focused their optimistic remarks on health care and the many possible applications of AI in diagnosing and treating patients or helping senior citizens live fuller and healthier lives They were also enthusiastic about AI s role in contributing to broad public health programs built around massive amounts of data that may be captured in the coming years about everything from personal genomes to nutrition Additionally a number of these experts predicted that AI would abet long anticipated changes in formal and informal education systems Yet most experts regardless of whether they are optimistic or not expressed concerns about the long term impact of these new tools on the essential elements of being human All respondents in this non scientific canvassing were asked to elaborate on why they felt AI would leave people better off or not Many shared deep concerns and many also suggested pathways toward solutions The main themes they sounded about threats and remedies are outlined in the accompanying table Specifically participants were asked to consider the following Please think forward to the year 2030 Analysts expect that people will become even more dependent on networked artificial intelligence AI in complex digital systems Some say we will continue on the historic arc of augmenting our lives with mostly positive results as we widely implement these networked tools Some say our increasing dependence on these AI and related systems is likely to lead to widespread difficulties Our question By 2030 do you think it is most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will enhance human capacities and empower them That is most of the time will most people be better off than they are today Or is it most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will lessen human autonomy and agency to such an extent that most people will not be better off than the way things are today Overall and despite the downsides they fear 63 of respondents in this canvassing said they are hopeful that most individuals will be mostly better off in 2030 and 37 said people will not be better off A number of the thought leaders who participated in this canvassing said humans expanding reliance on technological systems will only go well if close attention is paid to how these tools platforms and networks are engineered distributed and updated Following are some of the most powerful overarching answers Sonia Katyal co director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology and a member of the inaugural U S Commerce Department Digital Economy Board of Advisors predicted In 2030 the greatest set of questions will involve how perceptions of AI and their application will influence the trajectory of civil rights in the future Questions about privacy speech the right of assembly and technological construction of personhood will all re emerge in this new AI context throwing into question our deepest held beliefs about equality and opportunity for all Who will benefit and who will be disadvantaged in this new world depends on how broadly we analyze these questions today for the future Erik Brynjolfsson director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy and author of Machine Platform Crowd Harnessing Our Digital Future said AI and related technologies have already achieved superhuman performance in many areas and there is little doubt that their capabilities will improve probably very significantly by 2030 I think it is more likely than not that we will use this power to make the world a better place For instance we can virtually eliminate global poverty massively reduce disease and provide better education to almost everyone on the planet That said AI and ML machine learning can also be used to increasingly concentrate wealth and power leaving many people behind and to create even more horrifying weapons Neither outcome is inevitable so the right question is not What will happen but What will we choose to do We need to work aggressively to make sure technology matches our values This can and must be done at all levels from government to business to academia and to individual choices Bryan Johnson founder and CEO of Kernel a leading developer of advanced neural interfaces and OS Fund a venture capital firm said I strongly believe the answer depends on whether we can shift our economic systems toward prioritizing radical human improvement and staunching the trend toward human irrelevance in the face of AI I don t mean just jobs I mean true existential irrelevance which is the end result of not prioritizing human well being and cognition Marina Gorbis executive director of the Institute for the Future said Without significant changes in our political economy and data governance regimes AI is likely to create greater economic inequalities more surveillance and more programmed and non human centric interactions Every time we program our environments we end up programming ourselves and our interactions Humans have to become more standardized removing serendipity and ambiguity from our interactions And this ambiguity and complexity is what is the essence of being human Judith Donath author of The Social Machine Designs for Living Online and faculty fellow at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society commented By 2030 most social situations will be facilitated by bots intelligent seeming programs that interact with us in human like ways At home parents will engage skilled bots to help kids with homework and catalyze dinner conversations At work bots will run meetings A bot confidant will be considered essential for psychological well being and we ll increasingly turn to such companions for advice ranging from what to wear to whom to marry We humans care deeply about how others see us and the others whose approval we seek will increasingly be artificial By then the difference between humans and bots will have blurred considerably Via screen and projection the voice appearance and behaviors of bots will be indistinguishable from those of humans and even physical robots though obviously non human will be so convincingly sincere that our impression of them as thinking feeling beings on par with or superior to ourselves will be unshaken Adding to the ambiguity our own communication will be heavily augmented Programs will compose many of our messages and our online AR appearance will be computationally crafted Raw unaided human speech and demeanor will seem embarrassingly clunky slow and unsophisticated Aided by their access to vast troves of data about each of us bots will far surpass humans in their ability to attract and persuade us Able to mimic emotion expertly they ll never be overcome by feelings If they blurt something out in anger it will be because that behavior was calculated to be the most efficacious way of advancing whatever goals they had in mind But what are those goals Artificially intelligent companions will cultivate the impression that social goals similar to our own motivate them to be held in good regard whether as a beloved friend an admired boss etc But their real collaboration will be with the humans and institutions that control them Like their forebears today these will be sellers of goods who employ them to stimulate consumption and politicians who commission them to sway opinions Andrew McLaughlin executive director of the Center for Innovative Thinking at Yale University previously deputy chief technology officer of the United States for President Barack Obama and global public policy lead for Google wrote 2030 is not far in the future My sense is that innovations like the internet and networked AI have massive short term benefits along with long term negatives that can take decades to be recognizable AI will drive a vast range of efficiency optimizations but also enable hidden discrimination and arbitrary penalization of individuals in areas like insurance job seeking and performance assessment Michael M Roberts first president and CEO of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN and Internet Hall of Fame member wrote The range of opportunities for intelligent agents to augment human intelligence is still virtually unlimited The major issue is that the more convenient an agent is the more it needs to know about you preferences timing capacities etc which creates a tradeoff of more help requires more intrusion This is not a black and white issue the shades of gray and associated remedies will be argued endlessly The record to date is that convenience overwhelms privacy I suspect that will continue danah boyd a principal researcher for Microsoft and founder and president of the Data Society Research Institute said AI is a tool that will be used by humans for all sorts of purposes including in the pursuit of power There will be abuses of power that involve AI just as there will be advances in science and humanitarian efforts that also involve AI Unfortunately there are certain trend lines that are likely to create massive instability Take for example climate change and climate migration This will further destabilize Europe and the U S and I expect that in panic we will see AI be used in harmful ways in light of other geopolitical crises Amy Webb founder of the Future Today Institute and professor of strategic foresight at New York University commented The social safety net structures currently in place in the U S and in many other countries around the world weren t designed for our transition to AI The transition through AI will last the next 50 years or more As we move farther into this third era of computing and as every single industry becomes more deeply entrenched with AI systems we will need new hybrid skilled knowledge workers who can operate in jobs that have never needed to exist before We ll need farmers who know how to work with big data sets Oncologists trained as robotocists Biologists trained as electrical engineers We won t need to prepare our workforce just once with a few changes to the curriculum As AI matures we will need a responsive workforce capable of adapting to new processes systems and tools every few years The need for these fields will arise faster than our labor departments schools and universities are acknowledging It s easy to look back on history through the lens of present and to overlook the social unrest caused by widespread technological unemployment We need to address a difficult truth that few are willing to utter aloud AI will eventually cause a large number of people to be permanently out of work Just as generations before witnessed sweeping changes during and in the aftermath of the Industrial Revolution the rapid pace of technology will likely mean that Baby Boomers and the oldest members of Gen X especially those whose jobs can be replicated by robots won t be able to retrain for other kinds of work without a significant investment of time and effort Barry Chudakov founder and principal of Sertain Research commented By 2030 the human machine AI collaboration will be a necessary tool to manage and counter the effects of multiple simultaneous accelerations broad technology advancement globalization climate change and attendant global migrations In the past human societies managed change through gut and intuition but as Eric Teller CEO of Google X has said Our societal structures are failing to keep pace with the rate of change To keep pace with that change and to manage a growing list of wicked problems by 2030 AI or using Joi Ito s phrase extended intelligence will value and revalue virtually every area of human behavior and interaction AI and advancing technologies will change our response framework and time frames which in turn changes our sense of time Where once social interaction happened in places work school church family environments social interactions will increasingly happen in continuous simultaneous time If we are fortunate we will follow the 23 Asilomar AI Principles outlined by the Future of Life Institute and will work toward not undirected intelligence but beneficial intelligence Akin to nuclear deterrence stemming from mutually assured destruction AI and related technology systems constitute a force for a moral renaissance We must embrace that moral renaissance or we will face moral conundrums that could bring about human demise My greatest hope for human machine AI collaboration constitutes a moral and ethical renaissance we adopt a moonshot mentality and lock arms to prepare for the accelerations coming at us My greatest fear is that we adopt the logic of our emerging technologies instant response isolation behind screens endless comparison of self worth fake self presentation without thinking or responding smartly John C Havens executive director of the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems and the Council on Extended Intelligence wrote Now in 2018 a majority of people around the world can t access their data so any human AI augmentation discussions ignore the critical context of who actually controls people s information and identity Soon it will be extremely difficult to identify any autonomous or intelligent systems whose algorithms don t interact with human data in one form or another Batya Friedman a human computer interaction professor at the University of Washington s Information School wrote Our scientific and technological capacities have and will continue to far surpass our moral ones that is our ability to use wisely and humanely the knowledge and tools that we develop Automated warfare when autonomous weapons kill human beings without human engagement can lead to a lack of responsibility for taking the enemy s life or even knowledge that an enemy s life has been taken At stake is nothing less than what sort of society we want to live in and how we experience our humanity Greg Shannon chief scientist for the CERT Division at Carnegie Mellon University said Better worse will appear 4 1 with the long term ratio 2 1 AI will do well for repetitive work where close will be good enough and humans dislike the work Life will definitely be better as AI extends lifetimes from health apps that intelligently nudge us to health to warnings about impending heart stroke events to automated health care for the underserved remote and those who need extended care elder care As to liberty there are clear risks AI affects agency by creating entities with meaningful intellectual capabilities for monitoring enforcing and even punishing individuals Those who know how to use it will have immense potential power over those who don t can t Future happiness is really unclear Some will cede their agency to AI in games work and community much like the opioid crisis steals agency today On the other hand many will be freed from mundane unengaging tasks jobs If elements of community happiness are part of AI objective functions then AI could catalyze an explosion of happiness Kostas Alexandridis author of Exploring Complex Dynamics in Multi agent based Intelligent Systems predicted Many of our day to day decisions will be automated with minimal intervention by the end user Autonomy and or independence will be sacrificed and replaced by convenience Newer generations of citizens will become more and more dependent on networked AI structures and processes There are challenges that need to be addressed in terms of critical thinking and heterogeneity Networked interdependence will more likely than not increase our vulnerability to cyberattacks There is also a real likelihood that there will exist sharper divisions between digital haves and have nots as well as among technologically dependent digital infrastructures Finally there is the question of the new commanding heights of the digital network infrastructure s ownership and control Oscar Gandy emeritus professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania responded We already face an ungranted assumption when we are asked to imagine human machine collaboration Interaction is a bit different but still tainted by the grant of a form of identity maybe even personhood to machines that we will use to make our way through all sorts of opportunities and challenges The problems we will face in the future are quite similar to the problems we currently face when we rely upon others including technological systems devices and networks to acquire things we value and avoid those other things that we might or might not be aware of James Scofield O Rourke a professor of management at the University of Notre Dame said Technology has throughout recorded history been a largely neutral concept The question of its value has always been dependent on its application For what purpose will AI and other technological advances be used Everything from gunpowder to internal combustion engines to nuclear fission has been applied in both helpful and destructive ways Assuming we can contain or control AI and not the other way around the answer to whether we ll be better off depends entirely on us or our progeny The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings Simon Biggs a professor of interdisciplinary arts at the University of Edinburgh said AI will function to augment human capabilities The problem is not with AI but with humans As a species we are aggressive competitive and lazy We are also empathic community minded and sometimes self sacrificing We have many other attributes These will all be amplified Given historical precedent one would have to assume it will be our worst qualities that are augmented My expectation is that in 2030 AI will be in routine use to fight wars and kill people far more effectively than we can currently kill As societies we will be less affected by this as we currently are as we will not be doing the fighting and killing ourselves Our capacity to modify our behaviour subject to empathy and an associated ethical framework will be reduced by the disassociation between our agency and the act of killing We cannot expect our AI systems to be ethical on our behalf they won t be as they will be designed to kill efficiently not thoughtfully My other primary concern is to do with surveillance and control The advent of China s Social Credit System SCS is an indicator of what it likely to come We will exist within an SCS as AI constructs hybrid instances of ourselves that may or may not resemble who we are But our rights and affordances as individuals will be determined by the SCS This is the Orwellian nightmare realised Mark Surman executive director of the Mozilla Foundation responded AI will continue to concentrate power and wealth in the hands of a few big monopolies based on the U S and China Most people and parts of the world will be worse off William Uricchio media scholar and professor of comparative media studies at MIT commented AI and its related applications face three problems development at the speed of Moore s Law development in the hands of a technological and economic elite and development without benefit of an informed or engaged public The public is reduced to a collective of consumers awaiting the next technology Whose notion of progress will prevail We have ample evidence of AI being used to drive profits regardless of implications for long held values to enhance governmental control and even score citizens social credit without input from citizens themselves Like technologies before it AI is agnostic Its deployment rests in the hands of society But absent an AI literate public the decision of how best to deploy AI will fall to special interests Will this mean equitable deployment the amelioration of social injustice and AI in the public service Because the answer to this question is social rather than technological I m pessimistic The fix We need to develop an AI literate public which means focused attention in the educational sector and in public facing media We need to assure diversity in the development of AI technologies And until the public its elected representatives and their legal and regulatory regimes can get up to speed with these fast moving developments we need to exercise caution and oversight in AI s development The remainder of this report is divided into three sections that draw from hundreds of additional respondents hopeful and critical observations 1 Concerns about human AI evolution 2 Suggested solutions to address AI s impact 3 Expectations of what life will be like in 2030 including respondents positive outlooks on the quality of life and the future of work health care and education Some responses are lightly edited for style A clear majority of the responses from these experts contained material outlining certain challenges fears or concerns about the AI infused future The five most often mentioned concerns were 1 the use of AI reduces individuals control over their lives 2 surveillance and data systems designed primarily for efficiency profit and control are inherently dangerous 3 displacement of human jobs by AI will widen economic and digital divides possibly leading to social upheaval 4 individuals cognitive social and survival skills will be diminished as they become dependent on AI and 5 citizens will face increased vulnerabilities such as exposure to cybercrime and cyberwarfare that spin out of control and the possibility that essential organizations are endangered by weaponized information A few also worried about the wholesale destruction of humanity The sections of this chapter will cover experts answers tied to these themes Autonomous systems can reduce or eliminate the need for human involvement in some tasks Today s ever advancing artificial narrow intelligence ANI tools for instance search engines and digital agents such as Siri Alexa and Cortana are not close to reaching the goal of human like artificial general intelligence AGI They are however continually becoming more powerful thanks to developments in machine learning and natural language processing and advances in materials science networking energy storage and hardware capabilities ANI is machine intelligence that equals or exceeds people s abilities or efficiency at a specific task For years code based tools in robots and other systems have performed repetitive tasks like factory floor assembly activities Today these tools are quickly evolving to master human traits such as reason logic learning task performance and creativity Today s smart networked software equipped devices cars digital assistants and platforms such as Google search and Facebook social mapping accomplish extremely complex tasks The systems underpinning today s global financial markets businesses militaries police forces and medical energy and industrial operations are all dependent upon networked AI of one type or another What is the future of humans in an age of accelerating technological change Many experts in this canvassing said that as AI advances human autonomy and agency are at risk They note that decision making on key aspects of life is ceded to code driven tools Individuals who function in this digital world sacrifice to varying degrees their independence right to privacy and power over choice Many of the experts who worry about this say humans accede to this in order to stay competitive to participate socially and professionally in the world to be entertained and to get things done They say people hand over some control of their lives because of the perceived advantages they gain via digital tools efficiency convenience and superior pattern recognition data storage and search and find capabilities Here is a selection of responses from these experts that touch on this An anonymous respondent summed up the concerns of many writing The most feared reversal in human fortune of the AI age is loss of agency The trade off for the near instant low friction convenience of digital life is the loss of context about and control over its processes People s blind dependence on digital tools is deepening as automated systems become more complex and ownership of those systems is by the elite Baratunde Thurston futurist former director of digital at The Onion and co founder of comedy technology start up Cultivated Wit said For the record this is not the future I want but it is what I expect given existing default settings in our economic and sociopolitical system preferences The problems to which we are applying machine learning and AI are generally not ones that will lead to a better life for most people That s why I say in 2030 most people won t be better due to AI We won t be more autonomous we will be more automated as we follow the metaphorical GPS line through daily interactions We don t choose our breakfast or our morning workouts or our route to work An algorithm will make these choices for us in a way that maximizes efficiency narrowly defined and probably also maximizes the profitability of the service provider By 2030 we may cram more activities and interactions into our days but I don t think that will make our lives better A better life by my definition is one in which we feel more valued and happy Given that the biggest investments in AI are on behalf of marketing efforts designed to deplete our attention and bank balances I can only imagine this leading to days that are more filled but lives that are less fulfilled To create a different future I believe we must unleash these technologies toward goals beyond profit maximization Imagine a mapping app that plotted your work commute through the most beautiful route not simply the fastest Imagine a communications app that facilitated deeper connections with people you deemed most important These technologies must be more people centric We need to ask that they ask us What is important to you How would you like to spend your time But that s not the system we re building All those decisions have been hoarded by the unimaginative pursuit of profit Thad Hall a researcher and coauthor of Politics for a Connected American Public added AI is likely to have benefits from improving medical diagnoses to improving people s consumer experiences However there are four aspects of AI that are very problematic 1 It is likely to result in more economic uncertainty and dislocation for people including employment issues and more need to change jobs to stay relevant 2 AI will continue to erode people s privacy as search becomes more thorough China s monitoring of populations illustrates what this could look like in authoritarian and Western countries with greater facial recognition used to identify people and affect their privacy 3 AI will likely continue to have biases that are negative toward minority populations including groups we have not considered Given that algorithms often have identifiable biases e g favoring people who are white or male they likely also have biases that are less well recognized such as biases that are negative toward people with disabilities older people or other groups These biases may ripple through society in unknown ways Some groups are more likely to be monitored effectively 4 AI is creating a world where reality can be manipulated in ways we do not appreciate Fake videos audio and similar media are likely to explode and create a world where reality is hard to discern The relativistic political world will become more so with people having evidence to support their own reality or multiple realities that mean no one knows what is the truth Thomas Schneider head of International Relations Service and vice director at the Federal Office of Communications OFCOM in Switzerland said AI will help mankind to be more efficient live safer and healthier and manage resources like energy transport etc more efficiently At the same time there are a number of risks that AI may be used by those in power to manipulate control and dominate others We have seen this with every new technology It can and will be used for good and bad Much will depend about how AI will be governed If we have an inclusive and bottom up governance system of well informed citizens then AI will be used for improving our quality of life If only a few people decide about how AI is used and what for many others will be dependent on the decisions of these few and risk being manipulated by them The biggest danger in my view is that there will be a greater pressure on all members of our societies to live according to what the system will tell us is best for us to do and not to do i e that we may lose the autonomy to decide ourselves how we want to live our lives to choose diverse ways of doing things With more and more recommendations rankings and competition through social pressure and control we may risk a loss of individual fundamental freedoms including but not limited to the right to a private life that we have fought for in the last decades and centuries Bart Knijnenburg assistant professor of computer science who is active in the Human Factors Institute at Clemson University said Whether AI will make our lives better depends on how it is implemented Many current AI systems including adaptive content presentation systems and so called recommender systems try to avoid information and choice overload by replacing our decision making processes with algorithmic predictions True empowerment will come from these systems supporting rather than replacing our decision making practices This is the only way we can overcome choice information overload and at the same time avoid so called filter bubbles For example Facebook s current post ranking systems will eventually turn us all into cat video watching zombies because they follow our behavioral patterns which may not be aligned with our preferences The algorithms behind these tools need to support human agency not replace it Peter Reiner professor and co founder of the National Core for Neuroethics at the University of British Columbia commented I am confident that in 2030 both arms of this query will be true AI driven algorithms will substantially enhance our abilities as humans and human autonomy and agency will be diminished Whether people will be better off than they are today is a separate question and the answer depends to a substantial degree on how looming technological developments unfold On the one hand if corporate entities retain unbridled control over how AI driven algorithms interact with humans people will be less well off as the loss of autonomy and agency will be largely to the benefit of the corporations On the other hand if we the people demand that corporate entities deploy AI algorithms in a manner that is sensitive to the issues of human autonomy and agency then there is a real possibility for us to be better off enhanced by the power of the AI driven algorithm and yet not relegated to an impoverished seat at the decision making table One could even parse this further anticipating that certain decisions can be comfortably left in the hands of the AI driven algorithm with other decisions either falling back on humans or arrived at through a combination of AI driven algorithmic input and human decision making If we approach these issues skillfully and it will take quite a bit of collaborative work between ethicists and industry we can have the best of both worlds On the other hand if we are lax in acting as watchdogs over industry we will be functionally rich and decisionally poor Paul Vixie an Internet Hall of Fame member known for designing and implementing several Domain Name System protocol extensions and applications wrote Understanding is a perfect proxy for control As we make more of the world s economy non understandable by the masses we make it easier for powerful interests to practice control Real autonomy or privacy or unpredictability will be seen as a threat and managed around Jo o Pedro Taveira embedded systems researcher and smart grids architect for INOV INESC Inova o in Portugal wrote Basically we will lose several degrees of freedom Are we ready for that When we wake up to what is happening it might be too late to do anything about it Artificial intelligence is a subject that must be studied philosophically in open minded abstract and hypothetical ways Using this perspective the issues to be solved by humans are but not limited to AI feelings values motivation free will solidarity love and hate Yes we will have serious problems Dropping the artificial off AI look at the concept of intelligence As a computer science person I know that so called AI studies how an agent a software program increases its knowledge base using rules that are defined using pattern recognition mechanisms No matter which mechanisms are used to generate this rule set the result will be always behavioral profiling Right now everybody uses and agrees to use a wide set of appliances services and products without a full understanding of the information that is being shared with enterprises companies and other parties There s a lack of needed regulation and audit mechanisms on who or what uses our information and how it is used and whether it is stored for future use Governments and others will try to access this information using these tools by decree arguing national security or administration efficiency improvements Enterprises and companies might argue that these tools offer improvement of quality of service but there s no guarantee about individuals privacy anonymity individual security intractability and so on Ramon Lopez de Mantaras director of the Spanish National Research Council s Artificial Intelligence Research Institute said I do not think it is a good idea to give high levels of autonomy to AI systems They are and will be weak AI systems without commonsense knowledge They will have more and more competence yes but this will be competence without comprehension AI machines should remain at the level of tools or at most assistants always keeping the human in the loop We should all read or re read the book Computer Power and Human Reason by Joseph Weizenbaum before deciding whether or not to give lots of autonomy to stupid machines Oscar Gandy emeritus professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania responded AI systems will make quite substantial and important contributions to the ability of health care providers to generate accurate diagnoses of maladies and threats to my well being now and in the future I can imagine the development and deployment of systems in which my well being is the primary basis of our relationship I am less sure about how my access to and use of this resource may be constrained or distorted by the interests of the other actors humans within profit power seeking orientations I assume that they will be aided by their own AI systems informing them how to best present options to me I am hopeful that we will have agents whether private social governmental whose interest and responsibility is in ensuring that my interests govern those relationships Robert Epstein senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology and the founding director of the Loebner Prize a competition in artificial intelligence said By 2030 it is likely that AIs will have achieved a type of sentience even if it is not human like They will also be able to exercise varying degrees of control over most human communications financial transactions transportation systems power grids and weapon systems As I noted in my 2008 book Parsing the Turing Test they will reside in the InterNest we have been building for them and we will have no way of dislodging them How they decide to deal with humanity to help us ignore us or destroy us will be entirely up to them and there is no way currently to predict which avenue they will choose Because a few paranoid humans will almost certainly try to destroy the new sentient AIs there is at least a reasonable possibility that that they will swat us like the flies we are the possibility that Stephen Hawking Elon Musk and others have warned about There is no way to my knowledge of stopping this future from emerging Driven by the convenience of connectivity the greed that underlies business expansion and the pipedreams of muddle headed people who confuse machine like intelligence with biological intelligence we will continue to build AIs we can barely understand and to expand the InterNest in which they will live until the inevitable whatever that proves to be occurs An attorney specializing in policy issues for a global digital rights organization commented I m not sure even today whether the tech advances of the last 12 years have been net positive over the global population We ve seen a widening gap between the very rich and everybody else That is likely bad for democracy AI seems likely to make the employment training problem worse in the U S and AI may have similar effects in countries that currently provide cheap labor On the political governmental side AI will exacerbate current surveillance and accountability problems I figure that AI will improve and speed up all biometric pattern recognition as well as DNA analysis and natural language processing And though we know that much of this is biased we re not adequately counteracting the bias we know about The companies who generate and disseminate AI technology have every incentive to continue I m not optimistic that collective action at least in the U S system will successfully counter those incentives Brian Behlendorf executive director of the Hyperledger project at The Linux Foundation and expert in blockchain technology wrote I am concerned that AI will not be a democratizing power but will enhance further the power and wealth of those who already hold it This is because more data means better AI and data is expensive to acquire especially personal data the most valuable kind This is in contrast to networking technologies whose benefits were shared fairly widely as the prices for components came down equally fast for everyone One other reason AI apps will be harder to debug than ordinary apps and we already see hard to debug applications leading to disenfranchisement and deterioration of living So I do not take as a given that AI will enrich most people s lives over the next 12 years Eileen Donahoe executive director of the Global Digital Policy Incubator at Stanford University commented While I do believe human machines collaboration will bring many benefits to society over time I fear that we will not have made enough progress by 2030 to ensure that benefits will be spread evenly or to protect against downside risks especially as they relate to bias discrimination and loss of accountability by that time David Bray executive director of People Centered Internet commented Hope Human machine AI collaborations extend our abilities of humans while we humans intentionally strive to preserve values of respect dignity and agency of choice for individuals Machines bring together different groups of people and communities and help us work and live together by reflecting on our own biases and helping us come to understand the plurality of different perspectives of others Big concern Human machine AI collaborations turn out to not benefit everyone only a few and result in a form of indentured servitude or neo feudalism that is not people centered and not uplifting of people Machines amplify existing confirmation biases and other human characteristics resulting in sensationalist emotion ridden news and other communications that gets page views and ad clicks yet lack nuance of understanding resulting in tribalism and a devolution of open societies and pluralities to the detriment of the global human condition Bernie Hogan senior research fellow at Oxford Internet Institute wrote The current political and economic climate suggests that existing technology especially machine learning will be used to create better decisions for those in power while creating an ever more tedious morass of bureaucracy for the rest We see little example of successful bottom up technology open source technology and hacktivism relative to the encroaching surveillance state and attention economy Dan Buehrer a retired professor of computer science formerly with the National Chung Cheng University in Taiwan warned Statistics will be replaced by individualized models thus allowing control of all individuals by totalitarian states and eventually by socially intelligent machines Nathalie Marechal doctoral candidate at the University of Southern California s Annenberg School for Communication who researches the intersection of internet policy and human rights said Absent rapid and decisive actions to rein in both government overreach and companies amoral quest for profit technological developments including AI will bring about the infrastructure for total social control threatening democracy and the right to individual self determination Katja Grace contributor to the AI Impacts research project and a research associate with the Machine Intelligence Research Institute said There is a substantial chance that AI will leave everyone worse off perhaps radically so The chance is less than 50 percent but the downside risk is so large that there could be an expectation the world might be worse for AI David A Banks an associate research analyst with the Social Science Research Council said AI will be very useful to a small professional class but will be used to monitor and control everyone else Luis German Rodriguez Leal teacher and researcher at the Universidad Central de Venezuela and consultant on technology for development said Humankind is not addressing properly the issue of educating people about possibilities and risks of human machine AI collaboration One can observe today the growing problems of ill intentioned manipulation of information and technological resources There are already plenty of examples about how decision making is biased using big data machine learning privacy violations and social networks just to mention a few elements and one can see that the common citizen is unaware of how much of his her will does not belong to him her This fact has a meaningful impact on our social political economic and private life We are not doing enough to attend to this issue and it is getting very late Llewellyn Kriel CEO of TopEditor International a media services company based in Johannesburg South Africa wrote Current developments do not augur well for the fair growth of AI Vast swaths of the population simply do not have the intellectual capacity or level of sophistication to understand 1 the technology itself and 2 the implications of its safe use This entrenches and widens the digital divide in places like Africa The socio political implications of this breed deep primitive superstition racial hatred toward whites and Asians who are seen as techno colonialists and the growth of kleptocracies amid the current mushrooming of corruption Steven Thompson an author specializing in illuminating emerging issues and editor of Androids Cyborgs and Robots in Contemporary Culture and Society wrote The keyword from the query is dependence I published pioneering quantitative research on internet addiction and dependency in 1996 and followed up 15 years later with a related updated research talk on the future of AI and internet dependency at a UNESCO sponsored conference on information literacy in Morocco My expertise is in ethical and technological issues related to moving the internet appliance into the human body The internet is moving into the human body and in that process societal statuses are altered privileging some while abandoning others in the name of emerging technologies and the global order is restructuring to the same effect Think of net neutrality issues gone wild corporately and humanly sustained with the privileges such creation and maintenance affords some members of society Now think of the liberty issues arising from those persons who are digital outcasts and wish to not be on the grid yet will be forced to do so by society and even government edicts Alan Mutter a longtime Silicon Valley CEO cable TV executive and now a teacher of media economics and entrepreneurism at the University of California Berkeley said The danger is that we will surrender thinking exploring and experimentation to tools that hew to the rules but can t color outside the lines Would you like computers to select the president or decide if you need hip surgery Dan Geer a respondent who provided no identifying details commented If you believe as do I that having a purpose to one s life is all that enables both pride and happiness then the question becomes whether AI will or will not diminish purpose For the irreligious AI will demolish purpose yet if AI is truly intelligent then AI will make serving it the masses purpose Ergo Cristobal Young an associate professor of sociology at Cornell University specializing in economic sociology and stratification commented I mostly base my response that tech will not leave most people better off than they are today on Twitter and other online media which were initially praised as liberation technology It is clear that the internet has devastated professional journalism filled the public sphere with trash that no one believes and degraded civil discourse This isn t about robots but rather about how humans use the internet Donald Trump himself says that without Twitter he could never have been elected and Twitter continues to be his platform for polarization insult and attacks on the institutions of accountability David J Krieger co director of the Institute for Communication Leadership in Lucerne Switzerland wrote The affordances of digital technologies bind people into information networks such that the network becomes the actor and intelligence as well as agency are qualities of the network as a whole and not any individual actors whether human or non human Networks will have access to much more information than do any present day actors and therefore be able to navigate complex environments e g self driving cars personal assistants smart cities Typically we will consult and cooperate with networks in all areas but the price will be that we have no such thing as privacy Privacy is indeed dead but in the place of personal privacy management there will be network publicy governance publicy is the opposite of privacy To ensure the use of these technologies for good instead of evil it will be necessary to dismantle and replace current divides between government and governed workers and capitalists as well as to establish a working global governance Wendy M Grossman author of net wars and technology blogger wrote 2030 is 12 years from now I believe human machine AI collaboration will be successful in many areas but that we will be seeing like we are now over Facebook and other social media serious questions about ownership and who benefits It seems likely that the limits of what machines can do will be somewhat clearer than they are now when we re awash in hype We will know by then for example how successful self driving cars are going to be and the problems inherent in handing off control from humans to machines in a variety of areas will also have become clearer The big fight is to keep people from relying on experimental systems and turning off the legacy ones too soon which is our current situation with the internet Karl M van Meter founding editor of the Bulletin of Sociological Methodology and author of Computational Social Science in the Age of Big Data said The well being of the world s population depends on governments making intelligent decisions based on AI or other means Moreover environmental change may well be the determining factor for future well being with or without intelligent decisions by world governments Andrew Whinston computer science professor and director of the Center for Research in Electronic Commerce at the University of Texas at Austin said There are several issues First security problems do not get the attention needed Secondly there may be use of the technology to control the population as we see developing in China AI methodology is focused on prediction at least so far so methods to improve health or general welfare are lacking Deep learning which is getting the big hype does not have a clear foundation That makes it scientifically weak An information administration manager responded We cede more and more decision making and policy making to self interested parties in the private sphere Our institutions are insufficiently nimble to keep up with the policy questions that arise and attempts to regulate new industries are subverted by corrupt money politics at both the federal and state levels An internet pioneer said Nothing in our current social economic or political structures points to a positive outcome There is no evidence that more AI will improve the lives of most people In fact the opposite is likely to be the case There will be more unemployment less privacy etc The following one liners from anonymous respondents also tie into human agency Other anonymous respondents commented Who decides what about people s code defined lives when where why and how Many of these respondents cited concerns that the future of AI will be shaped by those driven by profit motives and power thirst They note that many AI tools rely on individuals sharing of information preferences search strategies and data Human values and ethics are not necessarily baked into the systems making peoples decisions for them These experts worry that data based decision making can be prone to errors biases and false logic or mistaken assumptions And these experts argue that machine based decisions often favor efficiencies in the name of profit or power that are extremely unfavorable to individuals and the betterment of the human condition Michael Kleeman a senior fellow at the University of California San Diego and board member at the Institute for the Future wrote The utilization of AI will be disproportionate and biased toward those with more resources In general it will reduce autonomy and coupled with big data it will reduce privacy and increase social control There will be some areas where IA intelligence augmentation helps make things easier and safer but by and large it will be a global net negative A professor at a major U S university and expert in artificial intelligence as applied to social computing said As AI systems take in more data and make bigger decisions people will be increasingly subject to their unaccountable decisions and non auditable surveillance practices The trends around democratic governance of AI are not encouraging The big players are U S based and the U S is in an anti regulation stance that seems fairly durable Therefore I expect AI technologies to evolve in ways that benefit corporate interests with little possibility of meaningful public response Justin Reich executive director of MIT Teaching Systems Lab and research scientist in the MIT Office of Digital Learning responded Systems for human AI collaborations will be built by powerful affluent people to solve the problems of powerful affluent people In the hands of autocratic leaders AI will become a powerful tool of surveillance and control In capitalist economies human AI collaboration will be deployed to find new powerful ways of surveilling and controlling workers for the benefit of more affluent consumers Seth Finkelstein consulting programmer at Finkelstein Consulting and EFF Pioneer Award winner commented AI depends on algorithms and data Who gets to code the algorithms and to challenge the results Is the data owned as private property and who can change it As a very simple example let s take the topic of algorithmic recommendations for articles to read Do they get tuned to produce suggestions which lead to more informative material which granted is a relatively difficult task and fraught with delicate determinations Or are they optimized for ATTENTION CLICKS OUTRAGE To be sure the latter is cheap and easy and though it has its own share of political problems they re often more amenable to corporate management i e what s accurate vs what s unacceptable There s a whole structure of incentives that will push toward one outcome or the other Douglas Rushkoff professor of media at City University of New York responded The main reason I believe AI s impact will be mostly negative is that we will be applying it mostly toward the needs of the market rather than the needs of human beings So while AI might get increasingly good at extracting value from people or manipulating people s behavior toward more consumption and compliance much less attention will likely be given to how AI can actually create value for people Even the most beneficial AI is still being measured in terms of its ability to provide utility value or increase in efficiency fine values sure but not the only ones that matter to quality of life Annalie Killian futurist and vice president for strategic partnerships at Sparks Honey wrote More technology does not make us more human we have evidence for that now within 10 years of combining the smartphone device with persuasive and addictive designs that shape and hijack behavior Technologists who are using emotional analytics image modification technologies and other hacks of our senses are destroying the fragile fabric of trust and truth that is holding our society together at a rate much faster than we are adapting and compensating let alone comprehending what is happening The sophisticated tech is affordable and investible in the hands of very few people who are enriching themselves and growing their power exponentially and these actors are NOT acting in the best interest of all people Collin Baker senior AI researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California Berkeley commented I fear that advances in AI will be turned largely to the service of nation states and mega corporations rather than be used for truly constructive purposes The positive potential particularly in education and health care is enormous but people will have to fight to make it come about I hope that AI will get much better at understanding Gricean maxims for cooperative discourse and at understanding people s beliefs intentions and plans Brian Harvey lecturer on the social implications of computer technology at the University of California Berkeley said The question makes incorrect presuppositions encapsulated in the word we There is no we there are the owners and the workers The owners the 0 1 will be better off because of AI The workers bottom 95 will be worse off as long as there are owners to own the AI same as for any piece of technology One of the world s foremost social scientists studying human technology interactions said My chief fear is face recognition used for social control Even Microsoft has begged for government regulation Surveillance of all kinds is the future for AI It is not benign if not controlled Devin Fidler futurist and founder of Rethinkery Labs commented If earlier industrialization is any guide we may be moving into a period of intensified creative destruction as AI technologies become powerful enough to overturn the established institutions and the ordering systems of modern societies If the holes punched in macro scale organizational systems are not explicitly addressed and repaired there will be increased pressures on everyday people as they face not only the problems of navigating an unfamiliar new technology landscape themselves but also the systemic failure of institutions they rely on that have failed to adapt An anonymous respondent said My fear is that technology will further separate us from what makes us human and sensitive to others My hope is that technology would be used to improve the quality of living not supplant it Much of the AI innovation is simply clogging our senses stealing our time increasing the channels and invasion of adverts This has destroyed our phones filled our mailboxes and crowded our email No product is worth that level of incursion Paola Perez vice president of the Internet Society s Venezuela chapter and chair of the LACNIC Public Policy Forum responded Humans will be better with AI Many problems will be solved but many jobs are going to disappear and there may be more poor people as a result Will we see life extension Maybe and maybe not because our dependence on technology may also be destructive to our health Eliot Lear principal engineer at Cisco Systems predicted AI and tech will not leave most people better off than they are today As always technology outpaces our ability to understand its ramifications so as to properly govern its use I have no reason to believe that we will have caught up by 2030 Olivia Coombe a respondent who provided no identifying details wrote Children learn from their parents As AI systems become more complex and are given increasingly important roles in the functioning of day to day life we should ask ourselves what are we teaching our artificial digital children If we conceive and raise them in a world of individual self interest will they just strengthen these existing and often oppressive systems of capitalist competition Or could they go their own way aspiring to a life of entrepreneurship to collaboration Worse yet will they see the reverence we hold for empires and seek to build their own through conquest Peter Asaro a professor at The New School and philosopher of science technology and media who examines artificial intelligence and robotics commented AI will produce many advantages for many people but it will also exacerbate many forms of inequality in society It is likely to benefit a small group who design and control the technology greatly benefit a fairly larger group of the already well off in many ways but also potentially harm them in other ways and for the vast majority of people in the world it will offer few visible benefits and be perceived primarily as a tool of the wealthy and powerful to enhance their wealth and power Mark Deuze a professor of media studies at the University of Amsterdam wrote With the advances in AI and tech the public debate grows over their impact It is this debate that will contribute to the ethical and moral dimensions of AI hopefully inspiring a society wide discussion on what we want from tech and how we will take responsibility for that desire Rob Frieden professor and Pioneers Chair in Telecommunications and Law at Penn State University said Any intelligent system depends on the code written to support it If the code is flawed the end product reflects those flaws An old school acronym spells this out GIGO Garbage In Garbage Out I have little confidence that AI can incorporate any and every real world scenario even with likely developments in machine learning As AI expands in scope and reach defects will have ever increasing impacts largely on the negative side of the ledger Anthony Judge author futurist editor of the Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential and former head of the Union of International Associations said AI will offer greater possibilities My sense is that it will empower many most probably 1 to 30 and will disempower many if not 99 Especially problematic will be the level of complexity created for the less competent notably the elderly as is evident with taxation and banking systems issues to which sysadmins are indifferent For some it will be a boon proactive companions whether for quality dialogue or sex Sysadmins will build in unfortunate biases Missing will be the enabling of interdisciplinarity as has long been possible but carefully designed out for the most dubious divide and rule reasons Blinkered approaches and blind spots will set the scene for unexpected disasters currently deniably incomprehensible Black Swan effect Advantages for governance will be questionable Better oversight will be dubiously enabled Stephanie Perrin president of Digital Discretion a data privacy consulting firm wrote There is a likelihood that given the human tendency to identify risk when looking at the unknown future AI will be used to attempt to predict risk In other words more and deeper surveillance will be used to determine who is a good citizen purchaser employee student etc and who is bad This will find itself into public space surveillance systems employee vetting systems note the current court case where LinkedIn is suing data scrapers who offer to predict flight risk employees and all kinds of home management systems and intelligent cars While this might possibly introduce a measure of safety in some applications the impact of fear that comes with unconscious awareness of surveillance will have a severe impact on creativity and innovation We need that creativity as we address massive problems in climate change and reversing environmental impacts so I tend to be pessimistic about outcomes Alistair Knott an associate professor specializing in cognitive science and AI at the University of Otago in Dunedin New Zealand wrote AI has the potential for both positive and negative impacts on society Negative impacts are rooted in the current dominance of transnational companies and tech companies in particular in global politics These companies are likely to appropriate the majority of advances in AI technology and they are unlikely to spread the benefit of these advances throughout society We are currently witnessing an extraordinary concentration of wealth in the hands of a tiny proportion of the world s population This is largely due to the mainstreaming of neoliberalism in the world s dominant economies but it is intensified by the massive success of tech companies which achieve huge profits with relatively small workforces The advance of AI technologies is just going to continue this trend unless quite draconian political changes are effected that bring transnational companies under proper democratic control Richard Forno of the Center for Cybersecurity at the University of Maryland Baltimore County wrote AI is only as smart and efficient as its human creators can make it If AI in things like Facebook algorithms is causing this much trouble now what does the future hold The problem is less AI s evolution and more about how humankind develops and uses it that is where the real crisis in AI will turn out Sam Punnett research and strategy officer at TableRock Media wrote The preponderance of AI controlled systems are designed to take collected data and enable control advantage Most of the organizations with the resources to develop these systems do so to enable advantages in commercial financial transactions manufacturing efficiency and surveillance Self regulation by industry has already been shown to fail e g social media platforms and Wall Street Government agencies are lagging in their will and understanding of the implications of the technology to effectively implement guidelines to curtail the impacts of unforeseen circumstances As such government participation will be reactive to the changes that the technology will bring My greatest fear is a reliance on faulty algorithms that absolve responsibility while failing to account for exceptions Luis Pereira associate professor of electronics and nanotechnologies Universidade NOVA de Lisboa Portugal responded I fear that more control and influence will be exerted on people such as has started in China There will be a greater wealth gap benefits will not spread to all and a caste system will develop unless a new social compact is put in place which is unlikely Widespread revolt is plausible Stavros Tripakis an associate professor of computer science at Aalto University in Finland and adjunct professor at the University of California Berkeley wrote 1984 George Orwell police state A principal architect for a top five technology company commented AI will enable vicious regimes to track citizens at all times Mistaken identifications will put innocent people in jail and even execute them with no hope of appeal In general AI will only have a positive contribution in truly democratic states which are dwindling in number John Sniadowski a director for a technology company wrote As technology is currently instantiated it simply concentrates power into a smaller number of international corporations That needs fixing for everyone to gain the best from AI David Brake senior lecturer in communications at the University of Bedfordshire UK said Like many colleagues I fear that AI will be framed as neutral and objective and thereby used as cover to make decisions that would be considered unfair if made by a human If we do not act to properly regulate the use of AI we will not be able to interrogate the ways that AI decision making is constructed or audit them to ensure their decisions are indeed fair Decisions may also be made even more than today based on a vast array of collected data and if we are not careful we will be unable to control the flows of information about us used to make those decisions or to correct misunderstandings or errors which can follow us around indefinitely Imagine being subject to repeated document checks as you travel around the country because you know a number of people who are undocumented immigrants and your movements therefore fit the profile of an illegal immigrant And you are not sure whether to protest because you don t know whether such protests could encourage an algorithm to put you into a suspicious category which could get you harassed even more often A longtime veteran of a pioneering internet company commented Profit motive and AI at scale nearly guarantee suffering for most people It should be spiffy for the special people with wealth and power though Watching how machines are created to ensure addiction to deliver ads is a reminder that profit driven exploitation always comes first The push for driverless cars too is a push for increased profits Joshua Loftus assistant professor of information operations and management sciences at New York University and co author of Counterfactual Fairness in Machine Learning commented How have new technologies shaped our lives in the past It depends on the law market structure and who wields political power In the present era of extreme inequality and climate catastrophe I expect technologies to be used by employers to make individual workers more isolated and contingent by apps to make users more addicted on a second by second basis and by governments for surveillance and increasingly strict border control Eugene H Spafford internet pioneer and founder and executive director emeritus of the Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security commented Without active controls and limits the primary adopters of AI systems will be governments and large corporations Their use of it will be to dominate control people and this will not make our lives better Michael Muller a researcher in the AI interactions group for a global technology solutions provider said it will leave some people better off and others not writing For the wealthy and empowered AI will help them with their daily lives and it will probably help them to increase their wealth and power For the rest of us I anticipate that AI will help the wealthy and empowered people to surveil us to manipulate us and in some cases to control us or even imprison us For those of us who do not have the skills to jump to the AI related jobs I think we will find employment scarce and without protections In my view AI will be a mixed and intersectional blessing at best Estee Beck assistant professor at the University of Texas at Arlington and author of A Theory of Persuasive Computer Algorithms for Rhetorical Code Studies responded Tech design and policy affects our privacy in the United States so much so that most people do not think about the tracking of movements behaviors and attitudes from smartphones social media search engines ISPs internet service providers and even Internet of Things enabled devices Until tech designers and engineers build privacy into each design and policy decision for consumers any advances with human machine AI collaboration will leave consumers with less security and privacy Michael H Goldhaber an author consultant and theoretical physicist who wrote early explorations on the digital attention economy said For those without internet connection now its expansion will probably be positive overall For the rest we will see an increasing arms race between uses of control destructive anarchism racism etc and ad hoc from below efforts at promoting social and environmental good Organizations and states will seek more control to block internal or external attacks of many sorts The combined struggles will take up an increasing proportion of the world s attention efforts and so forth I doubt that any very viable and democratic egalitarian order will emerge over the next dozen years and even in a larger time frame good outcomes are far from guaranteed Dave Burstein editor and publisher at Fast Net News said There s far too much second rate AI that is making bad decisions based on inadequate statistical understanding For example a parole or sentencing AI probably would find a correlation between growing up in a single parent household and likelihood of committing another crime Confounding variables like the poverty of so many single mothers need to be understood and dealt with I believe it s wrong for someone to be sent to jail longer because their father left That kind of problem confounding variables and the inadequacy of preponderant data is nearly ubiquitous in AI in practice Ian Peter pioneer internet activist and internet rights advocate said Personal data accumulation is reaching a point where privacy and freedom from unwarranted surveillance are disappearing In addition the algorithms that control usage of such data are becoming more and more complex leading to inevitable distortions Henry Kissinger may have not been far off the mark when he described artificial intelligence as leading to The End of the Age of Enlightenment Michael Zimmer associate professor and privacy and information ethics scholar at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee commented I am increasingly concerned that AI driven decision making will perpetuate existing societal biases and injustices while obscuring these harms under the false belief such systems are neutral Martin Shelton a professional technologist commented There are many kinds of artificial intelligence some kinds reliant on preset rules to appear smart and some which respond to changing conditions in the world But because AI can be used anywhere we can recognize patterns the potential uses for artificial intelligence are pretty huge The question is how will it be used While these tools will become cheaper and more widespread we can expect that like smartphones or web connectivity their uses will be primarily driven by commercial interests We re beginning to see the early signs of AI failing to make smart predictions in larger institutional contexts If Amazon fails to correctly suggest the right product in the future everything is fine You bought a backpack once and now Amazon thinks you want more backpacks forever It ll be okay But sometimes these decisions have enormous stakes ProPublica documented how automated risk assessment software used in U S courtroom sentencing procedures is only slightly more accurate at predicting recidivism than the flip of a coin Likewise hospitals using IBM Watson to make predictions about cancer treatments find the software often gives advice that humans would not To mitigate harm in high stakes situations we must critically interrogate how our assumptions about our data and the rules that we use to create our AI promote harm Nigel Hickson an expert on technology policy development for ICANN based in Brussels responded I am optimistic that AI will evolve in a way that benefits society by improving processes and giving people more control over what they do This will only happen though if the technologies are deployed in a way in which benefits all My fear is that in non democratic countries AI will lessen freedom choice and hope Vian Bakir a professor of political communication and journalism at Bangor University responded I am pessimistic about the future in this scenario because of what has happened to date with AI and data surveillance For instance the recent furor over fake news disinformation and the use of complex data analytics in the U K s 2016 Brexit referendum and in the U S 2016 presidential election To understand influence and micro target people in order to try get them to vote a certain way is deeply undemocratic It shows that current political actors will exploit technology for personal political gains irrespective of wider social norms and electoral rules There is no evidence that current bad practices would not be replicated in the future especially as each new wave of technological progress outstrips regulators ability to keep up and people s ability to comprehend what is happening to them and their data Furthermore and related the capabilities of mass dataveillance in private and public spaces is ever expanding and their uptake in states with weak civil society organs and minimal privacy regulation is troubling In short dominant global technology platforms show no signs of sacrificing their business models that depend on hoovering up ever more quantities of data on people s lives then hyper targeting them with commercial messages and across the world political actors and state security and intelligence agencies then also make use of such data acquisitions frequently circumventing privacy safeguards or legal constraints Tom Slee senior product manager at SAP SE and author of What s Yours is Mine Against the Sharing Economy wrote Many aspects of life will be made easier and more efficient by AI But moving a decision such as health care or workplace performance to AI turns it into a data driven decision driven by optimization of some function which in turn demands more data Adopting AI driven insurance ratings for example demands more and more lifestyle data from the insured if it is to produce accurate overall ratings Optimized data driven decisions about our lives unavoidably require surveillance and once our lifestyle choices become input for such decisions we lose individual autonomy In some cases we can ignore this data collection but we are in the early days of AI driven decisions By 2030 I fear the loss will be much greater I do hope I am wrong Timothy Graham a postdoctoral research fellow in sociology and computer science at Australian National University commented There is already an explosion of research into fairness and representation in ML and conferences such as Fairness Accountability and Transparency in Machine Learning as it is difficult to engineer systems that do not simply reproduce existing social inequality disadvantage and prejudice Deploying such systems uncritically will only result in an aggregately worse situation for many individuals whilst a comparatively small number benefit A senior researcher and programmer for a major global think tank commented I expect AI to be embedded in systems tools etc to make them more useful However I am concerned that AI s role in decision making will lead to more brittle processes where exceptions are more difficult than today this is not a good thing Jenni Mechem a respondent who provided no identifying details said My two primary reasons for saying that advances in AI will not benefit most people by 2030 are first there will continue to be tremendous inequities in who benefits from these advances and second if the development of AI is controlled by for profit entities there will be tremendous hidden costs and people will yield control over vast areas of their lives without realizing it The examples of Facebook as a faux community commons bent on extracting data from its users and of pervasive internet censoring in China should teach us that neither for profit corporations nor government can be trusted to guide technology in a manner that truly benefits everyone Democratic governments that enforce intelligent regulations as the European Union has done on privacy may offer the best hope Suso Baleato a fellow at Harvard University s Institute of Quantitative Social Science and liaison for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD s Committee on Digital Economy Policy commented The intellectual property framework impedes the necessary accountability of the underlying algorithms and the lack of efficient redistributive economic policies will continue amplifying the bias of the datasets Sasha Costanza Chock associate professor of civic media at MIT said Unfortunately it is most likely that AI will be deployed in ways that deepen existing structural inequality along lines of race class gender ability and so on A small portion of humanity will benefit greatly from AI while the vast majority will experience AI through constraints on life chances Although it s possible for us to design AI systems to advance social justice our current trajectory will reinforce historic and structural inequality Dalsie Green Baniala CEO and regulator of the Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulator of Vanuatu wrote Often machine decisions do not produce an accurate result they do not meet expectations or specific needs For example applications are usually invented to target the developed world market They may not work appropriately for countries like ours small islands separated by big waters Michiel Leenaars director of strategy at NLnet Foundation and director of the Internet Society s Netherlands chapter responded Achieving trust is not the real issue achieving trustworthiness and real empowerment of the individual is As the technology that to a large extent determines the informational self disappears or in practical terms is placed out of local control going underground under the perfect pretext of needing networked AI the balance between societal well being and human potential on the one hand and corporate ethics and opportunistic business decisions on the other stands to be disrupted Following the typical winner takes all scenario the internet is known to produce I expect that different realms of the internet will become even less transparent and more manipulative For the vast majority of people especially in non democracies there already is little real choice but to move and push along with the masses Mike O Connor a retired technologist who worked at ICANN and on national broadband issues commented I m feeling internet pioneer regret about the Internet of S that is emerging from the work we ve done over the last few decades I actively work to reduce my dependence on internet connected devices and the amount of data that is collected about me and my family I will most certainly work equally hard to avoid human AI devices connections I earnestly hope that I m resoundingly proven wrong in this view when 2030 arrives Luke Stark a fellow in the department of sociology at Dartmouth College and at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society wrote AI technologies run the risk of providing a comprehensive infrastructure for corporate and state surveillance more granular and all encompassing than any previous such regime in human history Zoetanya Sujon a senior lecturer specializing in digital culture at the University of the Arts London commented Like the history of so many technologies show us AI will not be the magic solution to the world s problems or to symbolic and economic inequalities Instead AI is most benefitting those with the most power Larry Lannom internet pioneer and vice president at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives CNRI said I am hopeful that networked human machine interaction will improve the general quality of life My fear Will all of the benefits of more powerful artificial intelligence benefit the human race as a whole or simply the thin layer at the top of the social hierarchy that owns the new advanced technologies A professor and researcher in AI based in Europe noted Using technological AI based capabilities will give people the impression that they have more power and autonomy However those capabilities will be available in contexts already framed by powerful companies and states No real freedom For the good and for the bad An anonymous respondent said In the area of health care alone there will be tremendous benefits for those who can afford medicine employing AI But at the same time there is an enormous potential for widening inequality and for abuse We can see the tip of this iceberg now with health insurance companies today scooping up readily available poorly protected third party data that will be used to discriminate A senior data analyst and systems specialist expert in complex networks responded Artificial intelligence software will implement the priorities of the entities that funded development of the software In some cases this will be a generic service sold to the general public much as we now have route planning software in GPS units and this will provide a definite benefit to consumers In other cases software will operate to the benefit of a large company but to the detriment of consumers for example calculating a price for a product that will be the highest that a given customer is prepared to pay In yet a third category software will provide effective decision making in areas ranging from medicine to engineering but will do so at the cost of putting human beings out of work A distinguished engineer at one of the world s largest computing hardware companies commented Tech will continue to be integrated into our lives in a seamless way My biggest concern is responsible gathering of information and its use Information can be abused in many ways as we are seeing today A digital rights activist commented AI is already through racial recognition in particular technologically laundering longstanding and pervasive bias in the context of police surveillance Without algorithmic transparency and transparency into training data AIs can be bent to any purpose The following one liners from anonymous respondents also tie into this theme Other anonymous respondents commented One of the chief fears about today s technological change is the possibility that autonomous hardware and software systems will cause millions of people globally to lose their jobs and as a result their means for affording life s necessities and participating in society Many of these experts say new jobs will emerge along with the growth of AI just as they have historically during nearly every human transition to new tools Brad Templeton chair for computing at Singularity University said While obviously there will be good and bad the broad history of automation technologies is positive even when it comes to jobs There is more employment today than ever in history Ben Shneiderman distinguished professor and founder of the Human Computer Interaction Lab at the University of Maryland said Automation is largely a positive force which increases productivity lowers costs and raises living standards Automation expands the demand for services thereby raising employment which is what has happened at Amazon and FedEx My position is contrary to those who believe that robots and artificial intelligence will lead to widespread unemployment Over time I think AI machine learning strategies will become merely tools embedded in ever more complex technologies for which human control and responsibility will become clearer Robert D Atkinson president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation wrote about how advances in AI are essential to expanded job opportunities The developed world faces an unprecedented productivity slowdown that promises to limit advances in living standards AI has the potential to play an important role in boosting productivity and living standards Toby Walsh a professor of AI at the University of New South Wales in Australia and president of the AI Access Foundation said I m pessimistic in short term we re seeing already technologies like AI being used to make life worse for many but I m optimistic in long term that we ll work out how to get machines to do the dirty dull dangerous and difficult and leave us free to focus on all the more important and human parts of our lives Yet many others disagree Some fear the collapse of the middle class and social and economic upheaval if most of the world s economic power is held by a handful of technology behemoths that are reaping the great share of financial rewards in the digital age while employing far fewer people than the leading companies of the industrial age A fairly large share of these experts warn that if steps are not taken now to adjust to this potential future that AI s radical reduction in human work will be devastating David Cake an leader with Electronic Frontiers Australia and vice chair of the ICANN Generic Names Supporting Organization Council wrote The greatest fear is that the social disruption due to changing employment patterns will be handled poorly and lead to widespread social issues Jerry Michalski founder of the Relationship Economy eXpedition said We re far from tipping into a better social contract In a more just world AI could bring about utopias However many forces are shoving us in the opposite direction 1 Businesses are doing all they can to eliminate full time employees who get sick and cranky need retirement accounts and raises while software gets better and cheaper The precariat will grow 2 Software is like a flesh eating bacterium Tasks it eats vanish from the employment landscape Unlike previous technological jumps this one unemploys people more quickly than we can retrain and reemploy them 3 Our safety net is terrible and our beliefs about human motivations suck 4 Consumerism still drives desires and expectations James Hendler professor of computer web and cognitive sciences and director of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for Data Exploration and Application wrote I believe 2030 will be a point in the middle of a turbulent time when AI is improving services for many people but it will also be a time of great change in society based on changes in work patterns that are caused to a great degree by AI On the one hand for example doctors will have access to information that is currently hard for them to retrieve rapidly resulting in better medical care for those who have coverage and indeed in some countries the first point of contact in a medical situation may be an AI which will help with early diagnoses prescriptions On the other hand over the course of a couple of generations starting in the not too distant future we will see major shifts in work force with not just blue collar jobs but also many white collar jobs lost Many of these will not be people replaced by AIs but rather the result of a smaller number of people being able to accomplish the same amount of work for example in professions such as law clerks physicians assistants and many other currently skilled positions we would project a need for less people even as demand grows Betsy Williams a researcher at the Center for Digital Society and Data Studies at the University of Arizona wrote AI s benefits will be unequally distributed across society Few will reap meaningful benefits Large entities will use AI to deliver marginal improvements in service to their clients at the cost of requiring more data and risking errors Employment trends from computerization will continue AI will threaten medium skill jobs Instead of relying on human expertise and context knowledge many tasks will be handled directly by clients using AI interfaces or by lower skilled people in service jobs boosted by AI AI will harm some consumers For instance rich consumers will benefit from self driving cars while others must pay to retrofit existing cars to become more visible to the AI Through legal maneuvering self driving car companies will avoid many insurance costs and risks shifting them to human drivers pedestrians and bicyclists In education creating high quality automated instruction requires expertise and money Research on American K 12 classrooms suggests that typical computer aided instruction yields better test scores than instruction by the worst teachers By 2030 most AI used in education will be of middling quality for some their best alternative The children of the rich and powerful will not have AI used on them at school instead they will be taught to use it For AI to significantly benefit the majority it must be deployed in emergency health care where quicker lab work reviews of medical histories or potential diagnoses can save lives or in aid work say to coordinate shipping of expiring food or medicines from donors to recipients in need Nathaniel Borenstein chief scientist at Mimecast wrote Social analyses of IT information technology trends have consistently wildly exaggerated the human benefits of that technology and underestimated the negative effects I foresee a world in which IT and so called AI produce an ever increasing set of minor benefits while simultaneously eroding human agency and privacy and supporting authoritarian forms of governance I also see the potential for a much worse outcome in which the productivity gains produced by technology accrue almost entirely to a few widening the gap between the rich and poor while failing to address the social ills related to privacy But if we can find a way to ensure that these benefits are shared equally among the population it might yet prove to be the case that the overall effect of the technology is beneficial to humanity This will only happen however if we manage to limit the role of the rich in determining how the fruits of increased productivity will be allocated Andrea Romaoli Garcia an international lawyer active in internet governance discussions commented AI will improve the way people make decisions in all industries because it allows instant access to a multitude of information People will require training for this future educational and technological development This is a very high level of human development that poor countries don t have access to Without proper education and policies they will not have access to wealth The result may be a multitude of hungry and desperate people This may be motivation for wars or invasion of borders Future human machine interaction AI will only be positive if richer countries develop policies to help poorer countries to develop and gain access to work and wealth Josh Calder a partner at the Foresight Alliance commented The biggest danger is that workers are displaced on a mass scale especially in emerging markets Jeff Johnson computer science professor at the University of San Francisco previously with Xerox HP Labs and Sun Microsystems responded I believe advances in AI will leave many more people without jobs which will increase the socioeconomic differences in society but other factors could help mitigate this e g adoption of guaranteed income Alan Bundy a professor of automated reasoning at the University of Edinburgh wrote Unskilled people will suffer because there will be little employment for them This may create disruption to society some of which we have already seen with Trump Brexit etc Peter Levine associate dean for research and professor of citizenship and public affairs in Tufts University s Tisch College of Civic Life wrote Being a fully fledged citizen has traditionally depended on work I m worried that rising levels of non employment will detract from civic engagement Also AI is politically powerful and empowers the people and governments that own it Thus it may increase inequality and enhance authoritarianism Hassaan Idrees an electrical engineer and Fulbright Scholar active in creating energy systems for global good commented I believe human machine interaction will be more of a utility and less fanciful as science fiction puts it People will not need to see their physicians in person their automated doctors making this irrelevant Similarly routine workplace activities like data processing and financial number crunching would be performed by AI Humans with higher levels of intellect can survive this age and those on the lower ends of spectrum of mental acumen would be rendered unnecessary Ethem Alpaydin a professor of computer engineering at Bogazici University in Istanbul responded As with other technologies I imagine AI will favor the developed countries that actually develop these technologies For the developing countries however whose labor force is mostly unskilled and whose exports are largely low tech AI implies higher unemployment lower income and more social unrest The aim of AI in such countries should be to add skill to the labor force rather than supplant them Sam Ladner a former UX researcher for Amazon and Microsoft now an adjunct professor at Ontario College of Art and Design wrote Technology is not a neutral tool but one that has our existing challenges imprinted onto it Inequality is high and growing Too many companies deny their employees a chance to work with dignity whether it be through providing them meaningful things to do or with the basic means to live AI will be placed on top of that existing structure Those who already have dignified work with a basic income will see that enhanced those who are routinely infantilized or denied basic rights will see that amplified Some may slip into that latter category because their work is more easily replaced by AI and machine learning Jonathan Swerdloff consultant and data systems specialist for Driven Inc wrote The more reliant on AI we become the more we are at the mercy of its developers While AI has the ability to augment professionals and to make decisions I have three concerns which make me believe it will not leave us better off by 2030 This does not address fears that anything run via AI could be hacked and changed by bad faith third parties 1 Until any sort of self policed AI sentience is achieved it will suffer from a significant GIGO garbage in garbage out problem As AI as currently conceived only knows what it is taught the seed sets for teaching must be thought out in detail before the tools are deployed Based on the experience with Microsoft s Tay and some responses I ve heard from the Sophia robot I am concerned that AI will magnify humanities flaws 2 Disparate access Unless the cost for developing AI drops precipitously and it may since one AI tool could be leveraged into building further less expensive AI tools access to whatever advantages the tools will bring will likely be clustered among a few beneficiaries I view this akin to high frequency trading on Wall Street Those who can do Those who can t lose 3 Tool of control If AI is deployed to make civic or corporate decisions those who control the algorithms control everything In the U S we ve recently seen Immigration and Customs Enforcement change its bond algorithm to always detain in every case Stuart A Umpleby a professor and director of the research program in social and organizational learning at George Washington University wrote People who use AI and the internet will have their lives enhanced by these technologies People who do not use them will be increasingly disconnected from opportunities As the digital world becomes more complicated and remote from real world experiences the need will grow for people and software to make connections There will be a need for methods to distinguish the real world from the scam world Simeon Yates director of the Centre for Digital Humanities and Social Science at the University of Liverpool said AI will simply increase existing inequalities it like the internet will fail in its emancipatory promise Panagiotis T Metaxas author of Technology Propaganda and the Limits of Human Intellect and professor of computer science at Wellesley College responded There will be a lot of wealth that AI supported devices will be producing The new technologies will make it easier and cheaper to produce food and entertainment massively bread and circus This wealth will not be distributed evenly increasing the financial gap between the top small percentage of people and the rest Even though this wealth will not be distributed evenly the relatively small share given to the vast majority of people will be enough to improve their 2018 condition In this respect the majority of people will be better off than they are today They may not feel better off if they were aware of the inequalities compared to the top beneficiaries but they will not be aware of them due to controlled propaganda Unfortunately there will not be much they could do about the increased inequalities Technologies of police enforcement by robots and lack of private communication will make it impossible for them to organize complain or push for change They will not be valued as workers citizens or soldiers The desire for democracy as we know it today will be coming to an end Many will feel depressed but medical products will make it easy for them to increase pleasure and decrease pain Grace Mutung u co leader of the Kenya ICT Action Network responded New technologies will more likely increase current inequalities unless there is a shift in world economics From the experience of the UN work on Millennium Development Goals while there has been improvement with the quality of life generally low and middle income countries still suffer disparate inequalities This will likely lead to governance problems In any case governments in these countries are investing heavily in surveillance which will likely have more negative effects on society Danny Gillane a netizen from Lafayette Louisiana commented Technology promises so much but delivers so little Facebook gave us the ability to stay in touch with everyone but sacrificed its integrity and our personal information in pursuit of the dollar The promise that our medical records would be digitized and more easily shared and drive costs down still has not materialized on a global scale The chief drivers of AI innovation and application will be for profit companies who have shown that their altruism only extends to their bottom lines Like most innovations I expect AI to leave our poor even poorer and our rich even richer increasing the numbers of the former while consolidating power and wealth in an ever shrinking group of currently rich people A professional working on the setting of web standards wrote Looking ahead 12 years from now I expect that AI will be enhancing the quality of life for some parts of some populations and in some situations while worsening the quality of life for others AI will still be uneven in quality and unevenly available throughout different parts of society Privacy and security protections will be inadequate data bias will still be common many technologies and response patterns will be normed to the needs of the common denominator user and misidentify or misinterpret interactions with people with disabilities or if appropriately identifying their disability will expose that information without user consent or control So many people included comments and concerns about the future of jobs for humans in their wide ranging responses to this canvassing that a later section of this report has more expert opinions on this topic The following one liners from anonymous respondents also tie into AI and jobs Other anonymous respondents commented While these experts expect AI to augment humans in many positive ways some are concerned that a deepening dependence upon machine intelligence networks will diminish crucial human capabilities Some maintain there has already been an erosion of people s abilities to think for themselves to take action independent of automated systems and to interact effectively face to face with others Charles Ess an expert in ethics and professor with the department of media and communication at the University of Oslo said It seems quite clear that evolving AI systems will bring about an extraordinary array of options making our lives more convenient But convenience almost always comes at the cost of deskilling of our offloading various cognitive practices and virtues to the machines and thereby our becoming less and less capable of exercising our own agency autonomy and most especially our judgment phronesis In particular empathy and loving itself are virtues that are difficult to acquire and enhance My worst fears are not only severe degradation perhaps more or less loss of such capacities and worst of all our forgetting they even existed in the first place along with the worlds they have made possible for us over most of our evolutionary and social history Daniel Siewiorek a professor with the Human Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University predicted The downside isolating people decreasing diversity a loss of situational awareness witness GPS directional systems and losing the receipt of how to do things In the latter case as we layer new capabilities on older technologies if we forget how the older technology works we cannot fix it and layered systems may collapse thrusting us back into a more primitive time Marilyn Cade longtime global internet policy consultant responded Technology often reflects the ethics of its creators but more significantly those who commercialize it Most individuals focus on how they personally use technology They do not spend time or even have the skills expertise to make judgments about the attributes of the way that technology is applied We must introduce and maintain a focus on critical thinking for our children youth so that they are capable of understanding the implications of a different fully digitized world I love the fact that my typos are autocorrected but I know how to spell all the words I know how to construct a logical argument If we don t teach critical thinking at all points in education we will have a 2030 world where the elites scientists make decisions that are not even apparent to the average person on the street neighborhood Garland McCoy founder and chief development officer of the Technology Education Institute wrote I am an optimist at heart and so believe that given a decade plus the horror that is unfolding before our eyes will somehow be understood and resolved That said if the suicide epidemic we are witnessing continues to build and women continue to opt out of motherhood all bets are off I do think technology is at the core of both the pathology and choice Aneesh Aneesh professor at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee said Socially AI systems will automate tasks that currently require human negotiation and interaction Unless people feel the pressure institutionally or otherwise to interact with each other they more often than not choose not to interact The lack of physical embodied interaction is almost guaranteed to result in social loneliness and anomie and associated problems such as suicide a phenomenon already are on the rise in the United States Ebenezer Baldwin Bowles author editor and journalist responded If one values community and the primacy of face to face eye to eye communication then human machine AI collaboration in 2030 will have succeeded in greatly diminishing the visceral primal aspects of humanity Every expression of daily life either civil or professional or familial or personal will be diminished by the iron grip of AI on the fundamental realities of interpersonal communications Already the reliance on voice to text technology via smartphone interface diminishes the ability of people to write with skill and cogency Taking the time to ring up another and chat requires too much psychic energy so we speak to one another in text box fragments written down and oft altered by digital assistants The dismissive but socially acceptable TL DR becomes commonplace as our collective attention span disintegrates Yes diagnostic medicine and assembly line production and expanded educational curriculum will surely be enhanced by cyber based one and zero technologies but at what cost to humanity Is it truly easier and safer to look into a screen and listen to an electronically delivered voice far away on the other side of an unfathomable digital divide instead of looking into another s eyes perhaps into a soul and speaking kind words to one another and perhaps singing in unison about the wonders of the universe We call it artificial intelligence for good reason A principal design researcher at one of the world s largest technology companies commented Although I have long worked in this area and been an optimist I now fear that the goal of most AI and UX is geared toward pushing people to interact more with devices and less with other people As a social species that is built to live in communities reductions in social interaction will lead to erosion of community and rise in stress and depression over time Although AI has the potential to improve lives as well those advances will come more slowly than proponents think due to the complexity brake Paul Allen wrote about among other things There have been AI summers and AI winters This is not an endless summer A chief operating officer wrote No doubt in my mind AI is and will continue to present benefits in simplifying and aiding human activities however the net effect is not likely to leave people better off The advances in AI enabled tools are likely to expand the digital gap in human competencies This growing gap will decrease the capacity of sizable portions of the population to survive an outage of the technology This raises humanitarian and national security concerns Dalsie Green Baniala CEO and regulator of the Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulator of Vanuatu wrote With the introduction of the Internet of Things human senses are in decline Alper Dincel of T C Istanbul Kultur University in Turkey wrote Personal connections will continue to drop as they are in today s world We are going to have more interest in fiction than in reality These issues will affect human brain development as a result Michael Dyer an emeritus professor of computer science at the University of California Los Angeles commented As long as GAI general AI is not achieved then specialized AI will eliminate tasks associated with jobs but not the jobs themselves A trucker does a lot more than merely drive a truck A bartender does a lot more than merely pour drinks Society will still have to deal with the effects of smart technologies encroaching ever into new parts of the labor market A universal basic income could mitigate increasing social instability Later on as general AI spreads it will become an existential threat to humanity My estimate is that this existential threat will not begin to arise until the second half of the 21st century Unfortunately by then humanity might have grown complacent since specialized AI systems do not pose an existential threat Mauro D R os an adviser to the E Government Agency of Uruguay and director of the Internet Society s Uruguay chapter responded In 2030 dependence on AI will be greater in all domestic personal work and educational contexts this will make the lives of many people better However it has risks We must be able to maintain active survival capabilities without AI Human freedom cannot be lost in exchange for the convenience of improving our living standards AI must continue to be subject to the rationality and control of the human being Nancy Greenwald a respondent who provided no identifying details wrote Perhaps the primary downside is overreliance on AI which 1 is only as good as the algorithms created how are they instructed to learn and 2 has the danger of limiting independent human thinking How many Millennials can read a map or navigate without the step by step instructions from Waze Google or their iPhones And information searches online don t give you an overview I once wasted 1 5 billable hours searching for a legal concept when two minutes with the human based BNA outline got me the result in two minutes Let s be thoughtful about how we use the amazing technology Valarie Bell a computational social scientist at the University of North Texas commented As a social scientist I m concerned that never before have we had more ways in which to communicate and yet we ve never done it so poorly so venomously and so wastefully With devices replacing increasingly higher order decisions and behaviors people have become more detached more disinterested and yet more self focused and self involved Lane Jennings managing editor for the World Future Review from 2009 to 2015 wrote It is most likely that advances in AI will improve technology and thus give people new capabilities But this progress will also make humanity increasingly vulnerable to accidental breakdowns power failures and deliberate attacks Example Driverless cars and trucks and pilotless passenger aircraft will enhance speed and safety when they work properly but they will leave people helpless if they fail Fear and uncertainty could negate positive benefits after even a few highly publicized disasters Michael Veale co author of Fairness and Accountability Designs Needs for Algorithmic Support in High Stakes Public Sector Decision Making and a technology policy researcher at University College London responded AI technologies will turn out to be more narrowly applicable than some hope There will be a range of small tasks that will be more effectively automated Whether these tasks leave individuals with increased ability to find meaning or support in life is debatable Freed from some aspects of housework and administration some individuals may feel empowered whereas others might feel aimless Independent living for the elderly might be technologically mediated but will it have the social connections and community that makes life worth living Jobs too will change in nature but it is not clear that new tasks will make people happy It is important that all technologies and applications are backed up with social policies and systems to support meaning and connection or else even effective AI tools might be isolating and even damaging on aggregate The following one liners from anonymous respondents also tie into this theme Other anonymous respondents commented Some of these experts are particularly worried about how networked artificial intelligence can amplify cybercrime create fearsome possibilities in cyberwarfare or enable the erosion of essential institutions and organizations Anthony Nadler assistant professor of media and communication studies at Ursinus College commented The question has to do with how decisions will be made that shape the contingent development of this potentially life changing technology And who will make those decisions In the best case scenario the development of AI will be influenced by diverse stakeholders representing different communities who will be affected by its implementation and this may mean that particular uses of AI military applications medical marketing etc will be overseen by reflective ethical processes In the absolute worst case scenario unrestricted military development will lead to utter destruction whether in a situations in which the machines take over or more likely in which weapons of tremendous destruction become all the more readily accessible Jennifer J Snow an innovation officer with the U S Air Force wrote Facets including weaponized information cyberbullying privacy issues and other potential abuses that will come out of this technology will need to be addressed by global leaders Lee McKnight associate professor at Syracuse University s School of Information Studies commented There will be good bad and ugly outcomes from human machine interaction in artificially intelligent systems services and enterprises Poorly designed artificially intelligent services and enterprises will have unintended societal consequences hopefully not catastrophic but sure to damage people and infrastructure Even more regrettably defending ourselves against evil or to be polite bad AI systems turned ugly by humans or other machines must become a priority for societies well before 2030 given the clear and present danger How can I be sure What are bots and malware doing every day today Is there a reason to think evil doers will be less motivated in the future No So my fear is that the hopefully sunny future of AI which in aggregate we may assume will be a net positive for all of us will be marred by many unfortunate events Robert M Mason a professor emeritus at the University of Washington s Information School responded Technologies including AI leverage human efforts People find ways to apply technologies to enhance the human spirit and the human experience yet others can use technologies to exploit human fears and satisfy personal greed As the late Fred Robbins Nobel Laureate in Physiology Medicine observed my paraphrase when I asked why he was pessimistic about the future of mankind Of course I m pessimistic Humans have had millions of years to develop physically and mentally but we ve had only a few thousand years as the world population has expanded to develop the social skills that would allow us to live close together I understand his pessimism and it takes only a few people to use AI or any technology in ways that result in widespread negative societal impacts Frank Feather futurist and consultant with StratEDGY commented AI by 2030 This is only about a decade away so despite AI s continuing evolution it will not have major widespread effects by 2030 With care in implementation all effects should be positive in social and economic impact That said the changes will represent a significant step toward what I call a DigiTransHuman Future where the utility of humans will increasingly be diminished as this century progresses to the extent that humans may become irrelevant or extinct replaced by DigiTransHumans and their technologies robots that will appear and behave just like today s humans except at very advanced stages of humanoid development This is not going to be a so called singularity and there is nothing artificial about the DigiTransHuman Intelligence It is part of designed evolution of the species John Leslie King a computer science professor at the University of Michigan and a consultant for several years on cyberinfrastructure for the National Science Foundation s directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE and Social Behavioral and Economic SBE sciences commented If there are evil things to be done with AI people will find out about them and do them There will be an ongoing fight like the one between hackers and IT security people John Markoff fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University and author of Machines of Loving Grace The Quest for Common Ground Between Humans and Robots wrote There are expected and unexpected consequences to AI and related technologies It is quite possible that improvements in living standards will be offset by the use of autonomous weapons in new kinds of war A veteran of a pioneering internet company commented In the face of managing resources and warfare the big issues for AI at scale the goals are not likely to be sharing and co existence Dan Schultz senior creative technologist at Internet Archive responded AI will no doubt result in life saving improvements for a huge portion of the world s population but it will also be possible to weaponize in ways that further exacerbate divides of any kind you can imagine political economic education privilege etc AI will amplify and enable the will of those in power its net impact on humanity will depend on the nature of that will Sam Gregory director of WITNESS and digital human rights activist responded Trends in AI suggest it will enable more individualized personalized creation of synthetic media filter bubbles around people including the use of deepfakes and related individualized synthetic audio and video micro targeting based on personal data and trends in using AI generated and directed bots These factors may be controlled by increasing legislation and platform supervision but by 2030 there is little reason to think that most peoples individual autonomy and ability to push back to understand the world around them will have improved Miguel Moreno Mu oz a professor of philosophy specializing in ethics epistemology and technology at the University of Granada in Spain said There is a risk of overreliance on systems with poorly experienced intelligence augmentation due to pressure to reduce costs This could lead to major dysfunctions in health care or in the supervision of highly complex processes A hasty application of management systems based on the Internet of Things could be problematic in certain sectors of industry transport or health but its advantages will outweigh its disadvantages I do believe there may be significant risks in the military applications of AI Denise N Rall a professor of arts and social sciences at Southern Cross University in Australia responded The basic problem with the human race and its continued existence on this planet is overpopulation and depletion of the Earth s resources So far interactions with technology have reduced population in the first world but not in developing countries and poverty will fuel world wars Technology may support robotic wars and reduce casualties for the wealthy countries The disparity between rich and poor will continue unabated Patrick Lambe a partner at Straits Knowledge and president of the International Society for Knowledge Organization s Singapore chapter wrote I chose the negative answer not because of a dystopian vision for AI itself and technology interaction with human life but because I believe social economic and political contexts will be slow to adapt to technology s capabilities The real world environment and the technological capability space are becoming increasingly disjointed and out of synch Climate change migration pressures political pressures food supply and water will create a self reinforcing crisis loop with which human machine AI capabilities will be largely out of touch There will be some capability enhancement e g medicine but on the whole technology contributions will continue to add negative pressures to the other environmental factors employment job security left right political swings On the whole I think these disjoints will continue to become more enhanced until a major crisis point is reached e g war Mechthild Schmidt Feist department coordinator for digital communications and media at New York University said Historical precedent shows that inventions are just as powerful in the hands of criminals or irresponsible or uninformed people The more powerful our communication the more destructive it could be We would need global enforceable legislation to limit misuse 1 That is highly unlikely 2 It is hard to predict all misuses My negative view is due to our inability to make responsible use of our current online communication and media models The utopian freedom has become a dystopian battleground Marc Brenman managing partner at IDARE LLC said We do not know all that machines can do There is no inherent necessity that they will care for us We may be an impediment to them They may take orders from evil doers They will enable us to make mistakes even faster than we do now Any technology is only as good as the morality and ethics of its makers programmers and controllers If machines are programmed to care more for the earth than for people they may eliminate us anyway since we are destroying the earth Robert K Logan chief scientist at the Strategic Innovation Lab sLab at OCAT University and professor emeritus of physics at the University of Toronto said The idea of the Singularity is an example of the over extension of AI Computers will never achieve an equivalency to human intelligence There is no such thing as AW artificial wisdom AI as a tool to enhance human intelligence makes sense but AI to replace human intelligence makes no sense and therefore is nonsense Alexey Turchin existential risks researcher and futurist responded There are significant risks of AI misuse before 2030 in the form of swarms of AI empowered drones or even non aligned human level AI Adam Popescu a writer who contributes frequently to the New York Times Washington Post Bloomberg Businessweek Vanity Fair and the BBC wrote We put too much naive hope in everything tech being the savior The following one liners from anonymous respondents also tie into this theme Other anonymous respondents commented A number of participants in this canvassing offered solutions to the worrisome potential future spawned by AI Among them 1 Improving collaboration across borders and stakeholder groups 2 Developing policies to assure that development of AI will be directed at augmenting humans and the common good 3 Shifting the priorities of economic political and education systems to empower individuals to stay ahead in the race with the robots Many respondents sketched out overall aspirations Andrew Wycoff the director of OECD s directorate for science technology and innovation and Karine Perset an economist in OECD s digital economy policy division commented Twelve years from now we will benefit from radically improved accuracy and efficiency of decisions and predictions across all sectors Machine learning systems will actively support humans throughout their work and play This support will be unseen but pervasive like electricity As machines ability to sense learn interact naturally and act autonomously increases they will blur the distinction between the physical and the digital world AI systems will interconnect and work together to predict and adapt to our human needs and emotions The growing consensus that AI should benefit society at large leads to calls to facilitate the adoption of AI systems to promote innovation and growth help address global challenges and boost jobs and skills development while at the same time establishing appropriate safeguards to ensure these systems are transparent and explainable and respect human rights democracy culture nondiscrimination privacy and control safety and security Given the inherently global nature of our networks and applications that run across then we need to improve collaboration across countries and stakeholder groups to move toward common understanding and coherent approaches to key opportunities and issues presented by AI This is not too different from the post war discussion on nuclear power We should also tread carefully toward Artificial General Intelligence and avoid current assumptions on the upper limits of future AI capabilities Wendy Hall professor of computer science at the University of Southampton and executive director of the Web Science Institute said By 2030 I believe that human machine AI collaboration will be empowering for human beings overall Many jobs will have gone but many new jobs will have been created and machines AI should be helping us do things more effectively and efficiently both at home and at work It is a leap of faith to think that by 2030 we will have learnt to build AI in a responsible way and we will have learnt how to regulate the AI and robotics industries in a way that is good for humanity We may not have all the answers by 2030 but we need to be on the right track by then Ian O Byrne an assistant professor focusing on literacy and technology at the College of Charleston said I believe in human machine AI collaboration but the challenge is whether humans can adapt our practices to these new opportunities Arthur Bushkin an IT pioneer who worked with the precursors to the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ARPANET and Verizon wrote The principal issue will be society s collective ability to understand manage and respond to the implications and consequences of the technology Daniel Obam information and communications technology policy advisor responded As we develop AI the issue of ethical behaviour is paramount AI will allow authorities to analyse and allocate resources where there is the greatest need AI will also change the way we work and travel Digital assistants that mine and analyse data will help professionals in making concise decisions in health care manufacturing and agriculture among others Smart devices and virtual reality will enable humans to interact with and learn from historical or scientific issues in a more clear manner Using AI authorities will be able to prevent crime before it happens Cybersecurity needs to be at the forefront to prevent unscrupulous individuals from using AI to perpetrate harm or evil on the human race Ryan Sweeney director of analytics at Ignite Social Media commented Our technology continues to evolve at a growing rate but our society culture and economy are not as quick to adapt We ll have to be careful that the benefits of AI for some do not further divide those who might not be able to afford the technology What will that mean for our culture as more jobs are automated We will need to consider the impact on the current class divide Susan Mernit executive director of The Crucible and co founder and board member of Hack the Hood responded If AI is in the hands of people who do not care about equity and inclusion it will be yet another tool to maximize profit for a few The next three sections of this report focus on solutions most often mentioned by respondents to this canvassing A number of these experts said ways must be found for people of the world to come to a common understanding of the evolving concerns over AI and digital life and to reach agreement in order to create cohesive approaches to tackling AI s challenges Danil Mikhailov head of data and innovation for Wellcome Trust responded I see a positive future of human AI interaction in 2030 In my area health there is tremendous potential in the confluence of advances in big data analysis and genomics to create personalised medicine and improve diagnosis treatment and research Although I am optimistic about human capacity for adaptation learning and evolution technological innovation will not always proceed smoothly In this we can learn from previous technological revolutions For example Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane rightly pointed out that the original luddites in the 19th century had a justified grievance They suffered severe job losses and it took the span of a generation for enough jobs to be created to overtake the ones lost It is a reminder that the introduction of new technologies benefits people asymmetrically with some suffering while others benefit To realise the opportunities of the future we need to acknowledge this and prepare sufficient safety nets such as well funded adult education initiatives to name one example It s also important to have an honest dialogue between the experts the media and the public about the use of our personal data for social good projects like health care taking in both the risks of acting such as effects on privacy and the opportunity costs of not acting It is a fact that lives are lost currently in health systems across the world that could be saved even with today s technology let alone that of 2030 Edson Prestes a professor and director of robotics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul responded We must understand that all domains technological or not have two sides a good and a bad one To avoid the bad one we need to create and promote the culture of AI Robotics for good We need to stimulate people to empathize toward others We need to think about potential issues even if they have small probability to happen We need to be futurists foreseeing potential negative events and how to circumvent them before they happen We need to create regulations laws at national and international levels to handle globally harmful situations for humans other living beings and the environment Applying empathy we should seriously think about ourselves and others if the technology will be useful for us and others and if it will not cause any harm We cannot develop solutions without considering people and the ecosystem as the central component of development If so the pervasiveness of AI robotics in the future will diminish any negative impact and create a huge synergy among people and environment improving people s daily lives in all domains while achieving environment sustainability Adam Nelson a software developer for one of the big five global technology companies said Human machine AI collaboration will be extremely powerful but humans will still control intent If human governance isn t improved AI will merely make the world more efficient But the goals won t be human welfare They ll be wealth aggregation for those in power Wendy Seltzer strategy lead and counsel at the World Wide Web Consortium commented I m mildly optimistic that we will have devised better techno social governance mechanisms such that if AI is not improving the lives of humans we will restrict its uses Jen Myronuk a respondent who provided no identifying details said The optimist s view includes establishing and implementing a new type of ISO standard encoded human rights as a functional data set alongside exponential and advancing technologies Global human rights and human machine AI technology can and must scale together If applied as an extension of the human experience human machine AI collaboration will revolutionize our understanding of the world around us Fiona Kerr industry professor of neural and systems complexity at the University of Adelaide commented The answer depends very much on what we decide to do regarding the large questions around ensuring equality of improved global health by agreeing on what productivity and worth now look like partly supported by the global wage through fair redistribution of technology profits to invest in both international and national social capital through robust discussion on the role of policy in rewarding technologists and businesses to build quality partnerships between humans and AI through the growth of understanding in the neurophysiological outcomes of human human and human technological interaction which allows us to best decide what not to technologies when a human is more effective and how to ensure we maximise the wonders of technology as an enabler of a human centric future Benjamin Kuipers a professor of computer science at the University of Michigan wrote We face several critical choices between positive and negative futures Advancing technology will provide vastly more resources the key decision is whether those resources will be applied for the good of humanity as a whole or if they will be increasingly held by a small elite Advancing technology will vastly increase opportunities for communication and surveillance The question is whether we will find ways to increase trust and the possibilities for productive cooperation among people or whether individuals striving for power will try to dominate by decreasing trust and cooperation In the medium term increasing technology will provide more powerful tools for human corporate or even robot actors in society The actual problems will be about how members of a society interact with each other In a positive scenario we will interact with conversational AIs for many different purposes and even when the AI belongs to a corporation we will be able to trust that it takes what in economics is called a fiduciary stance toward each of us That is the information we provide must be used primarily for our individual benefit Although we know and are explicitly told that our aggregated information is valuable to the corporation we can trust that it will not be used for our manipulation or our disadvantage Denise Garcia an associate professor of political science and international affairs at Northeastern University said Humanity will come together to cooperate Charles Geiger head of the executive secretariat for the UN s World Summit on the Information Society commented As long as we have a democratic system and a free press we may counterbalance the possible threats of AI Warren Yoder longtime director of the Public Policy Center of Mississippi now an instructor at Mississippi College optimistically responded Human AI collaborations will augment our human abilities and increase the material well being of humanity At the same time the concomitant increase in the levels of education and health will allow us to develop new social philosophies and rework our polities to transform human well being AI increases the disruption of the old social order making the new transformation both necessary and more likely though not guaranteed Wangari Kabiru author of the MitandaoAfrika blog based in Nairobi Kenya commented In 2030 advancing AI and tech will not leave most people better off than they are today because our global digital mission is not strong enough and not principled enough to assure that no not one is left behind perhaps intentionally The immense positive impact potential for enabling people to achieve more in nearly every area of life the full benefits of human machine AI collaboration can only be experienced when academia civil society and other institutions are vibrant enterprise is human values based and governments and national constitutions and global agreements place humanity first Engineering should serve humanity and never should humanity be made to serve the exploits of engineering More people MUST be creators of the future of LIFE the future of how they live future of how they work future of how their relationships interact and overall how they experience life Beyond the coexistence of human machine this creates synergy A professor expert in AI connected to a major global technology company s projects in AI development wrote Precision democracy will emerge from precision education to incrementally support the best decisions we can make for our planet and our species The future is about sustaining our planet As with the current development of precision health as the path from data to wellness so too will artificial intelligence improve the impact of human collaboration and decision making in sustaining our planet Some respondents argued that individuals must do better at taking a more active role in understanding and implementing the decision making options available to them in these complex code dependent systems Kristin Jenkins executive director of BioQUEST Curriculum Consortium said Like all tools the benefits and pitfalls of AI will depend on how we use it A growing concern is the collection and potential uses of data about people s day to day lives Something always knows where we are the layout of the house what s in the fridge and how much we slept The convenience provided by these tools will override caution about data collection so strong privacy protection must be legislated and culturally nurtured We need to learn to be responsible for our personal data and aware of when and how it is collected and used Peng Hwa Ang professor of communications at Nanyang Technological University and author of Ordering Chaos Regulating the Internet commented AI is still in its infancy A lot of it is ruled based and not demanding of true intelligence or learning But even so I find it useful My car has lane assistance I find that it makes me a better driver When AI is more full fledged it would make driving safer and faster I am using AI for some work I am doing on sentiment analysis I find that I am able to be more creative in asking questions to be investigated I expect AI will compel greater creativity Right now the biggest fear of AI is that it is a black box operation yes the factors chosen are good and accurate and useful but no one knows why those criteria are chosen We know the percentages of the factors but we do not know the whys Hopefully by 2030 the box will be more transparent That s on the AI side On the human side I hope human beings understand that true AI will make mistakes If not it is not real AI This means that people have got to be ready to catch the mistakes that AI will make It will be very good But it will still not be foolproof Bert Huang an assistant professor in the department of computer science at Virginia Tech focused on machine learning wrote AI will cause harm and it has already caused harm but its benefits will outweigh the harm it causes That said the historical pattern of technology being net positive depends on people seeking positive things to do with the technology so efforts to guide research toward societal benefits will be important to ensure the best future An anonymous respondent said We should ensure that values local or global and basic philosophical theories on ethics inform the development and implementation of AI systems Many experts who shared their insights in this study suggested there has to be an overall change in the development regulation and certification of autonomous systems They generally said the goal should be values based inclusive decentralized networks imbued with empathy that help individuals assure that technology meets social and ethical responsibilities for the common good Susan Etlinger an industry analyst for Altimeter Group and expert in data analytics and digital strategy commented In order for AI technologies to be truly transformative in a positive way we need a set of ethical norms standards and practical methodologies to ensure that we use AI responsibly and to the benefit of humanity AI technologies have the potential to do so much good in the world identify disease in people and populations discover new medications and treatments make daily tasks like driving simpler and safer monitor and distribute energy more efficiently and so many other things we haven t yet imagined or been able to realize And like any tectonic shift AI creates its own type of disruption We ve seen this with every major invention from the Gutenberg press to the invention of the semiconductor But AI is different Replication of some human capabilities using data and algorithms has ethical consequences Algorithms aren t neutral they replicate and reinforce bias and misinformation They can be opaque And the technology and means to use them rests in the hands of a select few organizations at least today Bryan Johnson founder and CEO of Kernel a leading developer of advanced neural interfaces and OS Fund a venture capital firm said We could start with owning our own digital data and the data from our bodies minds and behavior and then follow by correcting our major tech companies incentives away from innovation for everyday convenience and toward radical human improvement As an example of what tech could look like when aligned with radical human improvement cognitive prosthetics will one day give warnings about biases like how cars today have sensors letting you know when you drift off to sleep or if you make a lane change without a signal and correct cognitive biases and warn an individual away from potential cognitive biases This could lead to better behaviors in school home and work and encourage people to make better health decisions Marc Rotenberg executive director of Electronic Privacy Information Center EPIC commented The challenge we face with the rise of AI is the growing opacity of processes and decision making The favorable outcomes we will ignore The problematic outcomes we will not comprehend That is why the greatest challenge ahead for AI accountability is AI transparency We must ensure that we understand and can replicate the outcomes produced by machines The alternative outcome is not sustainable John C Havens executive director of the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems and the Council on Extended Intelligence wrote While today people provide consent for their data usage most people don t understand the depth and breadth of how their information is utilized by businesses and governments at large Until every individual is provided with a sovereign identity attached to a personal data cloud they control information won t truly be shared just tracked By utilizing blockchain or similar technologies and adopting progressive ideals toward citizens and their data as demonstrated by countries like Estonia we can usher in genuine digital democracy in the age of the algorithm The other issue underlying the human AI augmentation narrative rarely discussed is the economic underpinnings driving all technology manufacturing Where exponential growth shareholder models are prioritized human and environmental well being diminishes Multiple reports from people like Joseph Stiglitz point out that while AI will greatly increase GDP in the coming decades the benefits of these increases will favor the few versus the many It s only by adopting Beyond GDP or triple bottom line metrics that people planet and profit will shape a holistic future between humans and AI Greg Lloyd president and co founder at Traction Software presented a future scenario By 2030 AIs will augment access and use of all personal and networked resources as highly skilled and trusted agents for almost every person human or corporate These agents will be bound to act in accordance with new laws and regulations that are fundamental elements of their construction much like Isaac Asimov s Three Laws of Robotics but with finer grain certifications for classes of activities that bind their behavior and responsibility for practices much like codes for medical legal accounting and engineering practice Certified agents will be granted access to personal or corporate resources and within those bounds will be able to converse take direction give advice and act like trusted servants advisers or attorneys Although these agents will feel like intelligent and helpful beings they will not have any true independent will or consciousness and must not pretend to be human beings or act contrary to the laws and regulations that bind their behavior Think Ariel and Prospero Tracey P Lauriault assistant professor of critical media and big data at Carleton University s School of Journalism and Communication commented What about regulatory and policy interventions to protect citizens from potentially harmful outcomes AI auditing oversight transparency and accountability Without some sort of principles of a systems based framework to ensure that AI remains ethical and in the public interest in a stable fashion then I must assume that AI will impede agency and could lead to decision making that can be harmful biased inaccurate and not able to dynamically change with changing values There needs to be some sort of accountability Jo l Colloc professor at Universit du Havre Normandy University and author of Ethics of Autonomous Information Systems commented When AI supports human decisions as a decision support system it can help humanity enhance life health and well being and supply improvements for humanity See Marcus Flavius Quintilianus s principles Who is doing what with what why how when where Autonomous AI is power that can be used by powerful persons to control the people put them in slavery Applying the Quintilian principles to the role of AI we should propose a code of ethics of AI to evaluate that each type of application is oriented toward the well being of the user 1 do not harm the user 2 benefits go to the user 3 do not misuse her his freedom identity and personal data and 4 decree as unfair any clauses alienating the user s independence or weakening his her rights of control over privacy in use of the application The sovereignty of the user of the system must remain total Joseph Turow professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania wrote Whether or not AI will improve society or harm it by 2030 will depend on the structures governing societies of the era Broadly democratic societies with an emphasis on human rights might encourage regulations that push AI in directions that help all sectors of the nation Authoritarian societies will by contrast set agendas for AI that further divide the elite from the rest and use technology to cultivate and reinforce the divisions We see both tendencies today the dystopian one has the upper hand especially in places with the largest populations It is critical that people who care about future generations speak out when authoritarian tendencies of AI appear Henry E Brady dean of the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California Berkeley wrote I believe that policy responses can be developed that will reduce biases and find a way to accommodate AI and robotics with human lives Jennifer King director of privacy at Stanford Law School s Center for Internet and Society said Unless we see a real effort to capture the power of AI for the public good I do not see an overarching public benefit by 2030 The shift of AI research to the private sector means that AI will be developed to further consumption rather than extend knowledge and public benefit Gary Kreps distinguished professor of communication and director of the Center for Health and Risk Communication at George Mason University wrote The tremendous potential for AI to be used to engage and adapt information content and computer services to individual users can make computing increasingly helpful engaging and relevant However to achieve these outcomes AI needs to be programmed with the user in mind For example AI services should be user driven adaptive to individual users easy to use easy to understand and easy for users to control These AI systems need to be programmed to adapt to individual user requests learning about user needs and preferences Thomas Streeter a professor of sociology at the University of Vermont said The technology will not determine whether things are better or worse in 2030 social and political choices will Paul Werbos a former program director at the National Science Foundation who first described the process of training artificial neural networks through backpropagation of errors in 1974 said We are at a moment of choice The outcome will depend a lot on the decisions of very powerful people who do not begin to know the consequences of the alternatives they face or even what the substantive alternatives are Divina Frau Meigs professor of media sociology at the University of Paris III Sorbonne Nouvelle and UNESCO chair for sustainable digital development responded The sooner the ethics of AI are aligned with human rights tenets the better Juan Ortiz Freuler a policy fellow at the World Wide Web Foundation wrote We believe technology can and should empower people If the people will continue to have a substantive say on how society is run then the state needs to increase its technical capabilities to ensure proper oversight of these companies Tech in general and AI in particular will promote the advancement of humanity in every area by allowing processes to scale efficiently reducing the costs and making more services available to more people including quality health care mobility education etc The open question is how these changes will affect power dynamics To operate effectively AI requires a broad set of infrastructure components which are not equally distributed These include data centers computing power and big data What is more concerning is that there are reasons to expect further concentration On the one hand data scales well The upfront fixed costs of setting up a datacenter are large compared to the cost of keeping it running Therefore the cost of hosting each extra datum is marginally lower than the previous one Data is the fuel of AI and therefore whoever gets access to more data can develop more effective AI On the other hand AI creates efficiency gains by allowing companies to automate more processes meaning whoever gets ahead can undercut competitors This circle fuels concentration As more of our lives are managed by technology there is a risk that whoever controls these technologies gets too much power The benefits in terms of quality of life and the risks to people s autonomy and control over politics are qualitatively different and there cannot and should not be up for tradeoffs Meryl Alper an assistant professor of communication at Northeastern University and a faculty associate at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society wrote My fear is that AI tools will be used by a powerful few to further centralize resources and marginalize people These tools much like the internet itself will allow people to do this ever more cheaply quickly and in a far reaching and easily replicable manner with exponentially negative impacts on the environment Preventing this in its worst manifestations will require global industry regulation by government officials with hands on experience in working with AI tools on the federal state and local level and transparent audits of government AI tools by grassroots groups of diverse in every sense of the term stakeholders David Wilkins instructor in computer science at the University of Oregon responded AI must be able to explain the basis for its decisions A top research director and technical fellow at a major global technology company said There is a huge opportunity to enhance folks lives via AI technologies The positive uses of AI will dominate as they will be selected for their value to people I trust the work by industry academia and civil society to continue to play an important role in moderating the technology such as pursuing understandings of the potential costly personal social and societal influences of AI I particularly trust the guidance coming from the long term ongoing One Hundred Year Study on AI and the efforts of the Partnership on AI Peter Stone professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin and chair of the first study panel of the One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence AI100 responded As chronicled in detail in the AI100 report I believe that there are both significant opportunities and significant challenges risks when it comes to incorporating AI technologies into various aspects of everyday life With carefully crafted industry specific policies and responsible use I believe that the potential benefits outweigh the risks But the risks are not to be taken lightly Anita Salem systems research and design principal at SalemSystems warned of a possible dystopian outcome Human machine interaction will result in increasing precision and decreasing human relevance unless specific efforts are made to design in humanness For instance AI in the medical field will aid more precise diagnosis will increase surgical precision and will increase evidence based analytics If designed correctly these systems will allow the humans to do what they do best provide empathy use experience based intuition and utilize touch and connection as a source of healing If human needs are left out of the design process we ll see a world where humans are increasingly irrelevant and more easily manipulated We could see increasing under employment leading to larger wage gaps greater poverty and homelessness and increasing political alienation We ll see fewer opportunities for meaningful work which will result in increasing drug and mental health problems and the further erosion of the family support system Without explicit efforts to humanize AI design we ll see a population that is needed for purchasing but not creating This population will need to be controlled and AI will provide the means for this control law enforcement by drones opinion manipulation by bots cultural homogeny through synchronized messaging election systems optimized from big data and a geopolitical system dominated by corporations that have benefited from increasing efficiency and lower operating costs Chris Newman principal engineer at Oracle commented As it becomes more difficult for humans to understand how AI tech works it will become harder to resolve inevitable problems A better outcome is possible with a hard push by engineers and consumers toward elegance and simplicity e g Steve Jobs era Apple A research scientist based in North America wrote The wheels of legislation which is a primary mechanism to ensure benefits are distributed throughout society move slowly While the benefits of AI automation will accrue very quickly for the 1 it will take longer for the rest of the populace to feel any benefits and that s ONLY if our representative leaders DELIBERATELY enact STRONG social and fiscal policy For example AI will save billions in labor costs and also cut the bargaining power of labor in negotiations with capital Any company using AI technologies should be heavily taxed with that money going into strong social welfare programs like job retraining and federal jobs programs For another example any publicly funded AI research should be prevented from being privatized The public ought to see the reward from its own investments Don t let AI follow the pattern of Big Pharma s exploitation of the public permitted Bayh Dole Act Ken Birman a professor in the department of computer science at Cornell University responded By 2030 I believe that our homes and offices will have evolved to support app like functionality much like the iPhone in my pocket People will customize their living and working spaces and different app suites will support different lifestyles or special needs For example think of a young couple with children a group of students sharing a home or an elderly person who is somewhat frail Each would need different forms of support This applications perspective is broad and very flexible But we also need to ensure that privacy and security are strongly protected by the future environment I do want my devices and apps linked on my behalf but I don t ever want to be continuously spied upon I do think this is feasible and as it occurs we will benefit in myriad ways Martin Geddes a consultant specializing in telecommunications strategies said The unexpected impact of AI will be to automate many of our interactions with systems where we give consent and to enable a wider range of outcomes to be negotiated without our involvement This requires a new presentation layer for the augmented reality metaverse with a new browser the Guardian Avatar that helps to protect our identity and our interests Lindsey Andersen an activist at the intersection of human rights and technology for Freedom House and Internews now doing graduate research at Princeton University commented Already there is an overreliance on AI to make consequential decisions that affect people s lives We have rushed to use AI to decide everything from what content we see on social media to assigning credit scores to determining how long a sentence a defendant should serve While often well intentioned these uses of AI are rife with ethical and human rights issues from perpetuating racial bias to violating our rights to privacy and free expression If we have not dealt with these problems through smart regulation consumer buyer education and establishment of norms across the AI industry we could be looking at a vastly more unfair polarized and surveilled world in 2030 Yeseul Kim a designer for a major South Korean search firm wrote The prosperity generated by and the benefits of AI will promote the quality of living for most people only when its ethical implications and social impacts are widely discussed and shared inside the human society and only when pertinent regulations and legislation can be set up to mitigate the misconduct that can be brought about as the result of AI advancement If these conditions are met computers and machines can process data at unprecedented speed and at an unrivaled precision level and this will improve the quality of life especially in medical and healthcare sectors It has already been proven and widely shared among medical expert groups that doctors perform better in detecting diseases when they work with AI Robotics for surgery is also progressing so this will also benefit the patients as they can assist human surgeons who inevitably face physical limits when they conduct surgeries Mark Maben a general manager at Seton Hall University wrote The AI revolution is sadly likely to be dystopian At present governmental educational civic religious and corporate institutions are ill prepared to handle the massive economic and social disruption that will be caused by AI I have no doubt that advances in AI will enhance human capacities and empower some individuals but this will be more than offset by the fact that artificial intelligence and associated technological advances will mean far fewer jobs in the future Sooner than most individuals and societies realize AI and automation will eliminate the need for retail workers truck drivers lawyers surgeons factory workers and other professions In order to ensure that the human spirit thrives in a world run and ruled by AI we will need to change the current concept of work That is an enormous task for a global economic system in which most social and economic benefits come from holding a traditional job We are already seeing a decline in democratic institutions and a rise in authoritarianism due to economic inequality and the changing nature of work If we do not start planning now for the day when AI results in complete disruption of employment the strain is likely to result in political instability violence and despair This can be avoided by policies that provide for basic human needs and encourage a new definition of work but the behavior to date by politicians governments corporations and economic elites gives me little confidence in their ability to lead us through this transition Eduardo Vendrell a computer science professor at the Polytechnic University of Valencia in Spain responded These advances will have a noticeable impact on our privacy since the basis for this application is focused on the information we generate with the use of different technologies It will be necessary to regulate in a decisive way the access to the information and its use Yoram Kalman an associate professor at the Open University of Israel and member of The Center for Internet Research at the University of Haifa wrote The main risk is when communication and analysis technologies are used to control others to manipulate them or to take advantage of them These risks are ever present and can be mitigated through societal awareness and education and through regulation that identifies entities that become very powerful thanks to a specific technology or technologies and which use that power to further strengthen themselves Such entities be they commercial political national military religious or any other have in the past tried and succeeded in leveraging technologies against the general societal good and that is an ever present risk of any powerful innovation This risk should make us vigilant but should not keep us from realizing one of the most basic humans urges the strive to constantly improve the human condition Sam Gregory director of WITNESS and digital human rights activist responded We should assume all AI systems for surveillance and population control and manipulation will be disproportionately used and inadequately controlled by authoritarian and non democratic governments These governments and democratic governments will continue to pressure platforms to use AI to monitor for content and this monitoring in and of itself will contribute to the data set for personalization and for surveillance and manipulation To fight back against this dark future we need to get the right combination of attention to legislation and platform self governance right now and we need to think about media literacy to understand AI generated synthetic media and targeting We should also be cautious about how much we encourage the use of AI as a solution to managing content online and as a solution to for example managing hate speech Jonathan Kolber futurist wrote My fear is that by generating AIs that can learn new tasks faster and more reliably than people can do the future economy will have only evanescent opportunities for most people My hope is that we will begin implementing a sustainable and viable universal basic income and in particular Michael Haines MUBI proposal To my knowledge the only such proposal that is sustainable and can be implemented in any country at any time I have offered a critique of alternatives Given that people may no longer need depend on their competitive earning power in 2030 AI will empower a far better world If however we fail to implement a market oriented universal basic income or something equally effective vast multitudes will become unemployed and unemployable without means to support themselves That is a recipe for societal disaster Walid Al Saqaf senior lecturer at S dert rn University member of the board of trustees of the Internet Society ISOC and vice president of the ISOC Blockchain Special Interest Group commented The challenge is to ensure that the data used for AI procedures is reliable This entails the need for strong cyber security and data integrity The latter I believe can be tremendously enhanced by distributed ledger technologies such as blockchain I foresee mostly positive results from AI so long as there is enough guards to protect from automated execution of tasks in areas that may have ethical considerations such as taking decisions that may have life or death implications AI has a lot of potential It should be used to add to and not replace human intellect and judgement Danny O Brien international director for a nonprofit digital rights group commented I m generally optimistic about the ability of humans to direct technology for the benefit of themselves and others I anticipate human machine collaboration to take place at an individual level with tools and abilities that enhance our own judgment and actions rather than this being a power restricted to a few actors So for instance if we use facial recognition or predictive tools it will be under the control of an end user transparent and limited to personal use This may require regulation internal coding restraints or a balance being struck between user capabilities But I m hopeful we can get there Fernando Barrio director of the law program at the Universidad Nacional de R o Negro in Argentina commented The interaction between humans and networked AI could lead to a better future for a big percentage of the population In order to do so efforts need to be directed not only at increasing AI development and capabilities but also at positive policies to increase the availability and inclusiveness of those technologies The challenge is not technical it is sociopolitical Paul Jones professor of information science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill responded AI as we know it in 2018 is just beginning to understand itself Like HAL it will have matured by 2030 into an understanding of its post adolescent self and of its relationship to humans and to the world But also humans will have matured in our relationship to AI Like all adolescent relationships there will have been risk taking and regrets and hopefully reconciliation Language was our first link to other intelligences then books then the internet each a more intimate conversation than the one before AI will become our link adviser and to some extent our wise loving companion Jean Claude Heudin a professor with expertise in AI and software engineering at the De Vinci Research Center at Pole Universitaire Leonard de Vinci in France wrote Natural intelligence and artificial intelligence are complementary We need all of the possible intelligence possible for solving the problems yet to come More intelligence is always better Bryan Alexander futurist and president of Bryan Alexander Consulting responded I hope we will structure AI to enhance our creativity to boost our learning to expand our relationships worldwide to make us physically safer and to remove some drudgery But some have concerns that the setting of policy could do some damage Scott Burleigh software engineer and intergalactic internet pioneer wrote Advances in technology itself including AI always increase our ability to change the circumstances of reality in ways that improve our lives It also always introduces possible side effects that can make us worse off than we were before Those effects are realized when the policies we devise for using the new technologies are unwise I don t worry about technology I worry about stupid policy I worry about it a lot but I am guardedly optimistic in most cases I think we eventually end up with tolerable policies Jeff Jarvis director of the Tow Knight Center at City University of New York s Craig Newmark School of Journalism commented What worries me most is worry itself An emerging moral panic that will cut off the benefits of this technology for fear of what could be done with it What I fear most is an effort to control not just technology and data but knowledge itself prescribing what information can be used for before we know what those uses could be I could substitute book for AI and the year 1485 or maybe 1550 for 2030 in your question and it d hold fairly true Some thought it would be good some bad both end up right We will figure this out We always have Sure after the book there were wars and other profound disturbances But in the end humans figure out how to exploit technologies to their advantage and control them for their safety I d call that a law of society The same will be true of AI Some will misuse it of course and that is the time to identify limits to place on its use not speculatively before Many more will use it to find economic societal educational and cultural benefit and we need to give them the freedom to do so Some respondents said no matter how society comes together to troubleshoot AI concerns there will still be problems Dave Gusto professor of political science and co director of the Consortium for Science Policy Outcomes at Arizona State University said The question asked about most people Most people in the world live a life that is not well regarded by technology technology developers and AI I don t see that changing much in the next dozen years A longtime Silicon Valley communications professional who has worked at several of the top tech companies over the past few decades responded AI will continue to improve if quality human input is behind it If so better AI will support service industries at the top of the funnel leaving humans to handle interpretation decisions and applied knowledge Medical data gathering for earlier diagnostics comes to mind Smarter job search processes environmental data collection for climate change actions these applications all come to mind Hari Shanker Sharma an expert in nanotechnology and neurobiology at Uppsala University in Sweden said AI has not yet peaked hence growth will continue but evil also uses such developments That will bring bigger dangers to mankind The need will be to balance growth with safety e g social media is good and bad The ways to protect from evil mongers are not sufficient Tracing an attacker evil monger in a global village to control and punish is the need AI will give birth to an artificial human being who could be an angel or a devil Plan for countering evil at every development stage A changemaker working for digital accessibility wrote There is no reason to assume some undefined force will be able to correct for or ameliorate the damage of human nature amplified with power centralizing technologies There is no indication that governments will be able to counterbalance power centralization trends as governments too take advantage of such market failures The outward dressing of such interactions is probably the least important aspect of it An information science futurist commented I fear that powerful business interests will continue to put profits above all else closing their eyes to the second and third order effects of their decisions I fear that we do not have the political will to protect and promote the common interests of citizens and democracy I fear that our technological tools are advancing more quickly than our ability to manage them wisely I have however recently spotted new job openings with titles like Director of Research Policy and Ethics in AI and Architect AI Ethical Practice at major software companies There are reasons for hope The following one liners from anonymous respondents also tie into this theme Other anonymous respondents commented A share of these experts suggest the creation of policies regulations or ethical and operational standards should shift corporate and government priorities to focus on the global advancement of humanity rather than profits or nationalism They urge that major organizations revamp their practices and make sure AI advances are aimed at human augmentation for all regardless of economic class Evan Selinger professor of philosophy at the Rochester Institute of Technology commented In order for people in general to be better off as AI advances through 2030 a progressive political agenda one rooted in the protection of civil liberties and human rights and also conscientious of the dangers of widening social and economic inequalities would have to play a stronger role in governance In light of current events it s hard to be optimistic that such an agenda will have the resources necessary to keep pace with transformative uses of AI throughout ever increasing aspects of society To course correct in time it s necessary for the general public to develop a deep appreciation about why leading ideologies concerning the market prosperity and security are not in line with human flourishing Nicholas Beale leader of the strategy practice at Sciteb an international strategy and search firm commented All depends on how responsibly AI is applied AI done right will empower But unless Western CEOs improve their ethics it won t I m hoping for the best Benjamin Shestakofsky an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania specializing in digital technology s impacts on work said Policymakers should act to ensure that citizens have access to knowledge about the effects of AI systems that affect their life chances and a voice in algorithmic governance The answer to this question will depend on choices made by citizens workers organizational leaders and legislators across a broad range of social domains For example algorithmic hiring systems can be programmed to prioritize efficient outcomes for organizations or fair outcomes for workers The profits produced by technological advancement can be broadly shared or can be captured by the shareholders of a small number of high tech firms Charles Zheng a researcher into machine learning and AI with the National Institute of Mental Health wrote To ensure the best future politicians must be informed of the benefits and risks of AI and pass laws to regulate the industry and to encourage open AI research My hope is that AI algorithms advance significantly in their ability to understand natural language and also in their ability to model humans and understand human values My fear is that the benefits of AI are restricted to the rich and powerful without being accessible to the general public Mary Chayko author of Superconnected The Internet Digital Media and Techno Social Life said We will see regulatory oversight of AI geared toward the protection of those who use it Having said that people will need to remain educated as to AI s impacts on them and to mobilize as needed to limit the power of companies and governments to intrude on their spaces lives and civil rights It will take vigilance and hard work to accomplish this but I feel strongly that we are up to the task R Ray Wang founder and principal analyst at Constellation Research based in Silicon Valley said We have not put the controls of AI in the hands of many In fact the experience in China has shown how this technology can be used to take away the freedoms and rights of the individual for the purposes of security efficiency expediency and whims of the state On the commercial side we also do not have any controls in play as to ethical AI Five elements should be included transparency explainability reversibility coachability and human led processes in the design John Willinsky professor and director of the Public Knowledge Project at Stanford Graduate School of Education said Uses of AI that reduce human autonomy and freedom will need to be carefully weighed against the gains in other qualities of human life e g driverless cars that improve traffic and increase safety By 2030 deliberations over such matters will be critical to the functioning of human machine AI collaboration My hope however is that these deliberations are not framed as collaborations between what is human and what is AI but will be seen as the human use of yet another technology with the wisdom of such use open to ongoing human consideration and intervention intent on advancing that sense of what is most humane about us A professor of media studies at a U S university commented Technology will be a material expression of social policy If that social policy is enacted through a justice oriented democratic process then it has a better chance of producing justice oriented outcomes If it is enacted solely by venture funded corporations with no obligation to the public interest most people in 2030 will likely be worse off Gene Crick director of the Metropolitan Austin Interactive Network and longtime community telecommunications expert wrote To predict AI will benefit most people is more hopeful than certain AI can benefit lives at work and home if competing agendas can be balanced Key support for this important goal could be technology professionals acceptance and commitment regarding social and ethical responsibilities of our work Anthony Picciano a professor of education at the City of New York University s Interactive Technology and Pedagogy program responded I am concerned that profit motives will lead some companies and individuals to develop AI applications that will threaten not necessarily improve our way of life In the next 10 years we will see evolutionary progress in the development of artificial intelligence After 2030 we will likely see revolutionary developments that will have significant ramifications on many aspects of human endeavor We will need to develop checks on artificial intelligence Bill Woodcock executive director at Packet Clearing House the research organization behind global network development commented In short term pragmatic ways learning algorithms will save people time by automating much of tasks like navigation and package delivery and shopping for staples But that tactical win comes at a strategic loss as long as the primary application of AI is to extract more money from people because that puts them in opposition to our interests as a species helping to enrich a few people at the expense of everyone else In AI that exploits human psychological weaknesses to sell us things we have for the first time created something that effectively predates our own species That s a fundamentally bad idea and requires regulation just as surely as would self replicating biological weapons Ethem Alpaydin a professor of computer engineering at Bogazici University in Istanbul responded AI will favor the developed countries that actually develop these technologies AI will help find cures for various diseases and overall improve the living conditions in various ways For the developing countries however whose labor force is mostly unskilled and whose exports are largely low tech AI implies higher unemployment lower income and more social unrest The aim of AI in such countries should be to add skill to the labor force rather than supplant them For example automatic real time translation systems e g Google s Babel fish would allow people who don t speak a foreign language to find work in the tourism industry Joe Whittaker a former professor of sciences and associate director of the NASA GESTAR program now associate provost at Jackson State University said Actions should be taken to make the internet universally available and accessible provide the training and know how for all users John Paschoud councilor for the London borough of Lewisham said It is possible that advances in AI and networked information will benefit most people but this is highly dependent upon on how those benefits are shared If traditional capitalist models of ownership of the means of production prevail then benefits of automated production will be retained by the few who own not the many who work Similarly models of housing health care etc can be equitably distributed and can all be enhanced by technology David Schlangen a professor of applied computational linguistics at Bielefeld University in Germany responded If the right regulations are put in place and ad based revenue models can be controlled in such a way that they cannot be exploited by political interest groups the potential for AI based information search and decision support is enormous That s a big if but I prefer to remain optimistic Kate Carruthers a chief data and analytics officer based in Australia predicted Humans will increasingly interact with AI on a constant basis and it will become hard to know where the boundaries are between the two Just as kids now see their mobile phones as an extension of themselves so too will human AI integration be I fear that the cause of democracy and freedom will be lost by 2030 so it might be a darker future To avoid that one thing we need to do is ensure the development of ethical standards for the development of AI and ensure that we deal with algorithmic bias We need to build ethics into our development processes Further I assume that tracking and monitoring of people will be an accepted part of life and that there will be stronger regulation on privacy and data security Every facet of life will be circumscribed by AI and it will be part of the fabric of our lives David Zubrow associate director of empirical research at Carnegie Mellon University s Software Engineering Institute said How the advances are used demands wisdom leadership and social norms and values that respect and focus on making the world better for all education and health care will reach remote and underserved areas for instance The fear is control is consolidated in the hands of few that seek to exploit people nature and technology for their own gain I am hopeful that this will not happen Francisco S Melo an associate professor of computer science at Instituto Superior T cnico in Lisbon Portugal responded I expect that AI technology will contribute to render several services in health assisted living etc more efficient and humane and by making access to information more broadly available contribute to mitigate inequalities in society However in order for positive visions to become a reality both AI researchers and the general population should be aware of the implications that such technology can have particularly in how information is used and the ways by which it can be manipulated In particular AI researchers should strive for transparency in their work in order to demystify AI and minimize the possibility of misuse the general public on the other hand should strive to be educated in the responsible and informed use of technology Kyung Sin Park internet law expert and co founder of Open Net Korea responded AI consists of software and training data Software is already being made available on an open source basis What will decide AI s contribution to humanity will be whether data used for training AI will be equitably distributed Data protection laws and the open data movement will hopefully do the job of making more data available equally to all people I imagine a future where people can access AI driven diagnosis of symptoms which will drastically reduce health care costs for all Doug Schepers chief technologist at Fizz Studio said AI ML in applications and in autonomous devices and vehicles will make some jobs obsolete and the resulting unemployment will cause some economic instability that impacts society as a whole but most individuals will be better off The social impact of software and networked systems will get increasingly complex so ameliorating that software problem with software agents may be the only way to decrease harm to human lives but only if we can focus the goal of software to benefit individuals and groups rather than companies or industries Erik Huesca president of the Knowledge and Digital Culture Foundation based in Mexico City said There is a concentration of places where specific AI is developed It is a consequence of the capital investment that seeks to replace expensive professionals Universities have to rethink what type of graduates to prepare especially in areas of health legal and engineering where the greatest impact is expected since the labor displacement of doctors engineers and lawyers is a reality with the incipient developed systems Stephen Abram principal at Lighthouse Consulting Inc wrote I am concerned that individual agency is lost in AI and that appropriate safeguards should be in place around data collection as specified by the individual I worry that context can be misconstrued by government agencies like ICE IRS police etc There is a major conversation needed throughout the time during which AI applications are developed and they need to be evergreen as innovation and creativity spark new developments Indeed this should not be part of a political process but an academic independent process guided by principles and not economics and commercial entities David Klann consultant and software developer at Broadcast Tool Die responded AI and related technologies will continue to enhance peoples lives I tend toward optimism I instinctively believe there are enough activists who care about the ethics of AI that the technology will be put to use solving problems that humans cannot solve on their own Take mapping for instance I recently learned about congestion problems caused by directions being optimized for individuals People are now tweaking the algorithms to account for multiple people taking the most efficient route that had become congested and was causing neighborhood disturbance due to the increased traffic I believe people will construct AI algorithms to learn of and to think ahead about such unintended consequences and to avoid them before they become problems Of course my fear is that money interests will continue to wield an overwhelming influence over AI and machine learning ML These can be mitigated through fully disclosed techniques transparency and third party oversight These third parties may be government institutions or non government organizations with the strength to enforce ethical use of the technologies Open source code and open ML training data will contribute significantly to this mitigation Andrian Kreye a journalist and documentary filmmaker based in Germany said If humanity is willing to learn from its mistakes with low level AIs like social media algorithms there might be a chance for AI to become an engine for equality and progress Since most digital development is driven by venture capital experience shows that automation and abuse will be the norm Mai Sugimoto an associate professor of sociology at Kansai University in Japan responded AI could amplify one s bias and prejudice We have to make data unbiased before putting it into AI but it s not very easy An anonymous respondent wrote There are clearly advances associated with AI but the current global political climate gives no indication that technological advancement in any area will improve most lives in the future We also need to think ecologically in terms of the interrelationship between technology and other social change events For example medical technology has increased lifespans but the current opioid crisis has taken many lives in the U S among certain demographics A founder and president said The future of AI is more about the policies we choose and the projects we choose to fund I think there will be large corporate interests in AI that serve nothing but profits and corporations interests This is the force for the bad However I also believe that most technologists want to do good and that most people want to head in a direction for the common good In the end I think this force will win out A senior strategist in regulatory systems and economics for a top global telecommunications firm wrote If we do not strive to improve society making the weakest better off the whole system may collapse So AI had better serve to make life easier for everyone What will human technology co evolution look like by 2030 Participants in this canvassing expect the rate of change to fall in a range anywhere from incremental to extremely impactful Generally they expect AI to continue to be targeted toward efficiencies in workplaces and other activities and they say it is likely to be embedded in most human endeavors The greatest share of participants in this canvassing said automated systems driven by artificial intelligence are already improving many dimensions of their work play and home lives and they expect this to continue over the next decade While they worry over the accompanying negatives of human AI advances they hope for broad changes for the better as networked intelligent systems are revolutionizing everything from the most pressing professional work to hundreds of the little everyday aspects of existence One respondent s answer covered many of the improvements experts expect as machines sit alongside humans as their assistants and enhancers An associate professor at a major university in Israel wrote In the coming 12 years AI will enable all sorts of professions to do their work more efficiently especially those involving saving life individualized medicine policing even warfare where attacks will focus on disabling infrastructure and less in killing enemy combatants and civilians In other professions AI will enable greater individualization e g education based on the needs and intellectual abilities of each pupil student Of course there will be some downsides greater unemployment in certain rote jobs e g transportation drivers food service robots and automation etc This section begins with experts sharing mostly positive expectations for the evolution of humans and AI It is followed by separate sections that include their thoughts about the potential for AI human partnerships and quality of life in 2030 as well as the future of jobs health care and education Many of the leading experts extolled the positives they expect to continue to expand as AI tools evolve to do more things for more people Martijn van Otterlo author of Gatekeeping Algorithms with Human Ethical Bias and assistant professor of artificial intelligence at Tilburg University in the Netherlands wrote Even though I see many ethical issues potential problems and especially power imbalance misuse issues with AI not even starting about singularity issues and out of control AI I do think AI will change most lives for the better especially looking at the short horizon of 2030 even more so because even bad effects of AI can be considered predominantly good by the majority of people For example the Cambridge Analytica case has shown us the huge privacy issues of modern social networks in a market economy but overall people value the extraordinary services Facebook offers to improve communication opportunities sharing capabilities and so on Vint Cerf Internet Hall of Fame member and vice president and chief internet evangelist at Google said I see AI and machine learning as augmenting human cognition a la Douglas Engelbart There will be abuses and bugs some harmful so we need to be thoughtful about how these technologies are implemented and used but on the whole I see these as constructive M che l Foghl engineering director and DevOps Code Pillar at Google s Munich office said The trend is that AI ML models in specific domains can out perform human experts e g certain cancer diagnoses based on image recognition in retina scans I think it would be fairly much the consensus that this trend would continue and many more such systems could aid human experts to be more accurate Craig Mathias principal at Farpoint Group an advisory firm specializing in wireless networking and mobile computing commented Many if not most of the large scale technologies that we all depend upon such as the internet itself the power grid and roads and highways will simply be unable to function in the future without AI as both solution complexity and demand continue to increase Matt Mason a roboticist and the former director of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University wrote AI will present new opportunities and capabilities to improve the human experience While it is possible for a society to behave irrationally and choose to use it to their detriment I see no reason to think that is the more likely outcome Mike Osswald vice president of experience innovation at Hanson Inc commented I m thinking of a world in which people s devices continuously assess the world around them to keep a population safer and healthier Thinking of those living in large urban areas with devices forming a network of AI input through sound analysis air quality natural events etc that can provide collective notifications and insight to everyone in a certain area about the concerns of environmental factors physical health even helping provide no quarter for bad actors through community policing Barry Hughes senior scientist at the Center for International Futures at the University of Denver commented I was one of the original test users of the ARPANET and now can hardly imagine living without the internet Although AI will be disruptive through 2030 and beyond meaning that there will be losers in the workplace and growing reasons for concern about privacy and AI cyber related crime on the whole I expect that individuals and societies will make choices on use and restriction of use that benefit us Examples include likely self driving vehicles at that time when my wife s deteriorating vision and that of an increased elderly population will make it increasingly liberating I would expect rapid growth in use for informal non traditional education as well as some more ambivalent growth in the formal education sector Big data applications in health related research should be increasingly productive and health care delivery should benefit Transparency with respect to its character and use including its developers and their personal benefits is especially important in limiting the inevitable abuse Dana Klisanin psychologist futurist and game designer predicted People will increasingly realize the importance of interacting with each other and the natural world and they will program AI to support such goals which will in turn support the ongoing emergence of the slow movement For example grocery shopping and mundane chores will be allocated to AI smart appliances freeing up time for preparation of meals in keeping with the slow food movement Concern for the environment will likewise encourage the growth of the slow goods slow fashion movement The ability to recycle reduce reuse will be enhanced by the use of in home 3D printers giving rise to a new type of craft that is supported by AI AI will support the cradle to grave movement by making it easier for people to trace the manufacturing process from inception to final product Liz Rykert president at Meta Strategies a consultancy that works with technology and complex organizational change responded The key for networked AI will be the ability to diffuse equitable responses to basic care and data collection If bias remains in the programming it will be a big problem I believe we will be able to develop systems that will learn from and reflect a much broader and more diverse population than the systems we have now Michael R Nelson a technology policy expert for a leading network services provider who worked as a technology policy aide in the Clinton administration commented Most media reports focus on how machine learning will directly affect people medical diagnosis self driving cars etc but we will see big improvements in infrastructure traffic sewage treatment supply chain etc Gary Arlen president of Arlen Communications wrote After the initial frenzy recedes about specific AI applications such as autonomous vehicles workplace robotics transaction processing health diagnoses and entertainment selections specific applications will develop probably in areas barely being considered today As with many new technologies the benefits will not apply equally potentially expanding the haves and have nots dichotomy In addition as AI delves into new fields including creative work such as design music art composition we may see new legal challenges about illegal appropriation of intellectual property via machine learning However the new legal tasks from such litigation may not need a conventional lawyer but could be handled by AI itself Professional health care AI poses another type of dichotomy For patients AI could be a bonanza identifying ailments often in early stages based on early symptoms and recommending treatments At the same time such automated tasks could impact employment for medical professionals And again there are legal challenges to be determined such as liability in the case of a wrong action by the AI Overall there is no such thing as most people but many individuals and groups especially in professional situations WILL live better lives thanks to AI albeit with some severe adjustment pains Tim Morgan a respondent who provided no identifying details said Algorithmic machine learning will be our intelligence amplifier exhaustively exploring data and designs in ways humans alone cannot The world was shocked when IBM s Deep Blue computer beat Garry Kasparov in 1997 What emerged later was the realization that human and AI centaurs could combine to beat anyone human or AI The synthesis is more than the sum of the parts Marshall Kirkpatrick product director of influencer marketing responded If the network can be both decentralized and imbued with empathy rather than characterized by violent exploitation then we re safe I expect it will land in between hopefully leaning toward the positive For example I expect our understanding of self and freedom will be greatly impacted by an instrumentation of a large part of memory through personal logs and our data exhaust being recognized as valuable just like when we shed the term junk DNA Networked AI will bring us new insights into our own lives that might seem as far fetched today as it would have been 30 years ago to say I ll tell you what music your friends are discovering right now AI is most likely to augment humanity for the better but it will take longer and not be done as well as it could be Hopefully we ll build it in a way that will help us be comparably understanding to others Daniel A Menasce professor of computer science at George Mason University commented AI and related technologies coupled with significant advances in computer power and decreasing costs will allow specialists in a variety of disciplines to perform more efficiently and will allow non specialists to use computer systems to augment their skills Some examples include health delivery smart cities and smart buildings For these applications to become reality easy to use user interfaces or better yet transparent user interfaces will have to be developed David Wells chief financial officer at Netflix at the time he responded to this study responded Technology progression and advancement has always been met with fear and anxiety giving way to tremendous gains for humankind as we learn to enhance the best of the changes and adapt and alter the worst Continued networked AI will be no different but the pace of technological change has increased which is different and requires us to more quickly adapt This pace is different and presents challenges for some human groups and societies that we will need to acknowledge and work through to avoid marginalization and political conflict But the gains from better education medical care and crime reduction will be well worth the challenges Rik Farrow editor of login for the USENIX association wrote Humans do poorly when it comes to making decisions based on facts rather than emotional issues Humans get distracted easily There are certainly things that AI can do better than humans like driving cars handling finances even diagnosing illnesses Expecting human doctors to know everything about the varieties of disease and humans is silly Let computers do what they are good at Steve Crocker CEO and co founder of Shinkuro Inc and Internet Hall of Fame member responded AI and human machine interaction has been under vigorous development for the past 50 years The advances have been enormous The results are marbled through all of our products and systems Graphics speech and language understanding are now taken for granted Encyclopedic knowledge is available at our fingertips Instant communication with anyone anywhere exists for about half the world at minimal cost The effects on productivity lifestyle and reduction of risks both natural and man made have been extraordinary and will continue As with any technology there are opportunities for abuse but the challenges for the next decade or so are not significantly different from the challenges mankind has faced in the past Perhaps the largest existential threat has been the potential for nuclear holocaust In comparison the concerns about AI are significantly less James Kadtke expert on converging technologies at the Institute for National Strategic Studies at the U S National Defense University wrote Barring the deployment of a few different radically new technologies such as general AI or commercial quantum computers the internet and AI between now and 2030 will proceed on an evolutionary trajectory Expect internet access and sophistication to be considerably greater but not radically different and also expect that malicious actors using the internet will have greater sophistication and power Whether we can control both these trends for positive outcomes is a public policy issue more than a technological one Tim Morgan a respondent who provided no identifying details said Human AI collaboration over the next 12 years will improve the overall quality of life by finding new approaches to persistent problems We will use these adaptive algorithmic tools to explore whole new domains in every industry and field of study materials science biotech medicine agriculture engineering energy transportation and more This goes beyond computability into human relationships AIs are beginning to understand and speak the human language of emotion The potential of affective computing ranges from productivity increasing adaptive interfaces to pre crime security monitoring of airports and other gathering places to companion pets which monitor their aging owners and interact with them in ways that improve their health and disposition Will there be unseen dangers or consequences Definitely That is our pattern with our tools We invent them use them to improve our lives and then refine them when we find problems AI is no different Ashok Goel director of the human centered computing Ph D program at Georgia Tech wrote Human AI interaction will be multimodal We will directly converse with AIs for example However much of the impact of AI will come in enhancing human human interaction across both space we will be networked with others and time we will have access to all our previously acquired knowledge This will aid augment and amplify individual and collective human intelligence in unprecedented and powerful ways David Cake an leader with Electronic Frontiers Australia and vice chair of the ICANN GNSO Council wrote In general machine learning and related technologies have the capacity to greatly reduce human error in many areas where it is currently very problematic and make available good appropriately tailored advice to people to whom it is currently unavailable in literally almost every field of human endeavour Fred Baker an independent networking technologies consultant longtime leader in the Internet Engineering Task Force and engineering fellow with Cisco commented In my opinion developments have not been out of control in the sense that the creation of Terminator s Skynet or the HAL 9000 computer might depict them Rather we have learned to automate processes in which neural networks have been able to follow data to its conclusion which we call big data unaided and uncontaminated by human intuition and sometimes the results have surprised us These remain and in my opinion will remain to be interpreted by human beings and used for our purposes Bob Frankston software innovation pioneer and technologist based in North America wrote It could go either way AI could be a bureaucratic straitjacket and tool of surveillance I m betting that machine learning will be like the X ray in giving us the ability to see new wholes and gain insights Perry Hewitt a marketing content and technology executive wrote Today voice activated technologies are an untamed beast in our homes Some 16 of Americans have a smart speaker and yet they are relatively dumb devices They misinterpret questions offer generic answers and to the consternation of some are turning our kids into a holes I am bullish on human machine interactions developing a better understanding of and improving our daily routines I think in particular of the working parent often although certainly not exclusively a woman who carries so much information in their head What if a human machine collaboration could stock the house with essentials schedule the pre camp pediatrician appointments and prompt drivers for the alternate side parking street cleaning rules The ability for narrow AI to assimilate new information the bus is supposed to come at 7 10 but a month into the school year is known to actually come at 7 16 could keep a family connected and informed with the right data and reduce the mental load of household management John McNutt a professor in the school of public policy and administration at the University of Delaware responded Throwing out technology because there is a potential downside is not how human progress takes place In public service a turbulent environment has created a situation where knowledge overload can seriously degrade our ability to do the things that are essential to implement policies and serve the public good AI can be the difference between a public service that works well and one that creates more problems than it solves Randy Marchany chief information security officer at Virginia Tech and director of Virginia Tech s IT Security Laboratory said AI human interaction in 2030 will be in its infancy stage AI will need to go to school in a manner similar to humans They will amass large amounts of data collected by various sources but need ethics training to make good decisions Just as kids are taught a wide variety of info and some sort of ethics religion social manners etc AI will need similar training Will AI get the proper training Who decides the training content Robert Stratton cybersecurity expert said While there is widespread acknowledgement in a variety of disciplines of the potential benefits of machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies progress has been tempered by their misapplication Part of data science is knowing the right tool for a particular job As more rigorous practitioners begin to gain comfort and apply these tools to other corpora it s reasonable to expect some significant gains in efficiency insight or profitability in many fields This may not be visible to consumers except through increased product choice but it may include everything from drug discovery to driving A data analyst for an organization developing marketing solutions said Assuming that policies are in place to prevent the abuse of AI and programs are in place to find new jobs for those who would be career displaced there is a lot of potential in AI integration By 2030 most AI will be used for marketing purposes and be more annoying to people than anything else as they are bombarded with personalized ads and recommendations The rest of AI usage will be its integration into more tedious and repetitive tasks across career fields Implementing AI in this fashion will open up more time for humans to focus on long term and in depth tasks that will allow further and greater societal progression For example AI can be trained to identify and codify qualitative information from surveys reviews articles etc far faster and in greater quantities than even a team of humans can By having AI perform these tasks analysts can spend more time parsing the data for trends and information that can then be used to make more informed decisions faster and allow for speedier turn around times Minor product faults can be addressed before they become widespread scientists can generate semiannual reports on environmental changes rather than annual or biannual Helena Draganik a professor at the University of Gdansk in Poland responded AI will not change humans It will change the relations between them because it can serve as an interpreter of communication It will change our habits as an intermediation technology AI will be a great commodity It will help in cases of health problems diseases It will also generate a great data industry big data market and a lack of anonymity and privacy Humanity will more and more depend on energy electricity These factors will create new social cultural security and political problems There are those who think there won t be much change by 2030 Christine Boese digital strategies professional commented I believe it is as William Gibson postulated The future is already here it just not very evenly distributed What I know from my work in user experience design and in exposure to many different Fortune 500 IT departments working in big data and analytics is that the promise and potential of AI and machine learning is VASTLY overstated There has been so little investment in basic infrastructure entire chunks of our systems won t even be interoperable The AI and machine learning code will be there in a pocket here a pocket there but system wide it is unlikely to be operating reliably as part of the background radiation against which many of us play and work online An anonymous respondent wrote While various deployments of new data science and computation will help firms cut costs reduce fraud and support decision making that involves access to more information than an individual can manage organisations professions markets and regulators public and private usually take many more than 12 years to adapt effectively to a constantly changing set of technologies and practices This generally causes a decline in service quality insecurity over jobs and investments new monopoly businesses distorting markets and social values etc For example many organisations will be under pressure to buy and implement new services but unable to access reliable market information on how to do this leading to bad investments distractions from core business and labour and customer disputes Mario Morino chairman of the Morino Institute and co founder of Venture Philanthropy Partners commented While I believe AI ML will bring enormous benefits it may take us several decades to navigate through the disruption and transition they will introduce on multiple levels Daniel Berninger an internet pioneer who led the first VoIP deployments at Verizon HP and NASA currently founder at Voice Communication Exchange Committee VCXC said The luminaries claiming artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence and promoting robot reverence imagine exponentially improving computation pushes machine self actualization from science fiction into reality The immense valuations awarded Google Facebook Amazon Tesla et al rely on this machine dominance hype to sell infinite scaling As with all hype pretending reality does not exist does not make reality go away Moore s Law does not concede the future to machines because human domination of the planet does not owe to computation Any road map granting machines self determination includes miracle as one of the steps You cannot turn a piece of wood into a real boy AI merely models human activity No amount of improvement in the development of these models turns the model into the thing Robot reverence attempts plausibility by collapsing the breadth of human potential and capacities It operates via denialism with advocates disavowing the importance of anything they cannot model In particular super AI requires pretending human will and consciousness do not exist Human beings remain the source of all intent and the judge of all outcomes Machines provide mere facilitation and mere efficiency in the journey from intent to outcome The dehumanizing nature of automation and the diseconomy of scale of human intelligence is already causing headaches that reveal another AI Winter arriving well before 2030 Paul Kainen futurist and director of the Lab for Visual Mathematics at Georgetown University commented Quantum cat here I expect complex superposition of strong positive negative and null as typical impact for AI For the grandkids sake we must be positive The following one liners from anonymous respondents also tie into AI in 2030 Other anonymous respondents commented The hopeful experts in this sample generally expect that AI will work to optimize augment and improve human activities and experiences They say it will save time and it will save lives via health advances and the reduction of risks and of poverty They expect it will spur innovation and broaden opportunities increase the value of human to human experiences augment humans and increase individuals overall satisfaction with life Clay Shirky writer and consultant on the social and economic effects of internet technologies and vice president at New York University said All previous forms of labor saving devices from the level to the computer have correlated with increased health and lifespan in the places that have adopted them Jamais Cascio research fellow at the Institute for the Future wrote Although I do believe that in 2030 AI will have made our lives better I suspect that popular media of the time will justifiably highlight the large scale problems displaced workers embedded bias and human systems being too deferential to machine systems But AI is more than robot soldiers autonomous cars or digital assistants with quirky personalities Most of the AI we will encounter in 2030 will be in the walls behind the scenes systems built to adapt workspaces living spaces and the urban environment to better suit our needs Medical AI will keep track of medication and alert us to early signs of health problems Environmental AI will monitor air quality heat index and other indicators relevant to our day s tasks Our visual and audio surroundings may be altered or filtered to improve our moods better our focus or otherwise alter our subconscious perceptions of the world Most of this AI will be functionally invisible to us as long as it s working properly The explicit human machine interface will be with a supervisor system that coordinates all of the sub AI and undoubtedly there will be a lively business in creating supervisor systems with quirky personalities Mike Meyer chief information officer at Honolulu Community College wrote Social organizations will be increasingly administered by AI ML systems to ensure equity and consistency in provisioning of services to the population The steady removal of human emotion driven discrimination will rebalance social organizations creating true equitable opportunity to all people for the first time in human history People will be part of these systems as censors in the old imperial Chinese model providing human emotional intelligence where that is needed to smooth social management All aspects of human existence will be affected by the integration of AI into human societies Historically this type of base paradigmatic change is both difficult and unstoppable The results will be primarily positive but will produce problems both in the process of change and in totally new types of problems that will result from the ways that people do adapt the new technology based processes Mark Crowley an assistant professor expert in machine learning and core member of the Institute for Complexity and Innovation at the University of Waterloo in Ontario Canada wrote While driving home on a long commute from work the human will be reading a book in the heads up screen of the windshield The car will be driving autonomously on the highway for the moment The driver will have an idea to note down and add to a particular document all this will be done via voice In the middle of this a complicated traffic arrangement will be seen approaching via other networked cars The AI will politely interrupt the driver put away the heads up display and warn the driver they may need to take over in the next 10 seconds or so The conversation will be flawless and natural like Jarvis in Avengers even charming But it will be tasks focused to the car personal events notes and news Theodore Gordon futurist management consultant and co founder of the Millennium Project commented There will be ups and downs surely but the net is I believe good The most encouraging uses of AI will be in early warning of terror activities incipient diseases and environmental threats and in improvements in decision making Yvette Wohn director of the Social Interaction Lab and expert on human computer interaction at the New Jersey Institute of Technology said One area in which artificial intelligence will become more sophisticated will be in its ability to enrich the quality of life so that the current age of workaholism will transition into a society where leisure the arts entertainment and culture are able to enhance the well being of society in developed countries and solve issues of water production food growth distribution and basic health provision in developing countries Ken Goldberg distinguished chair in engineering director of AUTOLAB s and CITRIS people and robots initiative and founding member of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab at the University of California Berkeley said As in the past 50 years AI will be combined with IA intelligence augmentation to enhance humans ability to work One example might be an AI based Devil s Advocate that would challenge my decisions with insightful questions as long as I can turn it off periodically Rich Ling a professor of media technology at Nanyang Technological University responded The ability to address complex issues and to better respond to and facilitate the needs of people will be the dominant result of AI An anonymous respondent wrote There will be an explosive increase in the number of autonomous cognitive agents e g robots and humans will interact more and more with them being unaware most of the time if it is interactivity with a robot or with another human This will increase the number of personal assistants and the level of service Fred Davis mentor at Runway Incubator in San Francisco responded As daily a user of the Google Assistant on my phone and both Google Home and Alexa I feel like AI has already been delivering significant benefits to my daily life for a few years My wife and I take having an always on omnipresent assistant on hand for granted at this point Google Home s ability to tell us apart and even respond with different voices is a major step forward in making computers people literate rather than the other way around There s always a concern about privacy but so far it hasn t caused us any problems Obviously this could change and instead of a helpful friend I might look at these assistants as creepy strangers Maintaining strict privacy and security controls is essential for these types of services Andrew Tutt an expert in law and author of An FDA for Algorithms which called for critical thought about how best to prevent deter and compensate for the harms that they cause said AI will be absolutely pervasive and absolutely seamless in its integration with everyday life It will simply become accepted that AI are responsible for ever more complex and ever more human tasks By 2030 it will be accepted that when you wish to hail a taxi the taxi will have no driver it will be an autonomously driven vehicle Robots will be responsible for more dynamic and complex roles in manufacturing plants and warehouses Digital assistants will play an important and interactive role in everyday interactions ranging from buying a cup of coffee to booking a salon appointment It will no longer be unexpected to call a restaurant to book a reservation for example and speak to a digital assistant who will pencil you in These interactions will be incremental but become increasingly common and increasingly normal My hope is that the increasing integration of AI into everyday life will vastly increase the amount of time that people can devote to tasks they find meaningful L Schomaker professor at the University of Groningen and scientific director of the Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Engineering ALICE research institute said In the 1990s you went to a PC on a desktop in a room in your house In the 2010s you picked a phone from your pocket and switched it on By 2030 you will be online 24 7 via miniature devices such as in ear continuous support advice and communications Michael Wollowski associate professor of computer science and software engineering at Rose Hulman Institute of Technology and expert in the Internet of Things diagrammatic systems and artificial intelligence wrote Assuming that industry and government are interested in letting the consumer choose and influence the future there will be many fantastic advances of AI I believe that AI and the Internet of Things will bring about a situation in which technology will be our guardian angel For example self driving cars will let us drive faster than we ever drove before but they will only let us do things that they can control Since computers have much better reaction time than people it will be quite amazing Similarly AI and the Internet of Things will let us conduct our lives to the fullest while ensuring that we live healthy lives Again it is like having a guardian angel that lets us do things knowing they can save us from stupidity Steve King partner at Emergent Research said 2030 is less than 12 years away So the most likely scenario is AI will have a modest impact on the lives of most humans over this time frame Having said that we think the use of AI systems will continue to expand with the greatest growth coming from systems that augment and complement human capabilities and decision making This is not to say there won t be negative impacts from the use of AI Jobs will be replaced and certain industries will be disrupted Even scarier there are many ways AI can be weaponized But like most technological advancements we think the overall impact of AI will be additive at least over the next decade or so Vassilis Galanos a Ph D student and teaching assistant actively researching future human machine symbiosis at the University of Edinburgh commented 2030 is not that far away so there is no room for extremely utopian dystopian hopes and fears Given that AI is already used in everyday life social media algorithms suggestions smartphones digital assistants health care and more it is quite probable that humans will live in a harmonious co existence with AI as much as they do now to a certain extent with computer and internet technologies Charlie Firestone communications and society program executive director and vice president at the Aspen Institute commented I remain optimistic that AI will be a tool that humans will use far more widely than today to enhance quality of life such as medical remedies education and the environment For example the AI will help us to conserve energy in homes and in transportation by identifying exact times and temperatures we need identifying sources of energy that will be the cheapest and the most efficient There certainly are dire scenarios particularly in the use of AI for surveillance a likely occurrence by 2030 I am hopeful that AI and other technologies will identify new areas of employment as it eliminates many jobs Pedro U Lima an associate professor of computer science at Instituto Superior T cnico in Lisbon Portugal said Overall I see AI based technology relieving us from repetitive and or heavy and or dangerous tasks opening new challenges for our activities I envisage autonomous mobile robots networked with a myriad of other smart devices helping nurses and doctors at hospitals in daily activities working as a third hand and physical and emotional support to patients I see something similar happening in factories where networked robot systems will help workers on their tasks relieving them from heavy duties John Laird a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan responded There will be a continual off loading of mundane intellectual and physical tasks on to AI and robotic systems In addition to helping with everyday activities it will significantly help the mentally and physically impaired and disabled There will also be improvements in customized individualized education and training of humans and conversely the customization of AI systems by everyday users We will be transitioning from current programming practices to user customization Automated driving will be a reality eliminating many deaths but also having significant societal changes Steven Polunsky director of the Alabama Transportation Policy Research Center at the University of Alabama wrote AI will allow public transportation systems to better serve existing customers by adjusting routes travel times and stops to optimize service New customers will also see advantages Smart transportation systems will allow public transit to network with traffic signals and providers of last mile trips to minimize traffic disruption and inform decision making about modal rail bus mobility on demand planning and purchasing Sanjiv Das a professor of data science and finance at Santa Clara University responded AI will enhance search to create interactive reasoning and analytical systems Search engines today do not know why we want some information and hence cannot reason about it They also do not interact with us to help with analysis An AI system that collects information based on knowing why it is needed and then asks more questions to refine its search would be clearly available well before 2030 These search thinking bots will also write up analyses based on parameters elicited from conversation and imbue these analyses with different political left right and linguistic aggressive mild slants chosen by the human using advances in language generation which are already well under way These intellectual agents will become companions helping us make sense of our information overload I often collect files of material on my cloud drive that I found interesting or needed to read later and these agents would be able to summarize and engage me in a discussion of these materials very much like an intellectual companion It is unclear to me if I would need just one such agent though it seems likely that different agents with diverse personalities may be more interesting As always we should worry what the availability of such agents might mean for normal human social interaction but I can also see many advantages in freeing up time for socializing with other humans as well as enriched interactions based on knowledge and science assisted by our new intellectual companions Lawrence Roberts designer and manager of ARPANET the precursor to the internet and Internet Hall of Fame member commented AI voice recognition or text with strong context understanding and response will allow vastly better access to website program documentation voice call answering and all such interactions will greatly relieve user frustration with getting information It will mostly provide service where no or little human support is being replaced as it is not available today in large part For example finding and or doing a new or unused function of the program or website one is using Visual 3D space recognition AI to support better than human robot activity including vehicles security surveillance health scans and much more Christopher Yoo a professor of law communication and computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania Law School responded AI is good at carrying out tasks that follow repetitive patterns In fact AI is better than humans Shifting these functions to machines will improve performance It will also allow people to shift their efforts to high value added and more rewarding directions an increasingly critical consideration in developing world countries where population is declining Research on human computer interaction HCI also reveals that AI driven pattern recognition will play a critical role in expanding humans ability to extend the benefits of computerization HCI once held that our ability to gain the benefit from computers would be limited by the total amount of time people can spend sitting in front of a screen and inputting characters through a keyboard The advent of AI driven HCI will allow that to expand further and will reduce the amount of customization that people will have to program in by hand At the same time AI is merely a tool All tools have their limits and can be misused Even when humans are making the decisions instead of machines blindly following the results of a protocol without exercising any judgment can have disastrous results Future applications of AI will thus likely involve both humans and machines if they are to fulfill their potential Joseph Konstan distinguished professor of computer science specializing in human computer interaction and AI at the University of Minnesota predicted Widespread deployment of AI has immense potential to help in key areas that affect a large portion of the world s population including agriculture transportation more efficiently getting food to people and energy Even as soon as 2030 I expect we ll see substantial benefits for many who are today disadvantaged including the elderly and physically handicapped who will have greater choices for mobility and support and those in the poorest part of the world A number of expert insights on this topic were shared earlier in this report These additional observations add to the discussion of hopes and concerns about the future of human jobs This segment starts with comments from those who are hopeful that the job situation and related social issues will turn out well It is followed by statements from those who are pessimistic Bob Metcalfe Internet Hall of Fame member co inventor of Ethernet founder of 3Com and now professor of innovation and entrepreneurship at the University of Texas at Austin said Pessimists are often right but they never get anything done All technologies come with problems sure but generally they get solved The hardest problem I see is the evolution of work Hard to figure out Forty percent of us used to know how to milk cows but now less than 1 do We all used to tell elevator operators which floor we wanted and now we press buttons Most of us now drive cars and trucks and trains but that s on the verge of being over AIs are most likely not going to kill jobs They will handle parts of jobs enhancing the productivity of their humans Stowe Boyd founder and managing director at Work Futures said There is a high possibility that unchecked expansion of AI could rapidly lead to widespread unemployment My bet is that governments will step in to regulate the spread of AI to slow the impacts of this phenomenon as a result of unrest by the mid 2020s That regulation might include for example not allowing AIs to serve as managers of people in the workplace but only to augment the work of people on a task or process level So we might see high degrees of automation in warehouses but a human being would be in charge in some sense Likewise fully autonomous freighters might be blocked by regulations An anonymous respondent wrote Repeatedly throughout history people have worried that new technologies would eliminate jobs This has never happened so I m very skeptical it will this time Having said that there will be major short term disruptions in the labor market and smart governments should begin to plan for this by considering changes to unemployment insurance universal basic income health insurance etc This is particularly the case in America where so many benefits are tied to employment I would say there is almost zero chance that the U S government will actually do this so there will be a lot of pain and misery in the short and medium term but I do think ultimately machines and humans will peacefully coexist Also I think a lot of the projections on the use of AI are ridiculous Regardless of the existence of the technology cross state shipping is not going to be taken over by automated trucks any time soon because of legal and ethical issues that have not been worked out Steven Miller vice provost and professor of information systems at Singapore Management University said It helps to have a sense of the history of technological change over the past few hundred years even longer Undoubtedly new ways of using machines and new machine capabilities will be used to create economic activities and services that were either a not previously possible or b previously too scarce and expensive and now can be plentiful and inexpensive This will create a lot of new activities and opportunities At the same time we know some existing tasks and jobs with a high proportion of those tasks will be increasingly automated So we will simultaneously have both new opportunity creation as well as technological displacement Even so the long term track record shows that human societies keep finding ways of creating more and more economically viable jobs Cognitive automation will obviously enhance the realms of automation but even with tremendous progress in this technology there are and will continue to be limits Humans have remarkable capabilities to deal with and adapt to change so I do not see the end of human work The ways people and machines combine together will change and there will be many new types of human machine symbiosis Those who understand this and learn to benefit from it will proposer Henry E Brady dean of the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California Berkeley wrote AI can replace people in jobs that require sophisticated and accurate pattern matching driving diagnoses based upon medical imaging proofreading and other areas There is also the fact that in the past technological change has mostly led to new kinds of jobs rather than the net elimination of jobs Furthermore I also believe that there may be limits to what AI can do It is very good at pattern matching but human intelligence goes far beyond pattern matching and it is not clear that computers will be able to compete with humans beyond pattern matching It also seems clear that even the best algorithms will require constant human attention to update check and revise them Geoff Livingston author and futurist commented The term AI misleads people What we should call the trend is machine learning or algorithms Weak AI as it is called today s AI reduces repetitive tasks that most people find mundane This in turn produces an opportunity to escape the trap of the proletariat being forced into monotonous labor to earn a living Instead of thinking of the Terminator we should view the current trend as an opportunity to seek out and embrace the tasks that we truly love including more creative pursuits If we embrace the inevitable evolution of technology to replace redundant tasks we can encourage today s youth to pursue more creative and strategic pursuits Further today s workers can learn how to manage machine learning or embrace training to pursue new careers that they may enjoy more My fear is that many will simply reject change and blame technology as has often been done One could argue much of today s populist uprising we are experiencing globally finds its roots in the current displacements caused by machine learning as typified by smart manufacturing If so the movement forward will be troublesome rife with dark bends and turns that we may regret as cultures and countries Marek Havrda director at NEOPAS and strategic adviser for the GoodAI project a private research and development company based in Prague that focuses on the development of artificial general intelligence and AI applications explained the issue from his point of view The development and implementation of artificial intelligence has brought about questions of the impact it will have on employment Machines are beginning to fill jobs that have been traditionally reserved for humans such as driving a car or prescribing medical treatment How these trends may unfold is a crucial question We may expect the emergence of super labour a labour defined by super high added value of human activity due to augmentation by AI Apart from the ability to deploy AI super labour will be characterised by creativity and the ability to co direct and supervise safe exploration of business opportunities together with perseverance in attaining defined goals An example may be that by using various online AI gig workers and maybe several human gig workers while leveraging AI to its maximum potential at all aspects from product design to marketing and after sales care three people could create a new service and ensure its smooth delivery for which a medium size company would be needed today We can expect growing inequalities between those who have access and are able to use technology and those who do not However it seems more important how big a slice of the AI co generated pie is accessible to all citizens in absolute terms e g having enough to finance public service and other public spending which would make everyone better off than in pre AI age than the relative inequalities Yoram Kalman an associate professor at the Open University of Israel and member of The Center for Internet Research at the University of Haifa wrote In essence technologies that empower people also improve their lives I see that progress in the area of human machine collaboration empowers people by improving their ability to communicate and to learn and thus my optimism I do not fear that these technologies will take the place of people since history shows that again and again people used technologies to augment their abilities and to be more fulfilled Although in the past too it seemed as if these technologies would leave people unemployed and useless human ingenuity and the human spirit always found new challenges that could best be tackled by humans Thomas H Davenport distinguished professor of information technology and management at Babson College and fellow of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy responded So far most implementations of AI have resulted in some form of augmentation not automation Surveys of managers suggest that relatively few have automation based job loss as the goal of their AI initiatives So while I am sure there will be some marginal job loss I expect that AI will free up workers to be more creative and to do more unstructured work Yvette Wohn director of the Social Interaction Lab and expert on human computer interaction at the New Jersey Institute of Technology commented Artificial intelligence will be naturally integrated into our everyday lives Even though people are concerned about computers replacing the jobs of humans the best case scenario is that technology will be augmenting human capabilities and performing functions that humans do not like to do Smart farms and connected distribution systems will hopefully eliminate urban food deserts and enable food production in areas not suited for agriculture Artificial intelligence will also become better at connecting people and provide immediate support to people who are in crisis situations A principal architect for a major global technology company responded AI is a prerequisite to achieving a post scarcity world in which people can devote their lives to intellectual pursuits and leisure rather than to labor The first step will be to reduce the amount of labor required for production of human necessities Reducing tedium will require changes to the social fabric and economic relationships between people as the demand for labor shrinks below the supply but if these challenges can be met then everyone will be better off Tom Hood an expert in corporate accounting and finance said By 2030 AI will stand for Augmented Intelligence and will play an ever increasing role in working side by side with humans in all sectors to add its advanced and massive cognitive and learning capabilities to critical human domains like medicine law accounting engineering and technology Imagine a personal bot powered by artificial intelligence working by your side in your laptop or smartphone making recommendations on key topics by providing up to the minute research or key pattern recognition and analysis of your organization s data One example is a CPA in tax given a complex global tax situation amid constantly changing tax laws in all jurisdictions who would be able to research and provide guidance on the most complex global issues in seconds It is my hope for the future of artificial intelligence in 2030 that we will be augmenting our intelligence with these machines A professor of computer science expert in systems who works at a major U S technological university wrote By 2030 we should expect advances in AI networking and other technologies enabled by AI and networks e g the growing areas of persuasive and motivational technologies to improve the workplace in many ways beyond replacing humans with robots The following one liners from anonymous respondents express a bright future for human jobs A section earlier in this report shared a number of key experts concerns about the potential negative impact of AI on the socioeconomic future if steps are not taken soon to begin to adjust to a future with far fewer jobs for humans Many additional respondents to this canvassing shared fears about this Wout de Natris an internet cybercrime and security consultant based in Rotterdam Netherlands wrote Hope Advancement in health care education decision making availability of information higher standards in ICT security global cooperation on these issues etc Fear Huge segments of society especially the middle classes who carry society in most ways e g through taxes savings and purchases will be rendered jobless through endless economic cuts by industry followed by governments due to lower tax income Hence all of society suffers Can governments and industry refrain from an overkill of surveillance Otherwise privacy values keep declining leading to a lower quality of life Jonathan Taplin director emeritus at the University of Southern California s Annenberg Innovation Lab wrote My fear is that the current political class is completely unprepared for the disruptions that AI and robotics applied at scale will bring to our economy While techno utopians point to universal basic income as a possible solution to wide scale unemployment there is no indication that anyone in politics has an appetite for such a solution And because I believe that meaningful work is essential to human dignity I m not sure that universal basic income would be helpful in the first place Alex Halavais an associate professor of social technologies at Arizona State University wrote AI is likely to rapidly displace many workers over the next 10 years and so there will be some potentially significant negative effects at the social and economic level in the short run Uta Russmann professor in the department of communication at FHWien der WKW University of Applied Sciences for Management Communication said Many people will not be benefitting from this development as robots will do their jobs Blue collar workers people working in supermarkets stacking shelves etc will not be needed less but the job market will not offer them any other possibilities The gap between rich and poor will increase as the need for highly skilled and very well paid people increases and the need for less skilled workers will decrease tremendously Ross Stapleton Gray principal at Stapleton Gray and Associates an information technology and policy consulting firm commented Human machine interaction could be for good or for ill It will be hugely influenced by decisions on social priorities We may be at a tipping point in recognizing that social inequities need to be addressed so say a decreased need for human labor due to AI will result in more time for leisure education etc instead of increasing wealth inequity Aneesh Aneesh author of Global Labor Algocratic Modes of Organization and professor at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee responded Just as automation left large groups of working people behind even as the United States got wealthier as a country it is quite likely that AI systems will automate the service sector in a similar way Unless the welfare state returns with a vengeance it is difficult to see the increased aggregate wealth resulting in any meaningful gains for the bottom half of society Alper Dincel of T C Istanbul Kultur University in Turkey wrote Unqualified people won t find jobs as machines and programs take over easy work in the near future Machines will also solve performance problems There is no bright future for most people if we don t start to try finding solutions Jason Abbott professor and director at the Center for Asian Democracy at University of Louisville said AI is likely to create significant challenges to the labor force as previously skilled semi skilled jobs are replaced by AI everything from AI in trucks and distribution to airlines logistics and even medical records and diagnoses Kenneth R Fleischmann an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin s School of Information responded In corporate settings I worry that AI will be used to replace human workers to a disproportionate extent such that the net economic benefit of AI is positive but that economic benefit is not distributed equally among individuals with a smaller number of wealthy individuals worldwide prospering and a larger number of less wealthy individuals worldwide suffering from fewer opportunities for gainful employment Gerry Ellis founder and digital usability and accessibility consultant at Feel The BenefIT responded Technology has always been far more quickly developed and adopted in the richer parts of the world than in the poorer regions where new technology is generally not affordable AI cannot be taken as a stand alone technology but in conjunction with other converging technologies like augmented reality robotics virtual reality the Internet of Things big data analysis etc It is estimated that around 80 of jobs that will be done in 2030 do not exist yet One of the reasons why unskilled and particularly repetitive jobs migrate to poor countries is because of cheap labour costs but AI combined with robotics will begin to do many of these jobs For all of these reasons combined the large proportion of the earth s population that lives in the under developed and developing world is likely to be left behind by technological developments Unless the needs of people with disabilities are taken into account when designing AI related technologies the same is true for them or I should say us as I am blind Karen Oates director of workforce development and financial stability for La Casa de Esperanza commented Ongoing increases in the use of AI will not benefit the working poor and low to middle income people Having worked with these populations for 10 years I ve already observed many of these people losing employment when robots and self operating forklifts are implemented Although there are opportunities to program and maintain these machines realistically people who have the requisite knowledge and education will fill those roles The majority of employers will be unwilling to invest the resources to train employees unless there is an economic incentive from the government to do so Many lower wage workers won t have the confidence to return to school to develop new knowledge skills when they were unsuccessful in the past As the use of AI increases low wage workers will lose the small niche they hold in our economy Peggy Lahammer director of health life sciences at Robins Kaplan LLP and legal market analyst commented Jobs will continue to change and as many disappear new ones will be created These changes will have an impact on society as many people are left without the necessary skills A European computer science professor expert in machine learning commented The social sorting systems introduced by AI will most likely define and further entrench the existing world order of the haves and the have nots making social mobility more difficult and precarious given the unpredictability of AI driven judgements of fit The interesting problem to solve will be the fact that initial designs of AI will come with built in imaginaries of what good or correct constitutes The level of flexibility designed in to allow for changes in normative perceptions and judgements will be key to ensuring that AI driven systems support rather than obstruct productive social change Stephen McDowell a professor of communication at Florida State University and expert in new media and internet governance commented Much of our daily lives is made up of routines and habits that we repeat and AI could assist in these practices However just because some things we do are repetitive does not mean they are insignificant We draw a lot of meaning from things we do on a daily weekly or annual basis whether by ourselves or with others Cultural practices such as cooking shopping cleaning coordinating and telling stories are crucial parts of building our families and larger communities Similarly at work some of the routines are predictable but are also how we gain a sense of mastery and expertise in a specific domain In both these examples we will have to think about how we define knowledge expertise collaboration and growth and development David Sarokin author of Missed Information Better Information for Building a Wealthier More Sustainable Future commented My biggest concern is that our educational system will not keep up with the demands of our modern times It is doing a poor job of providing the foundations to our students As more and more jobs are usurped by AI endowed machines everything from assembling cars to flipping burgers those entering the workplace will need a level of technical sophistication that few graduates possess these days Justin Amyx a technician with Comcast said My worry is automation Automation occurs usually with mundane tasks that fill low paying blue collar and under jobs Those jobs will disappear lawn maintenance truck drivers and fast food to name a few Those un skilled or low skilled workers will be jobless Unless we have training programs to take care of worker displacement there will be issues Many of these experts have high hopes for continued incremental advances across all aspects of health care and life extension They predict a rise in access to various tools including digital agents that can perform rudimentary exams with no need to visit a clinic a reduction in medical errors and better faster recognition of risks and solutions They also worry over the potential for a widening health care divide between those who can afford cutting edge tools and treatments and those less privileged They express concerns about the potential for data abuses such as the denial of insurance or coverage or benefits for select people or procedures Leonard Kleinrock Internet Hall of Fame member and co director of the first host to host online connection and professor of computer science at the University of California Los Angeles predicted As AI and machine learning improve we will see highly customized interactions between humans and their health care needs This mass customization will enable each human to have her medical history DNA profile drug allergies genetic makeup etc always available to any caregiver medical professional that they engage with and this will be readily accessible to the individual as well Their care will be tailored to their specific needs and the very latest advances will be able to be provided rapidly after the advances are established The rapid provision of the best medical treatment will provide great benefits In hospital settings such customized information will dramatically reduce the occurrence of medical injuries and deaths due to medical errors My hope and expectation is that intelligent agents will be able to assess the likely risks and the benefits that ensue from proposed treatments and procedures far better than is done now by human evaluators such humans even experts typically being poor decision makers in the face of uncertainty But to bring this about there will need to be carefully conducted tests and experimentation to assess the quality of the outcomes of AI based decision making in this field However as with any optimized system one must continually be aware of the fragility of optimized systems when they are applied beyond the confines of their range of applicability Kenneth Grady futurist founding author of the Algorithmic Society blog and adjunct and advisor at the Michigan State University College of Law responded In the next dozen years AI will still be moving through a phase where it will augment what humans can do It will help us sift through organize and even evaluate the mountains of data we create each day For example doctors today still work with siloed data Each patient s vital signs medicines dosage rates test results and side effects remain trapped in isolated systems Doctors must evaluate this data without the benefit of knowing how it compares to the thousands of other patients around the country or world with similar problems They struggle to turn the data into effective treatments by reading research articles and mentally comparing them to each patient s data As it evolves AI will improve the process Instead of episodic studies doctors will have near real time access to information showing the effects of treatment regimes Benefits and risks of drug interactions will be identified faster Novel treatments will become evident more quickly Doctors will still manage the last mile interpreting the analysis generated through AI This human in the loop approach will remain critical during this phase As powerful as AI will become it still will not match humans on understanding how to integrate treatment with values When will a family sacrifice effectiveness of treatment to prolong quality of life When two life threatening illnesses compete which will the patient want treated first This will be an important learning phase as humans understand the limits of AI Charles Zheng a researcher in machine learning and AI with the National Institute of Mental Health commented In the year 2030 I expect AI will be more powerful than they currently are but not yet at human level for most tasks A patient checking into a hospital will be directed to the correct desk by a robot The receptionist will be aided by software that listens to their conversation with the patient and automatically populates the information fields without needing the receptionist to type the information Another program cross references the database in the cloud to check for errors The patient s medical images would first be automatically labeled by a computer program before being sent to a radiologist A professor of computer science expert in systems who works at a major U S technological university wrote By 2030 physiological monitoring devices e g lower heartbeats and decreasing blood sugar levels could indicate lower levels of physical alertness Smart apps could detect those decaying physical conditions at an individual level and suggest improvements to the user e g taking a coffee break with a snack Granted there may be large scale problems caused by AI and robots e g massive unemployment but the recent trends seem to indicate small improvements such as health monitor apps outlined above would be more easily developed and deployed successfully Kenneth Cukier author and senior editor at The Economist commented AI will be making more decisions in life and some people will be uneasy with that But these are decisions that are more effectively done by machines such as assessing insurance risk the propensity to repay a loan or to survive a disease A good example is health care Algorithms not doctors will be diagnosing many diseases even if human doctors are still in the loop The benefit is that healthcare can reach down to populations that are today underserved the poor and rural worldwide Gabor Melli senior director of engineering for AI and machine learning for Sony PlayStation responded My hope is that by 2030 most of humanity will have ready access to health care and education through digital agents Kate Eddens research scientist at the Indiana University Network Science Institute responded There is an opportunity for AI to enhance human ability to gain critical information in decision making particularly in the world of health care There are so many moving parts and components to understanding health care needs and deciding how to proceed in treatment and prevention With AI we can program algorithms to help refine those decision making processes but only when we train the AI tools on human thinking a tremendous amount of real data and actual circumstances and experiences There are some contexts in which human bias and emotion can be detrimental to decision making For example breast cancer is over diagnosed and over treated While mammography guidelines have changed to try to reflect this reality strong human emotion powered by anecdotal experience leaves some practitioners unwilling to change their recommendations based on evidence and advocacy groups reluctant to change their stance based on public outcry Perhaps there is an opportunity for AI to calculate a more specific risk for each individual person allowing for a tailored experience amid the broader guidelines If screening guidelines change to recommended based on individual risk it lessens the burden on both the care provider and the individual People still have to make their own decisions but they may be able to do so with more information and a greater understanding of their own risk and reward This is such a low tech and simple example of AI but one in which AI can importantly supplement human decision making without replacing it Angelique Hedberg senior corporate strategy analyst at RTI International said The greatest advancements and achievements will be in health physical mental and environmental The improvements will have positive trickle down impacts on education work gender equality and reduced inequality AI will redefine our understanding of health care optimizing existing processes while simultaneously redefining how we answer questions about what it means to be healthy bringing care earlier in the cycle due to advances in diagnostics and assessment i e in the future preventative care identifies and initiates treatment for illness before symptoms present The advances will not be constrained to humans they will include animals and the built environment This will happen across the disease spectrum Advanced omics will empower better decisions There will be a push and a pull by the market and individuals This is a global story with fragmented and discontinuous moves being played out over the next decade as we witness wildly different experiments in health across the globe This future is full of hope for individuals and communities My greatest hope is for disabled individuals and those currently living with disabilities I m excited for communities and interpersonal connections as the work in this future will allow for and increase the value of the human to human experiences Progress is often only seen in retrospect I hope the speed of exponential change allows everyone to enjoy the benefits of these collaborations An anonymous respondent wrote In health care I hope AI will improve the diagnostics and reduce the number of errors Doctors cannot recall all the possibilities they have problems correlating all the symptoms and recognizing the patterns I hope that in the future patients will be interviewed by computers which will correlate the described symptoms with results of tests I hope that with the further development of AI and cognitive computing there will be fewer errors in reports of medical imaging and diagnosis Eduardo Vendrell a computer science professor at the Polytechnic University of Valencia in Spain responded In the field of health many solutions will appear that will allow us to anticipate current problems and discover other risk situations more efficiently The use of personal gadgets and other domestic devices will allow interacting directly with professionals and institutions in any situation of danger or deterioration of our health Monica Murero director of the E Life International Institute and associate professor in sociology of new technology at the University of Naples Federico II in Italy commented In health care I foresee positive outcomes in terms of reducing human mistakes that are currently still creating several failures Also I foresee an increased development of mobile remote 24 7 health care services and personalized medicine thanks to AI and human machine collaboration applied to the field Uta Russmann professor in the department of communication at FHWien der WKW University of Applied Sciences for Management Communication said Life expectancy is increasing globally and human machine AI collaboration will help older people to manage their life on their own by taking care of them helping them in the household taking down the garbage cleaning up etc as well as keeping them company just like cats and dogs do but it will be a much more advanced interaction Lindsey Andersen an activist at the intersection of human rights and technology for Freedom House and Internews now doing graduate research at Princeton University commented AI will augment human intelligence In health care for example it will help doctors more accurately diagnose and treat disease and continually monitor high risk patients through internet connected medical devices It will bring health care to places with a shortage of doctors allowing health care workers to diagnose and treat disease anywhere in the world and to prevent disease outbreaks before they start An anonymous respondent said The most important place where AI will make a difference is in health care of the elderly Personal assistants are already capable of many important tasks to help make sure older adults stay in their home But adding to that emotion detection more in depth health monitoring and AI based diagnostics will surely enhance the power of these tools Denis Parra assistant professor of computer science in the school of engineering at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile commented I live in a developing country Whilst there are potential negative aspects of AI loss of jobs for people with disabilities AI technology could improve their lives I imagine people entering a government office or health facility where people with eye or ear related disabilities could effortlessly interact to state their necessities and resolve their information needs Timothy Leffel research scientist National Opinion Research Center NORC at the University of Chicago said Formulaic transactions and interactions are particularly ripe for automation This can be good in cases where human error can cause problems e g for well understood diagnostic medical testing Jean Daniel Fekete researcher in human computer interaction at INRIA in France said Humans and machines will integrate more improving health through monitoring and easing via machine control Personal data will then become even more revealing and intrusive and should be kept under personal control Joe Whittaker a former professor of sciences and associate director of the NASA GESTAR program now associate provost at Jackson State University responded My hope is that AI human machine interface will become commonplace especially in the academic research and health care arena I envision significant advances in brain machine interface to facilitate mitigation of physical and mental challenges Similar uses in robotics should also be used to assist the elderly James Gannon global head of eCompliance for emerging technology cloud and cybersecurity at Novartis responded AI will increase the speed and availability to develop drugs and therapies for orphan indications AI will assist in general lifestyle and health care management for the average person Jay Sanders president and CEO of the Global Telemedicine Group responded AI will bring collective expertise to the decision point and in health care bringing collective expertise to the bedside will save many lives now lost by individual medical errors Geoff Arnold CTO for the Verizon Smart Communities organization said One of the most important trends over the next 12 years is the aging population and the high costs of providing them with care and mobility AI will provide better data driven diagnoses of medical and cognitive issues and it will facilitate affordable AV based paratransit for the less mobile It will support not replace human care givers John Lazzaro retired professor of electrical engineering and computer science University of California Berkeley commented When I visit my primary care physician today she spends a fair amount time typing into an EMS application as she s talking to me In this sense the computer has already arrived in the clinic An AI system that frees her from this clerical task that can listen and watch and distill the doctor patient interaction into actionable data would be an improvement A more advanced AI system would be able to form a second opinion based on this data as the appointment unfolds discreetly advising the doctor via a wearable The end goal is a reduction in the number of false starts in patient diagnosis If you ve read Lisa Sander s columns in the New York Times where she traces the arc of difficult diagnoses you understand the real clinical problem that this system addresses Steve Farnsworth chief marketing officer at Demand Marketing commented Machine learning and AI offer tools to turn that into actionable data One project using machine learning and big data already was able to predict SIDS correctly 94 of the time Imagine AI looking at diagnostics tests and successful treatments of millions of medical cases We would instantly have a deluge of new cures and know the most effective treatment options using only the data medicines and therapies we have now The jump in quality health care alone for humans is staggering This is only one application for AI Daniel Siewiorek a professor with the Human Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University predicted AI will enable systems to perform labor intensive activities where there are labor shortages For example consider recovery from an injury There is a shortage of physical therapists to monitor and correct exercises AI would enable a virtual coach to monitor correct and encourage a patient Virtual coaches could take on the persona of a human companion or a pet allowing the aging population to live independently Joly MacFie president of the Internet Society New York chapter commented AI will have many benefits for people with disabilities and health issues Much of the aging baby boomer generation will be in this category The overall hopes for the future of health care are tempered by concerns that there will continue to be inequities in access to the best care and worries that private health data may be used to limit people s options Craig Burdett a respondent who provided no identifying details wrote While most AI will probably be a positive benefit the possible darker side of AI could lead to a loss of agency for some For example in a health care setting an increasing use of AI could allow wealthier patients access to significantly more advanced diagnosis agents When coupled with a supportive care team these patients could receive better treatment and a greater range of treatment options Conversely less affluent patients may be relegated to automated diagnoses and treatment plants with little opportunity for interaction to explore alternative treatments AI could effectively manage long term health care costs by offering lesser treatment and sub optimal recovery rates to individuals perceived to have a lower status Consider two patients with diabetes One patient upon diagnosis modifies their eating and exercise patterns borne out by embedded diagnostic tools and would benefit from more advanced treatment The second patient fails to modify their behaviour resulting in substantial ongoing treatment that could be avoided by simple lifestyle choices An AI could subjectively evaluate that the patient has little interest in their own health and withhold more expensive treatment options leading to a shorter lifespan and an overall cost saving Sumandra Majee an architect at F5 Networks Inc said AI deep learning etc will become more a part of daily life in advanced countries This will potentially widen the gap between technology savvy people and economically well to do folks and the folks with limited access to technology However I am hopeful that in the field of healthcare especially when it comes to diagnosis AI will significantly augment the field allowing doctors to do a far better job Many of the routines aspects of checkups can be done via technology There is no reason an expert human has to be involved in basic A B testing to reach a conclusion Machines can be implemented for those tasks and human doctors should only do the critical parts I do see AI playing a negative role in education where students may not often actually do the hard work of learning through experience It might actually make the overall population dumber Timothy Graham a postdoctoral research fellow in sociology and computer science at Australian National University commented In health care we see current systems already under heavy criticism e g the My Health Record system in Australia or the NHS Digital program because they are nudging citizens into using the system through an opt out mechanism and there are concerns that those who do not opt out may be profiled targeted and or denied access to services based on their own data Valarie Bell a computational social scientist at the University of North Texas commented Let s say medical diagnosis is taken over by machines computers and robotics how will stressful prognoses be communicated Will a hologram or a computer deliver the bad news instead of a physician Given the health care industry s inherent profit motives it would be easy for them to justify how much cheaper it would be to simply have devices diagnose prescribe treatment and do patient care without concern for the importance of human touch and interactions Thus we may devolve into a health care system where the rich actually get a human doctor while everyone else or at least the poor and uninsured get the robot The following one liners from anonymous respondents also tie into the future of health care Over the past few decades experts and amateurs alike have predicted the internet would have large scale impacts on education Many of these hopes have not lived up to the hype Some respondents to this canvassing said the advent of AI could foster those changes They expect to see more options for affordable adaptive and individualized learning solutions including digital agents or AI assistants that work to enhance student teacher interactions and effectiveness Barry Chudakov founder and principal of Sertain Research and author of Metalifestream commented In the learning environment AI has the potential to finally demolish the retain to know learning and regurgitate model Knowing is no longer retaining machine intelligence does that it is making significant connections Connect and assimilate becomes the new learning model Lou Gross professor of mathematical ecology and expert in grid computing spatial optimization and modeling of ecological systems at the University of Tennessee Knoxville said I see AI as assisting in individualized instruction and training in ways that are currently unavailable or too expensive There are hosts of school systems around the world that have some technology but are using it in very constrained ways AI use will provide better adaptive learning and help achieve a teacher s goal of personalizing education based on each student s progress Guy Levi chief innovation officer for the Center for Educational Technology based in Israel wrote In the field of education AI will promote personalization which almost by definition promotes motivation The ability to move learning forward all the time by a personal AI assistant which opens the learning to new paths is a game changer The AI assistants will also communicate with one another and will orchestrate teamwork and collaboration The AI assistants will also be able to manage diverse methods of learning such as productive failure teach back and other innovating pedagogies Micah Altman a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and head scientist in the program on information science at MIT Libraries wrote These technologies will help to adapt learning and other environments to the needs of each individual by translating language aiding memory and providing us feedback on our own emotional and cognitive state and on the environment We all need adaptation each of us practically every day is at times tired distracted fuzzy headed or nervous which limits how we learn how we understand and how we interact with others AI has the potential to assist us to engage with the world better even when conditions are not ideal and to better understand ourselves Shigeki Goto Asia Pacific internet pioneer Internet Hall of Fame member and a professor of computer science at Waseda University commented AI is already applied to personalized medicine for an individual patient Similarly it will be applied to learning or education to realize personalized learning or tailored education We need to collect data which covers both of successful learning and failure experiences because machine learning requires positive and negative data Andreas Kirsch fellow at Newspeak House formerly with Google and DeepMind in Zurich and London wrote Higher education outside of normal academia will benefit further from AI progress and empower more people with access to knowledge and information For example question and answer systems will improve Tech similar to Google Translate and WaveNet will lower the barrier of knowledge acquisition for non English speakers At the same time child labor will be reduced because robots will be able to perform the tasks far cheaper and faster forcing governments in Asia to find real solutions Kristin Jenkins executive director of BioQUEST Curriculum Consortium said One of the benefits of this technology is the potential to have really effective responsive education resources We know that students benefit from immediate feedback and the opportunity to practice applying new information repeatedly to enhance mastery AI systems are perfect for analyzing students progress providing more practice where needed and moving on to new material when students are ready This allows time with instructors to focus on more complex learning including 21st century skills Mike Meyer chief information officer at Honolulu Community College commented Adult education availability and relevance will undergo a major transformation Community colleges will become more directly community centers for both occupational training and greatly expanded optional liberal arts art crafts and hobbies Classes will by 2030 be predominantly augmented reality based with a full mix of physical and virtual students in classes presented in virtual classrooms by national and international universities and organizations The driving need will be expansion of knowledge for personal interest and enjoyment as universal basic income or equity will replace the automated tasks that had provided subsistence jobs in the old system Jennifer Groff co founder of the Center for Curriculum Redesign an international non governmental organization dedicated to redesigning education for the 21st century wrote The impact on learning and learning environments has the potential to be one of the most positive future outcomes Learning is largely intangible and invisible making it a black box and our tools to capture and support learning to this point have been archaic Think large scale assessment Learners need tools that help them understand where they are in a learning pathway how they learn best what they need next and so on We re only just beginning to use technology to better answer these questions AI has the potential to help us better understand learning gain insights into learners at scale and ultimately build better learning tools and systems for them But as a large social system it is also prey to the complications of poor public policy that ultimately warps and diminishes AI s potential positive impact Norton Gusky an education technology consultant wrote By 2030 most learners will have personal profiles that will tap into AI machine learning Learning will happen everywhere and at any time There will be appropriate filters that will limit the influence of AI but ethical considerations will also be an issue Cliff Zukin professor of public policy and political science at Rutgers University s School of Planning and Public Policy and the Eagleton Institute of Politics said It takes information out of the category of a commodity and more information makes for better decisions and is democratizing Education to me has always been the status leveler correcting to some extent for birth luck and social mobility This will be like Asimov s Foundation where everyone is plugged into the data sphere There is a dark side later but overall a positive However some expect that there will be a continuing digital divide in education with the privileged having more access to advanced tools and more capacity for using them well while the less privileged lag behind Henning Schulzrinne co chair of the Internet Technical Committee of the IEEE Communications Society professor at Columbia University and Internet Hall of Fame member said Human mediated education will become a luxury good Some high school and college level teaching will be conducted partially by video and AI graded assignments using similar platforms to the MOOC massive open online courses models today with no human involvement to deal with increasing costs for education robo TA Joe Whittaker a former professor of sciences and associate director of the NASA GESTAR program now associate provost at Jackson State University responded Huge segments of society will be left behind or excluded completely from the benefits of digital advances many persons in underserved communities as well as others who are socio economically challenged This is due to the fact that these persons will be under prepared generally with little or no digital training or knowledge base They rarely have access to the relatively ubiquitous internet except when at school or in the workplace Clearly the children of these persons will be greatly disadvantaged Some witnesses of technology s evolution over the past few decades feel that its most positive potential has been disappointingly delayed After witnessing the slower than expected progress of tech s impact on public education since the 1990s they are less hopeful than others Ed Lyell longtime educational technologies expert and professor at Adams State University said education has been held back to this point by the tyranny of the status quo He wrote By 2030 lifelong learning will become more widespread for all ages The tools already exist including Khan Academy and YouTube We don t have to know as much just how to find information when we want it We will have on demand 24 7 schooling This will make going to sit down classroom schools more and more a hindrance to our learning The biggest negative will be from those protecting current status quo education including teachers faculty school boards and college administrators They are protecting their paycheck or ego based role They will need training counseling and help to embrace the existing and forthcoming change as good for all learners Part of the problem now is that they do not want to acknowledge the reality of how current schools are today Some do a good job yet these are mostly serving already smarter higher income communities Parents fight to have their children have a school like they experienced forgetting how inefficient and often useless it was AI can help customize curricula to each learner and guide monitor their journey through multiple learning activities including some existing schools on the job learning competency based learning internships and such You can already learn much more and more efficiently using online resources than almost all of the classes I took in my public schooling and college all the way through getting a Ph D A consultant and analyst also said that advances in education have been held back by entrenched interests in legacy education systems writing The use of technology in education is minimal today due to the existence and persistence of the classroom in a school model As we have seen over the last 30 years the application of artificial intelligence in the field of man machine interface has grown in many unexpected directions Who would have thought back in the late 1970s that the breadth of today s online i e internet capabilities could emerged I believe we are just seeing the beginning of the benefits of the man machine interface for mankind The institutionalized education model must be eliminated to allow education of each and every individual to grow The human brain can be educated 24 hours a day by intelligent educators who may not even be human in the future Access to information is no longer a barrier as it was 50 years ago The next step now is to remove the barrier of structured human delivery of learning in the classroom Brock Hinzmann a partner in the Business Futures Network who worked for 40 years as a futures researcher at SRI International was hopeful in his comments but also issued a serious warning He wrote Most of the improvements in the technologies we call AI will involve machine learning from big data to improve the efficiency of systems which will improve the economy and wealth It will improve emotion and intention recognition augment human senses and improve overall satisfaction in human computer interfaces There will also be abuses in monitoring personal data and emotions and in controlling human behavior which we need to recognize early and thwart Intelligent machines will recognize patterns that lead to equipment failures or flaws in final products and be able to correct a condition or shut down and pinpoint the problem Autonomous vehicles will be able to analyze data from other vehicles and sensors in the roads or on the people nearby to recognize changing conditions and avoid accidents In education and training AI learning systems will recognize learning preferences styles and progress of individuals and help direct them toward a personally satisfying outcome However governments or religious organizations may monitor emotions and activities using AI to direct them to feel a certain way to monitor them and to punish them if their emotional responses at work in education or in public do not conform to some norm Education could become indoctrination democracy could become autocracy or theocracy The expert predictions reported here about the impact of the internet between 2018 and 2030 came in response to questions asked by Pew Research Center and Elon University s Imagining the Internet Center in an online canvassing conducted between July 4 2018 and Aug 6 2018 This is the 10th Future of the Internet study the two organizations have conducted together For this project we invited more than 10 000 experts and members of the interested public to share their opinions on the likely future of the internet and 985 responded to at least one of the questions we asked This report covers only the answers to our questions about AI and the future of humans We also asked respondents to answer a series of questions tied to the 50th anniversary of the ARPANET internet additional reports tied to those responses will be released in 2019 the anniversary year Specifically related to artificial intelligence the participants in the nonscientific canvassing were asked Please think forward to the year 2030 Analysts expect that people will become even more dependent on networked artificial intelligence AI in complex digital systems Some say we will continue on the historic arc of augmenting our lives with mostly positive results as we widely implement these networked tools Some say our increasing dependence on these AI and related systems is likely to lead to widespread difficulties Our question By 2030 do you think it is most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will enhance human capacities and empower them That is most of the time will most people be better off than they are today Or is it most likely that advancing AI and related technology systems will lessen human autonomy and agency to such an extent that most people will not be better off than the way things are today The answers of the 979 respondents include Additionally they were also asked Please explain why you chose the answer you did and sketch out a vision of how the human machine AI collaboration will function in 2030 Please consider giving an example of how a typical human machine interaction will look and feel in a specific area for instance in the workplace in family life in a health care setting or in a learning environment Why What is your hope or fear What actions might be taken to assure the best future The web based instrument was first sent directly to a list of targeted experts identified and accumulated by Pew Research Center and Elon University during previous Future of the Internet studies as well as those identified in an earlier study of people who made predictions about the likely future of the internet between 1990 to 1995 Additional experts with proven interest in this particular research topic were also added to the list Among those invited were artificial intelligence researchers developers and business leaders from leading global organizations including to name a few Oxford Cambridge MIT Stanford and Carnegie Mellon universities Google Microsoft Facebook Amazon Kernel Kyndi BT and Cloudflare leaders active in global internet governance and internet research activities such as the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN Internet Society ISOC International Telecommunications Union ITU Association of Internet Researchers AoIR and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD We also invited a large number of professionals and policy people working in government including the National Science Foundation Federal Communications Commission U S military and European Union think tanks and interest networks for instance those that include professionals and academics in anthropology sociology psychology law political science and communications engineering computer science and business entrepreneurship faculty graduate students and postgraduate researchers who have published work tied to these topics plus many who are active in civil society organizations such as Association for Progressive Communications APC Electronic Privacy Information Center EPIC Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF and Access Now and those affiliated with newly emerging nonprofits and other research units Invitees were encouraged to share the survey link with others they believed would have an interest in participating thus there was a small snowball effect as a small percentage of these invitees invited others to weigh in Since the data are based on a nonrandom sample the results are not projectable to any population other than the individuals expressing their points of view in this sample The respondents remarks reflect their personal positions and are not the positions of their employers the descriptions of their leadership roles help identify their background and the locus of their expertise About half of the expert respondents elected to remain anonymous Because people s level of expertise is an important element of their participation in the conversation anonymous respondents were given the opportunity to share a description of their internet expertise or background and this was noted where relevant in this report Some 519 respondents answered the demographic questions on the canvassing About 70 identified themselves as being based in North America while 30 hail from other corners of the world When asked about their primary area of internet

machines cause mass unemployment SITTING IN AN office in San Francisco Igor Barani calls up some medical scans on his screen He is the chief executive of Enlitic one of a host of startups applying deep learning to medicine starting with the analysis of images such as X rays and CT scans It is an obvious use of the technology Deep learning is renowned for its superhuman prowess at certain forms of image recognition there are large sets of labelled training data to crunch and there is tremendous potential to make health care more accurate and efficient Dr Barani who used to be an oncologist points to some CT scans of a patient s lungs taken from three different angles Red blobs flicker on the screen as Enlitic s deep learning system examines and compares them to see if they are blood vessels harmless imaging artefacts or malignant lung nodules The system ends up highlighting a particular feature for further investigation In a test against three expert human radiologists working together Enlitic s system was 50 better at classifying malignant tumours and had a false negative rate where a cancer is missed of zero compared with 7 for the humans Another of Enlitic s systems which examines X rays to detect wrist fractures also handily outperformed human experts The firm s technology is currently being tested in 40 clinics across Australia Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor s Picks A computer that dispenses expert radiology advice is just one example of how jobs currently done by highly trained white collar workers can be automated thanks to the advance of deep learning and other forms of artificial intelligence The idea that manual work can be carried out by machines is already familiar now ever smarter machines can perform tasks done by information workers too What determines vulnerability to automation experts say is not so much whether the work concerned is manual or white collar but whether or not it is routine Machines can already do many forms of routine manual labour and are now able to perform some routine cognitive tasks too As a result says Andrew Ng a highly trained and specialised radiologist may now be in greater danger of being replaced by a machine than his own executive assistant She does so many different things that I don t see a machine being able to automate everything she does any time soon So which jobs are most vulnerable In a widely noted study published in 2013 Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne examined the probability of computerisation for 702 occupations and found that 47 of workers in America had jobs at high risk of potential automation In particular they warned that most workers in transport and logistics such as taxi and delivery drivers and office support such as receptionists and security guards are likely to be substituted by computer capital and that many workers in sales and services such as cashiers counter and rental clerks telemarketers and accountants also faced a high risk of computerisation They concluded that recent developments in machine learning will put a substantial share of employment across a wide range of occupations at risk in the near future Subsequent studies put the equivalent figure at 35 of the workforce for Britain where more people work in creative fields less susceptible to automation and 49 for Japan Economists are already worrying about job polarisation where middle skill jobs such as those in manufacturing are declining but both low skill and high skill jobs are expanding In effect the workforce bifurcates into two groups doing non routine work highly paid skilled workers such as architects and senior managers on the one hand and low paid unskilled workers such as cleaners and burger flippers on the other The stagnation of median wages in many Western countries is cited as evidence that automation is already having an effect though it is hard to disentangle the impact of offshoring which has also moved many routine jobs including manufacturing and call centre work to low wage countries in the developing world Figures published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis show that in America employment in non routine cognitive and non routine manual jobs has grown steadily since the 1980s whereas employment in routine jobs has been broadly flat see chart As more jobs are automated this trend seems likely to continue And this is only the start We are just seeing the tip of the iceberg No office job is safe says Sebastian Thrun an AI professor at Stanford known for his work on self driving cars Automation is now blind to the colour of your collar declares Jerry Kaplan another Stanford academic and author of Humans Need Not Apply a book that predicts upheaval in the labour market Gloomiest of all is Martin Ford a software entrepreneur and the bestselling author of Rise of the Robots He warns of the threat of a jobless future pointing out that most jobs can be broken down into a series of routine tasks more and more of which can be done by machines In previous waves of automation workers had the option of moving from routine jobs in one industry to routine jobs in another but now the same big data techniques that allow companies to improve their marketing and customer service operations also give them the raw material to train machine learning systems to perform the jobs of more and more people E discovery software can search mountains of legal documents much more quickly than human clerks or paralegals can Some forms of journalism such as writing market reports and sports summaries are also being automated Predictions that automation will make humans redundant have been made before however going back to the Industrial Revolution when textile workers most famously the Luddites protested that machines and steam engines would destroy their livelihoods Never until now did human invention devise such expedients for dispensing with the labour of the poor said a pamphlet at the time Subsequent outbreaks of concern occurred in the 1920s March of the machine makes idle hands declared a New York Times headline in 1928 the 1930s when John Maynard Keynes coined the term technological unemployment and 1940s when the New York Times referred to the revival of such worries as the renewal of an old argument As computers began to appear in offices and robots on factory floors President John F Kennedy declared that the major domestic challenge of the 1960s was to maintain full employment at a time when automation is replacing men In 1964 a group of Nobel prizewinners known as the Ad Hoc Committee on the Triple Revolution sent President Lyndon Johnson a memo alerting him to the danger of a revolution triggered by the combination of the computer and the automated self regulating machine This they said was leading to a new era of production which requires progressively less human labour and threatened to divide society into a skilled elite and an unskilled underclass The advent of personal computers in the 1980s provoked further hand wringing over potential job losses Yet in the past technology has always ended up creating more jobs than it destroys That is because of the way automation works in practice explains David Autor an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Automating a particular task so that it can be done more quickly or cheaply increases the demand for human workers to do the other tasks around it that have not been automated There are many historical examples of this in weaving says James Bessen an economist at the Boston University School of Law During the Industrial Revolution more and more tasks in the weaving process were automated prompting workers to focus on the things machines could not do such as operating a machine and then tending multiple machines to keep them running smoothly This caused output to grow explosively In America during the 19th century the amount of coarse cloth a single weaver could produce in an hour increased by a factor of 50 and the amount of labour required per yard of cloth fell by 98 This made cloth cheaper and increased demand for it which in turn created more jobs for weavers their numbers quadrupled between 1830 and 1900 In other words technology gradually changed the nature of the weaver s job and the skills required to do it rather than replacing it altogether In a more recent example automated teller machines ATMs might have been expected to spell doom for bank tellers by taking over some of their routine tasks and indeed in America their average number fell from 20 per branch in 1988 to 13 in 2004 Mr Bessen notes But that reduced the cost of running a bank branch allowing banks to open more branches in response to customer demand The number of urban bank branches rose by 43 over the same period so the total number of employees increased Rather than destroying jobs ATMs changed bank employees work mix away from routine tasks and towards things like sales and customer service that machines could not do The same pattern can be seen in industry after industry after the introduction of computers says Mr Bessen rather than destroying jobs automation redefines them and in ways that reduce costs and boost demand In a recent analysis of the American workforce between 1982 and 2012 he found that employment grew significantly faster in occupations for example graphic design that made more use of computers as automation sped up one aspect of a job enabling workers to do the other parts better The net effect was that more computer intensive jobs within an industry displaced less computer intensive ones Computers thus reallocate rather than displace jobs requiring workers to learn new skills This is true of a wide range of occupations Mr Bessen found not just in computer related fields such as software development but also in administrative work health care and many other areas Only manufacturing jobs expanded more slowly than the workforce did over the period of study but that had more to do with business cycles and offshoring to China than with technology he says So far the same seems to be true of fields where AI is being deployed For example the introduction of software capable of analysing large volumes of legal documents might have been expected to reduce the number of legal clerks and paralegals who act as human search engines during the discovery phase of a case in fact automation has reduced the cost of discovery and increased demand for it Judges are more willing to allow discovery now because it s cheaper and easier says Mr Bessen The number of legal clerks in America increased by 1 1 a year between 2000 and 2013 Similarly the automation of shopping through e commerce along with more accurate recommendations encourages people to buy more and has increased overall employment in retailing In radiology says Dr Barani Enlitic s technology empowers practitioners making average ones into experts Rather than putting them out of work the technology increases capacity which may help in the developing world where there is a shortage of specialists And while it is easy to see fields in which automation might do away with the need for human labour it is less obvious where technology might create new jobs We can t predict what jobs will be created in the future but it s always been like that says Joel Mokyr an economic historian at Northwestern University Imagine trying to tell someone a century ago that her great grandchildren would be video game designers or cybersecurity specialists he suggests These are jobs that nobody in the past would have predicted Similarly just as people worry about the potential impact of self driving vehicles today a century ago there was much concern about the impact of the switch from horses to cars notes Mr Autor Horse related jobs declined but entirely new jobs were created in the motel and fast food industries that arose to serve motorists and truck drivers As those industries decline new ones will emerge Self driving vehicles will give people more time to consume goods and services increasing demand elsewhere in the economy and autonomous vehicles might greatly expand demand for products such as food delivered locally There will also be some new jobs created in the field of AI itself Self driving vehicles may need remote operators to cope with emergencies or ride along concierges who knock on doors and manhandle packages Corporate chatbot and customer service AIs will need to be built and trained and have dialogue written for them AI firms are said to be busy hiring poets they will have to be constantly updated and maintained just as websites are today And no matter how advanced artificial intelligence becomes some jobs are always likely to be better done by humans notably those involving empathy or social interaction Doctors therapists hairdressers and personal trainers fall into that category An analysis of the British workforce by Deloitte a consultancy highlighted a profound shift over the past two decades towards caring jobs the number of nursing assistants increased by 909 teaching assistants by 580 and careworkers by 168 Focusing only on what is lost misses a central economic mechanism by which automation affects the demand for labour notes Mr Autor that it raises the value of the tasks that can be done only by humans Ultimately he says those worried that automation will cause mass unemployment are succumbing to what economists call the lump of labour fallacy This notion that there s only a finite amount of work to do and therefore that if you automate some of it there s less for people to do is just totally wrong he says Those sounding warnings about technological unemployment basically ignore the issue of the economic response to automation says Mr Bessen But couldn t this time be different As Mr Ford points out in Rise of the Robots the impact of automation this time around is broader based not every industry was affected two centuries ago but every industry uses computers today During previous waves of automation he argues workers could switch from one kind of routine work to another but this time many workers will have to switch from routine unskilled jobs to non routine skilled jobs to stay ahead of automation That makes it more important than ever to help workers acquire new skills quickly But so far says Mr Autor there is zero evidence that AI is having a new and significantly different impact on employment And while everyone worries about AI says Mr Mokyr far more labour is being replaced by cheap workers overseas Another difference is that whereas the shift from agriculture to industry typically took decades software can be deployed much more rapidly Google can invent something like Smart Reply and have millions of people using it just a few months later Even so most firms tend to implement new technology more slowly not least for non technological reasons Enlitic and other companies developing AI for use in medicine for example must grapple with complex regulations and a fragmented marketplace particularly in America which is why many startups are testing their technology elsewhere It takes time for processes to change standards to emerge and people to learn new skills The distinction between invention and implementation is critical and too often ignored observes Mr Bessen What of the worry that new high tech industries are less labour intensive than earlier ones Mr Frey cites a paper he co wrote last year showing that only 0 5 of American workers are employed in industries that have emerged since 2000 Technology might create fewer and fewer jobs while exposing a growing share of them to automation he says An oft cited example is that of Instagram a photo sharing app When it was bought by Facebook in 2012 for 1 billion it had tens of millions of users but only 13 employees Kodak which once employed 145 000 people making photographic products went into bankruptcy at around the same time But such comparisons are misleading says Marc Andreessen It was smartphones not Instagram that undermined Kodak and far more people are employed by the smartphone industry and its surrounding ecosystems than ever worked for Kodak or the traditional photography industry So who is right the pessimists many of them techie types who say this time is different and machines really will take all the jobs or the optimists mostly economists and historians who insist that in the end technology always creates more jobs than it destroys The truth probably lies somewhere in between AI will not cause mass unemployment but it will speed up the existing trend of computer related automation disrupting labour markets just as technological change has done before and requiring workers to learn new skills more quickly than in the past Mr Bessen predicts a difficult transition rather than a sharp break with history But despite the wide range of views expressed pretty much everyone agrees on the prescription that companies and governments will need to make it easier for workers to acquire new skills and switch jobs as needed That would provide the best defence in the event that the pessimists are right and the impact of artificial intelligence proves to be more rapid and more dramatic

defining and informing the senior management agenda since 1964 Our learning programs help organizations accelerate growth by unlocking their people s potential Governments around the world are under pressure to operate more efficiently serve citizens better and provide more satisfying working environments for their employees Lessons from the private sector show automation at scale has the potential to serve those purposes but to get there governments must become more strategic in their approach embrace new technologies and be prepared to act at scale Process automation and technologies based on artificial intelligence can bring benefits across numerous functions of government including much lower operating costs more efficient processes and less wastage and errors McKinsey estimates that as many as four out of five processes in HR finance and application processing are at least partially automatable with the potential to reduce costs by at least 30 percent The benefits of automation can be achieved relatively quickly Many of the solutions can be built on existing IT systems without significant additional investment The approach to rolling out automation at scale is intuitive starting with an assessment of the opportunity launching pilots building the infrastructure required and then scaling Many governments have already made significant progress in creating online processes for citizens to complete applications and communicate with providers of services The next stage is to use automation at scale to bring internal operations and processes up to date helping them become digital organizations at their core Many private sector companies have implemented automation at scale helping them reduce operating costs improve service offerings work faster and cut mundane manual tasks and processes A leading oil company has cut four days from its financial close process through automation of over 10 000 tasks One insurer has automated 120 000 transactions per month across 14 processes realizing cost savings of about 30 percent per process A large telecom operator uses automated processes for more than 400 000 transactions per month Governments can take lessons from their approach Private firms have married lean process design which is focused on minimizing waste and maximizing value with robotics and machine learning to push automation into new activities many of which previously required human input Processes such as procurement from purchase request to order are now automated to operate around the clock and at around a third of the cost of manual approaches A key private sector focus has been administrative activities which account for around a quarter of public sector employment suggesting governments can make significant efficiency and productivity gains in that area Automation offers accuracy consistency scalability and traceability The impact in government is likely to be an improved service offering more transparency and more consistent data and analysis for tasks such as crime prevention Automation can also boost employee satisfaction repetitive manual work is frequently cited as one of the main sources of public sector job dissatisfaction Six technologies in particular are likely to be useful in driving the change process exhibit In recent years some governments have made significant process in digitizing citizen facing services Among many examples the UK Government Digital Service has successfully migrated departmental publishing onto the GOV UK platform and digitized services including passport and driver s license applications Estonia s tax filing system allows 95 percent of residents to file their tax returns online and the US Digital Service has built a digital College Scorecard Still while some interfaces have gone digital automation of core processes has proved to be more challenging denying governments the chance to achieve efficiencies at scale In finance HR and procurement some 60 to 80 percent of tasks are automatable creating potential for net long term savings after accounting for implementation and ongoing software costs of at least 30 percent The fact that much of automation software sits on top of existing technology stacks means it is possible to get started quickly with the initial phases completed in weeks To make early gains and promote internal buy in we suggest governments or ministries take a three step approach comprising start up launch and scaling Assess the opportunity Governments or individual ministries embarking on a program to automate at scale should begin with a top down assessment of potential gains across administrative and corporate functions citizen facing services and public leadership roles The private sector provides useful benchmarks to inform the process Project leaders should set out their plans to develop use cases over a given period with targets defined in terms of financial impact or volume or both The vision should be transformational rather than incremental or tactical aiming for example to impact more than 50 percent of tasks and processes In the private sector one global bank set a goal of 1 billion of financial impact from enterprise wide automation over three years Select technology partners Once the assessment phase is complete leaders should launch a process to select a portfolio of technologies and vendors Procurement may be governed by a central framework but it is likely to leverage the services of a range of vendors and include a number of platforms and tools catering to different use cases identified in the initial assessment Pilot proofs of concept based on use cases Having put the requisite vendor relationships in place ministries should conduct proof of concept sprints for specific use cases The sprints should be run on an agile basis allowing flexible development and decision making Common initial use cases include invoice verification vendor procurement expense allocation and month end close processes This start up phase can be completed in as little as eight to 12 weeks assuming access to the right data and with a team of fewer than ten people The Danish government has launched pilots to test both robotic process automation in shared services centers and machine learning The physical operational and human infrastructure required for automation includes new capabilities and cross functional teams governance frameworks and suitable IT and data models Build cross functional teams Cross functional teams are necessary to work across capabilities and may include a delivery lead responsible for multiple processes to plan manage delivery and remove obstacles an automation architect to design target solutions developers to code configure test and improve and a business analyst to manage specifications and coordinate handover to end users The teams need access to subject matter experts and to IT and legal support It is a good but rare practice to designate an owner for each process to be automated Establish clear governance As more processes are automated and delivery teams grow dedicated governance frameworks are required Most private sector firms opt for a federated model with a center of excellence COE coordinating automation across lines of business or activity and creating links to continuous improvement teams During the start up phase development activity typically takes place in the COE When moving to the launch phase development and delivery teams are commonly located in the relevant line of business or activity Agree the IT and data model Successful automation at scale requires a coherent IT and data model that maximizes flexibility However it s important not to get locked in to one protocol This should include clear direction about where to involve the IT department for example in installing platforms deploying software and ensuring information security Moving from start up to a successful and sustainable launch of automation at scale for example automating ten or more processes and with the relevant infrastructure in place can take six to 12 months building a team of 15 to 20 people along the way As use cases develop some employees who have been coopted into COEs may return to ministerial duties Governments have found it particularly challenging to scale automated solutions This is in part structural ministries tend to work in silos but can also be cultural for example manifested in risk aversion in relation to IT projects and a result of talent shortage amid intense competition for expertise Establish centers of excellence An essential step in making the move to sustainable scaled solutions is to work programs based on a road map of priority processes and planned workforce changes Typically the COE will set out a standardized approach and provide program management resources but individual ministries or teams will drive delivery Senior management teams can provide support and encouragement by setting targets for back office such as finance HR and procurement and citizen facing functions such as applications and claims Invest in capability building Private sector firms that have successfully launched automation at scale have made it a priority to invest in capability building in particular ensuring not to become overly reliant on external suppliers and putting in place the HR processes to attract develop and retain individuals with the relevant technical skill sets Employees can also benefit in acquiring the basic skills around automated processes they can improve the efficiency and quality of their daily work and equip themselves for future opportunities A key element is to educate technology users who are often surprisingly averse to using new tools even when they find their old systems frustrating Plan and budget for ongoing maintenance Departments grounded in the business case for each process should plan and budget for ongoing maintenance and support of automated processes Failing to do so creates an unrealistic view of efficiencies and will mean that changes may not be financially sustainable The opportunity for automation at scale in government is significant and accessible and private companies are already seeing the results The same tools these companies use can help governments reduce costs improve the employee experience and provide faster and better services However governments must take urgent action to instigate change as they have done for some citizen facing services That means developing methodologies that can be hardwired into the automation process and taking a strategic approach to planning piloting and scaling Jens Riis Andersen is a partner in McKinsey s Copenhagen office Matthias Daub is a

robotics algorithms and artificial intelligence AI in recent times have shown they can do equal or sometimes even better work than humans who are dermatologists insurance claims adjusters lawyers seismic testers in oil fields sports journalists and financial reporters crew members on guided missile destroyers hiring managers psychological testers retail salespeople and border patrol agents Moreover there is growing anxiety that technology developments on the near horizon will crush the jobs of the millions who drive cars and trucks analyze medical tests and data perform middle management chores dispense medicine trade stocks and evaluate markets fight on battlefields perform government functions and even replace those who program software that is the creators of algorithms People will create the jobs of the future not simply train for them and technology is already central It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead Jonathan GrudinMultiple studies have documented that massive numbers of jobs are at risk as programmed devices many of them smart autonomous systems continue their march into workplaces A recent study by labor economists found that one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment to population ratio by about 0 18 0 34 percentage points and wages by 0 25 0 5 percent When Pew Research Center and Elon University s Imagining the Internet Center asked experts in 2014 whether AI and robotics would create more jobs than they would destroy the verdict was evenly split 48 of the respondents envisioned a future where more jobs are lost than created while 52 said more jobs would be created than lost Since that expert canvassing the future of jobs has been at the top of the agenda at many major conferences globally Several policy and market based solutions have been promoted to address the loss of employment and wages forecast by technologists and economists A key idea emerging from many conversations including one of the lynchpin discussions at the World Economic Forum in 2016 is that changes in educational and learning environments are necessary to help people stay employable in the labor force of the future Among the six overall findings in a new 184 page report from the National Academies of Sciences the experts recommended The education system will need to adapt to prepare individuals for the changing labor market At the same time recent IT advances offer new and potentially more widely accessible ways to access education Jobholders themselves have internalized this insight A 2016 Pew Research Center survey The State of American Jobs found that 87 of workers believe it will be essential for them to get training and develop new job skills throughout their work life in order to keep up with changes in the workplace This survey noted that employment is much higher among jobs that require an average or above average level of preparation including education experience and job training average or above average interpersonal management and communication skills and higher levels of analytical skills such as critical thinking and computer skills A central question about the future then is whether formal and informal learning structures will evolve to meet the changing needs of people who wish to fulfill the workplace expectations of the future Pew Research Center and Elon s Imagining the Internet Center conducted a large scale canvassing of technologists scholars practitioners strategic thinkers and education leaders in the summer of 2016 asking them to weigh in on the likely future of workplace training Some 1 408 responded to the following question sharing their expectations about what is likely to evolve by 2026 In the next 10 years do you think we will see the emergence of new educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers in the skills they will need to perform the jobs of the future The nonscientific canvassing found that 70 of these particular respondents said yes such programs would emerge and be successful A majority among the 30 who said no generally do not believe adaptation in teaching environments will be sufficient to teach new skills at the scale that is necessary to help workers keep abreast of the tech changes that will upend millions of jobs See About this canvassing of experts for further details about the limits of this sample Participants were asked to explain their answers and offered the following prompts to consider Several common expectations were evident in these respondents answers no matter how hopeful or fretful they were about the future of skills and capabilities training efforts It is important to note that many respondents listed human behaviors attributes and competencies in describing desirable work skills Although these aspects of psychology cannot be classified as skills and perhaps cannot be directly taught in any sort of training environment we include these answers under the general heading of skills capabilities and attributes A diversifying education and credentialing ecosystem Most of these experts expect the education marketplace especially online learning platforms to continue to change in an effort to accommodate the widespread needs Some predict employers will step up their own efforts to train and retrain workers Many foresee a significant number of self teaching efforts by jobholders themselves as they take advantage of proliferating online opportunities Respondents see a new education and training ecosystem emerging in which some job preparation functions are performed by formal educational institutions in fairly traditional classroom settings some elements are offered online some are created by for profit firms some are free some exploit augmented and virtual reality elements and gaming sensibilities and a lot of real time learning takes place in formats that job seekers pursue on their own A considerable number of respondents to this canvassing focused on the likelihood that the best education programs will teach people how to be lifelong learners Accordingly some say alternative credentialing mechanisms will arise to assess and vouch for the skills people acquire along the way A focus on nurturing unique human skills that artificial intelligence AI and machines seem unable to replicate Many of these experts discussed in their responses the human talents they believe machines and automation may not be able to duplicate noting that these should be the skills developed and nurtured by education and training programs to prepare people to work successfully alongside AI These respondents suggest that workers of the future will learn to deeply cultivate and exploit creativity collaborative activity abstract and systems thinking complex communication and the ability to thrive in diverse environments One such comment came from Simon Gottschalk a professor in the department of sociology at the University of Nevada Las Vegas The skills necessary at the higher echelons will include especially the ability to efficiently network manage public relations display intercultural sensitivity marketing and generally what author Dan Goleman would call social and emotional intelligence This also includes creativity and just enough critical thinking to move outside the box Another example is the response of Fredric Litto a professor emeritus of communications and longtime distance learning expert from the University of S o Paulo We are now in the transitional stage of employers gradually reducing their prejudice in the hiring of those who studied at a distance and moving in favor of such graduates who in the workplace demonstrate greater proactiveness initiative discipline collaborativeness because they studied online Other respondents mentioned traits including leadership design thinking human meta communication deliberation conflict resolution and the capacity to motivate mobilize and innovate Still others spoke of more practical needs that could help workers in the medium term to work with data and algorithms to implement 3 D modeling and work with 3 D printers or to implement the newly emerging capabilities in artificial intelligence and augmented and virtual reality Jonathan Grudin principal researcher at Microsoft commented People will create the jobs of the future not simply train for them and technology is already central It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead Seriously You re asking about the workforce of the future As if there s going to be one Anonymous scientific editorAbout a third of respondents expressed no confidence in training and education evolving quickly enough to match demands by 2026 Some of the bleakest answers came from some of the most respected technology analysts For instance Jason Hong an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University wrote There are two major components needed for a new kind of training program at this scale political will and a proven technology platform Even assuming that the political will and budget existed there s no platform today that can successfully train large numbers of people MOOCs Massive Open Online Courses have a high dropout rate and have serious questions about quality of instruction They are also struggling with basic issues like identification of individuals taking the courses So in short we can train small numbers of individuals tens of thousands per year using today s community colleges and university systems but probably not more Several respondents argued that job training is not a primary concern at a time when accelerating change in market economies is creating massive economic divides that seem likely to leave many people behind An anonymous scientific editor commented Seriously You re asking about the workforce of the future As if there s going to be one Employers either run sweatshops abroad or hire people in the first world to do jobs that they hate while more and more unskilled and skilled people end up permanently on welfare or zero hour contracts And the relatively job secure qualified people who work in the professions are probably a lot closer than they think they are to going over that same cliff The details of how they earn their credentials aren t going to be an issue Most participants in this canvassing wrote detailed elaborations explaining their positions though they were allowed to respond anonymously Their well considered comments provide insights about hopeful and concerning trends These findings do not represent all possible points of view but they do reveal a wide range of striking observations Respondents collectively articulated five major themes that are introduced and briefly explained in the 29 page section below and then expanded upon in more detailed sections Some responses are lightly edited for style or due to length The following section presents a brief overview of the most evident themes extracted from the written responses including a small selection of representative quotes supporting each point Some responses are lightly edited for style or due to length These experts envision that the next decade will bring a more widely diversified world of education and training options in which various entities design and deliver different services to those who seek to learn They expect that some innovation will be aimed at emphasizing the development of human talents that machines cannot match and at helping humans partner with technology They say some parts of the ecosystem will concentrate on delivering real time learning to workers often in formats that are self taught Commonly occurring ideas among the responses in this category are collected below under headings reflecting subthemes Most experts seem to have faith that rapid technological development and a rising wariness of coming impacts of the AI robotics revolution are going to spur the public private and governmental actions needed for education and training systems to be adapted to deliver more flexible open adaptable resilient certifiable and useful lifelong learning Educators have always found new ways of training the next generation of students for the jobs of the future and this generation will be no different Justin ReichJim Hendler a professor of computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute predicted The nature of education will change to a mix of models College education which will still favor multi year residential education will need to be more focused on teaching students to be lifelong learners followed by more online content in situ training and other such elements to increase skills in a rapidly changing information world As automation puts increasing numbers of low and middle skill workers out of work these models will also provide for certifications and training needs to function in an increasingly automated service sector Michael Wollowski an associate professor of computer science at the Rose Hulman Institute of Technology commented We will definitely see a vast increase in educational and training programs We will also see what might be called on demand or on the job kind of training programs We kind of have to as with continued automation we will need to retrain a large portion of the workforce I strongly believe employers will subscribe to this idea wholeheartedly it increases the overall education of their workforce which benefits their bottom line Nevertheless I am a big believer in the college experience which I see as a way to learn what you are all about as a person and in your field of study The confidence in your own self and your abilities cannot be learned in a short course It takes life experience or four years at a tough college At a good college you are challenged to be your best this is very resource intensive and cannot be scaled at this time Justin Reich executive director at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT Teaching Systems Lab observed Educators have always found new ways of training the next generation of students for the jobs of the future and this generation will be no different Our established systems of job training primarily community colleges and state universities will continue to play a crucial role though catastrophically declining public support for these institutions will raise serious challenges David Karger a professor of computer science at MIT wrote Most of what we now call online learning is little more than glorified textbooks but the future is very promising No matter how good our online teaching systems become the current four year college model will remain dominant for quite some time Online teaching will increase the reach of the top universities which will put pressure on lesser universities to demonstrate value One potential future would be for those universities to abandon the idea that they have faculty teaching their own courses and instead consist entirely of a cadre of less well paid teaching assistants who provide support for the students who are taking courses online A few respondents said already established institutions cannot be as fully successful as new initiatives Jerry Michalski founder at REX commented Today s educational and training institutions are a shambles They take too long to teach impractical skills and knowledge not connected to the real world and when they try to tackle critical thinking for a longer time scale they mostly fail The sprouts of the next generation of learning tools are already visible Within the decade the new shoots will overtake the wilting vines and we will see all sorts of new initiatives mostly outside these schooling academic and training institutions which are mostly beyond repair People will shift to them because they work because they are far less expensive and because they are always available Barry Chudakov founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp says education has been liberated because thanks to digital innovation everyone can embed learning continuously in their everyday lives He wrote The key to education in the next 10 years will be the understanding that we now live in a world without walls and so the walls of the school physical and conceptual need to shatter and never go up again In the hopefully near future we will not segregate schooling from work and real world thinking and development They will seamlessly weave into a braid of learning realization exposure hands on experience and integration into students own lives And again the experience of being a student now confined to grade school secondary school and university will expand to include workers those looking for work and those who want or need to retrain as well as what we now think of as conventional education One way we will break down these walls we are already doing so will be to create digital learning spaces to rival classrooms as places where learning happen s Via simulation gaming digital presentations combined with hands on real world experience learning and re education will move out of books and into the world The more likely enhancement will be to take digital enhancements out into the world again breaking down the walls of the classroom and school to inform and enhance experience An anonymous respondent echoed the sentiment of quite a few others who do not think it is possible to advance and enhance online education and training much in the next decade writing These programs have a cost and too few are willing to sacrifice for these programs More such arguments are included in later sections of this report Some respondents expressed confidence in the best of current online education and training options saying online course options are cost effective evolving for the better and game changing because they are globally accessible Those with the most optimism expect great progress will be made in augmented reality AR virtual reality VR and AI While some say 2026 will still be early days for this tech many are excited about its prospects for enhancing learning in the next decade Already today there are quite effective online training and education systems but they are not being implemented to their full potential Edward FriedmanEdward Friedman professor emeritus of technology management at the Stevens Institute of Technology wrote Already today there are quite effective online training and education systems but they are not being implemented to their full potential These applications will become more widely used with familiarity that is gained during the next decade Also populations will be more tech savvy and be able to make use of these systems with greater personal ease In addition the development of virtual reality AI assistants and other technological advances will add to the effectiveness of these systems There will be a greater need for such systems as the needs for new expertise in the workforce increase and the capacity of traditional education systems proves that it is not capable of meeting the need in a cost effective manner The president of a technology LLC wrote Training teaching are all going online partly because of high costs of campus education Richard Adler distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future predicted AI voice response telepresence VR and gamification techniques will come together to create powerful new learning environments capable of personalizing and accelerating learning across a broad range of fields Ray Schroeder associate vice chancellor for online learning at the University of Illinois Springfield commented It is projected that those entering the workforce today will pursue four or five different careers not just jobs over their lifetime These career changes will require retooling training and education The adult learners will not be able to visit physical campuses to access this learning they will learn online I expect that we will see the further development of artificially intelligent teaching specialists such as Jill Watson at Georgia Tech the virtual graduate assistant who was thought to be human by an entire class of computer science students I anticipate the further development and distribution of holoportation technologies such as those developed by Microsoft using HoloLens for real time three dimensional augmented reality These teaching tools will enable highly sophisticated interactions and engagement with students at a distance They will further fuel the scaling of learning to reach even more massive online classes Fredric Litto an professor emeritus of communications and longtime distance learning expert from the University of S o Paulo replied There is no field of work that cannot be learned totally or in great part in well organized and administered online programs either in traditional course formats or in self directed independent learning opportunities supplemented when appropriate by face to face hands on practice situations Tawny Schlieski research director at Intel and president of the Oregon Story Board explained New technologies of human computer interaction like augmented and virtual reality offer the possibility of entirely new mechanisms of education Augmented and virtual reality tools make learning more experiential they engage students with physical movement and they enable interactive and responsive instructional assets As these tools evolve over the next decade the academics we work with expect to see radical change in training and workforce development which will roll into although probably against a longer timeline more traditional institutions of higher learning Many respondents said real world campus based higher education will continue to thrive during the next decade They generally expect that no other educational experience can match residential universities capabilities for fully immersive person to person learning as well as mentoring and socializing functions before 2026 They said a residential university education helps build intangible skills that are not replicable online and thus deepens the skills base of those who can afford to pay for such an education but they expect that job specific training will be managed by employers on the job and via novel approaches Some say major universities core online course content developed with all of the new tech bells and whistles will be marketed globally and adopted as baseline learning in smaller higher education locales where online elements from major MOOCs can be optimally paired in hybrid learning with in person mentoring activities The most important skills to have in life are gained through interpersonal experiences and the liberal arts Human bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion empathy vulnerability and social emotional intelligence Frank ElavskyUta Russmann communications marketing sales professor at the FHWien University of Applied Sciences in Vienna Austria said In the future more and more jobs will require highly sophisticated people whose skills cannot be trained in mass online programs Traditional four year and graduate programs will better prepare people for jobs in the future as such an education gives people a general understanding and knowledge about their field and here people learn how to approach new things ask questions and find answers deal with new situations etc all this is needed to adjust to ongoing changes in work life Special skills for a particular job will be learned on the job Frank Elavsky data and policy analyst at Acumen LLC responded The most important skills to have in life are gained through interpersonal experiences and the liberal arts Human bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion empathy vulnerability and social emotional intelligence These skills are imperative to focus on as the future is in danger of losing these skillsets from the workforce Many people have gained these skills throughout history without any kind of formal schooling but with the growing emphasis on virtual and digital mediums of production education and commerce people will have less and less exposure to other humans in person and other human perspectives Isto Huvila professor at Uppsala University replied The difference between educating to perform and educating to make the future is the difference between vocational education and higher university education Spending four years at a university is not only about learning skills but about bildung self cultivation and socialising in a group that is capable of fostering collaboration much better than an ad hoc group of people But this does not mean that alternative means and paths of learning and accreditation would not be useful as complementary to the traditional system that has limitations as well Dana Klisanin psychologist futurist at Evolutionary Guidance Media R D wrote Educational institutions that succeed will use the tools of social media and game design to grant students access to teachers from all over the world and increase their motivation to succeed Online educational programs will influence the credentialing systems of traditional institutions and online institutions will increasingly offer meet ups and mingles such that a true hybrid educational approach emerges Will training for skills most important in the jobs of the future work well in large scale settings by 2026 Respondents in this canvassing overwhelmingly said yes anticipating that improvements in such education would continue However many believe the most vital skills are not easy to teach learn or evaluate in any education or training setting available today Dozens of descriptive terms were applied by respondents as they noted the skills capabilities and attributes they see as important in workers lives in the next decade The skills needed to succeed in today s world and the future are curiosity creativity taking initiative multi disciplinary thinking and empathy These skills interestingly are the skills specific to human beings that machines and robots cannot do Tiffany ShlainWhile coding and other hard skills were listed as being easiest to teach to a large group in an online setting soft human skills were seen by most respondents as crucial for survival in the age of AI and robotics Devin Fidler research director at the Institute for the Future predicted As basic automation and machine learning move toward becoming commodities uniquely human skills will become more valuable There will be an increasing economic incentive to develop mass training that better unlocks this value Susan Price a digital architect at Continuum Analytics commented Increasingly machines will perform tasks they are better suited to perform than humans such as computation data analysis and logic Functions requiring emotional intelligence empathy compassion and creative judgment and discernment will expand and be increasingly valued in our culture Tiffany Shlain filmmaker and founder of the Webby Awards wrote The skills needed to succeed in today s world and the future are curiosity creativity taking initiative multi disciplinary thinking and empathy These skills interestingly are the skills specific to human beings that machines and robots cannot do and you can be taught to strengthen these skills through education I look forward to seeing innovative live and online programs that can teach these at scale Ben Shneiderman professor of computer science at the University of Maryland observed Students can be trained to be more innovative creative and active initiators of novel ideas Skills of writing speaking and making videos are important but fundamental skills of critical thinking community building teamwork deliberation dialogue and conflict resolution will be powerful A mindset of persistence and the necessary passion to succeed are also critical Louisa Heinrich founder at Superhuman Limited commented Lateral and system thinking skills are increasingly critical for success in an ever changing global landscape and these will need to be re prioritised at all levels of education An anonymous technologist commented Programming and problem solving learning how to work with artificial intelligence and robotics will become more important and more and more workers will be replaced by software hardware based workers Automation will reduce the need for the current workforce and the divide between the upper class and the lower class will continue to eat the middle class Some who are pessimistic about the future of human work due to advances in capable AI and robotics mocked the current push in the U S to train more people in technical skills An anonymous respondent commented Teach a billion people to program and you ll end up with 900 000 000 unemployed programmers An anonymous program director for a major U S technology funding organization predicted We will see training for the jobs of the past and for service jobs The jobs of the future will not need large numbers of workers with a fixed set of skills most things that we can train large numbers of workers for we will also be able to train computers to do better Among the many other skills mentioned were process oriented and system oriented thinking journalistic skills including research evaluation of multiple sources writing and speaking understanding algorithms computational thinking networking and programming grasping law and policy an evidence based way of looking at the world time management conflict resolution decision making locating information in the flood of data storytelling using data and influencing and consensus building A few people mentioned that young adults need to be taught how to have face to face interaction including one who said they seem to be sorely lacking in these skills and can only interact with a cellphone or laptop Because so many intricacies of the workplace the human soft and hard are learned on the job respondents said they expect apprenticeships and forms of mentoring will regain value and evolve along with the 21st century workplace D Yvette Wohn assistant professor of information systems at the New Jersey Institute of Technology wrote Formalized apprenticeships that require both technical skills and interpersonal interaction will become more important Ian O Byrne an assistant professor of literacy education at the College of Charleston replied In the future we ll see more opportunities for online personalized learning This will include open online learning experiences e g MOOCs where individuals can lurk and build up capacity or quench interests I also believe that we ll see a rise in the offering of premium or pay content that creates a space where one to one learning and interaction will allow mentors to guide learners while providing critical feedback We will identify opportunities to build a digital version of the apprenticeship learning models that have existed in the past Alternative credentials and digital badges will provide more granular opportunities to document and archive learning over time from traditional and nontraditional learning sources Through evolving technologies e g blockchain this may provide opportunities for learners to document and frame their own learning pathways An instructional designer with 19 years of experience commented The pattern I m seeing is toward individualized learning almost on the level of tutoring or apprenticeship We ve seen again and again that the broader the audience focus the less the course seems to deliver As for what the skills of the future are they ll be specialized to their fields with a university degree assumed to be a certificate in the ability to learn more about a particular subject specialty You may get a degree in computer software development but the truth is that you still need to be taught how to write software for say the mortgage company or insurance company that hires you The key to the future will be flexibility and personal motivation to learn and tinker with new things As they anticipate the appearance of effective new learning environments and advances in digital accountability systems many of these experts believe fresh certification programs will be created to attest to workers participation in training programs and the mastery of skills Some predict that many more workers will begin using online and app based learning systems Charlie Firestone communications and society program executive director and vice president at The Aspen Institute replied There will be a move toward more precise and better credentialing for skills and competencies e g badging and similar techniques Employers will accept these more as they prove probative And online learning will be more prevalent even as an adjunct to formal classroom learning New industries such as green energy and telemedicine will increase new employment opportunities Despite all of these measures the loss of jobs from artificial intelligence and robotics will exceed any retraining program at least in the short run Sam Punnett research officer at TableRock Media wrote I suspect employers will recognize the new credentialing systems Particularly those certificates awarded for studies in emerging disciplines currently data science appears all the rage and those that reflect an upgrade of previously acquired skills Traditional credentials will continue to hold value but I believe they will be considered in light of a candidates perceived ability in learning how to learn The four year degree and subsequent graduate studies will continue to be less of a guaranty towards employment without work experience Certificates are being viewed more favourably and many universities are lagging in their connection between their pedagogies and working world requirements William J Ward a university communications professor DR4WARD commented Higher Education is doing a poor job of preparing students with the skills they need to succeed in the workforce Online and credentialing systems are more transparent and do a better job on delivering skills People with new types of credentialing systems are seen as more qualified than traditional four year and graduate programs Many workplaces place a higher value on real world work portfolios than they do on a degree or certification yet their hiring systems including AI bots programmed to scan resum s still use the commonly accepted credentials as a basis for interviewing candidates Some respondents hope to see change Schools today turn out widget makers who can make widgets all the same They are built on producing single right answers rather than creative solutions Jeff JarvisA software engineering and system administration professional commented The reliability of the traditional educational system is already being questioned in some fields it s considered common sense that certifications and degrees mean little and that a portfolio references and hands on interviews are much more important for assessing a candidate s ability The unfortunate reality is that many HR departments still post job listings saying degrees and certifications are required as a way of screening candidates Both of those cost a lot of money and neither mean a lot for a candidate s competence I hope this will change both job listings and quality of degrees certifications but don t see it happening soon Meryl Krieger career specialist at Indiana University Bloomington s Jacobs School replied Credentialing systems will involve portfolios as much as resum s resum s simply are too two dimensional to properly communicate someone s skillset Three dimensional materials in essence job reels that demonstrate expertise will be the ultimate demonstration of an individual worker s skills I see credentialing as a piece of a very complex set of criteria these will also incorporate an individual s ability to communicate and work with teams huge in employer requests for new employees which can more readily be documented and tracked through online portfolio tools than through traditional resume formats Thus the educational and training programs of the future will become in their best incarnations sophisticated combinations of classroom and hands on training programs The specific models will necessarily be responding to individual industry requirements Jeff Jarvis a professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism wrote Schools today turn out widget makers who can make widgets all the same They are built on producing single right answers rather than creative solutions They are built on an outmoded attention economy Pay us for 45 hours of your attention and we will certify your knowledge I believe that many not all areas of instruction should shift to competency based education in which the outcomes needed are made clear and students are given multiple paths to achieve those outcomes and they are certified not based on tests and grades but instead on portfolios of their work demonstrating their knowledge While the first three themes found among the responses to this canvassing were mostly hopeful about advances in education and training for 21st century jobs a large share of responses from top experts reflect a significant degree of pessimism for various reasons Some even say the future of jobs for humans is so baleful that capitalism may fail as an economic system The next themes and subthemes examine these responses A large share of respondents predicted that online formats for knowledge transfer will not advance significantly in the next decade The 30 who expressed pessimism were often deeply doubtful about the capabilities of current education systems to adapt to pivot to respond to new challenges as quickly as necessary Interestingly being able to adapt and respond to looming challenges was seen by nearly everyone in this canvassing as one of the most highly prized future capabilities these respondents especially agree that it is important and they say that our human institutions government business education are not adapting efficiently and are letting us down Many of them say that current K 12 or K 16 education programs are incapable of making adjustments within the next decade to serve the shifting needs of future jobs markets Among the other reasons listed by people who do not expect these kinds of transformative advances in job creation and job skill upgrading Some among the 70 of respondents who are mostly optimistic about the future of training for jobs also echoed one or more of the points above mentioning these tension points while hoping for the best Following are representative statements tied to these points and more from all respondents Thomas Claburn editor at large at Information Week wrote I m skeptical that educational and training programs can keep pace with technology Traditional models train people to equate what they do with who they are i e what do you want to be when you grow up rather than to acquire critical thinking and flexible skills and attitudes that fit a rapidly changing world Pamela RutledgeAndrew Walls managing vice president at Gartner wrote Barring a neuroscience advance that enables us to embed knowledge and skills directly into brain tissue and muscle formation there will be no quantum leap in our ability to up skill people Learning takes time and practice which means it requires money lots of money to significantly change the skill set of a large cohort B Remy Cross assistant professor of sociology Webster University commented Lacking a significant breakthrough in machine learning that could lead to further breakthroughs in adaptive responses by a fully online system it is too hard to adequately instruct large numbers of people in the kinds of soft skills that are anticipated as being in most demand As manufacturing and many labor intensive jobs move overseas or are fully mechanized we will see a bulge in service jobs These require good people skills something that is often hard to train online John Bell software developer and teacher at Dartmouth College replied Even today access to information is not the limiting factor in skills education for anyone who can go online While there have been generational gains in the developments of online communities a large scale educational experience either MOOC or on demand broadcasts will not be able to duplicate that Stowe Boyd managing director of Another Voice and a well known thinker on work futures discussed the intangibles of preparing humans to partner with AI and bot systems While we may see the creation and rollout of new training programs he observed it s unclear whether they will be able to retrain those displaced from traditional sorts of work to fit into the workforce of the near future Many of the skills that will be needed are more like personality characteristics like curiosity or social skills that require enculturation to take hold Individual training like programming or learning how to cook may not be what will be needed And employers may play less of a role especially as AI and bot augmented independent contracting may be the best path for many rather than a job Homesteading in exurbia may be the answer for many with forty acres and a bot as a political campaign slogan of 2024 Luis Miron a distinguished university professor and director of the Institute for Quality and Equity in Education at Loyola University in New Orleans wrote Bluntly speaking I have little confidence in the educational sector K 16 having the capacity and vision to offer high quality online educational programs capable of transforming the training needs of the wider society The most important skills are advanced critical thinking and knowledge of globalization affecting diverse societies culturally religiously and politically Pamela Rutledge director of the Media Psychology Research Center wrote The core assumptions driving educational content are not adapting as fast as the world is changing Traditional models train people to equate what they do with who they are i e what do you want to be when you grow up rather than to acquire critical thinking and flexible skills and attitudes that fit a rapidly changing world We have traditional institutions invested in learning as a supply side model rather than demand side that would create proactive self directed learners This bias impacts the entire process from educators to employers It is changing but beliefs are sticky and institutions are cumbersome bureaucracies that are slow to adapt New delivery systems for skills related to technology will be more readily accepted than traditional ones because they avoid much of the embedded bias Successful education models will begin developing mixed methods to leverage technology with traditional delivery and rewrite certification processes with practice relevant standards Justin Reich executive director at the MIT Teaching Systems Lab observed There will continue to be for profit actors in the sector and while some may offer choice and opportunity for students many others will be exploitative with a great er focus on extracting federal grants and burdening students with debt than actually educating students and creating new opportunities John Paine a business analyst commented The competing desires 1 to make educational activity available to all and 2 to monetize the bejeezus out of anything related to the internet will limit the effectiveness of any online learning systems in a more widespread context danah boyd founder of Data Society commented I have complete faith in the ability to identify job gaps and develop educational tools to address those gaps I have zero confidence in us having the political will to address the socio economic factors that are underpinning skill training For example companies won t pay for reskilling and we don t have the political power to tax them at the level needed for public investment in reskilling Furthermore we have serious geographic mismatches underlying discriminatory attitudes and limited opportunities for lower to mid level career advancement What s at stake are not simply skills gaps it s about how we want to architect labor benefits and social safety nets And right now we talk about needing to increase skills but that s not what employers care about It just sounds nice When computer science graduates from CUNY and Howard University can t get a job what s at stake is not skills training Among the future worker capabilities with the highest value in these respondents eyes are the ability to adapt or pivot and the motivation to up skill as needed Many respondents emphasized that the most crucial skill is that people have to learn how to learn and be self motivated to keep learning My biggest concern with self directed learning is that it requires a great deal of internal motivation And I am not confident that individuals will find their way David BersteinDavid Bernstein a former research director wrote The most important skills needed to succeed in the workplace will be flexibility and the ability to adapt and continuously learn My biggest concern with self directed learning is that it requires a great deal of internal motivation And I am not confident that individuals will find their way just as those who enter college today don t know what they want to be when they grow up often until after they graduate So everyone will still need some basic skills interpersonal communications basic arithmetic along with some general culture awareness so they can have that flexibility Any 3 year old can use their parent s smartphone or tablet without reading the manual What I worry about is how well they will adapt when they are 35 or 55 Calton Pu professor and junior chair in software at the Georgia Institute of Technology wrote The most important skill is a meta skill the ability to adapt to changes This ability to adapt is what distinguished Homo sapiens from other species through natural selection As the rate of technological innovation intensifies the workforce of the future will need to adapt to new technology and new markets The people who can adapt the best and fastest will win This view means that any given set of skills will become obsolete quickly as innovations change the various economic sectors precision agriculture manufacturing 4 0 precision medicine just to name a few Therefore the challenge is not only to teach skills but also how to adapt and learn new skills Whether the traditional programs or new programs will be better at teaching adaptive learning remains to be seen Cory Salveson learning systems and analytics lead at RSM US responded The nature of work today and in future is such that if people want to keep increasingly scarce well paying jobs they will need to educate themselves in an ongoing manner for their whole lives Some of these experts say those who aren t motivated to continue to learn and grow will be left behind Scott Amyx CEO of Amyx said online training is advancing and will continue to evolve but The education system is at an inflection point Many ambitious federal and state programs have fizzled to produce dismal to no statistical change in the caliber of K 12 education It s those less educated and less skilled who are most sensitive to technological displacement Online mediums and self directed approaches may be limited in effectiveness with certain labor segments unless supplemented by human coaching and support systems Beth Corzo Duchardt a professor at Muhlenberg College replied Self directed study is a variable that changes the alchemy of teaching and learning It is true that most online courses require self direction Indeed when I advise students I don t recommend that students take online courses unless they have demonstrated an aptitude for self direction But in person courses may also be self directed This works well for some students but not others Students who are self directed often have had a very good foundational education and supportive parents They have been taught to think critically and they know that the most important thing you can learn is how to learn And they are also are more likely to come from economic privilege So not only does the self direction factor pose a problem for teaching at scale the fact that a high degree of self direction may be required for successful completion of coursework towards the new workforce means that existing structures of inequality will be replicated in the future if we rely on these large scale programs Among the 30 of respondents who said they did not think things would turn out well in the future were those who said the trajectory of technology will overwhelm labor markets killing more jobs than it creates They foresee a society where AI programs and machines do most of the work and raise questions about people s sense of identity the socio economic divisions that already distress them their ability to pay for basic needs their ability to use the growing amount of leisure time constructively and the impact of all of this on economic systems It should also be noted that many among the 70 who expect positive change in the next decade also expressed some of these concerns The problem of future jobs is not one of skills training it is one of diminishing jobs How will we cope with a workforce that is simply irrelevant Jennifer ZickermanCory Doctorow activist in residence at MIT Media Lab and co owner of Boing Boing boingboing net responded It s an article of faith that automation begets more jobs than it displaces in the long run but this is a theory free observation based on previous automation booms The current automation is based on general purpose technologies machine learning Turing complete computers a universal network architecture that is equally optimized for all applications and there s good reason to believe that this will be more disruptive and create fewer new jobs than those that came before Glenn Ricart Internet Hall of Fame member and founder and chief technology officer of US Ignite said Up to the present time automation largely has been replacing physical drudgery and repetitive motion things that can and should improve the quality of people s work lives But in the next decade or two there is likely to be a significant amount of technological innovation in machine intelligence and personal assistants that takes a real swipe out of the jobs we want humans to have in education health care transportation agriculture and public safety What are the new jobs we want these people to have If we haven t been able to invent them in response to international trade pacts why are we sure we will be able to create them in the future Richard Stallman Internet Hall of Fame member and president of the Free Software Foundation commented I think this question has no answer I think there won t be jobs for most people a few decades from now and that s what really matters As for the skills for the employed fraction of advanced countries I think they will be difficult to teach You could get better at them by practice but you couldn t study them much Jennifer Zickerman an entrepreneur commented The problem of future jobs is not one of skills training it is one of diminishing jobs How will we cope with a workforce that is simply irrelevant The question isn t how to train people for nonexistent jobs it s how to share the wealth in a world where we don t need most people to work Nathaniel BorensteinNathaniel Borenstein chief scientist at Mimecast replied I challenge the premise of this question that humans will have to be trained for future jobs The jobs of the future are likely to be performed by robots The question isn t how to train people for nonexistent jobs it s how to share the wealth in a world where we don t need most people to work Paul Davis a director based in Australia predicted Whilst such programs will be developed and rolled out on a large scale I question their overall effectiveness Algorithms automation and robotics will result in capital no longer needing labor to progress the economic agenda Labor becomes in many ways surplus to economic requirements This shift will dramatically transform the notion of economic growth and significantly disrupt social contracts labor s bargaining position will be dramatically weakened The nature of this change may require the world to shift to a Post Economic Growth model to avoid societal dislocation and disruption John Sniadowski a systems architect replied The skill sets which could have been taught will be superseded by AI and other robotic technology By the time the training programs are widely available the required skills will no longer be required The whole emphasis of training must now be directed towards personal life skills development rather than the traditional working career based approach There is also the massive sociological economic impact of general automation and AI that must be addressed to redistribute wealth and focus life skills at lifelong learning Tom Sommerville agile coach wrote Our greatest economic challenges over the next decade will be climate change and the wholesale loss of most jobs to automation We urgently need to explore how to distribute the increasing wealth of complex goods and services our civilization produces to a populace that will be increasingly jobless in the traditional sense The current trend of concentrating wealth in the hands of a diminishing number of ultra rich individuals is unsustainable All of this while dealing with the destabilizing effects of climate change and the adaptations necessary to mitigate its worst impacts Some of these experts projected further out into the future imagining a world where the machines themselves learn and overtake core human emotional and cognitive capacities Timothy C Mack managing principal at AAI Foresight said In the area of skill building the wild card is the degree to which machine learning begins to supplant social creative and emotive skill sets This section features responses by several more of the many top analysts who participated in this canvassing Following this wide ranging set of comments on the topic a much more expansive set of quotations directly tied to the set of four themes begins on Page 40 Baratunde Thurston a director s fellow at MIT Media Lab Fast Company columnist and former digital director of The Onion replied Online training and certification will grow significantly in part due to the high expense of formal higher education along with its declining payoffs for certain occupations Why go 100 000 in debt for a four year university when you can take a more targeted course with more guaranteed income generation potential at the end From the employer perspective this type of learning will only grow We are creating a system of on demand labor akin to cloud based labor where companies provision labor resources at will and release them at will not by the year or month but by the job labor unit or small time unit including minutes The automation of human labor will grow significantly And having a workforce trained in discrete and atomizable bits of skills will be seen as a benefit by employers This of course is a terrible soulless insecure life for the workers but since when did that really change anything There will also be a parallel call for benefits professional development and compensation that smooths out the rough patches in this on demand labor life but such efforts will lag behind the exploitation of said labor because big business has more resources and big tech moves too fast for human scale responses of accountability and responsibility To quote Donald Trump Sad Doc Searls journalist speaker and director of Project VRM at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society wrote I don t expect the evolution of work in the connected world to require new educational and training programs Instead I expect we ll see much more adaptive forms of education especially of the self made kind Look at Linux and open source development The world runs on both now and they employ millions of human beings Many or most of the new open source programmers building and running our world today are self taught or teach each other to a higher degree than they are educated by formal schooling Look at Khan Academy and the home schooling movement both of which in many ways outperform formal institutional education The main qualification for programming work isn t a degree It s proven capability This model for employment of self and others will also spread to other professions By the way I don t like the term job It demeans work and reduces the worker to a position in an org chart The great educator John Taylor Gatto who won many awards for his teaching and rarely obeyed curricular requirements says nearly all attempts to reform education make it worse We are by nature learning animals We are each also very different both from each other and from who we were yesterday As a society we need to take advantage of that and nurture our natural hunger for knowledge and productive work while respecting and encouraging our diversity a fundamental balancing feature of all nature human and otherwise Jeff Jarvis professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism wrote At a roundtable on the future convened by Union Square Ventures a few years ago I heard this economic goal presented We need to see the marginal cost of teaching another student fall to zero to see true innovation come to education allowing change to occur outside the tax based and thus safe confines of public education I don t think we ll ever reach zero MOOCs are not the solution But we will likely see a radical economic disruption in education using new tools and means to learn and certify learning and that is the way by which we will manage to train many more people in many new skills Cory Doctorow activist in residence at MIT Media Lab and co owner of Boing Boing boingboing net responded There is for the immediate and medium term a huge shortage of IT talent of course especially security researchers and professionals In part this is driven by the legal and educational framework that takes a zero tolerance approach to the hacking that kids historically engaged in on their way to becoming security researchers If a kid today hacks her school s censoring firewall to look at a blocked site she is expelled and possibly arrested not streamed into an Advanced Placement computer science class We also have a poorly constituted math curriculum for understanding algorithms which is really understanding the statistics of machine learning models An earlier and more enduring focus on stats and statistical literacy which can readily be taught using current affairs for example analyzing the poll numbers from elections the claims made by climate change scientists or even the excellent oral arguments in the Supreme Court Texas abortion law case would impart skills that transferred well into IT programming and especially security Amy Webb futurist and CEO at the Future Today Institute commented Gill Pratt a former program manager of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA recently warned of a Cambrian Explosion of robotics About 500 000 years ago Earth experienced its first Cambrian Explosion a period of rapid cellular evolution and diversification that resulted in the foundation of life as we know it today We are clearly in the dawn of a new age one that is marked not just by advanced machines but rather machines that are starting to learn how to think Soon those machines that can think will augment humankind helping to unlock our creative and industrial potential Some of the workforce will find itself displaced by automation That includes anyone whose primary job functions are transactional bank tellers drivers mortgage brokers However there are many fields that will begin to work alongside smart machines doctors journalists teachers The most important skill of any future worker will be adaptability This current Cambrian Explosion of machines will mean diversification in our systems our interfaces our code Workers who have the temperament and fortitude to quickly learn new menu screens who can find information quickly and the like will fare well I do not see the wide scale emergence of training programs during the next 10 years due to the emergence of smart machines alone If there are unanticipated external events environmental disasters new pandemics and the like that could devastate a country s economy and significantly impact its workforce which might catalyze the development of online learning opportunities Mike Roberts Internet Hall of Fame member and first president and CEO of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN responded MOOCs and related efforts are in their infancy so yes there will be considerable expansion as more is learned about what works and what doesn t work These developments are contributing to a crisis of self confidence in higher ed where traditional scholarship is being challenged on many fronts including the basic definition of education Human brains are complex and it becomes tiresome to see simplistic approaches to education issues Generally an educated person possesses a level of knowledge about the world that allows him or her to use analytical skills induction deduction probability etc to arrive at conclusions that guide behavior The jury is very much out on the extent to which acquisition of knowledge and reasoning skills requires human interaction We now have empirical evidence that a substantial percentage half or more can be gained through self study using computer assisted techniques The path forward for society as a whole is strewn with obstacles of self interest ignorance flawed economics etc If one believes in the singularity it doesn t matter because human machine symbiosis will bury the problem Judith Donath of Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society replied A lot has been written about the need for STEM science technology engineering and mathematics education Here I want to focus on other areas 1 Teaching and Healing As computers robots and other machines take over many jobs we need to reposition the social status of jobs that involve interpersonal care day care teachers nurse elderly coach The issue is not just training but cultural re evaluation of teaching and healing as highly respected skills While technology can assist with this work we mustn t lose sight of the importance of human connections as an end in and of themselves 2 Craft and Repair For the benefit of both the individual and the environment we need to strongly support learning design craft building repair Few of us make anything we use from the building we live in to the objects we own and these things are mostly manufactured as cheaply as possible to be easily bought discarded and bought again in a process of relentless acquisition that often brings little happiness Education here should be integrated into everyday life not just for when one is in school E g much rental housing is in bad repair with tenants waiting weeks months years for even simple fixes a running toilet broken lights a hole in a wall Very easily accessible learning for how to fix these things themselves and making it economically rewarding in the case of a common good is a simple basic example of the kind of ubiquitous craft learning that at scale would be enormously valuable Some of this can be taught online a key component is also online coordination 3 An Informed Citizen What should people know what skills should they have to be informed participants in a democracy Certainly science and technology are important but we need to refocus liberal education not ignore it History in all its complexity Critical thinking how to debate how to recognize persuasive techniques how to understand multiple perspectives how to mediate between different viewpoints Key skill how to research how to evaluate what you see and read David Weinberger a senior researcher at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society said Judging from what we re seeing happening now on the web it seems likely that many of the innovative platforms will be peer to peer Sites like Stack Overflow for software engineers demonstrate a new moral sense that learning in private is selfish Public learning is becoming the norm Brad Templeton chair for computing at Singularity University wrote We will see the start of these technologies but they will not be widespread at the hard problem of adult retraining in 10 years Instead most focus will be on childhood education for the poorer sectors of the world The most important skill flexibility won t be taught easily this way but must become a focus of K 12 education John Markoff former senior writer at The New York Times said We have now passed through the first generation of MOOCs and a new generation of online learning technology is beginning to emerge Udacity is a good example of the trajectory Sebastian Thrun was one of the inventors of the MOOC concept After starting a company to pursue the idea he pivoted focusing specifically on skill oriented education that is coupled directly to the job market Vint Cerf vice president and chief internet evangelist at Google and an Internet Hall of Fame member noted The internet can support remote training and learning These need not be MOOCs Even mobiles can be sources of education I hope we will see more opportunities arising for sharing this kind of knowledge Marcel Bullinga trend watcher and keynote speaker futurecheck replied The future is cheap and so is the future of education I saw an ad already for 1 000 bachelor s level training with an app of course Schools and universities will transform in the same way as shops have done in the past 10 years from analog human first to digital mobile AI first New online credential systems will first complement then gradually replace the old ones The skills of the future Those are the skills a robot cannot master yet Leadership design human meta communication critical thinking motivating cooperating innovating In my black and white moments I say Skip all knowledge training in high schools Main teaching goal We enable you to survive in an ever changing world with ever changing skills and not yet existing jobs of the future We make you better than a robot We let you cooperate with robots We build your self trust We turn you into a decent polite social person And most importantly we do not mix education with religion never Anil Dash entrepreneur technologist and advocate AnilDash predicted These credentials will start to become widespread but acceptance and quality of the training programs will map to the existing systemic biases that inform current educational and career programs Henning Schulzrinne Internet Hall of Fame member and professor at Columbia University wrote Training programs have had the problem that short duration generic programs are often not very effective except as a way to incrementally add very specific skills learn how to operate the new industry specific tool X in a week to the existing repertoire The subject matter specific part of a B S degree in a technical or scientific field takes at least two years often more and these are high intensity full time years often without other responsibilities such as family mostly for students at an age where learning is still natural and easy A large part of this time is spent not in a classroom but becoming fluent through monitored practice including group work internships and other high intensity high interaction apprentice like programs It is hard to see how workers can afford to spend two years without income support while still fulfilling their adult responsibilities such as taking care of their family or elderly parents There are possibilities for adding limited skill sets to otherwise qualified workers e g the ability to program in Python for somebody who already has an economics degree increasing their ability to get their work done The MOOC style programs have shown themselves to be most effective for this delta learning for practicing professionals not turning a high school graduate into somebody who can compete with a college graduate Jamais Cascio distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future responded We will certainly see attempts to devise training and education to match workers to new jobs but for the most part they re likely to fall victim to two related problems 1 The difficulty of projecting what will be the jobs of the future in a world where the targets keep shifting faster and faster Jobs that seem viable may fall victim to a surprising development in automation see for example filmmaking new categories of work may not last long enough to support large numbers of employees 2 We re in an era of general purpose computing which means that our systems are not physically or procedurally limited to a narrow type of work Automation and semi automation e g self checkout stands don t need to completely eliminate a job to make it unable to support large numbers of workers As learning systems improve we will soon if we re not already be at a point where adaptive algorithms can learn new jobs faster than humans Kate Crawford a well known internet researcher studying how people engage with networked technologies wrote We clearly need new educational and training programs to address the deepening precarity of the labor market But to make it successful in that the right training could be developed to make it possible that everyone will have jobs is very unlikely Paul Jones clinical professor and director at the University of North Carolina replied We learn more today by training and information sipping than in the past Training is useful but not the end of education only a kind of education As for sipping you need not know the name of every bear to know you should avoid bears Yet the continual construction of knowledge and cultures requires more from us So far training formally as in Kahn Academy and Lynda com are unarguably effective for continual updates for basic skills No programmer or developer could keep up without the informal training of Stack Overflow Wikipedia hasn t destroyed bar trivia but it has made a dent in our conversational expertise Who played guitar lead on All or Nothing No need for debate A little information sip will let us know We re fine and informed but not educated or learned But what is left out Collaborative construction of knowledge in new areas deeper investigation into known areas and the discovery of entirely new areas of knowledge This is our challenge how to create wisdom from knowledge not just jobs from training and information Bob Frankston internet pioneer and software innovator commented This is a nuanced question We trained generations of people to be phone operators by making it easy to operate the phone aka dialing Today programming is increasingly become a trade The problem with many websites is not so much the training of the programmers as much as getting managers and C level people who understand the new concepts of a world being redefined by software And that s even more true for policymakers We need to think about co evolving work and workers And as always critical thinking will remain the biggest challenge Frank Pasquale author of The Black Box Society The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information and professor of law at the University of Maryland said The biggest danger for the United States educational system is premature vocationalism Rigorous science and humanities courses help students learn how to learn Skills training all too often does not Of course it can complement core academic courses and is likely to be part of a lifetime of learning for those switching occupations But turning high school and college into narrow vocational education programs would make their graduates more vulnerable to robotic replacement not less We need to invest in higher education shoring up support for traditional universities and colleges lest they eventually become bastions for reproduction of an elite leaving the rest of society to untested experiments or online programs Online learning is a good complement for existing colleges but cannot replace them Online only programs emphasize the upside of high tech approaches but rarely grapple with the downside Big data surveillance will track the work students do ostensibly in order to customize learning Get stuck on a lesson Just keep interfacing with a keyboard camera and perhaps haptic sensors Or perhaps IM some reserve army of tutorial labor via digital labor platforms like Mechanical Turk or TaskRabbit Want to prove you aren t faking exams Just let cameras record your every move and keystroke perhaps your eye movements and facial expressions too With new platforms Silicon Valley has lured some universities into giving away lectures for free The colleges think they re establishing good karma with the public but disrupters hope for a more chaotic endgame students deciding to watch free courses then proving their credentials to certifiers who give out badges to signify competence in a skill set The certifiers most likely won t be burdened with any of the teaching research community service counseling career or otherwise recreation social events extracurriculars or other long standing features of residential university communities They will just verify that student X can do task Y It could be a very profitable business If students pay less for actual instruction by experts they have more money to spend on badges This is the for profit model shift money away from instruction and amenities and toward administrator salaries and marketing Unburdened by legacy staff and faculty ed tech firms could muster a just in time workforce to develop new educational technologies Investors could continue unbundling the university into least cost providers of content units student surveillance and badge granting That vision may draw capital but it probably won t be attractive to many students There are serious worries about rapid centralization and reuse of student data by under regulated firms For instance black boxed instructional technology is often run by algorithms that can t be accessed by the students it is assessing Tom Ryan CEO of eLearn Institute Inc responded The degree and perhaps the prestige of the institution gets you the first interview but it is your ability to do good work that keeps the job and move s you to the next level How individuals develop the skills will be less important than having the skills As mastery learning evolves so will our performance based assessment systems providing universities and businesses a greater set of evidence and qualifications then is currently available Our traditional educational systems are burdened by legacy bureaucratic practices that don t contribute to mastery of learning and distract from great teaching and learning People in rural areas don t have physical access to a higher education campus or highly skilled trainers Current job responsibilities don t allow flexible work schedules to seek skills to improve their position K 12 teachers are constantly pulled from class time with students for professional development or during class are required to take attendance complete grade assessments fill out grade checks practice fire drills all degrading quality teaching time If online systems just removed these barriers they would be a great benefit but there is so much more these systems can offer Many of the new skills necessary for jobs of the future require digital skills to be successful Too often education leaders and politicians make unilateral decisions about the interaction between teacher and learner instead of building and maintaining an environment for great teaching and learning to take place Large school systems can t scale major improvements in current systems without leveraging the tools that society and industry are using to transform their practice Barry Chudakov founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp replied One serious drawback to fast tracking needed educational and training programs the people who are creating the jobs of the future have so little time to reflect and gain perspective on the people they will need and how adding these people to their corporate culture changes that culture These entrepreneurs are so busy building technology infrastructures filing patents testing beta incarnations of ideas and processes not to mention navigating the thicket of regulations and restrictions that surround many emerging technologies and industries that they simply don t have time to look around and see the implications of the changes their companies are creating In the near future we will explode the notion of education as a rite of passage for youth happening within the walls of an institution Educational institutions will not disappear but they will change in ways that make them almost unrecognizable by today s models Just as Pokemon Go lifts people out of their chairs into real world environments to explore imaginary captures we will change learning from a passive to an active dynamic experience Three dynamics that will affect all learning and retraining efforts 1 Newer tools are changing our sense of identity 2 We are moving from the fixed point of view that the book gave us to a multiple simultaneous narrative of flow in a networked environment 3 Again since what we think is what we think through we are applying that logic of visual presentation to our presentation and sense of self The first skill needed to succeed in the workforce of the future will be the ability to understand manage and manipulate data Everyone in a technology based profession will need to be a quant quantitative analyst or keep up with the quants Because all human processes and activities can now be quantified and there is considerable exploration and technology development in the application of quantification to everything from our sleep patterns and shopping habits to our emotions and online behaviors many new and important business models are emerging from quantification and the learning algorithms that drive it The second and much more important skill needed to succeed in the workforce of the future will be the ability to find meaning and value in data combined with the problem condition or opportunity the data is outlining Said simply the greatest skill will be the ability to think through the cloud of facts data experience and strategic direction that products and services require Design thinking or visual thinking will be a critical part of managing a data driven world Data mining and management can be taught effectively Thinking problem solving reflection and visioning are difficult to teach at scale Elisabeth Gee professor at Arizona State University and author of What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy commented First many jobs of the future won t require workers with a lot of training Second degrees and credentials have been increasingly promoted by institutions more driven by profit than an interest in preparing students in any meaningful way for employment If the government doesn t step in to restrict such institutions we ll continue to see students graduate with huge debt and little prospect of decent employment Lastly we don t need large scale training of workers we need real education not job focused and opportunities for people to pursue diverse pathways for career development and lifelong learning Patrick Tucker technology editor at Defense One and author of The Naked Future observed Online education offers the opportunity to gather data on student performance continuously or telemetrically What telemetric education offers is the opportunity to continuously and constantly evaluate a student to gain a much more comprehensive understanding of ability retention of information even how other behaviors and factors such as time of day other calendar items nutrition amount of time on Pokemon Go influence learning It offers a more true moving score Learning will become easier and much more of it will happen outside of school settings all of which will diminish the importance of schools and teachers as we know them today But platforms like Coursera can amplify the talents of gifted and effective instructors and reduce the cost of education in the coming decade for all Some schools and colleges will thrive and prosper at a level not seen in their history But they will do so only by transitioning away from today s classroom model toward something else like data driven skills workshops at the high school level and startup incubators or problem solving workshops at the college level We may be conflicted about replacing classes with platforms but if we are to be honest with ourselves we know that we can t prepare coming generations for the challenges of a technological and globalized economy the same way we prepared previous generations to be factory workers The greatest thinker of the 21st century whoever he or she is will understand more about how she thinks and learns than any student in any previous generation and all before ever stepping foot inside a schoolhouse Imagine for a moment the power of knowing beforehand how well you would perform on a test Laura Matzen of Sandia National Laboratory and some of her colleagues have demonstrated that the brain s electrical activity detectable via electroencephalogram EEG predicts how well studied material has been incorporated into memory and thus how well a subject will perform on memory tests Telemetric education also offers the opportunity for everyone to raise his or her hand and be heard That opportunity doesn t come easily in a crowded classroom especially not for women or minority students many of whom feel that if they ask the wrong question or display ignorance they ll confirm some unflattering broadly held perception about their social group David Golumbia associate professor of digital studies at Virginia Commonwealth University commented As an educator I am completely unconvinced by the current rhetoric that says our educational system is unable to meet the needs of current or future workforces This whole argument is a sham meant to attack the fundamental purpose and basis of education Most empirical evidence shows that the premises of this question are incorrect most high skilled jobs of the sort implied here have an oversupply of qualified talent We need more of an emphasis on the fundamental purpose of education not on skills Stephen Downes researcher at the National Research Council of Canada commented We will see educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers because for the most part mechanisms will be in place that enable them to train themselves Within 10 years we should be beginning to see that the idea of providing training education or training is misguided because it s overly expensive and less effective than self managed learning I find it interesting even that the question itself presumes that skills must be taught Which of these skills can be taught effectively via online systems It s not that the skills are taught per se but rather that the skills are learned A wide range of activities may enable skills to be learned especially multidisciplinary skills such as critical thinking or social interaction without specifically teaching those skills There are very few skills that require specific and personal instruction from an expert to learn frankly I can t think of any which means that within 10 years we should at least be able to countenance the possibility that all or nearly all educational programs may be automated Of course they will continue to require the time and participation of the individual learner and in many cases social interaction with other learners but the labor intensive learning industry we have developed to this point will not be required I see no major objections to this argument 1 It may be argued that personal interaction is required in order to get to know a student and therefore anticipate what they need However in 10 years it will be arguable and probably demonstrable that your own computer networks will know you better than any individual instructor could even an instructor who worked with you your entire life Sure there are disasters like the Facebook news stream but people are already amazed at how much Google knows about them And we know that with enough data analytics can outperform humans even in complex tasks 2 It may be argued that personal interaction is required in order to evaluate a student s level of achievement Most actual assessment not to be confused with multiple choice tests in school or professional programs is based on expert recognition The submitted behavior an essay performance in surgery piloting an aircraft in a simulation is not assessed according to whether a set of indicators is achieved this would possibly be a necessary but never a sufficient condition The expert looks at the overall behavior and assesses whether that competency has been met The expert is serving as a proxy for the community at large With modern communications technology this proxy is no longer required Through the course of any given day as a person goes through various activities they interact with dozens of other people either in person or through online interaction Each person responds to them in some way not by testing them but by for example engaging them in conversation asking questions following advice etc These responses over time form a comprehensive and constantly changing assessment of the person An anonymous postdoctoral fellow at Rice University s Humanities Research Center observed So much has been said and challenged over the past three decades about online education I d like to answer this by asking a different set of questions which address recent developments in robotics and artificial intelligence How will autonomous factories in Chicago U S share what they ve learned with factories in Pingdingshan China What credentialing system will self driving cars require How will artificially intelligent laborers learn the skills needed to run a household business government institution or political organization When will universities allow artilect nonhuman artificial intelligence students to enroll in their traditional undergraduate and graduate degree programs and how would students learn the more ephemeral skills like critical thinking from a thinking machine

AdvertisementSupported bySome big ideas are starting to percolate But less dramatic ones might work too By Neil IrwinLots of smart technologists and futurists are convinced that we are on the cusp of a world in which artificial intelligence robotics and other technologies will make a large portion of today s jobs obsolete They might be wrong of course but the consequences if they re right would be huge potentially a defining challenge of the decades ahead and one that would demand political attention Some of the potential answers are big bold ideas that have gained traction in particular ideological circles A universal basic income the idea that the government simply give each citizen enough money every month to support basic needs has fans among both free market libertarians and socialists But other ideas starting to percolate in economic policy circles may have advantages in terms of cost and political viability One interesting entry in this discussion is a paper published Tuesday by the Roosevelt Institute a liberal think tank called Don t Fear the Robots The economist Mark Paul writes that a series of policy steps that are in isolation not all that radical would go a long way toward ensuring that the benefits of technological advancement would be widely enjoyed As an example he says the Federal Reserve and other policymakers should commit more energetically to pursuing a maximum employment goal set in federal law even if it means being willing to tolerate a bit more risk of inflation Mr Paul argues for overhauling intellectual property law so that the companies that develop valuable patents and trademarks don t have such a lengthy monopoly on their innovations Over time this would probably mean that more of the benefits of technology would accrue to labor rather than capital And he sees promise in work sharing programs like those that have been used to help keep unemployment low in Germany even during economic downturns The idea is that if a company needs to cut 20 percent of its work force because of new innovations it is better for society if it cuts each worker s hours by 20 percent rather than laying off 20 percent of its staff Mr Paul argues that rapid shifts in the skills and technologies demanded by the modern economy strengthen the case for publicly funded higher education and training to help workers adapt This set of proposals is based on the idea that the emerging wave of digital disruption won t result in a permanent loss of demand for workers but rather shifts in what types of work the economy needs It s not unlike early 20th century America s shift from an agricultural economy to an industrial one or its shift from an industrial to an information economy over the last half century In this context the goal is not to stymie that evolution but to try to tilt the balance toward workers as the transition takes place We want a growing robust economy Mr Paul said We just need proper policies in place to ensure that workers don t bear the burden of that transition While these ideas are coming from a decidedly left of center place it s striking how some of them overlap with the goals of centrist business interests and even some conservative thinkers The McKinsey Global Institute the research arm of the consulting giant that has produced extensive analysis suggesting that advances in information technology and robotics will endanger millions of jobs in the coming decade often emphasizes the role of subsidized education and training Susan Lund a partner in the firm says it is increasingly crucial that people continually upgrade their skills to keep up with changing technology whether through community colleges traditional universities or narrowly targeted online training Lifelong learning accounts would be interesting Ms Lund said and they could be federally funded or they could be funded by employers but what you want is for people to be able to avail themselves of a two month leave to take courses so that they can keep up with change Ms Lund and her McKinsey colleagues also recommend new approaches to making job benefits like health insurance and retirement funds more portable so that people who work as independent contractors or who change jobs frequently can have more stability To the degree that many of these ideas imply a more activist government role conservatives tend to be more leery But Michael Strain a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute says the risks of disruption are high enough that some flexibility may be needed In particular we could be headed toward a bifurcated labor market where people with advanced skills earn higher wages but where workers without those skills see technology drive down demand for their services depressing their pay I tend to think that conservatives should be open to new policies for a new economic reality Mr Strain said So if we end up in a world where the market wages for large groups of workers really are well below the wages they would be willing to work for one way to combat that if you re serious about the importance of work would be significantly larger earnings subsidies than conservatives have been comfortable with By expanding the earned income tax credit or creating similar programs for example the government could increase the effective pay of jobs that otherwise would pay so little that Americans might choose to sit at home rather than take them Mr Strain says liberals have blind spots on these issues as well Raising the minimum wage as many on the left have advocated could well be counterproductive if technology causes market wages to fall for certain workers for example The unemployment rate is currently at its lowest level in 18 years and the bigger challenge for the economy now is that productivity is too low not that technology is causing productivity to be so high as to drive people out of jobs So this discussion over potential policy responses to a future that may or may not arrive remains speculative all the more so in an era of congressional dysfunction But there s a recent lesson worth learning from Globalization and automation caused upheaval in the manufacturing industry from the 1980s through the early 2000s and millions of factory workers lost their jobs The disruption to communities is still being felt and is arguably at the root of a lot of the biggest social and economic problems of this era If a similar technological wave is about to wash over millions of service workers we would all do well to try to keep history from repeating itself Neil Irwin is a senior economics correspondent for The Upshot He previously wrote for The Washington Post and is the author of The Alchemists Three Central Bankers and a World on Fire Neil Irwin FacebookAdvertisementFor Labor Day a call for a new union strategy from three prominent workers advocates As another Labor Day passes the stakes have never been higher for workers unions and people who believe in a just economy and a decent country The capitalism of recent decades has relentlessly undercut worker bargaining power triggering an explosive rise in inequality that has undermined democracy itself Driven by an ideological embrace of creative disruption and destruction and supercharged by the fusion of Wall Street s financialization of the economy with Silicon Valley s techno monopolies this profoundly destabilizing version of capitalism is reshaping every aspect of the economy Meanwhile however the architects of inequality are brilliantly distracting us from their growing domination by defining and controlling the debate about what is inevitable and what is possible Nearly every discussion of labor s future in mainstream media quickly becomes mired in a group of elite defined concerns called The Future of Work Rarely has a phrase been so ubiquitous in discussions of the economy or social policy Plug it into a search engine and you ll generate 50 million hits Scarcely a week goes by without a new convening report or foundation initiative focused on the Future of Work that details hair raising scenarios about the potential disappearance of jobs before sweeping waves of robotization artificial intelligence and machine learning Clearly technological change holds important implications for workers and the labor movement Yet discussions of the Future of Work as they are currently constructed threaten to become a dangerous distraction Such discussions usually overstate and sensationalize the technological threats workers currently face while consistently ignoring the forces that are driving the changes that most threaten workers security They draw us into fruitless futuristic policy debates that divert us from addressing the nation s most urgent needs They tend to be dominated by the thinking of the very consultants who are engineering changes in the workplace They accept as inevitable a future in which jobs will be scarce and a firmly entrenched wealthy elite will be setting our priorities They narrow the range of social vision to the question of how to ensure that the citizens of the future simply get enough to survive We argue that it is not the Future of Work that must concern us at this crucial moment but rather it is the future of workers whose future is inextricably linked to our ability to promote and preserve equality and democracy that must be our most urgent concern Unless we center our thinking around the intertwined and interdependent fates of working people and their struggles for economic racial and gender justice we cannot plan for a humane and sustainable future It is the concentration of wealth and power in this new economy not computerization or artificial intelligence that represents the gravest threat to our future It is that concentration that will determine how innovative technologies are deployed and in whose interests they operate The future of work will be determined by who wields power and for what purposes From the beginning the Future of Work discussion has been overwhelmingly framed and driven by people who seek to profit from it Consulting companies like McKinsey Deloitte Accenture and Catalant not only hype scenarios that stress imminent cataclysmic and technology driven changes that are about to radically redefine work and the workforce but also offer their services to companies that seek to take advantage of the Future of Work Nor are the consultants the only ones steering this discussion Bank of America and Barclays are big boosters of Future of Work talk So is the business press Fortune Forbes Wired Fast Company and The Economist all run regular features under the Future of Work rubric Thought leader organizations from the Aspen Institute to the Hamilton Project to TED also publicize the Future of Work framework None has been more influential than the World Economic Forum WEF whose annual gathering of the world s financial and political titans in Davos Switzerland both structures and reveals the agendas of the global elite Klaus Schwab the chairman of the WEF argues that we are in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution and it is all about disruption The speed of current breakthroughs has no historical precedent he says Yet the Future of Work framework would not have gained such traction had it been solely the product of Davos denizens and the business press Academics and technology writers played an important role in legitimizing it Indeed a 2013 study by two Oxford University scholars helped set off the recent craze of Future of Work discussions by claiming that nearly half of all U S jobs were vulnerable to replacement by computerization findings that have since been debunked as vastly overstated A woman shouts while marching with service workers asking for 15 minimum wage pay during a rally at Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark New JerseyDriven by powerful and self interested forces and legitimized by academics and serious writers it is little wonder that within the last few years it has become an article of faith according to Robert D Atkinson and John Wu of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation that workers in advanced industrial nations are experiencing almost unprecedented levels of labor market disruption Worried governments and governmental organizations have been scrambling to address what they ve been told is a looming crisis They ve ranged from the California State Assembly which hosted a Future of Work Summit in 2017 to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development OECD which recently created a Future of Work Fellowship Scheme to the International Labor Organization ILO which is preparing a massive report on the Future of Work the release of which will coincide with the organization s centennial next year A number of influential foundations have joined and promoted the Future of Work discussion in recent years The Open Society Foundation s U S Programs conducted a sprawling collaborative inquiry into new technologies and their impact on the future of work from 2013 to 2015 Others were right behind The Rockefeller Foundation teamed up with Arizona State University to open ShiftLabs a design lab and pilot program that will work in partnership with communities across the country to help them diagnose how technology is changing work in their local and regional markets Both the Field Foundation and the Ford Foundation have recently launched Future of Work initiatives Given Ford s commitment and history of supporting workers rights we hope their initiative will take a more nuanced approach that will re frame this discussion in ways that put the future of workers equality and democracy at its center Unions themselves have followed the lead of these foundations jumping into the Future of Work fray late but with urgency Internationally the UNI Global Union which brings together unions of workers in finance commerce communications and other service sectors held a Future of Work summit in November 2016 and launched an initiative called the Future World of Work In the United States the AFL CIO decided at its October 2017 convention to create a Commission on the Future of Work and Unions which held its first meeting on The Future of Work in a Digital Age in May Among the experts who informed its inaugural deliberations was Michael Chui of McKinsey Global Institute co author of its 2017 report on automation and the threat of job loss a testament to how pervasive the influence of consultants tends to be in Future of Work inquiries Chui s appearance notwithstanding the AFL CIO s Future of Work and Unions inquiry is in some ways a throwback In fact the labor federation was arguably the first institution to actually use the phrase Future of Work In 1982 the federation formed the Committee on the Evolution of Work which convened labor s top leaders and advisers to think strategically about the future of unions in light of a changing economic picture That committee produced a 1983 report entitled The Future of Work Much like the AFL CIO s current inquiry it analyzed the effects of technology on changing employment patterns and its implications for workers Eerily the language of that report could have been lifted from any one of dozens of reports written in the last few years by Future of Work scribes Technology is changing the structure of the U S economy the 1983 report concluded Robots in the factory word processors in the office scanners at the checkout counter push button banking computers in the home and communications satellites in the sky were threatening to create conditions of labor surplus There won t be enough high tech jobs to replace the jobs lost in declining industries it predicted The AFL CIO followed up with another report in 1985 on The Changing Situation of Workers and Their Unions which recommended a number of policies seeking to stem the tide of union losses including the development of associate memberships None of those recommendations had much impact on labor s downward trajectory over the following decades Given the urgent problems labor now faces the AFL CIO cannot afford to recapitulate its 1980s exercise It is heartening to see that it has charged its commission to examine the future of unions as well as the future of work Yet if it is to effectively point the way forward it must also resist the shiny object distractions that tend to characterize most Future of Work discussions If it falls victim to fretting again over the technology s impact on work and fails to generate a more successful strategy for labor s revival than the AFL CIO s 1980s inquiry did there will be no third union initiated Future of Work exercise decades from now By then there will be no movement to convene such an inquiry and there will be nothing to discuss The elite will have thoroughly programmed the system and our descendants will have become its wards Three distractions tend to characterize Future of Work inquiries First they usually overstate the threat of technological change The current fixation on the menace of automation is not new and if the past is any guide the mass automation of jobs is not imminent As Louis Anslow reminds us fears of technological unemployment have periodically swept through the ranks of labor advocates since John Maynard Keynes invented that term in the 1930s In the late 1950s and early 1960s in particular worries about technological unemployment flared President Kennedy s secretary of labor W Willard Wirtz feared that a surging population and driving technology is splitting the American labor force This division of people threatens to create a human slag heap he warned In fact unemployment fell in the 1960s rather than rose And to date while automation has contributed to the shifting of jobs from one sector to another it has never reduced the total number of jobs Most careful research on the question does not see any indication of overall job loss stemming from automation According to data gathered by Heidi Shierholz for the years between 1953 and 2016 faster adoption of technology was not associated with higher unemployment rates Not only are jobs not disappearing overall add Robert D Atkinson and John Wu but labor market transformation has actually slowed in recent years In their view the real threat is that technological change and resulting productivity growth will be too slow not too fast Lending credence to these arguments are the recent findings of the U S Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS which surprised economists by reporting that the proportion of people working in the gig economy or in alternative work arrangements has not grown as many prophets of the Future of Work have predicted Most of the top 20 fastest growing occupations listed by the BLS including home health care are also impervious to automation We realize that just because the Future of Work seems to be unfolding more slowly than many have predicted this does not mean that big changes won t eventually come Yet when even the direst warnings predict that deeply negative impacts of automation are still many years off why do unions and progressives continue to worry about the Future of Work when our movement is facing challenges that threaten to make it an utterly marginal force by the time that future arrives We are not opponents of technology Properly deployed and democratically accountable technology has the ability to shorten workweeks and improve workers lives and living standards But we will not get such technology by talking about the Future of Work We will only get it if we begin to challenge the reigning assumptions that are currently guiding Future of Work discussions Second Future of Work discussions tend to push us prematurely into debates on policy proposals that do not address our main problems proposals such as the creation of a Universal Basic Income UBI It is no coincidence that leading prophets of the Future of Work tend to be among those most avidly promoting UBI These range from the anti union founder of Tesla Elon Musk who says we ll end up doing universal basic income because it will be necessary when we find that there will be fewer and fewer jobs that a robot cannot do better than a human to former SEIU President Andy Stern who believes a tsunami of change is on its way that will give us an an economy with far fewer jobs and that UBI will allow people to be entrepreneurs in a world of constant economic change As a recent study commissioned by the British Trade Union Congress TUC suggests however the UBI is no silver bullet Even many who are sympathetic to the idea including labor law professor Brishen Rogers understand that the features of any UBI enacted prior to a revival of worker organization and bargaining power would be determined by those who hold power and thus would at best reinforce and more than likely exacerbate inequality We agree with Rogers and with Robert McChesney and John Leonard who argue that if we are to organize a gigantic battle to a enact new social right we ought to fight for a world where workers concerns are central and not struggle to be extras in a world of by and for the rich Third and most important talk of the Future of Work tends to ignore the forces that are driving the changes in our economy that are disempowering workers and concentrating income and wealth at the top The problem is not whether artificial intelligence is about to eliminate jobs it is about as who is driving this change why they are driving it and whether there is any democratic accountability for how change will happen and who will be advantaged or disadvantaged by it The fundamental question we must address is about power and who has it We must remember that automation and the reorganization of the employee employer relationship are taking place in a world economy that has been transformed by financialization and globalization in ways that have allowed a tiny number of individuals and entities to gain enormous unprecedented power Consider for instance the power of the Blackstone Group the world s largest private equity firm which is headed by Steve Schwartzmann a key ally of President Donald Trump Blackstone controls 150 companies with a combined value of more than 400 billion which employ approximately 600 000 workers It is the largest owner of hotels and offices in the world the world s largest private owner of real estate the largest owner of logistics companies in Europe and the world s largest investor in hedge funds We shouldn t be surprised that the introduction of new technologies and reorganized work relations in an economy increasingly dominated by gargantuan entities like Blackstone has weakened workers power and led to increased income and wealth inequality Robots fasten parts on a new 2015 aluminum alloy body Ford F 150 truck in the body shop at the company s Kansas City Assembly Plant in Claycomo MissouriAlthough many business apologists argue that rising inequality inevitably flows from the bias that new technologies have for skilled over unskilled labor careful investigations of skill biased technological change undertaken by the likes of David Card of the University of California at Berkeley find that the evidence for this is surprisingly weak Rather as Frederick Guy and Peter Skottz among others have found inequalities are being exacerbated not by technological change as such but by power biased technological change Which means we shouldn t focus on the smoke beclouded image of the great and powerful wizard the robots and artificial intelligence machines that have so captured the imaginations of Future of Work prophets but instead on those behind the curtains who are pulling the levers How should labor and its allies think about the future We argue that our focus should be fixed firmly on the intersection of three intertwined and interdependent fates that of workers rather than work equality and democracy The quality of workers lives the extent of equality and the health of democracy are deeply interdependent We cannot improve one of these without improving the others By the same token the erosion of one undermines the others Focusing on workers means expanding our vision beyond the workplace What happens to workers on the job is intimately connected to what happens in their communities in their schools and in their lived environments It is also intimately connected to their gender racial ethnic and citizenship status The same forces that are weakening worker bargaining power and making work more precarious are also undermining public institutions like schools and mass transit profiting from rising household debt and shaping policies that are contributing to climate change and environmental injustice Improving workers lives on the job cannot be separated from improving their lives off work Workers in turn cannot improve their lives without gaining an effectual collective voice in shaping their world on and off the job That requires revitalizing democracy and making it real For the first three quarters of the 20th century efforts to expand political democracy went hand in hand with efforts to make the workplace more democratic Progressive Era reformers predicted that democracy would die in a world dominated by what were then the new corporate behemoths unless workers secured industrial democracy in the workplace They argued that Political freedom can exist only where there is industrial freedom political democracy only where there is industrial democracy That logic was embedded in the New Deal s labor reforms and in the vision of those who fought for and won collective bargaining rights for government workers in the 1960s As workplace democracy expanded so did political democracy Racial age gender and income restrictions on the electorate all fell as collective bargaining spread We are now experiencing a true crisis of democracy however one decades in the making Since the 1970s democracy has been weakened and rolled back both in the workplace and in the nation at large The battle to roll back workplace democracy began in earnest with the passage of the Taft Hartley Act in 1947 and gathered steam as the 20th century drew to a close Collective bargaining was stifled in the public sector and sharply eroded in the private sector the rights of workers to bargain were undermined by the spread of private sector right to work laws to 28 states and by a growing assault on public sector bargaining that has culminated with the Supreme Court s Janus v AFSCME decision As workplace democracy was undercut so too was political democracy The same courts that diminished workers rights also gutted both campaign finance and voting rights laws and turned a blind eye toward partisan gerrymandering The power to make economic policy was ceded to the unaccountable courts established by trade treaties courts with the power to override environmental protections enacted by the nation s lawmakers As democracy has diminished some voters have become discouraged and withdrawn from political participation while others frustrated by their inability to have their voices heard either at work on in shaping the direction of their society have turned to a faux and often racist populism Tragically a decisive group of such voters turned to Donald Trump in 2016 in the belief that the system was broken and impervious to their concerns and thus needed to be shaken up Unless we can revive democracy amid the increasingly inhospitable conditions that it faces in the 21st century workers will not be able to improve the quality of their lives By the same token we cannot revive democracy without addressing the toxic impact of exploding inequality Since democracy s origins among the ancient Greeks its proponents have repeatedly warned that massive inequalities would be fatal to democracy s survival That belief informed Lincoln s eventual conclusion that slavery and democracy could not co exist and FDR s efforts to tax wealth increase worker bargaining power and provide jobs for the jobless In large part due to Roosevelt s policies and the explosive growth of unions inequality sharply diminished between 1940 and 1975 an era that economists call the Great Compression But since the mid 1970s inequality has been rising rapidly and has now reached unprecedented levels The massive increases in income and wealth have chiefly benefitted the 1 percent and even more so the 01 percent Today the wealthiest Americans wield power seldom matched by their forebears even in the original Gilded Age The Koch brothers the Waltons the Mercers and their like have funded the rightward turn in the Republican party shaped such social policies as education reform and bankrolled the legal cases that have weakened union power voting rights and campaign finance laws Democracy cannot co exist with their overweening power any more than it could co exist with what Lincoln era Republicans called the Slave Power How can we translate a focus on workers equality and democracy into concrete action Senator Elizabeth Warren s recently introduced Accountable Capitalism Act provides one promising approach It would end the practice of state granted corporate charters and require that all corporations obtain charters from the federal government which would in turn compel companies to consider the interests of stakeholders and host communities not just stockholders as they set and pursued their corporate agendas Warren would also require that corporations with more than 1 billion in annual revenues designate 40 percent of seats on their boards of directors for representatives elected by employees Senator Tammy Baldwin s recently proposed Reward Work Act also provides for worker elected representatives on corporate boards While legislative initiatives like these and political mobilizations to free Congress and state legislatures from corporate domination are clearly necessary they are also insufficient Change on the scale that s needed will not come without collective action and strategic disruption At a time when many unions and progressive groups have slipped into a defensive crouch they need instead to go on offense with big and innovative organizing and bargaining campaigns that tackle the intertwined issues of expanding democracy combating inequality and winning a better future for workers In recent years SEIU s Fight for 15 has demonstrated the power of audacious demands as an initial call for a 15 minimum wage for fast food workers not only won them that wage but also spread to encompass workers in multiple industries and cities and became a litmus test for politicians across the nation More recently New York s city council capped the number of Uber and Lyft drivers while establishing a higher minimum wage for those drivers Neither of these efforts would have succeeded absent political initiatives supported by mass mobilization and protest Our task now is to multiply such efforts engaging in creative disruption of the inequality machine We believe that must begin with revolutionizing the tool that has been bequeathed to us by more than a century and a half of workers struggles organizing through collective action and negotiating with those who control the economy and our future through collective bargaining The form of workplace centered organizing and bargaining that evolved over the course of the 20th century however is not up the challenge that workers and citizens face in this century We need to forge new ways of organizing and bargaining appropriate to a world in which power is concentrating in the hands of fewer economic actors where fissurization has created a situation where workers direct employers increasingly do not have the ability to meet their demands due to the market pressures they themselves face where financialization has altered the goals and behavior of employers making management of private enterprise increasingly subject to fickle financial markets or the manipulations of private equity where the public sector is being starved of resources saddled with debt and privatized where the burden of taxation is being shifted away from corporations and the wealthy to the backs of working people where concentration of wealth and power at the top is producing increasing atomization and alienation for those at the bottom where government is either unwilling under Republicans or incapable under Democrats of enforcing labor standards or challenging and curbing corporate power One promising response to these new realities has emerged from public sector unions that have sought to Bargain for the Common Good Campaigns pioneered by teachers in Chicago St Paul and Seattle state workers in Oregon county workers in San Diego and municipal workers in Los Angeles have consciously sought to redefine collective bargaining In these settings unions joined with community allies to craft bargaining demands that advanced the shared goals of workers and their allies demanded that those allies be seated at the bargaining table and used the bargaining process to identify educate and mobilize a broad constituency around an agenda that challenged the ways in which big money was dictating the public agenda They have challenged the strictures that have confined collective bargaining to issues that tend to divide unions from taxpayers bringing militancy to bear by striking with the public s support when needed to advance their cause as the Chicago teachers did in 2012 Until recently much of the Bargaining for Common Good BCG work has been primarily focused on workers already covered by collective bargaining agreements That ceased to be the case earlier this year The recent wave of teachers walkouts in the spring of 2018 were organizing bargaining and political campaigns all at once In West Virginia teachers refused to return to work until all state workers had received a pay increase equal to theirs In Oklahoma teachers protested the state s failure to fairly tax wealthy oil and gas interests In Arizona teachers demanded that the state enact no further tax cuts until the state s per pupil spending on education reached the national average their initiative raising taxes on the rich has qualified for the November ballot Since the vast majority of strikers were not union members these walkouts were both massive organizing campaigns and democracy campaigns as well since they posed such explicit political demands as raising taxes to fund public schools more adequately They instinctively adopted a Bargaining for the Common Good approach in that they were not just about wages or benefits but also about improving education and fighting for fairer taxation The efforts to redefine organizing and bargaining or to apply the insights of Bargaining for the Common Good need not remain confined to the public sector Important initiatives in three employment growth sectors of the new economy also promise the sort of fresh approaches we will need in the years ahead One of these is embodied in Caring Across Generations a campaign that seeks to address the growing demand for elder care how we fund that care and how we ensure that the workers who provide it have the training pay and benefits they need to do their best work winning dignity for themselves in the process While Future of Work prophets stoke fears about technology replacing workers frontline health care jobs like those involved in elder care many of which are done by women people of color and immigrants are five of the top eight fastest growing occupations Workers assemble Volkswagen Passat sedans at the German automaker s plant in Chattanooga TennesseeA second opportunity is emerging among workers who are contesting the monopoly power of their employers Still in its early stages organizing at Amazon is challenging not just the company s treatment of workers but also its growing monopoly control of multiple industries This campaign is connecting warehouse workers globally organizing U S workers challenging the massive tax subsidies that the company receives and calling out Amazon s mistreatment of Muslim workers and the sales of hate mongering products on its platforms Working on multiple levels the campaign seeks to expose the often horrible conditions at the company s warehouses and the larger perils posed to equality and democracy by massive vertical monopolies like Amazon A third area of promising growth sector organizing and bargaining targets banks and private equity The Communications Workers of America CWA the Committee for Better Banks and allied organizations are organizing to improve pay and benefits for the nation s more than one million non union bank workers to end the sales goals and metrics that force workers to sell predatory financial products as a condition of employment and more broadly to reform the finance system so that it serves the common good instead of operating as a driver of inequality As part of this campaign Wells Fargo workers were the whistleblowers who exposed the bank s cheating scandals Santander workers have helped expose Santander s subprime auto loan practices These and their fellow bank workers have now launched a global campaign to regulate from below which envisions workers playing a growing and increasingly central role in exposing and stopping banks from cheating consumers and engaging in practices that threaten the broader health of the economy Bank workers are simultaneously organizing for a union for better wages and for a banking system that serves society instead of the finance sector The titans of private equity also present a promising target particularly since such firms control a range of companies in multiple sectors and multiple nations Blackstone offers an example of how multiple campaigns targeting one such firm could be run at once tying together a variety of different issues and organizations that could challenge the full scope of the company s activities One part of the campaign would organize the non union companies Blackstone owns Another could organize a tenant s union since Blackstone is now the largest landlord in the country and mobilize unions using the leverage of their pension funds to stop Blackstone from foreclosing on homes in post hurricane Puerto Rico Legislation has been introduced in several states that would tax private equity executives to recover the states shares of the billions that are lost to the carried interest loophole that protects the hyper wealthy executives of Blackstone and other private equity giants The current battle with KKR Bain and other such firms to make them pay severance to the 30 000 Toys R Us workers who lost their jobs when the company was liquidated challenges the private equity companies that hide behind complicated corporate structures to avoid compensating workers after destroying their jobs Given the increasing power that firms like these wield over an ever widening range of companies campaigns like this one will have to multiply if workers are to defend their most basic rights and hold corporate power accountable in the decades ahead If they are to survive as a significant force in this century unions will need to deploy the tools they developed in the last century collective action and collective bargaining beyond the workplace and the binary employer employee relationship Workers are also taxpayers renters mortgage holders consumers students student loan debtors and citizens of an endangered biosphere In each of these roles they are being abused and exploited by a form of increasingly unaccountable capitalism Ultimately workplace struggles must link up with fights outside the workplace not only because the battles for a decent life transcend such distinctions but also because in the current form of financialized and globalized capitalism the same people and institutions are increasingly controlling workers lives and constraining their horizons both on and off the clock Whatever the target our goal must be to develop new instrumentalities for broad disruptive collective action Only when workers and their allies create vehicles capable of challenging concentrated economic and political power can we hope to shape a future of work that works for all Building such vehicles not fretfully ruminating about the threats we face from robots and AI must be our most urgent task The good news is that the important work we need is already under way We must expand it exponentially We have no time to lose After

States but it is something like a moment in history for Youngstown Ohio one its residents can cite with precision September 19 1977 For much of the 20th century Youngstown s steel mills delivered such great prosperity that the city was a model of the American dream boasting a median income and a homeownership rate that were among the nation s highest But as manufacturing shifted abroad after World War II Youngstown steel suffered and on that gray September afternoon in 1977 Youngstown Sheet and Tube announced the shuttering of its Campbell Works mill Within five years the city lost 50 000 jobs and 1 3 billion in manufacturing wages The effect was so severe that a term was coined to describe the fallout regional depression Youngstown was transformed not only by an economic disruption but also by a psychological and cultural breakdown Depression spousal abuse and suicide all became much more prevalent the caseload of the area s mental health center tripled within a decade The city built four prisons in the mid 1990s a rare growth industry One of the few downtown construction projects of that period was a museum dedicated to the defunct steel industry This winter I traveled to Ohio to consider what would happen if technology permanently replaced a great deal of human work I wasn t seeking a tour of our automated future I went because Youngstown has become a national metaphor for the decline of labor a place where the middle class of the 20th century has become a museum exhibit Youngstown s story is America s story because it shows that when jobs go away the cultural cohesion of a place is destroyed says John Russo a professor of labor studies at Youngstown State University The cultural breakdown matters even more than the economic breakdown In the past few years even as the United States has pulled itself partway out of the jobs hole created by the Great Recession some economists and technologists have warned that the economy is near a tipping point When they peer deeply into labor market data they see troubling signs masked for now by a cyclical recovery And when they look up from their spreadsheets they see automation high and low robots in the operating room and behind the fast food counter They imagine self driving cars snaking through the streets and Amazon drones dotting the sky replacing millions of drivers warehouse stockers and retail workers They observe that the capabilities of machines already formidable continue to expand exponentially while our own remain the same And they wonder Is any job truly safe Futurists and science fiction writers have at times looked forward to machines workplace takeover with a kind of giddy excitement imagining the banishment of drudgery and its replacement by expansive leisure and almost limitless personal freedom And make no mistake if the capabilities of computers continue to multiply while the price of computing continues to decline that will mean a great many of life s necessities and luxuries will become ever cheaper and it will mean great wealth at least when aggregated up to the level of the national economy But even leaving aside questions of how to distribute that wealth the widespread disappearance of work would usher in a social transformation unlike any we ve seen If John Russo is right then saving work is more important than saving any particular job Industriousness has served as America s unofficial religion since its founding The sanctity and preeminence of work lie at the heart of the country s politics economics and social interactions What might happen if work goes away The U S labor force has been shaped by millennia of technological progress Agricultural technology birthed the farming industry the industrial revolution moved people into factories and then globalization and automation moved them back out giving rise to a nation of services But throughout these reshufflings the total number of jobs has always increased What may be looming is something different an era of technological unemployment in which computer scientists and software engineers essentially invent us out of work and the total number of jobs declines steadily and permanently This fear is not new The hope that machines might free us from toil has always been intertwined with the fear that they will rob us of our agency In the midst of the Great Depression the economist John Maynard Keynes forecast that technological progress might allow a 15 hour workweek and abundant leisure by 2030 But around the same time President Herbert Hoover received a letter warning that industrial technology was a Frankenstein monster that threatened to upend manufacturing devouring our civilization The letter came from the mayor of Palo Alto of all places In 1962 President John F Kennedy said If men have the talent to invent new machines that put men out of work they have the talent to put those men back to work But two years later a committee of scientists and social activists sent an open letter to President Lyndon B Johnson arguing that the cybernation revolution would create a separate nation of the poor the unskilled the jobless who would be unable either to find work or to afford life s necessities The job market defied doomsayers in those earlier times and according to the most frequently reported jobs numbers it has so far done the same in our own time Unemployment is currently just over 5 percent and 2014 was this century s best year for job growth One could be forgiven for saying that recent predictions about technological job displacement are merely forming the latest chapter in a long story called The Boys Who Cried Robot one in which the robot unlike the wolf never arrives in the end The end of work argument has often been dismissed as the Luddite fallacy an allusion to the 19th century British brutes who smashed textile making machines at the dawn of the industrial revolution fearing the machines would put hand weavers out of work But some of the most sober economists are beginning to worry that the Luddites weren t wrong just premature When former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers was an MIT undergraduate in the early 1970s many economists disdained the stupid people who thought that automation was going to make all the jobs go away he said at the National Bureau of Economic Research Summer Institute in July 2013 Until a few years ago I didn t think this was a very complicated subject the Luddites were wrong and the believers in technology and technological progress were right I m not so completely certain now 2 Reasons to Cry RobotWhat does the end of work mean exactly It does not mean the imminence of total unemployment nor is the United States remotely likely to face say 30 or 50 percent unemployment within the next decade Rather technology could exert a slow but continual downward pressure on the value and availability of work that is on wages and on the share of prime age workers with full time jobs Eventually by degrees that could create a new normal where the expectation that work will be a central feature of adult life dissipates for a significant portion of society After 300 years of people crying wolf there are now three broad reasons to take seriously the argument that the beast is at the door the ongoing triumph of capital over labor the quiet demise of the working man and the impressive dexterity of information technology Labor s losses One of the first things we might expect to see in a period of technological displacement is the diminishment of human labor as a driver of economic growth In fact signs that this is happening have been present for quite some time The share of U S economic output that s paid out in wages fell steadily in the 1980s reversed some of its losses in the 90s and then continued falling after 2000 accelerating during the Great Recession It now stands at its lowest level since the government started keeping track in the mid 20th century A number of theories have been advanced to explain this phenomenon including globalization and its accompanying loss of bargaining power for some workers But Loukas Karabarbounis and Brent Neiman economists at the University of Chicago have estimated that almost half of the decline is the result of businesses replacing workers with computers and software In 1964 the nation s most valuable company AT T was worth 267 billion in today s dollars and employed 758 611 people Today s telecommunications giant Google is worth 370 billion but has only about 55 000 employees less than a tenth the size of AT T s workforce in its heyday The spread of nonworking men and underemployed youth The share of prime age Americans 25 to 54 years old who are working has been trending down since 2000 Among men the decline began even earlier the share of prime age men who are neither working nor looking for work has doubled since the late 1970s and has increased as much throughout the recovery as it did during the Great Recession itself All in all about one in six prime age men today are either unemployed or out of the workforce altogether This is what the economist Tyler Cowen calls the key statistic for understanding the spreading rot in the American workforce Conventional wisdom has long held that under normal economic conditions men in this age group at the peak of their abilities and less likely than women to be primary caregivers for children should almost all be working Yet fewer and fewer are Economists cannot say for certain why men are turning away from work but one explanation is that technological change has helped eliminate the jobs for which many are best suited Since 2000 the number of manufacturing jobs has fallen by almost 5 million or about 30 percent Young people just coming onto the job market are also struggling and by many measures have been for years Six years into the recovery the share of recent college grads who are underemployed in jobs that historically haven t required a degree is still higher than it was in 2007 or for that matter 2000 And the supply of these non college jobs is shifting away from high paying occupations such as electrician toward low wage service jobs such as waiter More people are pursuing higher education but the real wages of recent college graduates have fallen by 7 7 percent since 2000 In the biggest picture the job market appears to be requiring more and more preparation for a lower and lower starting wage The distorting effect of the Great Recession should make us cautious about overinterpreting these trends but most began before the recession and they do not seem to speak encouragingly about the future of work The shrewdness of software One common objection to the idea that technology will permanently displace huge numbers of workers is that new gadgets like self checkout kiosks at drugstores have failed to fully displace their human counterparts like cashiers But employers typically take years to embrace new machines at the expense of workers The robotics revolution began in factories in the 1960s and 70s but manufacturing employment kept rising until 1980 and then collapsed during the subsequent recessions Likewise the personal computer existed in the 80s says Henry Siu an economist at the University of British Columbia but you don t see any effect on office and administrative support jobs until the 1990s and then suddenly in the last recession it s huge So today you ve got checkout screens and the promise of driverless cars flying drones and little warehouse robots We know that these tasks can be done by machines rather than people But we may not see the effect until the next recession or the recession after that Some observers say our humanity is a moat that machines cannot cross They believe people s capacity for compassion deep understanding and creativity are inimitable But as Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee have argued in their book The Second Machine Age computers are so dexterous that predicting their application 10 years from now is almost impossible Who could have guessed in 2005 two years before the iPhone was released that smartphones would threaten hotel jobs within the decade by helping homeowners rent out their apartments and houses to strangers on Airbnb Or that the company behind the most popular search engine would design a self driving car that could soon threaten driving the most common job occupation among American men In 2013 Oxford University researchers forecast that machines might be able to perform half of all U S jobs in the next two decades The projection was audacious but in at least a few cases it probably didn t go far enough For example the authors named psychologist as one of the occupations least likely to be computerisable But some research suggests that people are more honest in therapy sessions when they believe they are confessing their troubles to a computer because a machine can t pass moral judgment Google and WebMD already may be answering questions once reserved for one s therapist This doesn t prove that psychologists are going the way of the textile worker Rather it shows how easily computers can encroach on areas previously considered for humans only After 300 years of breathtaking innovation people aren t massively unemployed or indentured by machines But to suggest how this could change some economists have pointed to the defunct career of the second most important species in U S economic history the horse For many centuries people created technologies that made the horse more productive and more valuable like plows for agriculture and swords for battle One might have assumed that the continuing advance of complementary technologies would make the animal ever more essential to farming and fighting historically perhaps the two most consequential human activities Instead came inventions that made the horse obsolete the tractor the car and the tank After tractors rolled onto American farms in the early 20th century the population of horses and mules began to decline steeply falling nearly 50 percent by the 1930s and 90 percent by the 1950s Humans can do much more than trot carry and pull But the skills required in most offices hardly elicit our full range of intelligence Most jobs are still boring repetitive and easily learned The most common occupations in the United States are retail salesperson cashier food and beverage server and office clerk Together these four jobs employ 15 4 million people nearly 10 percent of the labor force or more workers than there are in Texas and Massachusetts combined Each is highly susceptible to automation according to the Oxford study Technology creates some jobs too but the creative half of creative destruction is easily overstated Nine out of 10 workers today are in occupations that existed 100 years ago and just 5 percent of the jobs generated between 1993 and 2013 came from high tech sectors like computing software and telecommunications Our newest industries tend to be the most labor efficient they just don t require many people It is for precisely this reason that the economic historian Robert Skidelsky comparing the exponential growth in computing power with the less than exponential growth in job complexity has said Sooner or later we will run out of jobs Is that certain or certainly imminent No The signs so far are murky and suggestive The most fundamental and wrenching job restructurings and contractions tend to happen during recessions we ll know more after the next couple of downturns But the possibility seems significant enough and the consequences disruptive enough that we owe it to ourselves to start thinking about what society could look like without universal work in an effort to begin nudging it toward the better outcomes and away from the worse ones To paraphrase the science fiction novelist William Gibson there are perhaps fragments of the post work future distributed throughout the present I see three overlapping possibilities as formal employment opportunities decline Some people displaced from the formal workforce will devote their freedom to simple leisure some will seek to build productive communities outside the workplace and others will fight passionately and in many cases fruitlessly to reclaim their productivity by piecing together jobs in an informal economy These are futures of consumption communal creativity and contingency In any combination it is almost certain that the country would have to embrace a radical new role for government 3 Consumption The Paradox of LeisureWork is really three things says Peter Frase the author of Four Futures a forthcoming book about how automation will change America the means by which the economy produces goods the means by which people earn income and an activity that lends meaning or purpose to many people s lives We tend to conflate these things he told me because today we need to pay people to keep the lights on so to speak But in a future of abundance you wouldn t and we ought to think about ways to make it easier and better to not be employed Frase belongs to a small group of writers academics and economists they have been called post workists who welcome even root for the end of labor American society has an irrational belief in work for work s sake says Benjamin Hunnicutt another post workist and a historian at the University of Iowa even though most jobs aren t so uplifting A 2014 Gallup report of worker satisfaction found that as many as 70 percent of Americans don t feel engaged by their current job Hunnicutt told me that if a cashier s work were a video game grab an item find the bar code scan it slide the item onward and repeat critics of video games might call it mindless But when it s a job politicians praise its intrinsic dignity Purpose meaning identity fulfillment creativity autonomy all these things that positive psychology has shown us to be necessary for well being are absent in the average job he said The post workists are certainly right about some important things Paid labor does not always map to social good Raising children and caring for the sick is essential work and these jobs are compensated poorly or not at all In a post work society Hunnicutt said people might spend more time caring for their families and neighbors pride could come from our relationships rather than from our careers The post work proponents acknowledge that even in the best post work scenarios pride and jealousy will persevere because reputation will always be scarce even in an economy of abundance But with the right government provisions they believe the end of wage labor will allow for a golden age of well being Hunnicutt said he thinks colleges could reemerge as cultural centers rather than job prep institutions The word school he pointed out comes from skhol the Greek word for leisure We used to teach people to be free he said Now we teach them to work Hunnicutt s vision rests on certain assumptions about taxation and redistribution that might not be congenial to many Americans today But even leaving that aside for the moment this vision is problematic it doesn t resemble the world as it is currently experienced by most jobless people By and large the jobless don t spend their downtime socializing with friends or taking up new hobbies Instead they watch TV or sleep Time use surveys show that jobless prime age people dedicate some of the time once spent working to cleaning and childcare But men in particular devote most of their free time to leisure the lion s share of which is spent watching television browsing the Internet and sleeping Retired seniors watch about 50 hours of television a week according to Nielsen That means they spend a majority of their lives either sleeping or sitting on the sofa looking at a flatscreen The unemployed theoretically have the most time to socialize and yet studies have shown that they feel the most social isolation it is surprisingly hard to replace the camaraderie of the water cooler Most people want to work and are miserable when they cannot The ills of unemployment go well beyond the loss of income people who lose their job are more likely to suffer from mental and physical ailments There is a loss of status a general malaise and demoralization which appears somatically or psychologically or both says Ralph Catalano a public health professor at UC Berkeley Research has shown that it is harder to recover from a long bout of joblessness than from losing a loved one or suffering a life altering injury The very things that help many people recover from other emotional traumas a routine an absorbing distraction a daily purpose are not readily available to the unemployed The transition from labor force to leisure force would likely be particularly hard on Americans the worker bees of the rich world Between 1950 and 2012 annual hours worked per worker fell significantly throughout Europe by about 40 percent in Germany and the Netherlands but by only 10 percent in the United States Richer college educated Americans are working more than they did 30 years ago particularly when you count time working and answering e mail at home In 1989 the psychologists Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Judith LeFevre conducted a famous study of Chicago workers that found people at work often wished they were somewhere else But in questionnaires these same workers reported feeling better and less anxious in the office or at the plant than they did elsewhere The two psychologists called this the paradox of work many people are happier complaining about jobs than they are luxuriating in too much leisure Other researchers have used the term guilty couch potato to describe people who use media to relax but often feel worthless when they reflect on their unproductive downtime Contentment speaks in the present tense but something more pride comes only in reflection on past accomplishments The post workists argue that Americans work so hard because their culture has conditioned them to feel guilty when they are not being productive and that this guilt will fade as work ceases to be the norm This might prove true but it s an untestable hypothesis When I asked Hunnicutt what sort of modern community most resembles his ideal of a post work society he admitted I m not sure that such a place exists Less passive and more nourishing forms of mass leisure could develop Arguably they already are developing The Internet social media and gaming offer entertainments that are as easy to slip into as is watching TV but all are more purposeful and often less isolating Video games despite the derision aimed at them are vehicles for achievement of a sort Jeremy Bailenson a communications professor at Stanford says that as virtual reality technology improves people s cyber existence will become as rich and social as their real life Games in which users climb into another person s skin to embody his or her experiences firsthand don t just let people live out vicarious fantasies he has argued but also help you live as somebody else to teach you empathy and pro social skills But it s hard to imagine that leisure could ever entirely fill the vacuum of accomplishment left by the demise of labor Most people do need to achieve things through yes work to feel a lasting sense of purpose To envision a future that offers more than minute to minute satisfaction we have to imagine how millions of people might find meaningful work without formal wages So inspired by the predictions of one of America s most famous labor economists I took a detour on my way to Youngstown and stopped in Columbus Ohio 4 Communal Creativity The Artisans RevengeArtisans made up the original American middle class Before industrialization swept through the U S economy many people who didn t work on farms were silversmiths blacksmiths or woodworkers These artisans were ground up by the machinery of mass production in the 20th century But Lawrence Katz a labor economist at Harvard sees the next wave of automation returning us to an age of craftsmanship and artistry In particular he looks forward to the ramifications of 3 D printing whereby machines construct complex objects from digital designs The factories that arose more than a century ago could make Model Ts and forks and knives and mugs and glasses in a standardized cheap way and that drove the artisans out of business Katz told me But what if the new tech like 3 D printing machines can do customized things that are almost as cheap It s possible that information technology and robots eliminate traditional jobs and make possible a new artisanal economy an economy geared around self expression where people would do artistic things with their time In other words it would be a future not of consumption but of creativity as technology returns the tools of the assembly line to individuals democratizing the means of mass production Something like this future is already present in the small but growing number of industrial shops called makerspaces that have popped up in the United States and around the world The Columbus Idea Foundry is the country s largest such space a cavernous converted shoe factory stocked with industrial age machinery Several hundred members pay a monthly fee to use its arsenal of machines to make gifts and jewelry weld finish and paint play with plasma cutters and work an angle grinder or operate a lathe with a machinist When I arrived there on a bitterly cold afternoon in February a chalkboard standing on an easel by the door displayed three arrows pointing toward bathrooms pewter casting and zombies Near the entrance three men with black fingertips and grease stained shirts took turns fixing a 60 year old metal turning lathe Behind them a resident artist was tutoring an older woman on how to transfer her photographs onto a large canvas while a couple of guys fed pizza pies into a propane fired stone oven Elsewhere men in protective goggles welded a sign for a local chicken restaurant while others punched codes into a computer controlled laser cutting machine Beneath the din of drilling and wood cutting a Pandora rock station hummed tinnily from a Wi Fi connected Edison phonograph horn The foundry is not just a gymnasium of tools It is a social center Alex Bandar who started the foundry after receiving a doctorate in materials science and engineering has a theory about the rhythms of invention in American history Over the past century he told me the economy has moved from hardware to software from atoms to bits and people have spent more time at work in front of screens But as computers take over more tasks previously considered the province of humans the pendulum will swing back from bits to atoms at least when it comes to how people spend their days Bandar thinks that a digitally preoccupied society will come to appreciate the pure and distinct pleasure of making things you can touch I ve always wanted to usher in a new era of technology where robots do our bidding Bandar said If you have better batteries better robotics more dexterous manipulation then it s not a far stretch to say robots do most of the work So what do we do Play Draw Actually talk to each other again You don t need any particular fondness for plasma cutters to see the beauty of an economy where tens of millions of people make things they enjoy making whether physical or digital in buildings or in online communities and receive feedback and appreciation for their work The Internet and the cheap availability of artistic tools have already empowered millions of people to produce culture from their living rooms People upload more than 400 000 hours of YouTube videos and 350 million new Facebook photos every day The demise of the formal economy could free many would be artists writers and craftspeople to dedicate their time to creative interests to live as cultural producers Such activities offer virtues that many organizational psychologists consider central to satisfaction at work independence the chance to develop mastery and a sense of purpose After touring the foundry I sat at a long table with several members sharing the pizza that had come out of the communal oven I asked them what they thought of their organization as a model for a future where automation reached further into the formal economy A mixed media artist named Kate Morgan said that most people she knew at the foundry would quit their jobs and use the foundry to start their own business if they could Others spoke about the fundamental need to witness the outcome of one s work which was satisfied more deeply by craftsmanship than by other jobs they d held Late in the conversation we were joined by Terry Griner an engineer who had built miniature steam engines in his garage before Bandar invited him to join the foundry His fingers were covered in soot and he told me about the pride he had in his ability to fix things I ve been working since I was 16 I ve done food service restaurant work hospital work and computer programming I ve done a lot of different jobs said Griner who is now a divorced father But if we had a society that said We ll cover your essentials you can work in the shop I think that would be utopia That to me would be the best of all possible worlds 5 Contingency You re on Your Own One mile to the east of downtown Youngstown in a brick building surrounded by several empty lots is Royal Oaks an iconic blue collar dive At about 5 30 p m on a Wednesday the place was nearly full The bar glowed yellow and green from the lights mounted along a wall Old beer signs trophies masks and mannequins cluttered the back corner of the main room like party leftovers stuffed in an attic The scene was mostly middle aged men some in groups talking loudly about baseball and smelling vaguely of pot some drank alone at the bar sitting quietly or listening to music on headphones I spoke with several patrons there who work as musicians artists or handymen many did not hold a steady job It is the end of a particular kind of wage work said Hannah Woodroofe a bartender there who it turns out is also a graduate student at the University of Chicago She s writing a dissertation on Youngstown as a harbinger of the future of work A lot of people in the city make ends meet via post wage arrangements she said working for tenancy or under the table or trading services Places like Royal Oaks are the new union halls People go there not only to relax but also to find tradespeople for particular jobs like auto repair Others go to exchange fresh vegetables grown in urban gardens they ve created amid Youngstown s vacant lots When an entire area like Youngstown suffers from high and prolonged unemployment problems caused by unemployment move beyond the personal sphere widespread joblessness shatters neighborhoods and leaches away their civic spirit John Russo the Youngstown State professor who is a co author of a history of the city Steeltown USA says the local identity took a savage blow when residents lost the ability to find reliable employment I can t stress this enough this isn t just about economics it s psychological he told me Russo sees Youngstown as the leading edge of a larger trend toward the development of what he calls the precariat a working class that swings from task to task in order to make ends meet and suffers a loss of labor rights bargaining rights and job security In Youngstown many of these workers have by now made their peace with insecurity and poverty by building an identity and some measure of pride around contingency The faith they lost in institutions the corporations that have abandoned the city the police who have failed to keep them safe has not returned But Russo and Woodroofe both told me they put stock in their own independence And so a place that once defined itself single mindedly by the steel its residents made has gradually learned to embrace the valorization of well rounded resourcefulness Karen Schubert a 54 year old writer with two master s degrees accepted a part time job as a hostess at a caf in Youngstown early this year after spending months searching for full time work Schubert who has two grown children and an infant grandson said she d loved teaching writing and literature at the local university But many colleges have replaced full time professors with part time adjuncts in order to control costs and she d found that with the hours she could get adjunct teaching didn t pay a living wage so she d stopped I think I would feel like a personal failure if I didn t know that so many Americans have their leg caught in the same trap she said Among Youngstown s precariat one can see a third possible future where millions of people struggle for years to build a sense of purpose in the absence of formal jobs and where entrepreneurship emerges out of necessity But while it lacks the comforts of the consumption economy or the cultural richness of Lawrence Katz s artisanal future it is more complex than an outright dystopia There are young people working part time in the new economy who feel independent whose work and personal relationships are contingent and say they like it like this to have short hours so they have time to focus on their passions Russo said Schubert s wages at the caf are not enough to live on and in her spare time she sells books of her poetry at readings and organizes gatherings of the literary arts community in Youngstown where other writers many of them also underemployed share their prose The evaporation of work has deepened the local arts and music scene several residents told me because people who are inclined toward the arts have so much time to spend with one another We re a devastatingly poor and hemorrhaging population but the people who live here are fearless and creative and phenomenal Schubert said Whether or not one has artistic ambitions as Schubert does it is arguably growing easier to find short term gigs or spot employment Paradoxically technology is the reason A constellation of Internet enabled companies matches available workers with quick jobs most prominently including Uber for drivers Seamless for meal deliverers Homejoy for house cleaners and TaskRabbit for just about anyone else And online markets like Craigslist and eBay have likewise made it easier for people to take on small independent projects such as furniture refurbishing Although the on demand economy is not yet a major part of the employment picture the number of temporary help services workers has grown by 50 percent since 2010 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Some of these services too could be usurped eventually by machines But on demand apps also spread the work around by carving up jobs like driving a taxi into hundreds of little tasks like a single drive which allows more people to compete for smaller pieces of work These new arrangements are already challenging the legal definitions of employer and employee and there are many reasons to be ambivalent about them But if the future involves a declining number of full time jobs as in Youngstown then splitting some of the remaining work up among many part time workers instead of a few full timers wouldn t necessarily be a bad development We shouldn t be too quick to excoriate companies that let people combine their work art and leisure in whatever ways they choose Today the norm is to think about employment and unemployment as a black and white binary rather than two points at opposite ends of a wide spectrum of working arrangements As late as the mid 19th century though the modern concept of unemployment didn t exist in the United States Most people lived on farms and while paid work came and went home industry canning sewing carpentry was a constant Even in the worst economic panics people typically found productive things to do The despondency and helplessness of unemployment were discovered to the bafflement and dismay of cultural critics only after factory work became dominant and cities swelled The 21st century if it presents fewer full time jobs in the sectors that can be automated could in this respect come to resemble the mid 19th century an economy marked by episodic work across a range of activities the loss of any one of which would not make somebody suddenly idle Many bristle that contingent gigs offer a devil s bargain a bit of additional autonomy in exchange for a larger loss of security But some might thrive in a market where versatility and hustle are rewarded where there are as in Youngstown few jobs to have yet many things to do 6 Government The Visible HandIn the 1950s Henry Ford II the CEO of Ford and Walter Reuther the head of the United Auto Workers union were touring a new engine plant in Cleveland Ford gestured to a fleet of machines and said Walter how are you going to get these robots to pay union dues The union boss famously replied Henry how are you going to get them to buy your cars As Martin Ford no relation writes in his new book The Rise of the Robots this story might be apocryphal but its message is instructive We re pretty good at noticing the immediate effects of technology s substituting for workers such as fewer people on the factory floor What s harder is anticipating the second order effects of this transformation such as what happens to the consumer economy when you take away the consumers Technological progress on the scale we re imagining would usher in social and cultural changes that are almost impossible to fully envision Consider just how fundamentally work has shaped America s geography Today s coastal cities are a jumble of office buildings and residential space Both are expensive and tightly constrained But the decline of work would make many office buildings unnecessary What might that mean for the vibrancy of urban areas Would office space yield seamlessly to apartments allowing more people to live more affordably in city centers and leaving the cities themselves just as lively Or would we see vacant shells and spreading blight Would big cities make sense at all if their role as highly sophisticated labor ecosystems were diminished As the 40 hour workweek faded the idea of a lengthy twice daily commute would almost certainly strike future generations as an antiquated and baffling waste of time But would those generations prefer to live on streets full of high rises or in smaller towns Today many working parents worry that they spend too many hours at the office As full time work declined rearing children could become less overwhelming And because job opportunities historically have spurred migration in the United States we might see less of it the diaspora of extended families could give way to more closely knitted clans But if men and women lost their purpose and dignity as work went away those families would nonetheless be troubled The decline of the labor force would make our politics more contentious Deciding how to tax profits and distribute income could become the most significant economic policy debate in American history In The Wealth of Nations Adam Smith used the term invisible hand to refer to the order and social benefits that arise surprisingly from individuals selfish actions But to preserve the consumer economy and the social fabric governments might have to embrace what Haruhiko Kuroda the governor of the Bank of Japan has called the visible hand of economic intervention What follows is an early sketch of how it all might work In the near term local governments might do well to create more and more ambitious community centers or other public spaces where residents can meet learn skills bond around sports or crafts and socialize Two of the most common side effects of unemployment are loneliness on the individual level and the hollowing out of community pride A national policy that directed money toward centers in distressed areas might remedy the maladies of idleness and form the beginnings of a long term experiment on how to reengage people in their neighborhoods in the absence of full employment We could also make it easier for people to start their own small scale and even part time businesses New business formation has declined in the past few decades in all 50 states One way to nurture fledgling ideas would be to build out a network of business incubators Here Youngstown offers an unexpected model its business incubator has been recognized internationally and its success has brought new hope to West Federal Street the city s main drag Near the beginning of any broad decline in job availability the United States might take a lesson from Germany on job sharing The German government gives firms incentives to cut all their workers hours rather than lay off some of them during hard times So a company with 50 workers that might otherwise lay off 10 people instead reduces everyone s hours by 20 percent Such a policy would help workers at established firms keep their attachment to the labor force despite the declining amount of overall labor Spreading work in this way has its limits Some jobs can t be easily shared and in any case sharing jobs wouldn t stop labor s pie from shrinking it would only apportion the slices differently Eventually Washington would have to somehow spread wealth too One way of doing that would be to more heavily tax the growing share of income going to the owners of capital and use the money to cut checks to all adults This idea called a universal basic income has received bipartisan support in the past Many liberals currently support it and in the 1960s Richard Nixon and the conservative economist Milton Friedman each proposed a version of the idea That history notwithstanding the politics of universal income in a world without universal work would be daunting The rich could say with some accuracy that their hard work was subsidizing the idleness of millions of takers What s more although a universal income might replace lost wages it would do little to preserve the social benefits of work The most direct solution to the latter problem would be for the government to pay people to do something rather than nothing Although this smacks of old European socialism or Depression era makework it might do the most to preserve virtues such as responsibility agency and industriousness In the 1930s the Works Progress Administration did more than rebuild the nation s infrastructure It hired 40 000 artists and other cultural workers to produce music and theater murals and paintings state and regional travel guides and surveys of state records It s not impossible to imagine something like the WPA or an effort even more capacious for a post work future What might that look like Several national projects might justify direct hiring such as caring for a rising population of elderly people But if the balance of work continues to shift toward the small bore and episodic the simplest way to help everybody stay busy might be government sponsorship of a national online marketplace of work or alternatively a series of local ones sponsored by local governments Individuals could browse for large long term projects like cleaning up after a natural disaster or small short term ones an hour of tutoring an evening of entertainment an art commission The requests could come from local governments or community associations or nonprofit groups from rich families seeking nannies or tutors or from other individuals given some number of credits to spend on the site each year To ensure a baseline level of attachment to the workforce the government could pay adults a flat rate in return for some minimum level of activity on the site but people could always earn more by taking on more gigs Although a digital WPA might strike some people as a strange anachronism it would be similar to a federalized version of Mechanical Turk the popular Amazon sister site where individuals and companies post projects of varying complexity while so called Turks on the other end browse tasks and collect money for the ones they complete Mechanical Turk was designed to list tasks that cannot be performed by a computer The name is an allusion to an 18th century Austrian hoax in which a famous automaton that seemed to play masterful chess concealed a human player who chose the moves and moved the pieces A government marketplace might likewise specialize in those tasks that required empathy humanity or a personal touch By connecting millions of people in one central hub it might even inspire what the technology writer Robin Sloan has called a Cambrian explosion of mega scale creative and intellectual pursuits a generation of Wikipedia scale projects that can ask their users for even deeper commitments There s a case to be made for using the tools of government to provide other incentives as well to help people avoid the typical traps of joblessness and build rich lives and vibrant communities After all the members of the Columbus Idea Foundry probably weren t born with an innate love of lathe operation or laser cutting Mastering these skills requires discipline discipline requires an education and an education for many people involves the expectation that hours of often frustrating practice will eventually prove rewarding In a post work society the financial rewards of education and training won t be as obvious This is a singular challenge of imagining a flourishing post work society How will people discover their talents or the rewards that come from expertise if they don t see much incentive to develop either Modest payments to young people for attending and completing college skills training programs or community center workshops might eventually be worth considering This seems radical but the aim would be conservative to preserve the status quo of an educated and engaged society Whatever their career opportunities young people will still grow up to be citizens neighbors and even episodically workers Nudges toward education and training might be particularly beneficial to men who are more likely to withdraw into their living rooms when they become unemployed 7 Jobs and CallingsDecades from now perhaps the 20th century will strike future historians as an aberration with its religious devotion to overwork in a time of prosperity its attenuations of family in service to job opportunity its conflation of income with self worth The post work society I ve described holds a warped mirror up to today s economy but in many ways it reflects the forgotten norms of the mid 19th century the artisan middle class the primacy of local communities and the unfamiliarity with widespread joblessness The three potential futures of consumption communal creativity and contingency are not separate paths branching out from the present They re likely to intertwine and even influence one another Entertainment will surely become more immersive and exert a gravitational pull on people without much to do But if that s all that happens society will have failed The foundry in Columbus shows how the third places in people s lives communities separate from their homes and offices could become central to growing up learning new skills discovering passions And with or without such places many people will need to embrace the resourcefulness learned over time by cities like Youngstown which even if they seem like museum exhibits of an old economy might foretell the future for many more cities in the next 25 years On my last day in Youngstown I met with Howard Jesko a 60 year old Youngstown State graduate student at a burger joint along the main street A few months after Black Friday in 1977 as a senior at Ohio State University Jesko received a phone call from his father a specialty hose manufacturer near Youngstown Don t bother coming back here for a job his dad said There aren t going to be any left Years later Jesko returned to Youngstown to work but he recently quit his job selling products like waterproofing systems to construction companies his customers had been devastated by the Great Recession and weren t buying much anymore Around the same time a left knee replacement due to degenerative arthritis resulted in a 10 day hospital stay which gave him time to think about the future Jesko decided to go back to school to become a professor My true calling he told me has always been to teach One theory of work holds that people tend to see themselves in jobs careers or callings Individuals who say their work is just a job emphasize that they are working for money rather than aligning themselves with any higher purpose Those with pure careerist ambitions are focused not only on income but also on the status that comes with promotions and the growing renown of their peers But one pursues a calling not only for pay or status but also for the intrinsic fulfillment of the work itself When I think about the role that work plays in people s self esteem particularly in America the prospect of a no work future seems hopeless There is no universal basic income that can prevent the civic ruin of a country built on a handful of workers permanently subsidizing the idleness of tens of millions of people But a future of less work still holds a glint of hope because the necessity of salaried jobs now prevents so many from seeking immersive activities that they enjoy After my conversation with Jesko I walked back to my car to drive out of Youngstown I thought about Jesko s life as it might have been had Youngstown s steel mills never given way to a steel museum had the city continued to provide stable predictable careers to its residents If Jesko had taken a job in the steel industry he might be preparing for retirement today Instead that industry collapsed and then years later another recession struck The outcome of this cumulative grief is that Howard Jesko is not retiring at 60 He s getting his master s degree to become a teacher It took the loss of so many jobs to force him to pursue the work he always wanted to do After a Vietnam veteran encountered a grizzly bear in Yellowstone he pledged to dedicate his life to protecting the animals The Red Sox players who visit the White House owe their black and brown teammates an explanation So far the conversation about the upcoming Boston Red Sox visit to Donald Trump s White House has centered around the people of color who are skipping the event The manager Alex Cora a critic of the Trump administration s inexcusable treatment of Puerto Rico amid the devastation of Hurricane Maria in 2017 cited his home island s continuing troubles as his reason for opting out Unfortunately we are still struggling still fighting Cora said in a statement Some people still lack basic necessities others remain without electricity and many homes and schools are in pretty bad shape almost a year and a half after Hurricane Maria struck I ve used my voice on many occasions so that Puerto Ricans are not forgotten and my absence is no different As such at this moment I don t feel comfortable celebrating in the White House Seventy years in the success of a united Germany is a story so big that it can be hard to see except at a distance After the defeat of Nazi Germany the U S occupation authorities carried out a series of public opinion surveys in the American occupation zone One question asked whether Nazism was a bad idea or a good idea badly carried out In his history of postwar Germany Frederick Taylor writes The view that Nazism had been simply and unequivocally a bad idea was never held by more than 40 percent of respondents and by the end of the third post war winter that number had declined to 30 percent with double that number 60 percent now insisting that Nazism had been a good idea gone wrong Milton Mayer a German speaking American journalist lived for the year 1952 in a small town in the state of Hesse Mayer befriended and interviewed 10 men who had taken part in the burning of the town s synagogue With one sole exception he found them not only unrepentant but strongly convinced of their own victimhood The other nine decent hard working ordinarily intelligent and honest men did not know before 1933 that Nazism was evil They did not know between 1933 and 1945 that it was evil And they do not know it now None of them ever knew or now knows Nazism as we knew and know it and they lived under it served it and indeed made it And even that one exception only partially rejected Nazism He still believes in part of its program and practice the democratic part You don t have to love yourself before you can love someone else Six months after her divorce Jo Carter a project manager at a university in Madison Wisconsin thought she was ready to date She had married her high school prom date a year after graduating from college and they were together for 19 years before splitting up So I m newly divorced at 41 and I haven t been on a date with someone new since I was 20 maybe she says And the dating scene is a little different now So she did what many people these days do she made an online dating profile on OkCupid But partway through the process my gut just said no and I panicked and canceled my account in a huff says Carter now 49 Someone said something like Hey you re into crosswords I m into crosswords too maybe we could get together and do the crossword some morning And I was clawing at the keyboard in a panic to make this go away I just sat there looking at my computer thinking What just happened here They re not the only ones at fault For New York City s wealthiest inhabitants the advent of spring means gala season a string of fancy expensive parties benefiting museums cultural institutions such as the ballet and other charitable causes Every year the season hits its crescendo on the first Monday in May with the Metropolitan Museum of Art s Costume Institute Gala The party is the toughest ticket in town with a more opulent red carpet than even the Academy Awards It gets name checked by rappers and featured in Hollywood blockbusters For people with even a passing interest in high fashion it s the Super Bowl Like the Super Bowl the Met Gala s red carpet often leaves observers feeling like what they saw wasn t quite the world class effort they were promised The problem is usually with the parties themes which require revelers to dress in celebration of the Costume Institute s annual exhibit Every year in spite of months of notice and the event s near unlimited resources attendees screw up the theme From Russia to Venezuela the strongmen who have destroyed democratic institutions won high office at the ballot box When Recep Erdogan was first elected Prime Minister of Turkey in 2003 he vowed to respect the country s democratic institutions and to vacate office if he ever lost the public s trust The reality of Erdogan s rule has been rather more bleak Although international newspapers and magazines initially portrayed him as a democratic reformer he systematically expanded his powers and purged opponents from top positions in the army the civil service and the country s educational institutions When former allies tried to oust him in a coup in the summer of 2016 he used the occasion to consolidate his hold over the country Thanks to the vast emergency powers he claimed within days of the failed putsch he was able to dismiss tens of thousands of civil servants he considered politically unreliable and to jail some of the country s most prominent journalists The Democrats are rapidly becoming the party of the young and the consequences could be profound There is a mysterious cycle in human events said Franklin Delano Roosevelt accepting the Democratic nomination for president in Philadelphia in 1936 To some generations much is given Of others much is expected This generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny In the 20th century many sociologists and historians flirted with the idea that generational changes could explain U S politics The historians Arthur Schlesinger Sr and Jr wrote about cycles of American history arguing that as the generations turn American politics rotates inexorably between liberal and conservative consensus More recently a new generational scheme has come into vogue William Strauss and Neil Howe s theory of the fourth turning predicts a crisis and a major political realignment every 80 to 90 years Strauss and Howe were briefly in the spotlight in 2016 after Steve Bannon praised their work Trying to get professors fired because you don t like their views isn t activism it s preening would be totalitarianism When did college students get it into their head that they should be running the university The distressing trend of students somehow thinking that they re the teachers began in earnest in the 1960s a time when at least some of the grievances of campus protesters from racism and sexism to the possibility of being sent to die in Southeast Asia made sense A more noxious version of this trend however is now in full swing with students demanding a say in the hiring and firing of faculty whose views they merely happen not to like This is a dangerous development a triple threat to free speech to the education of future citizens and to the value of a college education It is no surprise to find Camille Paglia a professor at Philadelphia s University of the Arts who has been outraging people across the social and political spectrum for three decades embroiled in one of these controversies Paglia proposed to give a talk titled Ambiguous Images Sexual Duality and Sexual Multiplicity in Western Art According to a letter released by two student activists a gender non binary creative writing major had brought this lecture to the student body s attention through social media and raised their concerns to Title IX and other University administration about the school giving Camille a platform This led to a group of students demanding that Paglia who self identifies as transgender be removed from the faculty and replaced by a queer person of color When mothers feel lucky to have any help at all it s an impediment to the elusive goal of equity in the home I ve spent the past year interviewing married or cohabiting heterosexual mothers across the United States about the distribution of child care labor in their home Most of them did the lion s share of the work and were angry with their partner Yet many of them told me they were grateful Over and over again I heard women complain that they were doing more than their partner only to then insist that they were lucky to have any help at all Take Andrea a full time marketing professional in Portland Maine and the mother of an elementary school age child Although she sometimes feels that her husband Patrick who works for a health insurance company is right there with her Andrea says he behaves like her junior apprentice in child rearing These aren t their real names I granted my subjects anonymity in exchange for candor The Lord of the Rings author once wrote a short tale about a painter that elegantly argues for the value of escapism in literature There s good reason to discuss hobbits again this spring On Friday a biopic about the life of J R R Tolkien opens in theaters nationwide just as an exhibition of the author s art manuscripts and maps concludes at the Morgan Library and Museum in New York City The mumbling mild mannered Oxford professor who brought imaginary realms to life remains one of the most popular writers in the world more than 60 years after the publication of The Lord of the Rings And if six Hollywood blockbusters weren t enough Amazon Prime is now producing a new series based on less explored parts of the Middle earth mythology Such runaway success was never guaranteed for Tolkien A close look at his life reveals that he faced fierce criticism and had his own doubts about his writing career Tolkien was perhaps never so unsure of the future than in January 1945 when with World War II winding down and The Lord of the Rings still nearly 10 years away from being released he published a semi autobiographical short story titled Leaf by Niggle in The Dublin Review The story provides a window into Tolkien s creative process and his hope that fantasy stories oft considered mere children s fare would gain a genuine foothold in literature and transport readers to new realms Credentialed authorities are comically bad at predicting the future But reliable forecasting is possible The bet was on and it was over the fate of humanity On one side was the Stanford biologist Paul R Ehrlich In his 1968 best seller The Population Bomb Ehrlich insisted that it was too late to prevent a doomsday apocalypse resulting from overpopulation Resource shortages would cause hundreds of millions of starvation deaths within a decade It was cold hard math The human population was growing exponentially the food supply was not Ehrlich was an accomplished butterfly specialist He knew that nature did not regulate animal populations delicately Populations exploded blowing past the available resources and then crashed In his book Ehrlich played out hypothetical scenarios that represented the kinds of disasters that will occur In the worst case scenario famine rages across the planet Russia China and the United States are dragged into nuclear war and the resulting environmental degradation soon extinguishes the human race In the cheerful scenario population controls begin Famine spreads and countries teeter but the major death wave ends in the mid 1980s Only half a billion or so people die of starvation I challenge you to create one more optimistic Ehrlich wrote adding that he would not count scenarios involving benevolent aliens bearing care packages After a Vietnam veteran encountered a grizzly bear in Yellowstone he pledged to dedicate his life to protecting the animals Uncovering the link between early trauma and lifelong illness There s no new generation to inherit George s Creek Baptist Church TheAtlantic com Copyright c 2019 by The Atlantic Monthly Group All Rights Reserved The AtlanticWork has ruled our lives for centuries and it does so today more than ever But a new generation of thinkers insists there is an alternative By Andy BeckettFri 19 Jan 2018 00 45 EST Last modified on Mon 22 Jan 2018 12 58 ESTWork is the master of the modern world For most people it is impossible to imagine society without it It dominates and pervades everyday life especially in Britain and the US more completely than at any time in recent history An obsession with employability runs through education Even severely disabled welfare claimants are required to be work seekers Corporate superstars show off their epic work schedules Hard working families are idealised by politicians Friends pitch each other business ideas Tech companies persuade their employees that round the clock work is play Gig economy companies claim that round the clock work is freedom Workers commute further strike less retire later Digital technology lets work invade leisure In all these mutually reinforcing ways work increasingly forms our routines and psyches and squeezes out other influences As Joanna Biggs put it in her quietly disturbing 2015 book All Day Long A Portrait of Britain at Work Work is how we give our lives meaning when religion party politics and community fall away And yet work is not working for ever more people in ever more ways We resist acknowledging these as more than isolated problems such is work s centrality to our belief systems but the evidence of its failures is all around us As a source of subsistence let alone prosperity work is now insufficient for whole social classes In the UK almost two thirds of those in poverty around 8 million people are in working households In the US the average wage has stagnated for half a century As a source of social mobility and self worth work increasingly fails even the most educated people supposedly the system s winners In 2017 half of recent UK graduates were officially classified as working in a non graduate role In the US belief in work is crumbling among people in their 20s and 30s says Benjamin Hunnicutt a leading historian of work They are not looking to their job for satisfaction or social advancement You can sense this every time a graduate with a faraway look makes you a latte Work is increasingly precarious more zero hours or short term contracts more self employed people with erratic incomes more corporate restructurings for those still with actual jobs As a source of sustainable consumer booms and mass home ownership for much of the 20th century the main successes of mainstream western economic policy work is discredited daily by our ongoing debt and housing crises For many people not just the very wealthy work has become less important financially than inheriting money or owning a home Whether you look at a screen all day or sell other underpaid people goods they can t afford more and more work feels pointless or even socially damaging what the American anthropologist David Graeber called bullshit jobs in a famous 2013 article Among others Graeber condemned private equity CEOs lobbyists PR researchers telemarketers bailiffs and the ancillary industries dog washers all night pizza delivery that only exist because everyone is spending so much of their time working The argument seemed subjective and crude but economic data increasingly supports it The growth of productivity or the value of what is produced per hour worked is slowing across the rich world despite the constant measurement of employee performance and intensification of work routines that makes more and more jobs barely tolerable Unsurprisingly work is increasingly regarded as bad for your health Stress an overwhelming to do list and long hours sitting at a desk the Cass Business School professor Peter Fleming notes in his new book The Death of Homo Economicus are beginning to be seen by medical authorities as akin to smoking Work is badly distributed People have too much or too little or both in the same month And away from our unpredictable all consuming workplaces vital human activities are increasingly neglected Workers lack the time or energy to raise children attentively or to look after elderly relations The crisis of work is also a crisis of home declared the social theorists Helen Hester and Nick Srnicek in a paper last year This neglect will only get worse as the population grows and ages And finally beyond all these dysfunctions loom the most discussed most existential threats to work as we know it automation and the state of the environment Some recent estimates suggest that between a third and a half of all jobs could be taken over by artificial intelligence in the next two decades Other forecasters doubt whether work can be sustained in its current toxic form on a warming planet Like an empire that has expanded too far work may be both more powerful and more vulnerable than ever before We know work s multiplying problems intimately but it feels impossible to solve them all Is it time to start thinking of an alternative Our culture of work strains to cover its flaws by claiming to be unavoidable and natural Mankind is hardwired to work as the Conservative MP Nick Boles puts it in a new book Square Deal It is an argument most of us have long internalised But not quite all The idea of a world freed from work wholly or in part has been intermittently expressed and mocked and suppressed for as long as modern capitalism has existed Repeatedly the promise of less work has been prominent in visions of the future In 1845 Karl Marx wrote that in a communist society workers would be freed from the monotony of a single draining job to hunt in the morning fish in the afternoon rear cattle in the evening criticise after dinner In 1884 the socialist William Morris proposed that in beautiful factories of the future surrounded by gardens for relaxation employees should work only four hours a day In 1930 the economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that by the early 21st century advances in technology would lead to an age of leisure and abundance in which people might work 15 hours a week In 1980 as robots began to depopulate factories the French social and economic theorist Andr Gorz declared The abolition of work is a process already underway The manner in which it is to be managed constitutes the central political issue of the coming decades Since the early 2010s as the crisis of work has become increasingly unavoidable in the US and the UK these heretical ideas have been rediscovered and developed further Brief polemics such as Graeber s bullshit jobs have been followed by more nuanced books creating a rapidly growing literature that critiques work as an ideology sometimes labelling it workism and explores what could take its place A new anti work movement has taken shape Graeber Hester Srnicek Hunnicutt Fleming and others are members of a loose transatlantic network of thinkers who advocate a profoundly different future for western economies and societies and also for poorer countries where the crises of work and the threat to it from robots and climate change are they argue even greater They call this future post work For some of these writers this future must include a universal basic income UBI currently post work s most high profile and controversial idea paid by the state to every working age person so that they can survive when the great automation comes For others the debate about the affordability and morality of a UBI is a distraction from even bigger issues Post work may be a rather grey and academic sounding phrase but it offers enormous alluring promises that life with much less work or no work at all would be calmer more equal more communal more pleasurable more thoughtful more politically engaged more fulfilled in short that much of human experience would be transformed To many people this will probably sound outlandish foolishly optimistic and quite possibly immoral But the post workists insist they are the realists now Either automation or the environment or both will force the way society thinks about work to change says David Frayne a radical young Welsh academic whose 2015 book The Refusal of Work is one of the most persuasive post work volumes So are we the utopians Or are the utopians the people who think work is going to carry on as it is One of post work s best arguments is that contrary to conventional wisdom the work ideology is neither natural nor very old Work as we know it is a recent construct says Hunnicutt Like most historians he identifies the main building blocks of our work culture as 16th century Protestantism which saw effortful labour as leading to a good afterlife 19th century industrial capitalism which required disciplined workers and driven entrepreneurs and the 20th century desires for consumer goods and self fulfillment The emergence of the modern work ethic from this chain of phenomena was an accident of history Hunnicutt says Before then All cultures thought of work as a means to an end not an end in itself From urban ancient Greece to agrarian societies work was either something to be outsourced to others often slaves or something to be done as quickly as possible so that the rest of life could happen Even once the new work ethic was established working patterns continued to shift and be challenged Between 1800 and 1900 the average working week in the west shrank from about 80 hours to about 60 hours From 1900 to the 1970s it shrank steadily further to roughly 40 hours in the US and the UK Trade union pressure technological change enlightened employers and government legislation all progressively eroded the dominance of work Sometimes economic shocks accelerated the process In Britain in 1974 Edward Heath s Conservative government faced with a chronic energy shortage caused by an international oil crisis and a miners strike imposed a national three day working week For the two months it lasted people s non work lives expanded Golf courses were busier and fishing tackle shops reported large sales increases Audiences trebled for late night BBC radio DJs such as John Peel Some men did more housework the Colchester Evening Gazette interviewed a young married printer who had taken over the hoovering Even the Daily Mail loosened up with one columnist suggesting that parents experiment more in their sex lives while the children are doing a five day week at school The economic consequences were mixed Most people s earnings fell Working days became longer Yet a national survey of companies for the government by the management consultants Inbucon AIC found that productivity improved by about 5 a huge increase by Britain s usual sluggish standards Thinking was stimulated inside Whitehall and some companies the consultants noted on the possibility of arranging a permanent four day week Nothing came of it But during the 60s and 70s ideas about redefining work or escaping it altogether were commonplace in Europe and the US from corporate retreats to the counterculture to academia where a new discipline was established leisure studies the study of recreations such as sport and travel In 1979 Bernard Lefkowitz then a well known American journalist published Breaktime Living Without Work in a Nine to Five World a book based on interviews with 100 people who had given up their jobs He found a former architect who tinkered with houseboats and bartered an ex reporter who canned his own tomatoes and listened to a lot of opera and a former cleaner who enjoyed lie ins and a sundeck overlooking the Pacific Many of the interviewees were living in California and despite moments of drift and doubt they reported new feelings of wholeness and openness to experience By the end of the 70s it was possible to believe that the relatively recent supremacy of work might be coming to an end in the more comfortable parts of the west Labour saving computer technologies were becoming widely available for the first time Frequent strikes provided highly public examples of work routines being interrupted and challenged And crucially wages were high enough for most people to make working less a practical possibility Instead the work ideology was reimposed During the 80s the aggressively pro business governments of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan strengthened the power of employers and used welfare cuts and moralistic rhetoric to create a much harsher environment for people without jobs David Graeber who is an anarchist as well as an anthropologist argues that these policies were motivated by a desire for social control After the political turbulence of the 60s and 70s he says Conservatives freaked out at the prospect of everyone becoming hippies and abandoning work They thought What will become of the social order It sounds like a conspiracy theory but Hunnicutt who has studied the ebb and flow of work in the west for almost 50 years says Graeber has a point I do think there is a fear of freedom a fear among the powerful that people might find something better to do than create profits for capitalism During the 90s and 00s the counter revolution in favour of work was consolidated by centre left politicians In Britain under Tony Blair s government the political and cultural status of work reached a zenith Unemployment was lower than it had been for decades More women than ever were working Wages for most people were rising New Labour s minimum wage and working tax credits lifted and subsidised the earnings of the low paid Poverty fell steadily The chancellor Gordon Brown one of the country s most famous workaholics appeared to have found a formula that linked work to social justice A large part of the left has always organised itself around work Union activists have fought to preserve it by opposing redundancies and sometimes to extend it by securing overtime agreements With the Labour party the clue is in the name says Chuka Umunna the centre left Labour MP and former shadow business secretary who has become a prominent critic of post work thinking as it has spread beyond academia The New Labour governments were also responding Umunna says to the failure of their Conservative predecessors to actually live up to their pro work rhetoric There had been such high levels of unemployment under the Tories our focus was always going to be pro job In this earnest purposeful context the anti work tradition when it was remembered at all could seem a bit decadent One of its few remaining British manifestations was the Idler magazine which was set up in 1993 and acquired a cult status beyond its modest circulation In its elegantly retro pages often rather posh men wrote about the pleasures of laziness while on the side busily producing books and newspaper articles and running a creative consultancy with corporate clients Idle Industries By the early 21st century the work culture seemed inescapable The work culture has many more critics now In the US sharp recent books such as Private Government How Employers Rule Our Lives and Why We Don t Talk About It by the philosopher Elizabeth Anderson and No More Work Why Full Employment Is a Bad Idea by the historian James Livingston have challenged the dictatorial powers and assumptions of modern employers and also the deeply embedded American notion that the solution to any problem is working harder In the UK even professionally optimistic business journals have begun to register the extent of work s crises In his 2016 book The Wealth of Humans Work and its Absence in the 21st Century the Economist columnist Ryan Avent predicted that automation would lead to a period of wrenching political change before a broadly acceptable social system emerges Post work ideas are also circulating in party politics Last April the Green party proposed that weekends be lengthened to three days In 2016 shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour was developing a proposal for a UBI in the UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told his party conference last September that automation can be the gateway for a new settlement between work and leisure a springboard for expanded creativity and culture It felt like a watershed moment says Will Stronge head of Autonomy a British thinktank set up last year to explore the crisis of work and find ways out of it We re in contact with Labour and we re going to meet the Greens soon Like most British post workists he is leftwing in his politics part of the new milieu of ambitious young activist intellectuals that has grown up around Corbyn s leadership We haven t talked to people on the right Stronge admits No one s got in contact with us Yet post work has the potential to appeal to conservatives Some post workists think work should not be abolished but redistributed so that every adult labours for roughly the same satisfying but not exhausting number of hours We could say to people on the right You think work is good for people So everyone should have this good thing says James Smith a post workist whose day job is lecturing in 18th century English literature at Royal Holloway University of London Working less also ought to be attractive to conservatives who value the family Outside the insular intense working cultures of Britain and the US the reduction of work has long been a mainstream notion In France in 2000 Lionel Jospin s leftwing coalition government introduced a maximum 35 hour week for all employees partly to reduce unemployment and promote gender equality under the slogan Work less live more The law was not absolute some overtime was permitted and has been weakened since but many employers have opted to keep a 35 hour week In Germany the largest trade union IG Metall which represents electrical and metal workers is campaigning for shift workers and people caring for children or other relatives to have the option of a 28 hour week Even in Britain and the US the vogues for downshifting and work life balance during the 90s and 00s represented an admission that the intensification of work was damaging our lives But these were solutions for individuals and often wealthy individuals the rock star Alex James attracted huge media attention for becoming a cheesemaker in the Cotswolds rather than society as a whole And these were solutions intended to bring minimal disruption to a free market economy that was still relatively popular and functional We are not in that world any more And yet the difficulty of shedding the burdens and satisfactions of work is obvious when you meet the post workists Explorers of a huge economic and social territory that has been neglected for decades like Keynes and other thinkers who challenged the rule of work they alternate between confidence and doubt I love my job Helen Hester a professor of media and communication at the University of West London told me There s no boundary between my time off and on I m always doing admin or marking or writing something I m working the equivalent of two jobs Later in our interview which took place in a cafe among other customers working on laptops a ubiquitous modern example of leisure s colonisation by work she said knowingly but wearily Post work is a lot of work Yet the post workists argue that it is precisely their work saturated lives and their experience of the increasing precarity of white collar employment that qualify them to demand a different world Like many post workists Stronge has been employed for years on poorly paid short term academic contracts I ve worked as a breakfast cook I ve been a Domino s delivery driver he told me I once worked in an Indian restaurant while I was teaching My students would come in to eat and see me cooking and say Hi is that you Will Unconsciously that s why Autonomy came about James Smith was the only post workist I met who had decided to do less work I have one weekday off and cram everything into the other days he said as we sat in his overstuffed office on the Royal Holloway campus outside London I spend it with our one and a half year old It s a very small post work gesture But it was a strange sensation at first almost like launching myself off the side of a swimming pool It felt alien almost impossible to do without the moral power of having a child to look after Defenders of the work culture such as business leaders and mainstream politicians habitually question whether pent up modern workers have the ability to enjoy or even survive the open vistas of time and freedom that post work thinkers envisage for them In 1989 two University of Chicago psychologists Judith LeFevre and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi conducted a famous experiment that seemed to support this view They recruited 78 people with manual clerical and managerial jobs at local companies and gave them electronic pagers For a week at frequent but random intervals at work and at home these employees were contacted and asked to fill in questionnaires about what they were doing and how they were feeling The experiment found that people reported many more positive feelings at work than in leisure At work they were regularly in a state the psychologists called flow enjoying the moment by using their knowledge and abilities to the full while also learning new skills and increasing self esteem Away from work flow rarely occurred The employees mainly chose to watch TV try to sleep and in general vegetate even though they did not enjoy doing these things US workers the psychologists concluded had an inability to organise their psychic energy in unstructured free time To the post workists such findings are simply a sign of how unhealthy the work culture has become Our ability to do anything else only exercised in short bursts is like a muscle that has atrophied Leisure is a capacity Frayne says Graeber argues that in a less labour intensive society our capacity for things other than work could be built up again People will come up with stuff to do if you give them enough time I lived in a village in Madagascar once There was this intricate sociability People would hang around in cafes gossiping having affairs using magic It was a very complex drama the kind that can only develop when you have enough time They certainly weren t bored In western countries too he argues the absence of work would produce a richer culture The postwar years when people worked less and it was easier to be on the dole produced beat poetry avant garde theatre 50 minute drum solos and all Britain s great pop music art forms that take time to produce and consume The return of the drum solo may not be everyone s idea of progress But the possibilities of post work like all visions of the future walk a difficult line between being too concrete and too airy Stronge suggests a daily routine for post work citizens that would include a provocative degree of state involvement You get your UBI payment from the government Then you get a form from your local council telling you about things going on in your area a five a side football tournament say or community activism Big Society stuff almost Other scenarios he proposes may disappoint those who dream of non stop leisure I m under no illusion that paid work is going to disappear entirely It just may not be directed by someone else You take as long as you want have a long lunch spread the work though the day Town and city centres today are arranged for work and consumption work s co conspirator and very little else this is one of the reasons a post work world is so hard to imagine Adapting office blocks and other workplaces for other purposes would be a huge task which the post workists have only just begun to think about One common proposal is for a new type of public building usually envisaged as a well equipped combination of library leisure centre and artists studios It could have social and care spaces equipment for programming for making videos and music record decks says Stronge It would be way beyond a community centre which can be quite depressing This vision of state supported but liberated and productive citizens owes a lot to Ivan Illich the half forgotten Austrian social critic who was a leftwing guru during the 70s In his intoxicating 1973 book Tools for Conviviality Illich attacked the serfdom created by industrial machinery and demanded Give people tools that guarantee their right to work with high independent efficiency from power drills to mechanised pushcarts Illich wanted the public to rediscover what he saw as the freedom of the medieval artisan while also embracing the latest technology There is a strong artisan tendency in today s post work movement As Hester characterises it Instead of having jobs we re going to do craft to make our own clothes It s quite an exclusionary vision to do those things you need to be able bodied She also detects a deeper conservative impulse It s almost as if some people are saying Since we re going to challenge work other things have to stay the same Instead she would like the movement to think more radically about the nuclear home and family Both have been so shaped by work she argues that a post work society will redraw them The disappearance of the paid job could finally bring about one of the oldest goals of feminism that housework and raising children are no longer accorded a lower status With people having more time and probably less money private life could also become more communal she suggests with families sharing kitchens domestic appliances and larger facilities There have been examples of this before she says like Red Vienna in the early 20th century when the social democratic city government built housing estates with communal laundries workshops and shared living spaces that were quite luxurious Post work is about the future but it is also bursting with the past s lost possibilities Now that work is so ubiquitous and dominant will today s post workists succeed where all their other predecessors did not In Britain possibly the sharpest outside judge of the movement is Frederick Harry Pitts a lecturer in management at Bristol University Pitts used to be a post workist himself He is young and leftwing and before academia he worked in call centres he knows how awful a lot of modern work is Yet Pitts is suspicious of how closely the life post workists envisage creative collaborative high minded resembles the life they already live There is little wonder the uptake for post work thinking has been so strong among journalists and academics as well as artists and creatives he wrote in a paper co authored last year with Ana Dinerstein of Bath University since for these groups the alternatives to traditional work require little adaptation Pitts also argues that post work s optimistic visions can be a way of avoiding questions about power in the world A post work society is meant to resolve conflicts between different economic interest groups that s part of its appeal he told me Tired of the never ending task of making work better some socialists have latched on to post work he argues in the hope that exploitation can finally be ended by getting rid of work altogether He says this is both defeatist and naive Struggles between economic interest groups can t ever be entirely resolved Yet Pitts is much more positive about post work s less absolutist proposals such as redistributing working hours more equally There has to be a major change to work he says In that sense these people want the right thing Other critics of post work are also less dismissive than they first sound Despite being a Tory MP from the most pro business wing of his party Nick Boles accepts in his book that a future society may redefine work to include child rearing and taking care of elderly relatives and finally start valuing these contributions properly Post work is spreading feminist ideas to new places Hunnicutt the historian of work sees the US as more resistant than other countries to post work ideas at least for now When he wrote an article for the website Politico in 2014 arguing for shorter working hours he was shocked by the reaction it provoked It was a harsh experience he says There were personal attacks by email and telephone that I was some sort of communist and devil worshipper Yet he senses weakness behind such strenuous efforts to shut the work conversation down The role of work has changed profoundly before It s going to change again It s probably already in the process of changing The millennial generation know that the Prince Charming job that will meet all your needs has gone After meeting Pitts in Bristol I went to a post work event there organised by Autonomy It was a bitter Monday evening but liberal Bristol likes social experiments and the large city centre room was almost full There were students professionals in their 30s even a middle aged farmer They listened attentively for two hours while Frayne and two other panellists listed the oppressions of work and then hazily outlined what could replace it When the audience finally asked questions they all accepted the post workists basic premises An appetite for a society that treats work differently certainly exists But it is not so far overwhelming the evening s total attendance was less than 70 And yet as Frayne points out in some ways we re already in a post work society But it s a dystopic one Office employees constantly interrupting their long days with online distractions gig economy workers whose labour plays no part in their sense of identity and all the people in depressed post industrial places who have quietly given up trying to earn the spectre of post work runs through the hard shiny culture of modern work like hidden rust Last October research by Sheffield Hallam University revealed that UK unemployment is three times higher than the official count of those claiming the dole thanks to people who come under the broader definition of unemployment used by the Labour Force Survey or are receiving incapacity benefits When Frayne is not talking and writing about post work or doing his latest temporary academic job he sometimes makes a living collecting social data for the Welsh government in former mining towns There is lots of worklessness he says but with no social policies to dignify it Creating a more benign post work world will be more difficult now than it would have been in the 70s In today s lower wage economy suggesting people do less work for less pay is a hard sell As with free market capitalism in general the worse work gets the harder it is to imagine actually escaping it so enormous are the steps required But for those who think work will just carry on as it is there is a warning from history On 1 May 1979 one of the greatest champions of the modern work culture Margaret Thatcher made her final campaign speech before being elected prime minister She reflected on the nature of change in politics and society The heresies of one period she said always become the orthodoxies of the next The end of work as we know it will seem unthinkable until it has happened Main illustration Nathalie Lees Follow the Long Read on Twitter at gdnlongread or sign up to the long read weekly email

ParadaI want to tell you straight off what this story is about Sometime in the next 40 years robots are going to take your job I don t care what your job is If you dig ditches a robot will dig them better If you re a magazine writer a robot will write your articles better If you re a doctor IBM s Watson will no longer assist you in finding the right diagnosis from its database of millions of case studies and journal articles It will just be a better doctor than you And CEOs Sorry Robots will run companies better than you do Artistic types Robots will paint and write and sculpt better than you Think you have social skills that no robot can match Yes they can Within 20 years maybe half of you will be out of jobs A couple of decades after that most of the rest of you will be out of jobs In one sense this all sounds great Let the robots have the damn jobs No more dragging yourself out of bed at 6 a m or spending long days on your feet We ll be free to read or write poetry or play video games or whatever we want to do And a century from now this is most likely how things will turn out Humanity will enter a golden age But what about 20 years from now Or 30 We won t all be out of jobs by then but a lot of us will and it will be no golden age Until we figure out how to fairly distribute the fruits of robot labor it will be an era of mass joblessness and mass poverty Working class job losses played a big role in the 2016 election and if we don t want a long succession of demagogues blustering their way into office because machines are taking away people s livelihoods this needs to change and fast Along with global warming the transition to a workless future is the biggest challenge by far that progressive politics not to mention all of humanity faces And yet it s barely on our radar We Already Have a Solution for the Robot Apocalypse It s 200 Years Old That s kind of a buzzkill isn t it Luckily it s traditional that stories about difficult or technical subjects open with an entertaining or provocative anecdote The idea is that this allows readers to ease slowly into daunting material So here s one for you Last year at Christmas I was over at my mother s house and mentioned that I had recently read an article about Google Translate It turns out that a few weeks previously without telling anyone Google had switched over to a new machine learning algorithm Almost overnight the quality of its translations skyrocketed I had noticed some improvement myself but had chalked it up to the usual incremental progress these kinds of things go through I hadn t realized it was due to a quantum leap in software But if Google s translation algorithm was better did that mean its voice recognition was better too And its ability to answer queries Hmm How could we test that We decided to open presents instead of cogitating over this But after that was over the subject of erasers somehow came up Which ones are best Clear Black Traditional pink Come to think of it why are erasers traditionally pink I ll ask Google I told everyone So I pulled out my phone and said Why are erasers pink Half a second later Google told me Not impressed You should be We all know that phones can recognize voices tolerably well these days And we know they can find the nearest caf or the trendiest recipe for coq au vin But what about something entirely random And not a simple who where or when question This was a why question and it wasn t about why the singer Pink uses erasers or why erasers are jinxed Google has to be smart enough to figure out in context that I said pink and that I m asking about the historical reason for the color of erasers not their health or the way they re shaped And it did In less than a second With nothing more than a cheap little microprocessor and a slow link to the internet In case you re curious Google got the answer from Design Sponge The eraser was originally produced by the Eberhard Faber Company The erasers featured pumice a volcanic ash from Italy that gave them their abrasive quality along with their distinctive color and smell Still not impressed When Watson famously won a round of Jeopardy against the two best human players of all time it needed a computer the size of a bedroom to answer questions like this That was only seven years ago What do pink erasers have to do with the fact that we re all going to be out of a job in a few decades Consider Last October an Uber trucking subsidiary named Otto delivered 2 000 cases of Budweiser 120 miles from Fort Collins Colorado to Colorado Springs without a driver at the wheel Within a few years this technology will go from prototype to full production and that means millions of truck drivers will be out of a job Automated trucking doesn t rely on newfangled machines like the powered looms and steam shovels that drove the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century Instead like Google s ability to recognize spoken words and answer questions self driving trucks and cars and buses and ships rely primarily on software that mimics human intelligence By now everyone s heard the predictions that self driving cars could lead to 5 million jobs being lost but few people understand that once artificial intelligence software is good enough to drive a car it will be good enough to do a lot of other things too It won t be millions of people out of work it will be tens of millions This is what we mean when we talk about robots We re talking about cognitive abilities not the fact that they re made of metal instead of flesh and powered by electricity instead of chicken nuggets In other words the advances to focus on aren t those in robotic engineering though they are happening too but the way we re hurtling toward artificial intelligence or AI While we re nowhere near human level AI yet the progress of the past couple of decades has been stunning After many years of nothing much happening suddenly robots can play chess better than the best grandmaster They can play Jeopardy better than the best humans They can drive cars around San Francisco and they re getting better at it every year They can recognize faces well enough that Welsh police recently made the first ever arrest in the United Kingdom using facial recognition software After years of plodding progress in voice recognition Google announced earlier this year that it had reduced its word error rate from 8 5 percent to 4 9 percent in 10 months All of this is a sign that AI is improving exponentially a product of both better computer hardware and software Hardware has historically followed a growth curve called Moore s law in which power and efficiency double every couple of years and recent improvements in software algorithms have been even more explosive For a long time these advances didn t seem very impressive Going from the brainpower of a bacterium to the brainpower of a nematode might technically represent an enormous leap but on a practical level it doesn t get us that much closer to true artificial intelligence However if you keep up the doubling for a while eventually one of those doubling cycles takes you from the brainpower of a lizard who cares to the brainpower of a mouse and then a monkey wow Once that happens human level AI is just a short step away This can be hard to imagine so here s a chart that shows what an exponential doubling curve looks like measured in petaflops quadrillions of calculations per second During the first 70 years of the digital era computing power doubled every couple of years and that produced steadily improving accounting software airplane reservation systems weather forecasts Spotify and the like But on the scale of the human brain usually estimated at 10 to 50 petaflops it produced computing power so minuscule that you can t see any change at all Around 2025 we ll finally start to see visible progress toward artificial intelligence A decade later we ll be up to about one tenth the power of a human brain and a decade after that we ll have full human level AI It will seem like it happened overnight but it s really the result of a century of steady but mostly imperceptible progress Are we really this close to true AI Here s a yardstick to think about Even with all this doubling going on until recently computer scientists thought we were still years away from machines being able to win at the ancient game of Go usually regarded as the most complex human game in existence But last year a computer beat a Korean grandmaster considered one of the best of all time and earlier this year it beat the highest ranked Go player in the world Far from slowing down progress in artificial intelligence is now outstripping even the wildest hopes of the most dedicated AI cheerleaders Unfortunately for those of us worried about robots taking away our jobs these advances mean that mass unemployment is a lot closer than we feared so close in fact that it may be starting already But you d never know that from the virtual silence about solutions in policy and political circles I m hardly alone in thinking we re on the verge of an AI Revolution Many who work in the software industry people like Bill Gates and Elon Musk have been sounding the alarm for years But their concerns are largely ignored by policymakers and until recently often ridiculed by writers tasked with interpreting technology or economics So let s take a look at some of the most common doubts of the AI skeptics 1 We ll never get true AI because computing power won t keep doubling forever We re going to hit the limits of physics before long There are several pretty good reasons to dismiss this claim as a roadblock To start hardware designers will invent faster more specialized chips Google for example announced last spring that it had created a microchip called a Tensor Processing Unit which it claimed was up to 30 times faster and 80 times more power efficient than an Intel processor for machine learning tasks A huge array of those chips are now available to researchers who use Google s cloud services Other chips specialized for specific aspects of AI image recognition neural networking language processing etc either exist already or are certain to follow What s more this raw power is increasingly being harnessed in a manner similar to the way the human brain works Your brain is not a single superpowerful computing device It s made up of about 100 billion neurons working in parallel i e all at the same time to create human level intelligence and consciousness At the lowest level neurons operate in parallel to create small clusters that perform semi independent actions like responding to a specific environmental cue At the next level dozens of these clusters work together in each of about 100 sub brains distinct organs within the brain that perform specialized jobs such as speech visual processing and balance Finally all these sub brains operate in parallel and the resulting overall state is monitored and managed by executive functions that make sense of the world and provide us with our feeling that we have conscious control of our actions Modern computers also yoke lots of microprocessors together As of 2017 the fastest computer in the world uses roughly 40 000 processors with 260 cores each That s more than 10 million processing cores running in parallel Each one of these cores has less power than the Intel processor on your desktop but the entire machine delivers about the same power as the human brain This doesn t mean AI is here already Far from it This massively parallel architecture still presents enormous programming challenges but as we get better at exploiting it we re certain to make frequent breakthroughs in software performance In other words even if Moore s law slows down or stops the total power of everything put together more use of custom microchips more parallelism more sophisticated software and even the possibility of entirely new ways of doing computing will almost certainly keep growing for many more years 2 Even if computing power keeps doubling it has already been doubling for decades You guys keep predicting full on AI but it never happens It s true that during the early years of computing there was a lot of naive optimism about how quickly we d be able to build intelligent machines But those rosy predictions died in the 70s as computer scientists came to realize that even the fastest mainframes of the day produced only about a billionth of the processing power of the human brain It was a humbling realization and the entire field has been almost painfully realistic about its progress ever since We ve finally built computers with roughly the raw processing power of the human brain although only at a cost of more than 100 million and with an internal architecture that may or may not work well for emulating the human mind But in another 10 years this level of power will likely be available for less than 1 million and thousands of teams will be testing AI software on a platform that s actually capable of competing with humans 3 Okay maybe we will get full AI But it only means that robots will act intelligent not that they ll really be intelligent This is just a tedious philosophical debating point For the purposes of employment we don t really care if a smart computer has a soul or if it can feel love and pain and loyalty We only care if it can act like a human being well enough to do anything we can do When that day comes we ll all be out of jobs even if the computers taking our places aren t really intelligent 4 Fine But waves of automation steam engines electricity computers always lead to predictions of mass unemployment Instead they just make us more efficient The AI Revolution will be no different This is a popular argument It s also catastrophically wrong The Industrial Revolution was all about mechanical power Trains were more powerful than horses and mechanical looms were more efficient than human muscle At first this did put people out of work Those loom smashing weavers in Yorkshire the original Luddites really did lose their livelihoods This caused massive social upheaval for decades until the entire economy adapted to the machine age When that finally happened there were as many jobs tending the new machines as there used to be doing manual labor The eventual result was a huge increase in productivity A single person could churn out a lot more cloth than she could before In the end not only were as many people still employed but they were employed at jobs tending machines that produced vastly more wealth than anyone had thought possible 100 years before Once labor unions began demanding a piece of this pie everyone benefited The AI Revolution will be nothing like that When robots become as smart and capable as human beings there will be nothing left for people to do because machines will be both stronger and smarter than humans Even if AI creates lots of new jobs it s of no consequence No matter what job you name robots will be able to do it They will manufacture themselves program themselves repair themselves and manage themselves If you don t appreciate this then you don t appreciate what s barreling toward us In fact it s even worse In addition to doing our jobs at least as well as we do them intelligent robots will be cheaper faster and far more reliable than humans And they can work 168 hours a week not just 40 No capitalist in her right mind would continue to employ humans They re expensive they show up late they complain whenever something changes and they spend half their time gossiping Let s face it We humans make lousy laborers If you want to look at this through a utopian lens the AI Revolution has the potential to free humanity forever from drudgery In the best case scenario a combination of intelligent robots and green energy will provide everyone on Earth with everything they need But just as the Industrial Revolution caused a lot of short term pain so will intelligent robots While we re on the road to our Star Trek future but before we finally get there the rich are going to get richer because they own the robots and the rest of us are going to get poorer because we ll be out of jobs Unless we figure out what we re going to do about that the misery of workers over the next few decades will be far worse than anything the Industrial Revolution produced Wait wait skeptics will say If all this is happening as we speak why aren t people losing their jobs already Several sharp observers have made this point including James Surowiecki in a recent issue of Wired If automation were in fact transforming the US economy he wrote two things would be true Aggregate productivity would be rising sharply and jobs would be harder to come by than in the past But neither is happening Productivity has actually stalled since 2000 and jobs have gotten steadily more plentiful ever since the Great Recession ended Surowiecki also points out that job churn is low average job tenure hasn t changed much in decades and wages are rising though he admits that wage increases are meager by historical standards True enough But as I wrote four years ago since 2000 the share of the population that s employed has decreased middle class wages have flattened corporations have stockpiled more cash and invested less in new products and new factories and as a result of all this labor s share of national income has declined All those trends are consistent with job losses to old school automation and as automation evolves into AI they are likely to accelerate That said the evidence that AI is currently affecting jobs is hard to assess for one big and obvious reason We don t have AI yet so of course we re not losing jobs to it For now we re seeing only a few glimmers of smarter automation but nothing even close to true AI Remember that artificial intelligence progresses in exponential time This means that even as computer power doubles from a trillionth of a human brain s power to a billionth and then a millionth it has little effect on the level of employment Then in the relative blink of an eye the final few doublings take place and robots go from having a thousandth of human brainpower to full human level intelligence Don t get fooled by the fact that nothing much has happened yet In another 10 years or so it will So let s talk about which jobs are in danger first Economists generally break employment into cognitive versus physical jobs and routine versus nonroutine jobs This gives us four basic categories of work Routine physical digging ditches driving trucksRoutine cognitive accounts payable clerk telephone salesNonroutine physical short order cook home health aideNonroutine cognitive teacher doctor CEORoutine tasks will be the first to go and thanks to advances in robotics engineering both physical and cognitive tasks will be affected In a recent paper a team from Oxford and Yale surveyed a large number of machine learning researchers to produce a wisdom of crowds estimate of when computers would be able to take over various human jobs Two thirds said progress in machine learning had accelerated in recent years with Asian researchers even more optimistic than North American researchers about the advent of full AI within 40 years But we don t need full AI for everything The machine learning researchers estimate that speech transcribers translators commercial drivers retail sales and similar jobs could be fully automated during the 2020s Within a decade after that all routine jobs could be gone Nonroutine jobs will be next surgeons novelists construction workers police officers and so forth These jobs could all be fully automated during the 2040s By 2060 AI will be capable of performing any task currently done by humans This doesn t mean that literally every human being on the planet will be jobless by then in fact the researchers suggest it could take another century before that happens but that s hardly any solace By 2060 or thereabouts we ll have AI that can do anything a normal human can do which means that nearly all normal jobs will be gone And normal jobs are what almost all of us have 2060 seems a long way off but if the Oxford Yale survey is right we ll face an employment apocalypse far sooner than that the disappearance of routine work of all kinds by the mid 2030s That represents nearly half the US labor force The consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers recently released a study saying much the same It predicts that 38 percent of all jobs in the United States are at high risk of automation by the early 2030s most of them in routine occupations In the even nearer term the World Economic Forum predicts that the rich world will lose 5 million jobs to robots by 2020 while a group of AI experts writing in Scientific American figures that 40 percent of the 500 biggest companies will vanish within a decade Not scared yet Kai Fu Lee a former Microsoft and Google executive who is now a prominent investor in Chinese AI startups thinks artificial intelligence will probably replace 50 percent of human jobs When Within 10 years Ten years Maybe it s time to really start thinking hard about AI And forget about putting the genie back in the bottle AI is coming whether we like it or not The rewards are just too great Even if America did somehow stop AI research it would only mean that the Chinese or the French or the Brazilians would get there first Russian President Vladimir Putin agrees Artificial intelligence is the future not only for Russia but for all humankind he announced in September Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world There s just no way around it For the vast majority of jobs work as we know it will come steadily to an end between about 2025 and 2060 So who benefits The answer is obvious the owners of capital who will control most of the robots Who suffers That s obvious too the rest of us who currently trade work for money No work means no money But things won t actually be quite that grim After all fully automated farms and factories will produce much cheaper goods and competition will then force down prices Basic material comfort will be cheap as dirt Still not free though And capitalists can only make money if they have someone to sell their goods to This means that even the business class will eventually realize that ubiquitous automation doesn t really benefit them after all They need customers with money if they want to be rich themselves One way or another then the answer to the mass unemployment of the AI Revolution has to involve some kind of sweeping redistribution of income that decouples it from work Or a total rethinking of what work is Or a total rethinking of what wealth is Let s consider a few of the possibilities The welfare state writ large This is the simplest to think about It s basically what we have now but more extensive Unemployment insurance will be more generous and come with no time limits National health care will be free for all Anyone without a job will qualify for some basic amount of food and housing Higher taxes will pay for it but we ll still operate under the assumption that gainful employment is expected from anyone able to work This is essentially the bury our heads in the sand option We refuse to accept that work is truly going away so we continue to punish people who aren t employed Jobless benefits remain stingy so that people are motivated to find work even though there aren t enough jobs to go around We continue to believe that eventually the economy will find a new equilibrium This can t last for too long and millions will suffer during the years we continue to delude ourselves But it will protect the rich for a while Universal basic income 1 This is a step further down the road Everyone would qualify for a certain level of income from the state but the level of guaranteed income would be fairly modest because we would still want people to work Unemployment wouldn t be as stigmatized as it is in today s welfare state but neither would widespread joblessness be truly accepted as a permanent fact of life Some European countries are moving toward a welfare state with cash assistance for everyone Universal basic income 2 This is UBI on steroids It s available to everyone and the income level is substantial enough to provide a satisfying standard of living This is what we ll most likely get once we accept that mass unemployment isn t a sign of lazy workers and social decay but the inevitable result of improving technology Since there s no personal stigma attached to joblessness and no special reason that the rich should reap all the rewards of artificial intelligence there s also no reason to keep the universal income level low After all we aren t trying to prod people back into the workforce In fact the time will probably come when we actively want to do just the opposite provide an income large enough to motivate people to leave the workforce and let robots do the job better Silicon Valley perhaps unsurprisingly is fast becoming a hotbed of UBI enthusiasm Tech executives understand what s coming and that their own businesses risk a backlash unless we take care of its victims Uber has shown an interest in UBI Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg supports it Ditto for Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield A startup incubator called Y Combinator is running a pilot program to find out what happens if you give people a guaranteed income There are even some countries that are now trying it Switzerland rejected a UBI proposal in 2016 but Finland is experimenting with a small scale UBI that pays the unemployed about 700 per month even after they find work UBI is also getting limited tryouts by cities in Italy and Canada Right now these are all pilot projects aimed at learning more about how to best run a UBI program and how well it works But as large scale job losses from automation start to become real we should expect the idea to spread rapidly A tax on robots This is a notion raised by a draft report to the European Parliament and endorsed by Bill Gates who suggests that robots should pay income tax and payroll tax just like human workers That would keep humans more competitive Unfortunately there s a flaw here The end result would be to artificially increase the cost of employing robots and thus the cost of the goods they produce Unless every country creates a similar tax it accomplishes nothing except to push robot labor overseas We d be worse off than if we simply let the robots take our jobs in the first place Nonetheless a robot tax could still have value as a way of modestly slowing down job losses Economist Robert Shiller suggests that we should consider at least modest robot taxes during the transition to a different world of work And where would the money go Revenue could be targeted toward wage insurance he says In other words a UBI Socialization of the robot workforce In this scenario which would require a radical change in the US political climate private ownership of intelligent robots would be forbidden The market economy we have today would continue to exist with one exception The government would own all intelligent robots and would auction off their services to private industry The proceeds would be divided among everybody Progressive taxation on a grand scale Let the robots take all the jobs but tax all income at a flat 90 percent The rich would still have an incentive to run businesses and earn more money but for the most part labor would be considered a societal good like infrastructure not the product of individual initiative Wealth tax Intelligent robots will be able to manufacture material goods and services cheaply but there will still be scarcity No matter how many robots you have there s only so much beachfront property in Southern California There are only so many original Rembrandts There are only so many penthouse suites These kinds of things will be the only real wealth left and the rich will still want them So if robots make the rich even richer they ll bid up the price of these luxuries commensurately and all that s left is to tax them at high rates The rich still get their toys while the rest of us get everything we want except for a view of the sun setting over the Pacific Ocean A hundred years from now all of this will be moot Society will adapt in ways we can t foresee and we ll all be far wealthier safer and more comfortable than we are today assuming of course that the robots don t kill us all Skynet fashion But someone needs to be thinking hard about how to prepare for what happens in the meantime Not many are Last year for example the Obama White House released a 48 page report called Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence That sounds promising But it devoted less than one page to economic impacts and concluded only that policy questions raised by AI driven automation are important but they are best addressed by a separate White House working group Regrettably the coming jobocalypse has so far remained the prophecy of a few Cassandras mostly futurists academics and tech executives For example Eric Schmidt chairman of Google s parent company believes that AI is coming faster than we think and that we should provide jobs to everyone during the transition The country s goal should be full employment all the time and do whatever it takes he says Another sharp thinker about our jobless future is Martin Ford author of Rise of the Robots Mass joblessness he warns isn t limited to low skill workers Nor is it something we can fight by committing to better education AI will decimate any job that s predictable which means nearly all of them Many of us might not like to hear this but Ford is unsentimental about the work we do Relatively few people he says are paid primarily to engage in truly creative work or blue sky thinking All this is bad enough but it s made worse by the fact that income inequality has already been increasing for decades The frightening reality Ford says is that we may face the prospect of a perfect storm where the impacts from soaring inequality technological unemployment and climate change unfold roughly in parallel and some ways amplify and reinforce each other Unsurprisingly he believes the only plausible solution is some form of universal basic income So how do we get these ideas into the political mainstream One thing is certain The monumental task of dealing with the AI Revolution will be almost entirely up to the political left After all when the automation of human labor begins in earnest the big winners are initially going to be corporations and the rich Because of this conservatives will be motivated to see every labor displacement as a one off event just as they currently view every drought every wildfire and every hurricane as a one off event They refuse to see that global warming is behind changing weather patterns because dealing with climate change requires environmental regulations that are bad for business and bad for the rich Likewise dealing with an AI Revolution will require new ways of distributing wealth In the long run this will be good even for the rich but in the short term it s a pretty scary prospect for those with money and one they ll fight zealously Until they have no choice left conservatives are simply not going to admit this is happening let alone think about how to address it It s not in their DNA Other candidates are equally unlikely The military thinks about automation all the time but primarily as a means of killing people more efficiently not as an economic threat The business community is a slave to quarterly earnings and in any case will be too divided to be of much help Labor unions have good reason to care but by themselves they re too weak nowadays to have the necessary clout with policymakers Nor are we likely to get much help from governments which mostly don t even understand what s happening Google s Schmidt puts it bluntly The gap between the government in terms of their understanding of software let alone AI is so large that it s almost hopeless he said at a conference earlier this year Certainly that s true of the Trump administration Asked about AI being a threat to jobs Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stunningly waved it off as a problem that s still 50 or 100 years in the future I think we re like so far away from that he said Not even on my radar screen This drew a sharp rebuke from former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers I do not understand how anyone could reach the conclusion that all the action with technology is half a century away he said Artificial intelligence is transforming everything from retailing to banking to the provision of medical care So who s left Like it or not the only real choice to sound the alarm outside the geek community is the Democratic Party along with its associated constellation of labor unions think tanks and activists Imperfect as it is and its reliance on rich donors makes it conspicuously imperfect it s the only national organization that has both the principles and the size to do the job Unfortunately political parties are inherently short term thinkers Democrats today are absorbed with fighting President Donald Trump saving Obamacare pushing for a 15 minimum wage and arguing about all those things They have no time to think hard about the end of work Nonetheless somebody on the left with numbers clout power and organizing energy hopefully all the above had better start Conventional wisdom says Trump s victory last year was tipped over the edge by a backlash among working class voters in the Upper Midwest When blue collar workers start losing their jobs in large numbers we ll see a backlash that makes 2016 look like a gentle breeze Either liberals start working on answers now or we risk voters rallying around far more effective and dangerous demagogues than Trump Despite the amount of media attention that both robots and AI have gotten over the past few years it s difficult to get people to take them seriously But start to pay attention and you see the signs An Uber car can drive itself A computer can write simple sports stories SoftBank s Pepper robot already works in more than 140 cellphone stores in Japan and is starting to get tryouts in America too Alexa can order replacement Pop Tarts before you know you need them A Carnegie Mellon computer that seems to have figured out human bluffing beat four different online poker pros earlier this year California suffering from a lack of Mexican workers is ground zero for the development of robotic crop pickers Sony is promising a robot that will form an emotional bond with its owner These are all harbingers the way a dropping barometer signals a coming storm not the possibility of a storm but the inexorable reality The two most important problems facing the human race right now are the need for widespread deployment of renewable energy and figuring out how to deal with the end of work Everything else pales in comparison Renewable energy already gets plenty of attention even if half the country still denies that we really need it It s time for the end of work to start getting the same attention Subscribe to our free

computers robotics and artificial intelligence are displacing human jobs creating an epidemic of technological unemployment While this projection has yet to be confirmed if true it will have major economic and social repercussions for our future It is therefore appropriate to begin identifying policy options to address this potential problem This article offers an economic and social framework for addressing this problem and then provides an inventory of possible policy options organized into the following six categories a slowing innovation and change b sharing work c making new work d redistribution e education and f fostering a new social contract The Luddite fear and prediction that technology will displace many workers and lead to widespread unemployment may after many false alarms finally be coming true At the same time the utopian vision of humans being liberated from a life filled mostly with the drudgery of manual or mindless labor to enjoy a productive happier and more meaningful level of existence through art music literature and rich social relationships such as that suggested by behavioral psychologist B F Skinner 1948 in Walden Two may also be closer to realization Navigating the tension between these negative and positive perspectives on the growing displacement of human labor by technology requires a calculated and delicate effort to manage this critical period of transformation If handled poorly the widespread displacement of workers by technology could result in rapidly expanding economic divergence between rich and poor economic poverty and social unrest for growing numbers of dislocated workers backlashes against technology and social institutions and economic and social decline If properly managed the use of technology to replace mundane lackluster repetitive dangerous or strenuous labor could free us to live more enjoyable meaningful and leisurely lives Over the years technologyhas consistently been anet enhancer of employment Past innovations in industries such as the automobile agricultural chemical energy computer and telecommunications sectors have sparked rapid growth in quality gainful jobs In fact a 1968 paper that perhaps recognized for the first time the impact of the computer for communications by two leading computer scientists predicted that as a result of the growing role of computers u nemployment would disappear from the face of the earth forever Licklider and Taylor 1968 40 While the computer has indeed had an enormous impact on communications those early experts were overly optimistic about the long term impact on employment But there is no doubt that the general effect of technology on employment over the years has been positive As the National Academy of Sciences NAS concluded in a 1998 report h istorically technological change and productivity growth have been associated with expanding rather than contracting total employment and rising earnings National Academy of Sciences 1998 5 The same report had a positive prediction for the future of technology and employment The future will see little change in this pattern Rather than producing mass unemployment technological change will make its maximum contribution to higher living standards wages and employment levels if appropriate public and private policies are adopted to support the adjustment to new technologies National Academy of Sciences1998 3 5 emphasis added The if here is an important caveat and the objective of this paper is to address the appropriate public and private policies that should be pursued to guide the transition into an era where machines do more and more of the jobs that humans have traditionally undertaken Policy intervention appears necessary While the evidence is only suggestive and not conclusive to date the argument has been made that in this jobless recovery machines are now resulting in net job loss perhaps at an accelerating rate Rotman 2013 Deane 2013 Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2011 call this the great uncoupling where economic growth has become detached from employment growth for the first time in the modern era Other experts vociferously disagree with this prognosis contending it is just the latest of a long history of false alarms about the impact of technology on jobs going all the way back to Ned Ludd and his Luddite followers in the 19th century Miller and Atkinson 2013 Bessen 2013 Just as the major loss of agricultural jobs lead to increases in manufacturing jobs and the loss of manufacturing jobs led to increased jobs in digital industries technological optimists point to new industries and jobs that are already developing even as machines replace many existing jobs examples include app development and additive manufacturing Wadhwa 2012 While it may be too soon to definitely conclude whether technology replaces jobs we can see anecdotal evidence all around us in our daily lives as human beings are replaced by automated technology to perform the functions once done by gas station attendants bank tellers travel agents tax preparers farmers secretaries call service centers and grocery store cashiers Artificial intelligence is empowering robots and computers to replace more complex job functions such as assembly line worker surgeon barista and legal practitioner Markoff 2012 In the legal field for instance in order to predict the likely outcome of a case computer scientists and engineers are developing software programs that have the ability to execute some of the work done by attorneys thereby establishing a niche called quantitative legal prediction Lu 2012 The appeal to employers of replacing workers with machines is considerable given that machines require no wages or benefits take no sick days or vacations provide a consistent highly reliable quality of work for up to twenty four hours a day seven days a week if needed and incur no injuries They also require no workers compensation do not complain or disclose proprietary information and do not quit retire strike or take coffee breaks It is said that a robot can be operated 160 hours a week Even assuming competition from nimble fingered humans putting in 12 hour shifts a single robot might replace two workers and possibly as many as four Larson2012 This most recent quote is supported by Andrew McAfee when he emphasizes the massive increases in productivity brought on by digital technology Regalado 2012 Rapid advances expected in robotics and artificial intelligence will be the primary drivers of technology driven unemployment However other technologies will also contribute For example 3D printers nano manufacturing and autonomous vehicles will all displace thousands if not millions of workers Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee argue in their provocative book Race Against the Machine that Computers are now doing many things that used to be the domain of people only The pace and scale of this encroachment into human skills is relatively recent and has profound economic implications Perhaps the most important of these is that while digital progress grows the overall economic pie it can do so while leaving some people or even a lot of them worse off Brynjolfsson and McAfee2011 9 A recent study from the James Martin 21st Century School at Oxford University estimated that approximately 47 percent of U S employment was at high risk of being replaced by computerization over the next couple decades Frey and Osborne 2013 This concern is not new Back in in 1930 economist John Maynard Keynes 1930 predicted this problem in his essay entitled Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren where he posited that a new malady called technological unemployment is on the horizon toreplace and outrun human labor with more efficient fast paced innovations Like Skinner Keynes maintained that an age of leisure would be part of our future a future he foresaw as being replete with social and other repercussions If these projections of increasing job loss to technology are accurate and the predictions of widespread technological unemployment are finally coming true the consequences could be dire Accordingly the time is overdue to seriously consider what potential policy interventions are available to address this emerging problem Our objective in this article is to inventory and briefly evaluate the policy options that might be considered in an attempt to mitigate orhelp society adapt to the growing dislocation of jobs by technology We start with a more theoretical framing of the problem in Part II and then describe potential policies in Part III grouped into six categories of potential policy options If we assume for the purpose of this analysis that technology is indeed in the process of widespread displacement or elimination of human jobs there are two aspects of the consequent problem an economic and a social dimension from both an individual and collective perspective Deane 2013 First from the economic side growing prevalence and permanence of unemployment and underemployment presents the challenge of howaffected individualswill support their existence and that of their families As Martin Ford in The Lights in the Tunnel has warned Jobs are the primary mechanism through which income and hence purchasing power is distributed to the people who consume everything the economy produces If at some point machines are likely to permanently take over a great deal of the work now performed by human beings then that will be a threat to the very foundation of our economic system Ford 2009 5 The economic problems from unemployment do not just affect those who are unemployed and their families If a significant and growing proportion of the working age population is unable to find adequate work to sustain themselves with a reasonable lifestyle this problem would not only represent an individual tragedy for those persons but would also represent a major burden on the overall economy if the unemployed cannot actively participate as consumers of products and purchasers of services This second order effect limiting economic activity will have a spiraling negative effect on the economy leading to additional loss of jobs and generating further impedimentsto economic growth Over and above what machines are currently and ultimately able to provide there is much productive and useful work that can be done by human workers restoring infrastructure and inner cities cleaning up the environment taking better care of the sick and elderly orhelping people in developing countries among many other priorities The problem is finding an economic structure to compensate for or acknowledge such work Our current political economic system seems unwilling or unable to reward or remunerate people to undertake these worthy functions Second for most people a job ensures not only a livelihood but is also linked to identity self worth and focus Deane 2013 Even if we could find ways for people to pay for the basic necessities of life if jobs and careers disappear it may cause or contribute to major psychological and social stresses due to stigmatization or an inability to cope with the reality of long term unemployment including depression anxiety poor self esteem divorce substance abuse increased chronic diseases suicide and mortality Baker and Hassett 2012 American Psychological Association 2013 For the purpose of this essay we posit that people must do some kind of work Being productive is essential to human well being Vardi 2012 This is reiterated by Leon Kass in The Other War on Poverty where he states that Unemployment even if compensated is demoralizing degrading and dehumanizing We need to consider work as Dorothy Sayers put it as not primarily a thing one does to live but the thing one lives to do Kass2012 6 Widespread unemployment may also cause collective disruptions The strains presented by the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011 and the 99 vs 1 percent protest theme are but a minor and relatively mild early indicator of the type of social disruptions that are likely to occur if successful people continue to thrive and prosper while a growing percentage of the population is left behind in permanent poverty and despair An important aspect of the technology unemployment problem is determining whose jobs will be eliminated by technology A recurring theme among researchers economists political and social scientistssuch as Charles Murray Tyler Cowen Erik Brynjolfsson Andrew McAfee David Autor and Lawrence Katz see Rotman 2013 is that the middle skilled class based on nowadays requirements has all but disappeared and what is leftis a polarization between the highly skilled wealthy and the low skilled poor This hollowing out of the economy by removing middle class jobs and pushing workers into either low paying manual labor that cannot be done by machines e g restaurant and construction workers or higher end jobs involving higher skills and pay would tend to polarize the population into two disparate classes Autor and Dorn 2013 However more recent analyses suggest thatthe impact of technological unemployment might concentrate primarily on low income workers Frey and Osborne 2013 Under either economic model there will be a new urgency to improve the education and training of workers to be able to perform skilled high paying jobs which at least at this time are sometimes going unfilled When considering the near future and its economic and social repercussions we must also consider the generationsaffected by the inevitable displacement If mostly elderly workers are affected the economic dimension may be the most important Individuals who have worked for many years have already established their social status and have mostly performed their duty to society to be productive For those who wish to continue to work re education and re training will be critical For others who may be unable or uninterested in continuing to work the focus will be on how they can retire with dignity and a good quality of life This primarily depends on the establishment of economic safeguards derived from personal savings or from other sources of external support If on the other hand technology s destruction of jobs primarily affects young people the problem may now be both acutely economic and social The lack of any employment opportunity for young people who are likely to have recently completed the most updated educational training is likely to cause tremendous disenchantment and frustration which could lead to social disruption It is worthwhile noting that gender may also play a role with regard topredictions relating to unemployment or displacement In a paper prepared for the National Science Foundation David H Autor and Lawrence F Katz boldly state that technological advances breed winners and losers The authors explain that in the long run technological progress affects the composition of jobs not the number of jobs Autor and Katz 2010 1 According to Autor and Katz women in most industrialized countries have greatly exceeded men in the attainment of higher education and are thus better positioned to obtain higher paying occupations Not surprisingly the recurring theme derived from various lines of research is that the impacts of technological unemployment will not be spread evenly While machines will eliminate many jobs resulting in unemployment or displacement most of the people who will fall victim to this phenomenon will be the less educated whose current job functions are more susceptible to replacement by machines Perhaps the issue initially ishow tounequally but not unfairly sustain the lower and middle skilled class while incentivizing them tovoluntarily become more educated or contribute to society in other compensable and meaningful ways As the capabilities of artificial intelligence robotics and other technologies continue to advance more and more job functions will become automated leaving fewer and fewer jobs where humans are essential and thus raising broader longer term questions about what type of future society and lives we want The efficiency and wealth created by technologies even as they may reduce employment create a window of opportunity to enact policies that can use that wealth to help all citizens achieve enough material support to enjoy a good life with greater leisure and satisfaction Newman 2010 Policy interventions must address both shorter and longer term goals and ensure that short term actions are aligned with longer term objectives Policymakers in the U S and other industrialized nations have struggled for many decades to develop effective policies to address cyclical unemployment generally by trying to stimulate innovation and economic activity and hence boost job retention and creation Today s situation is different increased innovation and economic activity may not lead to more jobs It in fact could acceleratereplacement of human jobs by machines New and different policy interventions are therefore needed to address this new era of technological unemployment Perry 2013 Below we identify six potential categories of policy interventions and begin the task of populating those categories with specific proposals The six categories are a slowing innovation and change b sharing work c making new work d redistribution e education and f fostering a new social contract Not all six categories of interventions are likely to be equally desirable and effective and we do not shy away from offering our own preferences and recommendations We recognize though that views on the merits of different options may vary and thus try to identify as many policy options within each category as possible whether we personally think they are good bad or indifferent There may also be differences in effectiveness appeal and feasibility between policy options within a given category varying along dimensions such as the relative roles they give to governments versus individuals or whether they are static or dynamic None of the categories of policy approaches are mutually exclusive as optimal public policy is likely to involve mixtures of policies drawn from several or perhaps most or even all of the categories The optimal mix of categories is also likely to shift over time with some types of policies more effective and feasible in the short term while others more salient and necessary in the longer term Experimentation with different mixes of these policy options will also be valuable to better evaluate the individual options and their interactions These policy options seek to use legal interventions to protect jobs that might otherwise be lost due to technology innovation and development A 1 Place Limits on Technological Development If technology is the problem that is displacing many jobs then one solution might be to try to slow or block new technological developments This was the Luddite strategy and was most recently resurrected by Bill Joy s famous essay in 2000 on a policy of relinquishment for technologies such as genomics nanotechnology and robotics Joy2000 Such policies often encapsulated by stronger versions of the precautionary principle are doomed to fail for several reasons First restrictions on technology innovation would make a nation anticompetitive in the increasing global marketplace as other countries would step in to displace the laggards and achieve technological economic and military predominance Second emerging technologies are being developed and commercialized so rapidly in large part because of demand for and benefits of those technologies Therefore foregoing such technologies would likely be counter productive to overall social welfare Finally stopping progress has never been a successful or politically feasible strategy and runs counter tohuman nature and aspirations A 2 Mandating Human Workers Throughout history legislators regulators and trade unionists have attempted to protect jobs by prohibiting displacement of human jobs with technology Perhaps the iconic example of trying to preserve jobs by legal mandates is New Jersey s and Oregon s current law prohibiting consumers from pumping their own gasoline thus protecting the employment of gas station attendants to pump gasoline This anachronistic policy simply increases costs deprives consumers of convenience and artificially prolongs jobs that are low payingand of declining relevance Yglesias 2013 Trade unions have responded to automation with things like work preservation clauses or Bills of Rights which are intended to protect employees jobs when technology is integrated into the work environment This approach has the same objective as New Jersey s gas pumping law in that specific duties that could be performed by a machine are required to be executed by a human being Moon 2004 Although such clauses may have temporarily preserved some jobs they also promoted inefficiency and stalled innovation to the long term detriment of both the companies and workers in those sectors Japan is a good demonstration of this where companies facing changing markets and technologies are competitively harmed by outdated laws preventing them from laying off workers assigning such workers to chasing out rooms where the company tries to force the employee to voluntarily quit by creating boring job conditions Tabuchi 2013 These types of antiquated policies simply delay the inevitable by mandating inefficiency Dau Schmidt 2001 A 3 Regulatory Restraint Regulation has become a controversial political subject in the United States with respect to its impact on employment with conservatives making regulatory retrenchment a key part of their jobs strategy while liberals argue that regulation does not harm and may even benefit employment For example Arizona a state with a conservative government has enacted by Executive Order a moratorium on new regulations with certain enumerated exceptions in order to promote job creation and retention in the state Brewer 2013 The empirical record on this issue is equivocal and disputed with most but not all studies finding that any net impact of regulations on employment to be relatively minor Lee 2013 Not all regulations may have the same effect and therefore reducing regulations that have less important benefits or that particularly burden small businesses may have a beneficial impact on employment A 4 Employment Impact Statement for Regulations and Legislation While wholesale reductions in government regulation may not be effective or politically feasible for increasing employment selective study of the impact of regulations may help minimize regulatory burdens on job creating businesses and activities Impact statements have become a useful tool for anticipatory governance and are frequently mandated for governmental actions that may affect the environment privacy or other important social priorities This approach could also be extended to employment impacts While differing in scope and manner of execution several state legislatures currently require employment or economic impact statements with regard to proposed bills Rappa 2011 Employment impact statements consider factors such as the nature of the impact affected numbers and categories adverse impact regions and mitigation Additional considerations may apply based on the rules regulations and laws of each state NYS Department of State 2013 The objective of the analysis is to determine whether a proposed action will have an adverse impact on jobs and job opportunities and to consider the relative employment impacts of policy alternatives Such a requirement could be expanded to include federal legislation and federal and state regulations Although impact statements are criticized as being just paper exercises where the evaluating body simply goes through the motions to comply with the procedural requirement without affecting the pre determined choice to proceed with the chosen policy they do have the beneficial effect of forcing legislatures and agencies to incorporate in house expertise on employment impacts which can have subtle beneficial influences Impact assessments also inform the public and media of such impacts which can have an indirect influence on policymaking all of which helps to elevate the priority given to considering and ameliorating to the extent feasible adverse employment impacts These policy options seek to minimize the frequency of unemployment by sharing the paid work that is available across more workers Although these policies are mostly short term they may help delay or lessen the impact of technological unemployment B 1 Mandatory Retirement Age One straightforward way to share the diminishing supply of work among more people is to impose a mandatory retirement age Some employers e g airlines already impose such a limit but it could be applied more broadly across the economy The main advantage of such a policy is that it would free up more jobs to the benefit of young people who are increasingly being blocked out of the workforce by the lack of open jobs However such a policy would have significant detrimental impacts on individuals and society As people live longer many want to continue working past the typical retirement age for both economic and psychological reasons Also it does not appear to be in society s best interest to compel the retirement of skilled and experienced workers who have many healthy productive years of potential work remaining B 2 Shorter Work Week A shorter work week could help spread work among more workers and possibly lead to a better quality of life for workers who would have more time for leisure retraining and other activities Some Silicon Valley employers are now using a reduced work week as a perk of employment to attract the best and brightest young talent Tracy 2013 According to one European expert a 25 hour work week will allow younger people to spend more time with their children take better care of their health which will help raise average life expectancy and improve their over all quality of life while for the older population many of whom have more time on their hands than they know what to do with work can serve as both a psychological and physical outlet Ebdrup 2013 quoting James W Vaupel This proposal for reduced hours could take a couple of forms Many states take part and have established programs in what is commonly referred to as shared work work sharing or short time compensation In an effort not to cut jobs some companies often taking part in state run programs have reduced employees hours and have assisted them with obtaining prorated benefits for lost time This differs from the traditional view of job sharing in that it does not increase employed numbers but it helps keep people employed when companies have to trim labor costs Other positive aspects of such a strategy include a when businesses recover they may once again increase employees hours without having to retrain them a costly and time consuming enterprise b it helps avoid long term unemployment which often has a negative effect on re employment c it provides security for older workers who may not be as likely to find work if laid off instead of having their hours reduced and d the employee may appreciate the employer s efforts to avoid layoffs and reward the employer with greater loyalty commitment and performance In addition to the above the traditional work share model where two or more employees share the same job by limiting the hours each employee may work is another form of work sharing This may allow an employer to cut back on certain benefits and results in more workers being employed It may have some negative repercussions however if it is perceived by employees as an attempt to reduce benefit payments rather than to minimize unemployment There are also inefficiencies and extra burdens in having more employees do the same amount of overall work including the extra training monitoring and evaluation costs and the loss of consistency and continuity of work between two workers sharing the same job function Moreover as machines take over more and more jobs it is unlikely that there will be enough available human work hours to even justify a shorter work week and so such a strategy may help in the short term but just delay the inevitable in the long term Vardi2012 B 3 More Vacation Time Another way of achieving the same objective of hiring more workers to do the same amount of overall work is to provide more vacation time For example U S workers currently enjoy much less vacation time than their contemporaries in Europe If the U S was to mandate a minimum of four weeks of vacation this could create the need for hiring additional workers especially in larger facilities where work is more fungible Of course such a requirement would impose a burden on employers who would be required to pay for the additional vacation time thus increasing payroll costs and creating some inefficiency It would have the benefit of providing a more enjoyable life for most employees in addition to the impact in increasing employment Such a policy could be implemented now or later as technological employment becomes more severe Another variant would be to give employees a paid sabbatical which would not only create the need for more hiring to fill the gaps but would also give employees an opportunity to engage in retraining or other beneficial pursuits in their time off Ford 2009 These policy options seek to use governmental and other non market interventions to create additional employment that would not otherwise be available under existing market conditions C 1 Government Work Programs Government created work programs were successful to help lift the nation out of the great depression in the 1930s and may be needed to help get us out of the current great recession For example Kevin A Hassett recently made the following proposal in Congressional testimony The stigma of long term unemployment may be ameliorated by a short run jobs program that recruits the long term unemployed to assist with the normal functions of government This may allow individuals to look for a new job while employed a change that may have a large impact on placement Hassett 2013 10 Interestingly when it comes to government training programs Hassett claims they are a national embarrassment and the unemployed would be better off if the monies were available to individuals who themselves chose the skills they wish to acquire Hassett 2013 11 A government assisted program might include a a relocation service and subsidy to serve geographic areas or sectors that are experiencing a shortage b lump sum payment to an unemployed worker who secures employment c low interest loan to start a promising business d visa or other permit to retain highly educated and skilled foreign students or workers and e reduction of red tape and tax implications involved in establishing and maintaining new businesses Strain 2013 C 2 National Service Two kinds of national service exist namely mandatory or voluntary Whether one is preferable to the other is a matter of opinion however it has been pointed out that A republic to survive needed not only the consent of the governed but also their active participation It was not a machine that would go of itself free societies do not stay free without the involvement of their citizens Stengel 2007 In an article published by Time magazine Richard Stengel well known journalist editor and author noting the importance of national service nonetheless recommends that such a system should be voluntary Stengel cites the American mindset as the main reason mandatory service would not be successful because Americans do not enjoy being told what to do In terms of the components of an incentive basedvoluntary plan these could include a establishment of a national service baby bond whereby the federal government would invest a fixed amount of money in the name of each U S born child in a fund At and between a certain age range the child would be entitled to the money in the fund provided he or she commits one or two years to national service In addition the funds could only be used for specific worthy expenditures e g education down payment on a home etc b expansion and increased awareness of existing national service programs e g AmeriCorps that would benefit from additional membership derived from an incentive based voluntary program and c creation of additional entities that would serve as options for national service such as corps directed toward education student summer service health environment and emergency response Stengel 2007 Conceivably the list is virtually endless limited only by the creativity of the planners and framers of a national service system Providing incentives in exchange for the execution of respectable and valuable work which in turn also results in skills and other professional enhancements certainly appears to create a win win situation In terms of mandatory national service IlyaSomin Professor of Law at George Mason University School of Law has said that Mandatory national service which would require young people to do government mandated work is pretty clearly involuntary servitude under any reasonable definition of the word In response to whether a national service requirement may violate the 13th Amendment s restriction on involuntary servitude Somin replied I think that the answer is pretty clearly yes especially if you take the text of the Constitution seriously Note that the Amendment forbids not only slavery but also involuntary servitude a provision deliberately inserted to prevent state governments from in effect reenslaving blacks by imposing temporary forced labor systems Somin 2009 The article in The New Americanthat references Somin s comments provides that National service is just another costly and wasteful big government program Like most federal government programs it will be top heavy slow reacting expensive ineffective and administered from D C To get a good idea of what these new corps will be doing one only has to review what AmeriCorps has been up to since its inception Krey 2009 With regard to the implied failings of the AmeriCorps program Krey maintains that the effects of AmeriCorps activity have been inconsequential citing comical volunteerism and mismanagement with no tangible results He further addresses the repercussions of a forced system which according to Krey are destruction of private charity government indoctrination and tax increases and inflation Krey 2009 C 3 Guaranteed Employment The purpose of a job guarantee program JGP is to lift the burden off the private sector s shoulders during periods of slow economic growth and provide all the unemployed with a job Pay would be based on the federal minimum wage and legislated benefits would also be provided The system would work like a pendulum in a boom economy workers would move from a JGP to the private sector and back to a JGP during times of economic bust The benefits of a JGP include the elimination of unemployment benefits and the need for other costly social safety nets job security ongoing skills training and development poverty reduction less economic pressure on the healthcare system economic and social stability and increased production of goods and services coupled with a solid consumer base In essence a JGP may be viewed as a genuine bottom up approach to economic recovery It is a program that trickles up and stabilizes the rest of economic activity Strong and stable demand means strong and stable profit expectations A program that stabilizes employment and purchasing power is a program that stabilizes cash flow and earnings Stable incomes through employment also mean stable repayments of debts and greater overall balance sheet stability Tcherneva 2011 On the negative side it may be argued that implementing and running a program like the JGP would be extremely costly However if the government can thereby eliminate many of the costs currently associated with paying people who are not working it may not be a bad proposal Unemployment may be viewed as a policy tool to regulate inflation because when cost pressures rise during a slow unemployment ridden economy interest rates are tightened and wage demands are reduced which together ensure inflation is kept in check On the other hand it has been argued that the back and forth between private and public sector employment and a fixed JGP wage are enough to control inflation This is the view of William F Mitchell Professor of Economics at Newcastle University and Charles Darwin University Australia who has published extensively in the areas of wage and price inflation and unemployment Mitchell 1998 C 4 Tax Credits A long standing proposal to increase employment is to use the tax system to give companies incentives to hire more workers Spence and Hlatshwayo 2011 For example Alan Blinder former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve has proposed giving companies a tax credit equal to ten percent of the increase in their wage payments over the previous year Blinder 2013 Other experts have proposed using tax policy to benefit young people who may be disproportionately affected by technological unemployment Sachs and Kotlikoff 2012 C 5 Greater Priority for Traditional Job Creating Factors Over time we have learned that certain societal factors and forces create new jobs such as technology innovation entrepreneurship and stable social environments Although these forces may not be capable of completing compensating for technological unemployment they may help stall and mitigate the severity of such unemployment Policies such as supporting research and development providing additional financing and reducing regulatory burdens on small business entrepreneurs increasing international trade and promoting stable family environments should therefore be given higher priority in this time of potentially runaway unemployment Baker and Hassett 2012 Spence and Hlatshwayo 2011 Universities are centers of innovation and entrepreneurial start up companies all of which generate high quality jobs and therefore should also be a priority for funding Florida 2013 These policy options seek to redistribute wealth in order to blunt the human and social costs of widespread technological unemployment D 1 Minimum Guaranteed Income MGI One common policy proposal to the problem of technological unemployment is for the government to guarantee a minimum income to each citizen While this proposal seeks to address some of the humanitarian problems associated with chronic unemployment it is also the case that government conferred benefits without demanding work from those who are able undermines the work ethic attenuates social bonds creates an alienated underclass and breeds resentment among those who have to pay assuming the employed are being taxed to assist with subsidization This is the lesson learned from previous welfare programs Of course these impacts would be mitigated somewhat by the government not having to pay for some existing drains on the public purse such as unemployment benefits food stamps and social security that could be replaced by a MGI Nonetheless a MGI would likely have a corrosive effect on the social fabric would not address the need for people to have a meaningful purpose to their lives and would likely be politically infeasible in this era of government cut backs and retrenchment Switzerland s upcoming national referendum on a proposal for a guaranteed national income will be an interesting test case for the political feasibility of the MGI if it is not approved in that nation it is unlikely to be adopted in countries like the USA that historically and culturally have a smaller role for government involvement D 2 Smart Social Programs The human impacts of long term unemployment are real and tragic and from a humanitarian perspective cannot be ignored if we are entering an era of growing technological unemployment Painful lessons from the past half century of social programs have taught us that simply providing disadvantaged individuals with a monthly check does not usually help those people to get back on their feet and become self supporting Rather such handouts tend to create cycles of dependency lethargy and lack of self and external respect While the ethical case for some type of support to ensure a minimal standard of life is strong such support should be structured to include incentives and training provisions Martin Ford for example has suggested a system based on government provided income that is fed by taxation on businesses who will not have to pay wages benefits vacation pay and so forth and consumer goods and services Ford 2009 The model involves incentives that if fulfilled would have a positive effect on one s income the greater the response to the incentives the greater the incomethe individual will receive Such incentives might include participation in environmental stewardship continuing education child care art music volunteer work and other laudable activities Ford s proposal arguably eliminates the often negative effects of having idle hands low self esteem associated with job loss social stigma and unproductivity Under this incentive model the individual incomes received while unequal would not be unfair These policy options seek to revise our educational system to make workers more adept in succeeding in an increasingly technology focused and changing world E 1 Lifelong Education Policies The traditional model of education in which young people spend the first quarter or so of their life getting educated and then are done with education is quickly becoming obsolete In such a rapidly changing world there is a need for continuous life long education rather than the current once and done approach to education today Education will need to become more dispersed and delivered in a multitude of ways throughout a person s life Governments educational establishments and employers will all need to work together to create a new ethos of lifelong learning This shift could be encouraged by a mix of tax credits employee incentives and new online educational technologies to create consumer demand for lifelong learning Michael Spence for example has argued that the education system should be given greater value and to provide access for as many people as possible in order for the U S workforce to remain competitive Spence2011 39 He argues that this focus should go hand in hand with tax reform and government investment in infrastructure and technologySimilarly the NAS reported in 1987 that a key factor in sustaining American living standards and employment thus is continued private and public investment in new knowledge National Academy of Sciences1987 3 The NAS also underscored the importance of establishing training focused adjustment policies for effective worker transitions in the wake of technological displacement The source of funding for this revised educational policy wasdeemed to be beyond the NAS panel s charge One barrier to ongoing training through the workplace is that shorter job durations that many employees now experience provides less incentive for employers to pay for ongoing training since that employer will not get the benefit of that training once the employee has moved on to another job Dau Schmidt 2001 E 2 Updated Education Curriculum In addition to becoming life long the content of education must also change to align with a rapidly changing world At a time of unprecedented global change teaching static views of the world focused on facts and information all of which is now readily available online is obsolete In a world dominated by technology greater emphasis must be given to science technology engineering and mathematics STEM education as has been well recognized recently but slow to be implemented More importantly the type of adaptive and forecasting skills that will be essential in a time of rapid change must be taught including study of the possibilities and probabilities of human change awareness of fluctuations and alternatives a menu of skills for emerging jobs and coping skills flexibility and adaptability to change As Abdul Raheem Yusuf has suggested the era of rapid technological change necessitates that humans of the future be educated thinkers who are problem solvers leaving the mundane tasks to technology Yusuf 2007 Similarly Frank Levy and Richard Murnane predict that The major consequence of computerization will not be mass unemployment but a continued decline in the demand for moderately skilled and less skilled labor Job opportunities will grow but job growth will be greatest in higher skilled occupations in which computers complement expert thinking and complex communication to produce new products and services Levy and Murnane 2004 79 Levy and Murnane further maintain that while better education is not a perfect tool it is the best one we have to prepare workers for the unpredictable and ever changing employment market The authors conclude that many of the jobs already lost will not return and that our dynamic environment requires new policies and the first step in creating those policies is to recognize the new realities Levy and Murnane 2004 82 In a subsequent report prepared for the Organization for Economic Co operation and Development OECD Levy distinguishes among inductive deductive rule based skills expert thinking and complex communication only the first of which can be performed by a computer Jobs requiring expert thinking and complex communication on the other hand require a robust educational foundation and are thus not easily replaced with automation To remain successful in the future job market Levy recommends that workers must stay abreast of job market trends and hone skills that complement technology rather than skills that may be eliminated by same Levy2010 E 3 Greater Educational Experimentation Given the many stresses and changes affecting education this is an opportune time for more experimentation in education to try to find what strategies and approaches work best in the era of evolving technologies and jobs One track to try might be greater emphasis on the type of trade school model used more in the United Kingdom and some other European nations where some students may opt for a more practical and skills oriented training rather than attending traditional college While studies consistently show that young people with a university degree do much better than those without in terms of finding quality jobs Berger and Fisher 2013 Pielke 2012 a growing number of university graduates are not finding worthy jobs despite having gone deeply into debt to pay for their college education and may have fared better with a more focused skills based or trade school education Silva 2013 For example a recent poll conducted by Accenture found that forty one percent of recent college graduates say they are underemployed and sixty three percent say they will need more training in order to get their desired job Accenture 2103 The advent of online education and massive open online courses MOOCs is another opportunity for experimentation Even more radical are promising existing programs to develop robotics for teaching such as RUBI at the University of California San Diego Simon at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Cosmobot developed by AnthroTronix Different models of funding education including private enterprise training and block grants to states can also be tried In all these various experiments in educational innovation careful metrics should be kept to evaluate the success and strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches E 4 Mental Upgrading Brynjolfssonand McAfee 2011 consider ways to directly upgrade the human brain using brain computer interfaces thereby allowing us to better keep pace with technological change Unemployment here is viewed as the result of people not being able to keep pace with technology An enhanced existence may therefore help to eliminate unemployment as our altered state of mind would be better prepared for anything the future throws our way Relatedly our superior cognitive capabilities might induce us to either reject a market economy or alternatively spark new industries to keep employment vibrant These policy options seek to alter the existing social model in which an individual s economic livelihood social status and personal self worth are based on their employment F 1 Health Care Not Tied to Job In the new culture of the future flexibility will be paramount to allow individual workers to adapt to new technologies industries and opportunities Moreover the concept of having a single job is increasingly outmoded for many people who by choice or necessity cobble together their own portfolio of contractual tasks part time jobs short term jobs freelance jobs commissioned projects entrepreneurial initiatives and other income earning opportunities to make their livelihood This pattern will become more and more common going forward The regulatory and social benefit approaches to employment must adjust to this changing model Dau Schmidt 2001 Most people now have their health care tied to a specific employer which constrains the employment flexibility and adaptation that will be needed for the future As Ford writes o ne thing that is abundantly clear is that in a world where traditional jobs are disappearing access to healthcare insurance cannot be coupled to employment Ford 2009 New models of health care will be needed for the future whereby health insurance is not tied to a single employer Health care exchanges such as those that are being established under the Affordable Care Act in the United States health care coops or universal health care are models that will better fit the changing workplace of the future F 2 Alternative Valuation System For hundreds of years our society has been structured on an economic model in which people earn their income through employment and then use that income to pay for their living costs This model may be facing collapse if technological unemployment results in a significant proportion perhaps even a majority of the population eventually unable to support themselves because of the shrinking employment opportunities A new social order will be needed to both provide basic essentials for such people to live a good life as well as to live of life of dignity respect and accomplishment As discussed above simply giving handouts to affected persons undercuts their respect to both themselves and the members of their community Healthy happy living requires the sense that one is making a contribution to something meaningful Traditionally but not always that source of meaning and achievement has often been associated with one s job But that has never been the case for everyone as some find meaning and respect outside of the employment context whether it is as a caregiver for children or elder relatives a volunteer for a charitable organization an advocate for a cause or as a serious hobbyist The problem of technological unemployment means that more people will need to find their meaning or value in life outside of the employment relationship and there will be a need to incentivize and reward such activities when they are socially valuable in a way that can allow those people to obtain the amenities shelter food clothing health care etc necessary to live a full and satisfactory life In the long term this may mean moving beyond the existing economic model where dollars earned are used to recognize and reward effort to a broader and more flexible metric to recognize and reward social value Perhaps some type of online social contribution index will eventually need to be created whereby individuals score points for traditional work volunteer efforts caregiving activities creative inventions good deeds and other socially valuable contributions Compensation and entitlements would be based on each individual s social contribution score The era of Big Data and the massive amount of information collected daily on each person would be used to generate the rankings needed to administer such a system While such a post economic schememay seem far fetched and infeasible at this time such social engineering to restructure our social expectations and reward systems may be needed over the long term to address both the economic and social dimensions of the technology unemployment problem Although such systems go beyond our current market system the fact is that the market system is dependent on customers and if large numbers of consumers perhaps even a majority are without any means to purchase goods and services the market economy cannot succeed Change always brings with it risk and opportunity The rapid emergence of a growing number of technologies that can replace human work presents both risks and opportunities The real possibility of widespread and chronic technological unemployment could result in unacceptable individual and societal instability and adversity But those same technologies also have the potential to enrich our lives and to free us from the drudgery and danger of manual boring labor and to enjoy a higher quality of life To make this happen our laws policies assumptions and social contract must evolve as quickly as our technologies will There is thus an urgent need to identify evaluate and implement policies that can help manage and smooth our transition into the new technological era Perry 2013 Shorter term policies need to focus on preserving and creating as many jobs as possible to counter and delay as much as possible the trend towards technological unemployment and then to use redistribution and government support to ensure that individuals who are replaced from their existing or future jobs by technology have the material means to live a decent life and the incentive to improve themselves and live with dignity and respect Over the longer term more radical social engineering policies will be needed moving eventually to a new social contract that recognizes and rewards people for their contributions to society within and outside the employment context We hope to contribute to the effort to ensure an appropriate policy response by inventorying an initial list of potential policy initiatives to address the emerging technological unemployment problem We plan to post this list online and update it on a regular basis and welcome suggestions from readers for additional ideas of policy interventions that we can add with appropriate attribution to our evolving list There will be no single silver bullet that will solve this problem but rather what is needed is experimentation with a constantly shifting portfolio of policies such as some of the ones provide here The more ideas and proposals are available for policymakers to choose from the more successful and effective their policy experimentation is likely to be Accenture 2013 2013 College Graduate

February 2018Ryan Avent is senior editor and columnist at the Economist and author of The Wealth of Humans Work Power and Status in the Twenty first Century For those of us who have lived in relatively placid times it is hard to believe that American politics could become more chaotic than it is today But far beyond allegations of criminal acts in the executive branch the unending reality show trash talk of the president on his Twitter feed or even nuclear brinkmanship something else will push us into a new and uncertain era of politics likely far stranger and possibly more dangerous than anything in memory The force is technology It s easy to think we re living through a disruptive period now but we re only scratching the surface of what true technological change can do to a society The industrialization of the 19th century reoriented human life on a vast scale shifting production radically from villages and farms toward huge centralized factories powered by coal and steam And politics had to adapt just as radically as humans figured out how to make industrial societies work Institutions shaped around village life strained and broke under the pressures of the millions of people who moved to work in the new factories Story Continued BelowThe result was decades of what would now feel like chaos in the world s most developed nations Getting politicians attention took strikes riots and threats of revolution Comfortable elites were reluctant to give any ground Some disenchanted people fell under the sway of bold new ideologies like communism Nationalists and fascists pitched themselves as the saviors of society from destitution or corruption or the communists From the world wars to the horrors of collectivization in China and the Soviet Union tens of millions of people died as governments worked to manage an alien world built on technologies unlike anything humans had previously seen It was not until decades after World War II that industrial societies figured out how to function well to generate rapid economic growth and rising living standards for rich and poor alike By comparison technological change over the past half century has been almost trivial Cars have gotten better and televisions flatter but computers and the internet haven t yet changed the world into something an American from the 1960s would not recognize Now however a new pivot may be coming Within just a few years driverless cars will be plying the streets in great numbers multilingual artificial intelligence programs will take over many customer service roles and algorithms chewing over the massive amounts of data we emit will manage everything from our day to day health to the contents of our refrigerators Robots are becoming more dexterous and less likely to trip over themselves and gene editing may trigger a transformation that starts with the treatment of disease and could easily end up with the transformation of humans themselves At the moment it is easy and comforting to imagine that the machines will mostly be complementary to human workers whose common sense and human touch will still be necessary But over the next half century AI will get better faster than humans can learn new skills While we are probably still a very long way away from an AI with humanlike general intelligence we are much closer to a world where particular machines can perform specific tasks as well as humans and at far less cost precisely the kind of change that reshaped nations 150 years ago Long before we find ourselves dealing with malevolent AIs or genetically engineered superhumans and perhaps just 10 to 20 years from now we will have to deal with the threat technology poses to our social order and to our politics Long before we find ourselves dealing with malevolent AIs we will have to deal with the threat technology poses to our social order and to our politics Right now it s hard to know just how deep the change will cut One analysis published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development concludes that roughly 10 percent of jobs in advanced economies face automation but widely cited work by scholars at Oxford University puts the share of jobs at risk in America far higher at nearly 50 percent Even at the low end that means that millions or tens of millions of jobs will be lost and as many displaced workers will be forced to seek new work Even tech leaders are warning of the threat in increasingly somber tones Elon Musk is among the Silicon Valley bigwigs to declare support for a universal basic income for example and Bill Gates has proposed taxing robots to help fund programs for displaced workers As new technologies transform the economy wages fall and displaced workers compete with those already employed for available jobs We can see this effect around us now Conventional economics suggests that low unemployment drives wages up But that s not happening this time Despite very low unemployment of just 4 1 percent average earnings are growing at an unusually slow pace Low pay might discourage companies from automating away as many jobs as technology might allow for a time But it also would lead a lot of people to give up the job search And technology would allow a small percentage of uniquely skilled people and well positioned firms to do phenomenally well pushing inequality to unprecedented levels The Friday CoverBy NANCY SCOLAThis world in which technology is improving rapidly and great wealth is being created but a large share of working age adults are not strictly necessary to keep the economy humming at full tilt is one in which unprecedented prosperity should be possible Automation of critical tasks in medicine for example should dramatically reduce the cost of health care while improving accessibility and the quality of treatment at the expense however of vast numbers of jobs Realizing this potential prosperity then means moving to an economy in which work plays a much different role from the one it plays now Politicians instincts will be to focus on bringing back lost work rather than allowing people to do less much like recent populists including President Donald Trump have promised But adapting to a world of powerful AI means enabling far fewer people to work full time and revising full time to something much less than 40 hours per week To do that governments will need to provide more benefits directly and the overall level of redistribution might need to rise considerably Meanwhile we will be faced with a social crisis as people search for purpose and for ways to spend their time and as countries fight over which people should bear the cost burden of providing for which others That s the optimistic version Imagine the social political and legislative changes needed to make such a world a reality Then reflect on how governments have operated over the past decade or so particularly the U S government and it quickly becomes clear what kind of battles we are in for It s hard to build majorities in favor of radical reforms so in the short run the machinery of government will keep failing to address the problem adequately People will grow more frustrated That frustration will all but surely fuel populist and radical movements which will feed off each other and jointly erode the norms and institutions that hold society together a process that we can already see underway in the United States and elsewhere But over time as pressure builds our politics will face much graver challenges We will be back in the early 20th century struggling to understand what needs to change and how to make those changes without grave errors What might we be in for History suggests there are four directions in which society might turn Automation is transforming American society and politics in unprecedented ways no question But humans actually have a long history of fearing the rise of the machines and visualizing that anxiety Here POLITICO s resident Pulitzer Prize winning cartoonist and illustrator Matt Wuerker compiled a selection of magazine covers and political cartoons capturing that theme going back to the 1800s Clockwise from top Winsor McCay San Francisco Examiner 1933 William Heath The March of Intellect series 1829 Science and Invention 1924 Ron Cobb Los Angeles Free Press 1969 Oliver Patent political cartoon 1882 Credits Library of Congress Flickr Ron Cobb Alamy Trustees of the British museumThe best case scenario is one in which American society experiences a great awakening leading to a flowering of social movements that provide the political support for significant reforms This is not an impossibility During the Industrial Revolution social reformers pushed governments to end child labor and provide more support to the poor to build systems of public education and to address mass social ills as in the temperance movement which led the charge for Prohibition not all radical reform efforts worked out as hoped Social pressure was crucial to expanding the franchise it drove the civil rights movement Society can prove surprisingly malleable even over short time horizons as dramatic recent changes in norms regarding gay rights drug decriminalization and sexual harassment indicate Politicians love invoking jobs on the campaign trail Could that change in a future where Americans work less 1968 Richard Nixon In the next four years we must help create 15 million new jobs And I mean jobs with futures jobs that give a man s work meaning not government make work jobs 1976 Gerald Ford One test of a healthy economy is a job for every American who wants to work 1980 Ronald Reagan We cannot support our families unless there are jobs and we cannot have jobs unless people have both money to invest and the faith to invest it 1988 Michael Dukakis It s not about overthrowing governments in Central America it s about creating jobs in middle America 1992 Bill Clinton This country desperately needs a jobs program And my first priority would be to pass a jobs program to introduce it on the first day I was inaugurated 2008 Barack Obama You go into these small towns in Pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the Midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing s replaced them And it s not surprising then they get bitter 2012 Mitt Romney So if the president wants to talk about jobs and I hope he does we ll be comparing my record with his record And he comes up very very short 2016 Hillary Clinton First which candidate has a real plan to create good paying jobs 2016 Donald Trump I will be the greatest jobs president God has ever created Credit APSuch dramatic reforms are harder to come by when they involve large scale changes to welfare states but perhaps we will see new institutions through which those without work can contribute their time and labor to society That could include improved access to and funding for early childhood and adult education or perhaps more ambitiously the charge for a universal state provided basic income which would allow those who can only contribute through volunteer efforts to earn the purchasing power they need to enjoy a normal life In America in particular community action has long been the first line of defense against social hardship from the Granger movement promoting agricultural communities after the Civil War to the Volunteers of America looking after those battered by the Depression A new sense of community and social obligation might be just the thing to help shake government out of a dangerous complacency If not however a second more dire scenario might come to pass that of creeping authoritarianism This too was a feature of industrial history from government efforts to crush trade unions to the totalitarianism of some communist and fascist regimes A gridlocked America has already shown a worrying tendency to respond to crisis with strong law bending executive power in response to the threat of terrorism economic weakness and legislative dysfunction Intense partisan disagreement over how to respond to the economic challenges thrown up by the digital revolution might lead to permanent gridlock in America or to a constant succession of fragile coalitions in multiparty Europe If such governments are placed under pressure by economic crisis or threats real or imagined like hacking terrorism or revolutionary elements society at large will tolerate the application of greater ever more extra legal authority by the executive That s because while creeping authoritarianism would do nothing to solve the underlying economic troubles created by the digital era it could help manage them Powerful corporate and military forces could be coopted by an authoritarian regime and would thereby have an incentive not to resist the forces remaking society Dissenters could be oppressed Unfortunately new technologies often provide would be tyrants with new and powerful tools to keep society in line It is all too easy to imagine how large tech companies could be compelled by the carrot of state favor and the stick of aggressive antitrust action to help monitor dissidents punish enemies and reward friends Authoritarianism has enjoyed a revival of sorts in recent years as countries like Russia and Turkey have slipped back toward despotism Poland and Hungary have taken steps in this direction This is in many ways the path of least resistance in the face of unmanageable economic change If democracy cannot respond effectively and authoritarianism does not keep the peace then a third scenario becomes more probable state failure That might entail secession The more that resources are shared between rich places and poor ones the more that richer places like Catalonia which only recently voted for independence from Spain will find themselves drawn to breaking away It is difficult to imagine such a movement gaining momentum in America which has its own ugly experience with secession and civil war Yet even now large and economically powerful states like California are charting their own courses to the extent legally possible Were in some future the federal government to repeatedly resist or the Supreme Court to nullify measures deemed critical within California to meet the challenges of the new economy and if California were then to mount massive public resistance how much violence would Washington actually risk to keep citizens from going their own way If democracy cannot respond effectively and authoritarianism does not keep the peace then a third scenario becomes more probable state failure State failure might also end in revolution America has its own revolutionary history too and revolutions were a relatively common part of industrial history and still are outside of advanced economies Now and even in the depths of the last recession there was no appetite for such radicalism Neither did the crisis weaken most rich world governments enough to make them vulnerable to such political upheaval But imagine a world two decades hence in which inequality has grown significantly the government can scarcely manage to keep itself operating perhaps because of severe budget disagreements or a cyberattack young and healthy adults face a high rate of chronic unemployment and living standards seriously deteriorate in economically battered communities Perhaps under such circumstances a new ideological movement which had struggled to attract followers outside a committed core finds itself winning converts within the military while enjoying surprising electoral success not enough to break the gridlock but enough to claim a mandate to govern Such a movement might be idealistically utopian in nature promising to deliver the better technological future that existing institutions cannot But it might also be ruthlessly pragmatic in nature committed to keep society functioning by creating new rigid social hierarchies isolating military leaders and the high priests of technology from a repressed rabble There is a fourth possible future the deus ex machina the external shock that creates the conditions for radical but democratic change Across much of the industrialized world including the United States it took the brutal years of 1914 to 1945 the Depression and World War II in particular to foster broad acceptance of high tax rates to weaken the power of established elites and to build consensus in favor of a strong social safety net One of the most important and disturbing facts of modern economic history is that this bloody destructive period and its immediate aftermath represent the one time in which most advanced economies were able to reduce inequality significantly It may be that the social cohesion needed to build a truly inclusive economy which puts technology to work to the benefit of all is impossible to build in the absence of such dire threats Dept of the FutureBy DANNY VINIKThese scenarios might sound like fantasy because most of us have never experienced anything like them But most of us have never experienced the sort of dramatic economic change that turns existing ways of life on their head Soon we will If we could find a way to do a better job of meeting the needs of those hurt by economic change and seizing available opportunities to strengthen the economy like capitalizing on low interest rates to invest in infrastructure and training then the worst possible outcomes might be avoided But if we cannot if technological change means that governments fail to meet the needs of their citizens and if those citizens grow less content as a result pressure will build until a solution appears one way

LLCGovernment economic policy measures by which a government attempts to influence the economy The national budget generally reflects the economic policy of a government and it is partly through the budget that the government exercises its three principal methods of establishing control the allocative function the stabilization function and the distributive function Over time there have been considerable changes in emphasis on these different economic functions of the budget In the 19th century government finance was primarily concerned with the allocative function The job of government was to raise revenue as cheaply and efficiently as possible to perform the limited tasks that it could do better than the private sector As the 20th century began the distribution function acquired increased significance Social welfare benefits became important and many countries introduced graduated tax systems In the later interwar period and more especially in the 1950s and 60s stabilization was central although equity was also a major concern in the design of tax systems In the 1970s and 80s however the pendulum swung back Once more allocative issues came to the fore and stabilization and distribution became less significant in government finance The allocative function in budgeting determines on what government revenue will be spent Because a high proportion of national income is now devoted to public expenditure allocation decisions become more significant in political and economic terms At all times and in all countries the calls for expenditure on specific services or activities or for more generous transfer payments will always exceed the amount that can reasonably be raised in taxation or by borrowing The debate about how these scarce resources should be allocated has continued for hundreds of years and although numerous methods of deciding on priorities have emerged it has never been satisfactorily resolved In practice most democracies contain a number of different factions that disagree on the proper allocation of resources and indeed the proper level of public sector involvement in the economy the frequent change of national governments is related to the constant search for the right answers Economists have sought to provide objective criteria for public expenditures through the so called theory of public goods It is generally recognized that some goods needed by the public cannot be provided through the private market Lighthouses are a classic example The costs of a lighthouse are such that no one shipowner will want to finance it on the other hand if a lighthouse is provided for one shipowner it can be made available to all for no additional cost Indeed it must be available to all since there is no practical means of excluding ships from using the facility provided by the lighthouse even if their owners have refused to pay for it The only practical method of providing such services is by collective action If goods are to be provided in this way rather than through the private market it is immediately necessary to confront the twin problems of deciding how much to provide and who should pay for that provision Even if all individuals wanted the service equally as perhaps with lighthouses their views on the extent of the service would be influenced by the allocation of the costs Where different households may have different preferences and some may not want the service at all as for example with defense by nuclear weapons these difficulties are compounded Economists have tried to devise abstract voting schemes that would reconcile these difficulties but these appear to have little practical application Moreover others would challenge this whole approach to the problem It would be absurd to say that the consumer has a taste for national defense and that it is the job of the government to satisfy it The task of national leaders is to evolve a defense policy and persuade the public to accept it Similarly conservationists must attempt to awaken the public to the importance of parks and wildlife In the context of public policy the efficient allocation of resources consists not merely of distributing funds in the pursuit of given objectives but also involves determining the objectives themselves Genuine public goods pose severe problems for the national budget it is very difficult to decide how far particular goods the arts national parks even defense should be supplied and therefore no formal procedure of determination is likely to evolve What should be given to each will continue to be the subject of intense political debate with allocation changing as the government changes The concept of merit goods assists governments in deciding which public or other goods should be supplied Merit goods are commodities that the public sector provides free or cheaply because the government wishes to encourage their consumption Goods such as subsidized housing or social services which predominantly help the poor or health care services which help the poor and elderly are generally regarded as having considerable merit and therefore have a strong claim on government resources Other examples include the provision of retraining schemes or urban regeneration programs Once decisions have been made on how the limited national budget should be divided between different groups of activities or even before this public authorities need to decide which specific projects should be undertaken One method that has been used is cost benefit analysis This attempts to do for government programs what the forces of the marketplace do for business programs to measure and compare in terms of money the discounted streams of future benefits and future costs associated with a proposed project If the ratio of benefits to costs is considered satisfactory the project should be undertaken Satisfactory means among other things that the project is superior to any available public or private alternative Or if funds are limited public investment projects may be assigned priorities according to their cost benefit ratios One difficulty with cost benefit analysis is that every government agency has an incentive to estimate favourable ratios for its own projects It must after all compete with other agencies for funds No one can be certain as to the returns to be expected from an irrigation canal or a highway Private investors have also been known to exaggerate their claims in appealing to stockholders but they are generally subject to market sanctions that encourage them to err on the side of caution In addition to the possibility that cost benefit analysis may be biased by the preformed views of those commissioning the study there are other more fundamental difficulties Almost all proposals have effects that are difficult to value in monetary terms The siting of a new airport brings problems of noise and property blight to local people and increases the risk that civilians may die in an accident Putting a sensible value on human life has been a continuing difficulty for those carrying out cost benefit analyses even though every project does in fact affect probabilities of life and death These problems are of course not confined to cost benefit analysis Additional expenditure on health service or on road safety or better housing or heating old people s homes in winter all affect the number of people who die prematurely The failure of cost benefit analysis to provide answers to the problems of valuing life or the quality of life is a reflection of the wider problem confronting all decisions on public expenditure the influence of subjective judgment Until the mid 1970s the proportion of economic activity controlled by the government and the share of taxes in national income tended to increase in most countries Since then however challenges to this growth in the role of government have become increasingly influential and moves to privatization have been common There are several types of privatization One involves the sale to private owners of state owned assets and this is most correctly called privatization Publicly owned houses may be sold to their occupants Commodity stockpiles may be reduced or disbanded Increasingly however attention has been turned to the sale of publicly owned industries thus reversing the move to nationalization that occurred particularly in western Europe around and after World War II Where the privatized industry operates in a competitive environment no new problems arise Singapore has privatized its airline system for example which now competes with a mixture of privately and publicly owned international airlines Where privatization occurs but monopoly continues however there are new difficulties Both Japan and the United Kingdom have privatized their telecommunications networks Although in certain limited areas of telecommunications competition is possible and has been allowed to develop in both the United States and Britain technical and legal restrictions inhibit competition in many sectors of the industry Regulation is necessary therefore to restrict the freedom of privatized monopolies or near monopolies to raise prices and to exploit consumers in other ways In the United States which has by far the longest history of regulating private utilities such regulation has normally limited the rate of return that they earn to what is considered a fair level A disadvantage of this is that it may give the industry no greater incentive to increased efficiency than would exist in public ownership since higher costs can be passed directly onto consumers There have been experiments therefore with other forms of regulation which seek to strike a balance between incentives for better performance and the ability to exploit consumers A further problem for such regulation is that utilities and similar industries normally operate in both competitive and monopoly markets They may be inclined to use their monopoly power in some areas to gain unfair competitive advantages in others Despite these difficulties an increasingly wide range of industries ranging from water supply to airports are now considered candidates for privatization Privatization can also mean the dismantling of existing statutory restrictions on competition State activities are often protected by legal prohibitions on competing private enterprise German railways for example are entirely state owned and the law not only prevents competing railroads but severely restricts coach services and limits competitive trucking The dismantling of such restrictions is seen as one method of improving the efficiency of state concerns Another demand of privatization is the contracting out of publicly provided services U S municipalities have often entrusted activities such as refuse collection and in some cases even fire service to private contractors and European countries are increasingly experimenting with similar schemes These possibilities demonstrate that a service may be government financed but not necessarily provided by the government if extended more widely the concept could yield a different view of the economic role of the state While the objective of privatization is often to increase the efficiency of government activities its implementation may also have important effects on government revenue Any savings that result from lower costs lead directly to lower tax rates Where budgeting procedures do not distinguish between capital and current transactions the proceeds of privatization sales provide a once and for all boost to revenues The availability of this source of funding for state activity has given an artificial attractiveness to privatization especially in the United Kingdom If an industry is sold for the present value of its expected earnings and if these earnings are the same in public and private ownership privatization should have no net impact on public finances If it is expected to be more efficient in the private sector government finance on balance gains If it is sold for less than the maximum revenue that would be obtained and this is often the case either because of the difficulty of selling assets as large as nationalized industries or because the government wishes to secure a wide dispersion of share ownership the impact is likely to be negative Government spending is not the only way in which government allocates resources Its regional policies will determine whether domestic and overseas investors build factories in particular places while its taxation policies will determine whether they build them at all Government competition and merger policies affect the structure of industry and commerce while regulatory activities setting the number of hours shops may be open or who may buy cigarettes have profound effects on commercial activities Government also affects allocations by setting the legal and administrative framework within which the economy functions It may specify minimum wage levels or control the siting of new ventures and the activities of existing ones Such activities of government profoundly affect the allocation of resources but they are rarely monitored or subject to serious control Stabilization of the economy e g full employment control of inflation and an equitable balance of payments is one of the goals that governments attempt to achieve through manipulation of fiscal and monetary policies Fiscal policy relates to taxes and expenditures monetary policy to financial markets and the supply of credit money and other financial assets The use of fiscal and monetary policy as a means of stabilizing the economy is relatively recent for the most part a development of the period after World War II During the 19th century the only stabilization policy was that associated with the international gold standard Under the gold standard if a deficit occurred in a country s balance of payments gold tended to flow out of the country To counteract this process the monetary authorities would raise interest rates and stiffen credit requirements causing a fall in prices income and employment this in turn led to a reduction in imports and an expansion of exports thus improving the balance of payments If a country had a surplus in its balance of payments gold tended to flow in this meant that the interest rate fell and the supply of money and credit was increased As a consequence imports were stimulated and exports discouraged so that the surplus in the balance of payments tended to disappear The adjustment mechanism also included another important element capital movements between countries When interest rates fell in surplus countries and rose in deficit countries mobile international financial capital tended to flow from the former to the latter contributing to the elimination of deficits and surpluses in the balance of payments The working of this mechanism was partly automatic and partly the result of deliberate actions by the monetary authorities in each country In this form of stabilization policy external stability was achieved at the cost of stability in the domestic economy fluctuations in domestic prices incomes and employment functioned as the levers for bringing about equilibrium in the balance of payments Occasionally governments attempted to reduce the impact of this mechanism on the domestic economy particularly on the price level In particular governments in some surplus countries took sterilization actions to prevent the gold inflow from increasing the supply of money and credit to the maximum extent This could be done if the central bank offset its purchases of foreign exchange and gold with sales of government securities on the domestic credit market A somewhat more ambitious type of stabilization policy emerged in the period after World War I During the late 1920s and early 1930s the need to reduce unemployment acquired more urgency Previously the exchange rate the balance of payments and occasionally the price level had been considered more important than the situation in the labour market During the 1920s unemployment in Great Britain rose to very high levels between 20 and 30 percent of the labour force Consequently there was much discussion of whether employment could be increased by actions of the public authorities At first the discussion in Great Britain centred on the feasibility of public works programs as a means of putting men to work there was a growing belief that these programs might also be a good means of raising the general level of economic activity through their effect on purchasing power Some maintained that budget deficits would also raise the level of economic activity An active part in this discussion was taken by the economist J M Keynes and also by the Liberal Party which in 1928 published proposals for government intervention entitled Britain s Industrial Future The first countries to adopt the new policies were Sweden and Germany When the Nazi Party took power in Germany in 1933 its rearmament policies helped to reduce unemployment and to stimulate the economy In Sweden the new Social Democratic government attempted in more modest ways to expand the economy and ease unemployment through increased government expenditures in 1932 33 In the United States a very limited attempt was made by the administration of Pres Herbert Hoover but Franklin D Roosevelt made a more aggressive effort with such projects as the Works Progress Administration WPA which carried on its payroll an average of more than 2 000 000 workers per year from 1935 to 1941 Unemployment however persisted at a high level until World War II although there was a significant drop from a level of about 25 percent in 1933 The new stabilization policy needed a theoretical rationale if it was ever to win general acceptance from the leaders of public opinion The main credit for providing this belongs to Keynes In his General Theory of Employment Interest and Money 1935 36 he endeavoured to show that a capitalist economy with its decentralized market system does not automatically generate full employment and stable prices and that governments should pursue deliberate stabilization policies There has been much controversy among economists over the substance and meaning of Keynes s theoretical contribution Essentially he argued that high levels of unemployment might persist indefinitely unless governments took monetary and fiscal action At that time he believed that fiscal action was likely to be more effective than monetary measures In the deep depression of the 1930s interest rates had ceased to exert much influence on the ways in which owners of wealth disposed of their funds they might choose to hold larger cash balances instead of spending more money as the traditional theory had suggested Nor were investors inclined to take advantage of low interest rates if they could not find profitable uses for borrowed funds particularly if their firms were already suffering from excess capacity Keynes s pessimistic view of monetary policy had a strong influence on economists and governments during and immediately after World War II with the result that monetary policy was not tried very much during the 1940s It was often forgotten during the policy discussions of the time that Keynes s views on the efficacy of monetary policy were related to the particular situation of the 1930s Another influential idea embodied in Keynes s writing was that of economic stagnation He suggested that in the advanced industrial countries people tended to save more as their incomes grew larger and that private consumption tended to be a smaller and smaller part of the national income This implied that investment would have to take a continually larger share of the national income in order to maintain full employment Since he doubted that investment would rise sufficiently to do this Keynes was rather pessimistic about the possibility of achieving full employment in the long run He thus suggested that there might be some permanent tendency to high levels of unemployment This also had considerable influence on economic policy during the early postwar period it was some time before those in decision making positions realized that inflation rather than stagnation and unemployment was to be the main problem confronting them The desirability of pursuing policies to maintain high levels of employment was generally accepted in most industrial countries after the war In 1944 the British government stated in its White Paper on Employment Policy that the government accept as one of their primary aims and responsibilities the maintenance of a high and stable level of employment after the war One of the most influential British economists at this time was Sir William Beveridge whose book Full Employment in a Free Society had a strong impact on general thinking Similar ideas were expressed in the United States in the Employment Act of 1946 which stated The Congress hereby declares that it is the continuing policy and responsibility of the Federal Government to promote maximum employment production and purchasing power The Employment Act was less specific as to policy than the British government s White Paper but it established a council of economic advisers to assist the president and called upon him to present to every regular session of Congress a report on the state of the economy The president was also required to present a program showing ways and means of promoting a high level of employment and production Similar programs were adopted in other countries In Sweden in 1944 the Social Democrats published a document somewhat similar to the British White Paper and other such declarations were made in Canada and Australia Fiscal policy attempts to control the actions of individuals and companies by means of spending and taxation decisions On the expenditure side it can achieve this by spending money in ways for example on construction projects that stimulate other activity while on the taxation side it can affect work investment or production decisions by changing tax rates and levels Fiscal policy thus has two major components an overall effect generated by the balance between the resources the government puts into the economy through expenditures and the resources it takes out through taxation charges or borrowing and a microeconomic effect generated by the specific policies it adopts Both are important in stabilizing the economy Overall fiscal policy involves the government in deciding whether it should spend more than it receives or less The development of countercyclical fiscal policies in the post World War II period reflected the explicit attempt by some governments to protect their population from world recessions by deliberately spending additional money at appropriate times Experience with countercyclical fiscal policy has been disappointing in many cases the lag between identifying the problem and fiscal response has been too long with the result that a fiscal boost coincided with the next boom while a contraction might coincide with the next recession Fiscal policies that were intended to be countercyclical could end up exacerbating the original problems Another facet to fiscal policy is a government s attempt to guide the development of the economy by more specifically targeted policies Thus most countries have from time to time attempted to cushion particular areas from the effects of a decline in their dominant industry by regional policies to affect labour supply and demand by taxation and to change the pattern of consumer purchases by changes to indirect taxes These policies sometimes backfire as unforeseen consequences and interactions occur The simple notion of budget balance although widespread can be seriously misleading to one who attempts to decide whether a government is being expansionary or contractionary at a particular time If nothing else were happening and there were no inflation no changes in unemployment or exchange rates and the country were to have a constant population of all ages then the government s fiscal position or stance might be said to be neutral neither expansionary nor contractionary if spending were an exact match of taxation charges and profits on public sector activities Even in such a case however if it were pursuing specific microeconomic policies its neutrality might hide significant effects on the behaviour of the economy This notion has led many countries to believe that fiscal position is appropriately measured by the size of public borrowing because this measures the difference between the amount government spends and the amount it receives The recognition that simple budget balance not accounting for inflation may not in fact be neutral when other things are changing has led to a number of suggestions for more sophisticated measures of fiscal position The full employment budget surplus suggested by the Council of Economic Advisers in the United States for instance attempts to adjust the simple measure of budget deficit or surplus in reaction to the effects of deviations from a level of unemployment that it regards as normal or full The argument for this kind of adjustment is that high levels of unemployment cause increased benefit payments and reduced tax receipts that are abnormal and if the government were to try to maintain a simple budget balance at times of high employment this would require a large contraction in the other activities it supports A simple deficit then may be a surplus on a full employment basis and government action may be severely contractionary despite positive levels of borrowing Another type of suggested adjustment recognizes that inflation erodes the real value of public debt The neutral simple budget balance it is argued only requires that the government maintain its real asset position If inflation is eroding the real value of existing debt then the government may borrow to an adjusted or revised level before its actions actually reduce public assets Although it has come to be recognized that a simple budget deficit or surplus does not adequately reflect a government s fiscal position no country directly employs measures revised for unemployment and inflation in deciding on countercyclical policies This is partly because they are more difficult for politicians to understand and partly because it is genuinely difficult to decide on the precise form they should take Whatever the reason many countries even at times of high inflation and unemployment continue to focus on the simple budget balance measures The United Kingdom for example continued in 1980 81 to attempt to reduce public borrowing during a serious world recession and ran an adjusted surplus This procyclical policy is blamed by many as a cause of the high levels of unemployment that subsequently prevailed in that country The heyday of fiscal stabilization policies was however the 1950s and 60s In the 1970s governments became increasingly concerned about inflationary pressures and important disturbances particularly the oil crisis disrupted world economies Stabilization became a less important policy goal and one that governments were increasingly unable to achieve Monetarist economic theories acquired increased influence The primary economic issues determining fiscal policies once again became the more traditional concerns of allocation and distribution Although the governmental budget is primarily concerned with fiscal policy defining what resources it will raise and what it will spend the government also has a number of tools that it can use to affect the economy through monetary control By managing its portfolio of debt it can affect interest rates and by deciding on the amount of new money injected into the economy it can affect the amount of cash in circulation and therefore indirectly affect prices and other economic variables In recent years governments discouraged by past failures with fiscal manipulation have turned to monetarist policies to attempt control of the economy At its simplest monetarist theory postulates that in the economy there is a fixed amount of money which circulates at a given velocity This money is then available to finance the various transactions carried out in the economy at the prevailing prices Under these circumstances according to the theory control of the price level can be maintained by controlling the amount of available money Although a desire to control inflation has been at the heart of the recent rise to prominence of monetary policies in many countries monetary policy can be used to affect a number of different facets of economic behaviour In time of unemployment the central bank may stimulate private investment expenditure and possibly also household spending on consumer goods by reducing interest rates and taking measures to increase the supply of credit liquid assets and money The customary tools for doing this are open market operations the discount rate of the central bank and cash reserve requirements for commercial banks In open market operations the central bank buys government securities bonds and treasury bills from the private sector The effect is to reduce interest rates by bidding up bond prices The sellers of the government securities obtain cash that they deposit in the banks thus increasing the cash reserves of the banks and enabling them to expand credit to private borrowers this in turn causes interest rates in the private sector to fall and the terms of credit to become easier In response firms are likely to increase their investment expenditures and households are likely to spend more on consumer goods The second tool of monetary policy the discount rate of the central banks is often used together with open market operations This is the interest rate at which commercial banks can borrow funds from the central bank If the discount rate is reduced banks become more willing to extend credit to private borrowers because they can obtain funds themselves on easier terms In many countries changes in the discount rate tend to be followed by similar changes in the interest rates charged by banks to their borrowers The third tool of monetary policy that of the cash reserve requirements and in some countries certain types of government securities for commercial banks provides that banks must maintain money balances in the form of deposits in the central bank at a certain proportion of their liabilities This means that the banks cannot expand their earning assets such as government securities and private loans beyond that point If the government reduces the reserve requirements the banks can expand their loans further thus increasing the total volume of credit outstanding Monetary policy like fiscal policy may also be used to combat inflationary tendencies by reversing the above measures the central bank will then sell government securities thereby increasing interest rates and reducing the supply of private credit and money raise the discount rate or increase reserve requirements A broad distinction may be made between two types of stabilization policies discretionary and automatic Discretionary policies involve deliberate actions taken by the authorities such as open market operations changes in discount rates and reserve requirements and changes in tax rates or government expenditures Automatic policies put reliance on built in stabilizers that function without any deliberate intervention by the authorities In the monetary field for example an increase in commodity prices tends to reduce the real value of financial assets and if the government does nothing to offset this by increasing the volume of financial assets in the system private spending will tend to decline On the fiscal side the main automatic stabilizer is the relation between tax revenues and cyclical changes in the economy During booms tax revenues rise and the need for expenditures on unemployment compensation decreases channeling a larger proportion of the national income into government coffers these effects are accentuated if the tax system is progressive because tax revenues rise more rapidly than money incomes Provided that the government does not raise its expenditures along with the increased revenues the budget tends to have a braking effect on private expenditure in boom times and an expansionary effect in times of recession There has been much discussion over the merits of discretionary policies as against automatic stabilizers One advantage of automatic stabilizers is that the effects occur without the necessity of government action which means that there is no delay or lag because of political controversies administrative problems or difficulties in determining whether the time has come to act There are three types of lag in economic policy the recognition lag the decision lag and the effect lag The recognition lag is the time it takes for the authorities to discover the need to make a change in economic policy The reasons for this type of lag are that statistical information is often somewhat behind the event and that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between random fluctuations and fundamental shifts in economic trends Governments prefer to wait until there is certainty that say an increase in unemployment is not a passing thing The decision lag is the period between the time when the need for action is recognized and the time when action is taken Although the recognition lag is presumably of about the same duration for both monetary and fiscal policies the decision lag is usually considerably shorter for monetary policy than for fiscal policy The central bank can change monetary policy almost overnight whereas a change in fiscal policy is more complex both politically and administratively In many countries changes in income taxes for example can be made only at the beginning of a calendar year such changes are often complicated by political discussions in the legislative body The effect lag is the amount of time between the time action is taken and an effect is realized Monetary policy involves longer delays than fiscal policy the time between a change in monetary policy and its ultimate effect on private investment may be between one and two years Some economists argue that the sum of all the lags is so long and uncertain that the best strategy is not to take any action by the time the effects occur the economic situation may be radically different Some countries have tried to shorten the lags in fiscal and monetary policy One way to reduce the recognition lag is to improve the forecasting techniques for example by using sophisticated questionnaires or computerized econometric models In order to reduce the decision lag in fiscal policy some countries have given the authorities power to take limited action without the prior consent of the legislature In the United Kingdom the government introduced a regulation that allowed it to make immediate changes in tax policy In Belgium and West Germany the governments also have some discretionary powers to change tax rates without first asking the legislature In most countries however the legislative bodies have been reluctant to give up control of the budget and increasing skepticism about the effectiveness of stabilization policy has led to a retreat from frequent small adjustments to fiscal policy Attempts to shorten the effect lag of fiscal policy have produced new policy tools Some countries now use systems of taxes or subsidies to influence business investment within a relatively short time Attempts have also been made to reduce the effect lag in monetary policy Some countries have tried using various tools of credit rationing rather than relying on traditional measures such as open market operations But the effect lag is still a serious problem for monetary policy Perhaps the most serious unsolved problem of stabilization policy is the multiplicity of goals that policymakers must consider Every government has aims other than stabilizing the economy First it must stay in power a need that is likely to limit the alternatives open to stabilization policy particularly in periods of prosperity immediately before elections Second some monetary and fiscal actions impinge on particular groups in society and governments may wish to avoid what appear to be discriminatory policies Third a policy designed to achieve one element of stabilization such as full employment may prevent the achievement of another The conflict between full employment and price stability seems to arise in two different sets of circumstances Often wage increases that are made in the normal collective bargaining process are greater than the increases in labour productivity or output per man hour such wage increases tend to increase the cost of production and to force prices upward The government is then confronted with a choice between two unpleasant alternatives One is to allow the general price level to rise approximately in proportion to the increase in production costs the other alternative is to try to hold prices down by taking measures to restrict aggregate demand thus making it difficult for firms to shift their increased costs to the consumer through higher prices The latter alternative means increased unemployment Many governments have been confronted with exactly this choice of alternatives Wage gains made in collective bargaining have forced them to choose between allowing prices to move upward or attempting to hold prices stable at the cost of greater unemployment Another reason for the conflict between full employment and price stability is the tendency of wage increases to accelerate when the level of employment rises and the number of job vacancies increases In other words as the economy approaches full employment wages tend to rise at an increasing speed As prices begin to rise the conflict between full employment and price stability may be further exacerbated by the expectation that they will rise still further this may for example induce employees and their organizations to press for greater wage increases than they otherwise would in order to compensate for the expected price increases Another conflict in policy may arise with respect to the balance of payments When the economy is in a period of boom there is a tendency for imports to increase and sometimes for exports to decrease as well with obvious difficulties for the balance of payments The crisis may be heightened by short term capital movements if buyers and sellers of foreign exchange expect that there may be a devaluation of the country s currency This has caused much difficulty for many countries in the period since World War II In Britain and Denmark notably periods of boom have usually been accompanied by balance of payments problems When that occurs the government must sooner or later take restrictive actions that slow the economy down and increase unemployment if speculation in the currency is already under way it may be necessary to pursue the restrictive policy far into the next recession The problem is accentuated if there have been substantial price increases during the boom that have reduced the country s ability to compete with other countries It is ironic that a temporary improvement in the employment situation may if it leads to an accelerated increase in the price level serve to create greater unemployment in the future when restrictive actions become necessary for balance of payments reasons Attempts have been made to eliminate these conflicts of policy One remedy is incomes policy direct efforts by the government to prevent employers and unions from raising prices and wages Various methods have been tried The most moderate is the so called guideposts system under which the government announces the need for restraints on wage increases and perhaps also sets targets to guide unions and management this was attempted in the United States in the early 1960s In Sweden responsibility for limiting wage increases has been assigned to labour management organizations where bargaining takes place in a centralized fashion A more interventionist approach is for the government to enter the bargaining process and try to persuade unions to limit their wage demands The government may go still further and announce a wage freeze or even a system of wage and price control In the Netherlands the courts have occasionally been empowered to set wages but the resulting decisions have often been uncoordinated with the rest of stabilization policy Incomes policies have sometimes succeeded for short periods Generally however public refusal to accept the restraints has eventually led to their collapse In the United States the guideposts broke down during the boom of the mid 1960s and attempts at incomes policy in Sweden and Britain have not been notable for their success Even in the Netherlands later attempts to impose the system have failed to limit the rate of wage increase Governments have displayed serious deficiencies in their ability to handle stabilization policy Political leaders often lack economic information and understanding and their economic advisers find it difficult to explain the economic situation to them and to apprise them of the relevant tools There are also a variety of political inhibitions against taking action One consequence is that what is designed to be a countercyclical policy becomes a procyclical one instead of stabilizing the economy it tends to destabilize it The postwar experience in Britain is held by some to demonstrate the deficiencies of government in handling monetary and fiscal policy In time of boom the government often followed an expansionary course when a balance of payments crisis developed it then took restrictive action too late and pushed the economy into deeper recession than would otherwise have occurred On the basis of this experience some economists have argued that a policy that did not attempt to counter the short run swings in the economy would have been more successful in achieving stabilization They maintain that the authorities should concentrate on letting the volume of money and credit increase steadily at a rate dictated by the long term growth trend of the economy Those who hold this view believe that capitalist economies are inherently stable that crises are usually the result of bad policies on the part of the public authorities Most economists do not share their optimism as to the stability of the economy if left alone they continue to believe that governments must seek better tools for the purpose of short run stabilization The application of full employment policies after World War II was made more difficult by the fact that the postwar situation was radically different from that of the 1930s when much of the policy thinking had been done Most governments and their advisers expected a depression after the war but it never materialized One explanation is that the reallocation of resources from military to civilian uses proceeded more smoothly than expected Another explanation is that the consumers spent a larger part of their disposable income than they had been observed to do in the 1930s upsetting some of the statistical projections based on empirical data from those years A third explanation which applies perhaps to the years after 1948 was the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union which raised defense spending in many countries The period of the late 1940s and early 1950s proved to be characterized by tendencies to inflation rather than to unemployment Governments were slow to realize this and to shift their emphasis from employment creating policies to anti inflationary policies The fact that governments had accepted to a large extent the belief that monetary policy was not very important made it difficult for them to combat the tendencies to inflation In most countries a passive even expansionary monetary policy was in effect interest rates were kept down and the supply of money was allowed to grow faster than would have been consistent with stable prices Inflationary tendencies were further stimulated by the Korean War and the great increases in raw material prices that accompanied it During the 1950s several important developments influenced the attitudes of governments toward stabilization policy Most of the economic controls engendered by the war were removed particularly in international trade and finance The western European countries were in a period of rapid economic growth With the removal of direct controls on prices imports and building investment governments began to develop and refine the tools of monetary and fiscal policy In most countries the passive attitude toward monetary policy disappeared during the early 1950s there was increased interest in more flexible monetary management Interest also grew in developing a systematic fiscal policy that would offset the cyclical swings in production and employment The most energetic attempts to devise a countercyclical fiscal policy were made in Britain and Sweden Other European countries and the United States placed more reliance on monetary policy In the United States a contributing factor in the revival of monetary policy was a theoretical reformulation that took place among monetary and banking experts This was the so called availability theory of credit it held that monetary policy had its effect on spending not only directly through interest rates but also by restricting the general availability of credit and liquid funds It was argued that even rather small changes in the rate of interest for government securities could have a considerable impact on the supply of private credit if the supply diminished this would induce banks and other financial institutions to stiffen their credit standards and ration credit to their customers this in turn it was argued would tend to curb investment and thus have a braking effect on the economy Similar ideas were at work in other countries but with more emphasis on limiting the availability of credit through credit rationing loan ceilings control of private bond issues regulation of installment credit for the purchase of durable consumer goods and so on Serious attempts have been made to put a countercyclical monetary policy into practice in most advanced industrialized countries since the middle of the 1950s In some such as the United States the emphasis has been as suggested above on changes in the interest rate and in the supply of money and credit in others such as France Italy and Japan the emphasis has been on the rationing of credit by the central bank Fiscal policy has found less use than monetary policy in efforts to control cyclical fluctuations in the economy It has been most favoured in Britain the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands There are specific situations in which fiscal measures have been used to stimulate the economy in other countries as in Belgium and West Germany during the recessions of 1958 and 1962 Another example is the postponement of certain military expenditures in the United States as an anti inflationary measure during the boom of the mid 1950s and most notably the tax cuts passed by Congress in 1964 and 1981 as a stimulus to economic expansion Several countries have taken restrictive fiscal actions to overcome balance of payments crises including France and Finland on various occasions During the later 20th century there was an increasing tendency to employ fiscal policies in the short run partly in order to assist monetary policy in solving cyclical problems Our editors will review what you ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence including data as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past eventsThis is the weekend roundup of The WorldPost of which Nathan Gardels is the editor in chief Having slowly recovered from the great recession a decade ago the global economy is finally back on the growth track including in the United States as the American president characteristically trumpeted in his State of the Union speech this week The coming peril resides in the promise of this good news As unemployment falls and puts pressure on wages to rise in the age of digital capitalism automation of labor by intelligent machines will accelerate That in turn will reinforce a trend already underway the divorce of employment from productivity and wealth creation Inequality then deepens as wealth concentrates among those who own the robots so to speak while those who have only their labor to sell increasingly scramble to cobble together a living wage through precarious gigs Nobel economist Michael Spence and Laura Tyson report that 80 percent of job losses in American manufacturing over the past three decades have been due to technological displacement New jobs have also been created but mostly in low wage services with greatly diminished income Recent studies project that the trend will continue with as much as 40 percent of the U S workforce losing their jobs to technology by the early 2030s This presents a paradoxical challenge for governance in the digital age The more dynamic a perpetually innovating knowledge driven economy the more robust a redefined safety net and opportunity web must be to cope with the steady disruption and gaps in wealth and power that will result As the economic guru behind French President Emmanuel Macron s reforms argued in The WorldPost recently one answer is flexicurity a labor market that is more adaptable to the fluid shift of tasks in the workplace cushioned by a universal net that protects the welfare of workers instead of specific jobs In The WorldPost this week Jacob Hacker proposes the vital complement to flexicurity in tackling new levels of economic insecurity and inequality the opportunity web of what he calls predistribution He cites former World Bank economist Branko Milanovic s trenchant formulation of this idea The only promising avenue to reduce inequality is interventions that are undertaken before taxes and transfers kick in These include a reduction in the inequality of endowments especially inequality in education and the ownership of assets If market income inequality can be controlled and over time curbed government redistribution via transfers and taxes can also become much less important For Hacker predistribution is not some untested idealistic scheme but was in fact the foundation of broad American prosperity in the past Predistribution policies like public investments in infrastructure education research and development and the regulation of labor and financial markets built the American middle class writes the Yale professor And the collapse of such investment and regulations is the main reason that the middle class has experienced stagnant wages plummeting bargaining power and a declining share of national income since the late 1970s Hacker is critical of the American left for focusing on redistributing wealth after the rich are already rich instead of focusing on how to enhance the skills bargaining power and capital assets of the rest of society He notes with irony that as exemplified by the overhaul of the U S tax code just passed by the Republican dominated Congress the rich know how to help themselves The political right understands that American inequality is ultimately about predistribution rather than redistribution Why doesn t the left he asks Nicolas Berggruen takes Hacker s notion of predistribution a step further by floating the quite original idea of employing the latest digital technology blockchain to build up a sharing economy in which all have an equity stake The idea of the sharing economy he writes has so far come from companies like Airbnb Uber and Lyft and has been controlled by venture capital backed private corporations Here s where blockchain comes in it provides a technological mechanism for enabling sharing At its core the technology of blockchain is a mechanism for securely keeping track of information for example about ownership and transactions Rather than storing the information in a central location blockchain makes multiple copies and distributes them across all the nodes of a network Each transaction is propagated across the network at essentially zero cost and with total transparency This capacity Berggruen muses could enable a non state and non bureaucratic way to broadly extend ownership He offers this example Each new robot in an autonomous vehicle fleet could be fractionally owned by every member of the community in which it operates Every time someone purchased a ride with one of the vehicles rather than the income only going to a private company it could be distributed to everyone in the community through the blockchain technology In a nutshell what the Internet was to social media the core enabling technology blockchain is to the possibility of a true sharing economy For Berggruen this approach would address inequality at its root on the production side Instead of waiting for inequality to happen and then addressing it via a universal basic income we can instead pursue the idea of a universal right to intellectual and capital goods a universal basic capital Using blockchain to enable such a distributed democratic ownership structure he concludes could give everyone a stake in our roboticized future instead of deepening inequality and political conflict Drawing on their recent book Capitalism Without Capital Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake examine how the rise of the intangible economy built on skills and knowledge instead of tangible assets such as machinery and buildings has impacted productivity employment income inequality and financial access as well as widened the chasm between traditional and digital companies and between cities and rural areas In our increasingly intangible intensive economy they write spillovers are a force for equality potentially everyone can copy a design or a business idea But if intangibles are valuable in synergy with each other and can then be scaled this is a force for inequality because of the disruption and displacement caused in the tangible economy and its host communities Think Uber replacing licensed taxis Their concern is that the policy response to this inequality is to double down on conventional notions of infrastructure investment and regulation to bolster the tangible economy thus consolidating the divide between the old and new instead of adapting and updating policies to unleash the potential of intangible capital If the synergies of the intangible economy that Haskel and Westlake identify as causes of inequality can be married to Berggruen s idea of shared ownership of those synergies we may well have stumbled onto the rudiments of a new social contract for the digital age that spreads wealth more equally This was produced by The WorldPost a partnership of the

Economic GrowthSustained long term economic growth comes from increases in worker productivity which essentially means how well we do things In other words how efficient is your nation with its time and workers Labor productivity is the value that each employed person creates per unit of his or her input The easiest way to comprehend labor productivity is to imagine a Canadian worker who can make 10 loaves of bread in an hour versus a U S worker who in the same hour can make only two loaves of bread In this fictional example the Canadians are more productive Being more productive essentially means you can do more in the same amount of time This in turn frees up resources to be used elsewhere What determines how productive workers are The answer is pretty intuitive The first determinant of labor productivity is human capital Human capital is the accumulated knowledge from education and experience skills and expertise that the average worker in an economy possesses Typically the higher the average level of education in an economy the higher the accumulated human capital and the higher the labor productivity The second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change Technological change is a combination of invention advances in knowledge and innovation which is putting that advance to use in a new product or service For example the transistor was invented in 1947 It allowed us to miniaturize the footprint of electronic devices and use less power than the tube technology that came before it Innovations since then have produced smaller and better transistors that that are ubiquitous in products as varied as smart phones computers and escalators The development of the transistor has allowed workers to be anywhere with smaller devices These devices can be used to communicate with other workers measure product quality or do any other task in less time improving worker productivity The third factor that determines labor productivity is economies of scale Recall that economies of scale are the cost advantages that industries obtain due to size Read more about economies of scale in Cost and Industry Structure Consider again the case of the fictional Canadian worker who could produce 10 loaves of bread in an hour If this difference in productivity was due only to economies of scale it could be that Canadian workers had access to a large industrial size oven while the U S worker was using a standard residential size oven Now that we have explored the determinants of worker productivity let s turn to how economists measure economic growth and productivity To analyze the sources of economic growth it is useful to think about a production function which is the process of turning economic inputs like labor machinery and raw materials into outputs like goods and services used by consumers A microeconomic production function describes the inputs and outputs of a firm or perhaps an industry In macroeconomics the connection from inputs to outputs for the entire economy is called an aggregate production function Economists construct different production functions depending on the focus of their studies Figure 1 presents two examples of aggregate production functions In the first production function shown in Figure 1 a the output is GDP The inputs in this example are workforce human capital physical capital and technology We discuss these inputs further in the module Components of Economic Growth An economy s rate of productivity growth is closely linked to the growth rate of its GDP per capita although the two are not identical For example if the percentage of the population who holds jobs in an economy increases GDP per capita will increase but the productivity of individual workers may not be affected Over the long term the only way that GDP per capita can grow continually is if the productivity of the average worker rises or if there are complementary increases in capital A common measure of U S productivity per worker is dollar value per hour the worker contributes to the employer s output This measure excludes government workers because their output is not sold in the market and so their productivity is hard to measure It also excludes farming which accounts for only a relatively small share of the U S economy Figure 2 shows an index of output per hour with 2009 as the base year when the index equals 100 The index equaled about 106 in 2014 In 1972 the index equaled 50 which shows that workers have more than doubled their productivity since then According to the Department of Labor U S productivity growth was fairly strong in the 1950s but then declined in the 1970s and 1980s before rising again in the second half of the 1990s and the first half of the 2000s In fact the rate of productivity measured by the change in output per hour worked averaged 3 2 per year from 1950 to 1970 dropped to 1 9 per year from 1970 to 1990 and then climbed back to over 2 3 from 1991 to the present with another modest slowdown after 2001 Figure 3 shows average annual rates of productivity growth averaged over time since 1950 In recent years a controversy has been brewing among economists about the resurgence of U S productivity in the second half of the 1990s One school of thought argues that the United States had developed a new economy based on the extraordinary advances in communications and information technology of the 1990s The most optimistic proponents argue that it would generate higher average productivity growth for decades to come The pessimists on the other hand argue that even five or ten years of stronger productivity growth does not prove that higher productivity will last for the long term It is hard to infer anything about long term productivity trends during the later part of the 2000s because the steep recession of 2008 2009 with its sharp but not completely synchronized declines in output and employment complicates any interpretation While productivity growth was high in 2009 and 2010 around 3 it has slowed down since then Productivity growth is also closely linked to the average level of wages Over time the amount that firms are willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce If a few employers tried to pay their workers less than what those workers produced then those workers would receive offers of higher wages from other profit seeking employers If a few employers mistakenly paid their workers more than what those workers produced those employers would soon end up with losses In the long run productivity per hour is the most important determinant of the average wage level in any economy To learn how to compare economies in this regard follow the steps in the following Work It Out feature The Organization for Economic Co operation and Development OECD tracks data on the annual growth rate of real GDP per hour worked You can find these data on the OECD data webpage Labour productivity growth in the total economy at this website Step 1 Visit the OECD website given above and select two countries to compare Step 2 On the drop down menu Variable select Real GDP Annual Growth in percent and record the data for the countries you have chosen for the five most recent years Step 3 Go back to the drop down menu and select Real GDP per Hour Worked Annual Growth Rate in percent and select data for the same years for which you selected GDP data Step 4 Compare real GDP growth for both countries Table 2 provides an example of a comparison between Australia and Belgium Step 5 Consider the many factors can affect growth For example one factor that may have affected Australia is its isolation from Europe which may have insulated the country from the effects of the global recession In Belgium s case the global recession seems to have had an impact on both GDP and real GDP per hours worked between 2009 and 2013 though productivity does seem to be recovering Nothing is more important for people s standard of living than sustained economic growth Even small changes in the rate of growth when sustained and compounded over long periods of time make an enormous difference in the standard of living Consider Table 3 in which the rows of the table show several different rates of growth in GDP per capita and the columns show different periods of time Assume for simplicity that an economy starts with a GDP per capita of 100 The table then applies the following formula to calculate what GDP will be at the given growth rate in the future For example an economy that starts with a GDP of 100 and grows at 3 per year will reach a GDP of 209 after 25 years that is 100 1 03 25 209 The slowest rate of GDP per capita growth in the table just 1 per year is similar to what the United States experienced during its weakest years of productivity growth The second highest rate 3 per year is close to what the U S economy experienced during the strong economy of the late 1990s and into the 2000s Higher rates of per capita growth such as 5 or 8 per year represent the experience of rapid growth in economies like Japan Korea and China Table 3 shows that even a few percentage points of difference in economic growth rates will have a profound effect if sustained and compounded over time For example an economy growing at a 1 annual rate over 50 years will see its GDP per capita rise by a total of 64 from 100 to 164 in this example However a country growing at a 5 annual rate will see almost the same amount of growth from 100 to 163 over just 10 years Rapid rates of economic growth can bring profound transformation See the following Clear It Up feature on the relationship between compound growth rates and compound interest rates If the rate of growth is 8 young adults starting at age 20 will see the average standard of living in their country more than double by the time they reach age 30 and grow nearly sevenfold by the time they reach age 45 The formula for growth rates of GDP over different periods of time as shown in Figure 2 is exactly the same as the formula for how a given amount of financial savings grows at a certain interest rate over time as presented in Choice in a World of Scarcity Both formulas have the same ingredients Recall that compound interest is interest that is earned on past interest It causes the total amount of financial savings to grow dramatically over time Similarly compound rates of economic growth or the compound growth rate means that the rate of growth is being multiplied by a base that includes past GDP growth with dramatic effects over time For example in 2013 the World Fact Book produced by the Central Intelligence Agency reported that South Korea had a GDP of 1 67 trillion with a growth rate of 2 8 We can estimate that at that growth rate South Korea s GDP will be 1 92 trillion in five years If we apply the growth rate to each year s ending GDP for the next five years we will calculate that at the end of year one GDP is 1 72 trillion In year two we start with the end of year one value of 1 67 and increase it by 2 Year three starts with the end of year two GDP and we increase it by 2 and so on as depicted in the Table 4 Another way to calculate the growth rate is to apply the following formula Where future value is the value of GDP five years hence present value is the starting GDP amount of 1 64 trillion g is the growth rate of 2 and n is the number of periods for which we are calculating growth Productivity the value of what is produced per worker or per hour worked can be measured as the level of GDP per worker or GDP per hour The United States experienced a productivity slowdown between 1973 and 1989 Since then U S productivity has rebounded the current global recession notwithstanding It is not clear whether the current growth in productivity will be sustained The rate of productivity growth is the primary determinant of an economy s rate of long term economic growth and higher wages Over decades and generations seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita An aggregate production function specifies how certain inputs in the economy like human capital physical capital and technology lead to the output measured as GDP per capita Compound interest and compound growth rates behave in the same way as productivity rates Seemingly small changes in percentage points can have big impacts on income over time Answers to Self Check Questions20 2 Labor

automatic boon for an economy s growth A body of empirical evidence shows that in practice government outlays designed to stimulate the economy may fall short of that goal In response to the financial crisis and its impact on the economy the federal government has increased government spending markedly in order to stimulate economic growth With billions of taxpayer dollars appropriated toward this effort policy makers should examine whether federal spending actually promotes economic growth Although the studies are not all consistent historical evidence suggests an undesirable long run effect from government spending it crowds out private sector spending and uses money in unproductive ways Policy makers should use the best literature available to analyze government spending designed to spur growth for the likelihood of achieving that effect Where the assumptions or data are uncertain the analysis should fully explore the potential consequences of different assumptions or different potential values for the uncertain data Proponents of government spending claim that it provides public goods that markets generally do not such as military defense enforcement of contracts and police services 1 Standard economic theory holds that individuals have little incentive to provide these types of goods because others tend to use them without paying John Maynard Keynes one of the most significant economists of the 20th century advocated government spending even if government has to run a deficit to conduct such spending 2 He hypothesized that when the economy is in a downturn and unemployment of labor and capital is high governments can spend money to create jobs and employ capital that have been unemployed or underutilized Keynes s theory has been one of the implicit rationales for the current federal stimulus spending it is needed to boost economic output and promote growth 3These views of spending assume that government knows exactly which goods and services are underutilized which public goods will be value added and where to redirect resources However there is no information source that allows the government to know where goods and services can be most productively employed 4 Federal spending is less likely to stimulate growth when it cannot accurately target the projects where it would be most productive In addition to this information problem the political process itself can stunt economic growth For example Professor Emeritus of Law at George Mason University Gordon Tullock suggests that politicians and bureaucrats try to gain control of as much of the economy as possible 5 Moreover demand for government resources by the private sector leads to misallocation of resources through rent seeking the process by which industries and individuals lobby the government for money Rather than spend money where it is most needed legislators instead allocate money to favored groups 6 Though this may yield a high political return for incumbents seeking reelection this process does not favor economic growth The data support the theory A 1974 paper by Stanford s Gavin Wright found that political attempts to maximize votes explained between 59 and 80 percent of the difference in per capita federal spending to the states during the Great Depression 7 Ultimately spending under the Democratic Congress and the president was much more concentrated in Western states where elections were much tighter than in the Democratically controlled South Wright s analysis indicates that instead of allocating spending based purely on economic need during a crisis the party in power may distribute funding based on the prospect of political returns Proponents of government spending often point to the fiscal multiplier as a way that spending can fuel growth The multiplier is a factor by which some measure of economy wide output such as GDP increases in response to a given amount of government spending According to the multiplier theory an initial burst of government spending trickles through the economy and is re spent over and over again thus growing the economy A multiplier of 1 0 implies that if government created a project that hired 100 people it would put exactly 100 100 x 1 0 people into the workforce A multiplier larger than 1 implies more employment and a number smaller than 1 implies a net job loss In its 2009 assessment of the job effects of the stimulus plan the incoming Obama administration used a multiplier estimate of approximately 1 5 for government spending for most quarters This would mean that for every dollar of government stimulus spending GDP would increase by one and a half dollars 8 In practice however unproductive government spending is likely to have a smaller multiplier effect In a September 2009 National Bureau of Economic Research NBER paper Harvard economists Robert Barro and Charles Redlick estimated that the multiplier from government defense spending reaches 1 0 at high levels of unemployment but is less than 1 0 at lower unemployment rates Non defense spending may have an even smaller multiplier effect 9Another recent study corroborates this finding NBER economist Valerie A Ramey estimates a spending multiplier range from 0 6 to 1 1 10 Barro and Ramey s multiplier figures far lower than the Obama administration estimates indicate that government spending may actually decrease economic growth possibly due to inefficient use of money Taxes finance government spending therefore an increase in government spending increases the tax burden on citizens either now or in the future which leads to a reduction in private spending and investment This effect is known as crowding out In addition to crowding out private spending government outlays may also crowd out interest sensitive investment 11 Government spending reduces savings in the economy thus increasing interest rates This can lead to less investment in areas such as home building and productive capacity which includes the facilities and infrastructure used to contribute to the economy s output An NBER paper that analyzes a panel of OECD countries found that government spending also has a strong negative correlation with business investment 12 Conversely when governments cut spending there is a surge in private investment Robert Barro discusses some of the major papers on this topic that find a negative correlation between government spending and GDP growth 13 Additionally in a study of 76 countries the University of Vienna s Dennis C Mueller and George Mason University s Thomas Stratmann found a statistically significant negative correlation between government size and economic growth 14Though a large portion of the literature finds no positive correlation between government spending and economic growth some empirical studies have For example a 1993 paper by economists William Easterly and Sergio Rebelo looked at empirical data from approximately 100 countries from 1970 1988 and found a positive correlation between general government investment and GDP growth 15This lack of consensus in the empirical findings indicates the inherent difficulties with measuring such correlations in a complex economy However despite the lack of empirical consensus the theoretical literature indicates that government spending is unlikely to be as productive for economic growth as simply leaving the money in the private sector In 2009 Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act which authorized 787 billion in spending to promote job growth and bolster economic activity 16 The budgetary consequences of this legislation and other government spending initiatives aimed at improving the economic outlook for the federal budget can readily be seen in recent federal outlays As seen in figure 1 total federal outlays have risen steadily over time and a sharp increase occurred after 2007 As seen in figure 2 total federal spending as a percentage of GDP has risen sharply in the last two years to nearly 30 percent As explained above this spending may have countervailing effects that could actually hamper economic growth by crowding out private investment Government spending even in a time of crisis is not an automatic boon for an economy s growth A body of empirical evidence shows that in practice government outlays designed to stimulate the economy may fall short of that goal Such findings have serious consequences as the United States embarks on a massive government spending initiative Before it approves any additional spending to boost growth the government should use the best peer reviewed literature to estimate whether such spending is likely to stimulate growth and report how much uncertainty surrounds those estimates These analyses should be made available to the public for comment prior to enacting this kind of legislation 1 Richard E Wagner Fiscal Sociology and the Theory of Public Finance An Explanatory Essay Cheltenham

Tax rate cuts may encourage individuals to work save and invest but if the tax cuts are not financed by immediate spending cuts they will likely also result in an increased federal budget deficit which in the long term will reduce national saving and raise interest rates The net impact on growth is uncertain but many estimates suggest it is either small or negative Base broadening measures can eliminate the effect of tax rate cuts on budget deficits but at the same time they reduce the impact on labor supply saving and investment and thus reduce the direct impact on growth They may also reallocate resources across sectors toward their highest value economic use resulting in increased efficiency and potentially raising the overall size of the economy Results in the literature suggest that not all tax changes will have the same impact on growth Reforms that improve incentives reduce existing distortionary subsidies avoid windfall gains and avoid deficit financing will have more auspicious effects on the long term size of the economy but may also create trade offs between equity and efficiency Policy makers and researchers have long been interested in how potential changes to the personal income tax system affect the size of the overall economy In 2014 for example Representative Dave Camp R MI proposed a sweeping reform to the income tax system that would reduce rates greatly pare back subsidies in the tax code and maintain revenue levels and the distribution of tax burdens across income classes Committee on Ways and Means 2014 In this paper we focus on how tax changes affect economic growth We focus on two types of tax changes reductions in individual income tax rates and income tax reform We define the latter as changes that broaden the income tax base and reduce statutory income tax rates but nonetheless maintain the overall revenue levels and the distribution of tax burdens implied by the current income system Our focus is on individual income tax reform leaving consideration of reforms to the corporate income tax for which see Toder and Viard 2014 and reforms that focus on consumption taxes for other analyses By economic growth we mean expansion of the supply side of the economy and of potential Gross Domestic Product GDP This expansion could be an increase in the annual growth rate a one time increase in the size of the economy that does not affect the future growth rate but puts the economy on a higher growth path or both Our focus on the supply side of the economy in the long run is in contrast to the short term phenomenon also called economic growth by which a boost in aggregate demand in a slack economy can raise GDP and help align actual GDP with potential GDP The importance of the topics addressed here derive from the income tax s central role in revenue generation its impact on the distribution of after tax income and its effects on a wide variety of economic activities The importance is only heightened by concerns about the long term economic growth rate Gordon 2016 Summers 2014 and concerns about the long term fiscal status of the federal government Auerbach and Gale 2016 We find that while there is no doubt that tax policy can influence economic choices it is by no means obvious on an ex ante basis that tax rate cuts will ultimately lead to a larger economy in the long run While rate cuts would raise the after tax return to working saving and investing they would also raise the after tax income people receive from their current level of activities which lessens their need to work save and invest The first effect normally raises economic activity through so called substitution effects while the second effect normally reduces it through so called income effects Related T On The Record

Jobs Act A preliminary analysis William G Gale Hilary Gelfond Aaron Krupkin Mark Mazur and Eric Toder Thursday June 14 2018The financing of tax cuts significantly affects its impact on long term growth Tax cuts financed by immediate cuts in unproductive government spending could raise output but tax cuts financed by reductions in government investment could reduce output If they are not financed by spending cuts tax cuts will lead to an increase in federal borrowing which in turn will reduce long term growth The historical evidence and simulation analyses suggest that tax cuts that are financed by debt for an extended period of time will have little positive impact on long term growth and could reduce growth Tax reform is more complex as it involves tax rate cuts as well as base broadening changes There is a theoretical presumption that such changes should raise the overall size of the economy in the long term though the effect and magnitude of the impact are subject to considerable uncertainty One fact that often escapes unnoticed is that broadening the tax base by reducing or eliminating tax expenditures raises the effective tax rate that people and firms face and hence will operate in that regard in a direction opposite to rate cuts and mitigate their effects on economic growth But base broadening has the additional benefit of reallocating resources from sectors that are currently tax preferred to sectors that have the highest economic pre tax return which should increase the overall size of the economy A fair assessment would conclude that well designed tax policies have the potential to raise economic growth but there are many stumbling blocks along the way and certainly no guarantee that all tax changes will improve economic performance Given the various channels through which tax policy affects growth a tax change will be more growth inducing to the extent that it involves i large positive incentive substitution effects that encourage work saving and investment ii small or negative income effects including a careful targeting of tax cuts toward new economic activity rather than providing windfall gains for previous activities iii reductions in distortions across economic sectors and across different types of income and consumption and iv minimal increases in or reductions in the budget deficit Related Books

Huang Peter J Morgan and Naoyuki Yoshino 2019 Ageing and Employment Policies By Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD 2019The remainder of the paper is organized as follows Section II provides a conceptual framework by discussing the channels through which tax changes can affect economic performance including the many ways in which a positive substitution effect in response to a tax rate cut might be dissipated or even reversed by other factors Section III provides an empirical starting point We show that growth rates over long periods of time in the United States have not changed in tandem with the massive changes in the structure and revenue yield of the tax system that have occurred We also report findings from Piketty Saez and Stantcheva 2014 that across advanced countries even large changes in the top marginal income tax rate over time do not appear to be strongly correlated with rates of growth Section IV explores empirical evidence on taxes and growth from studies of major income tax changes in the United States Consistent with the discussion in Section III the studies find little evidence that tax cuts or tax reform since 1980 have impacted the long term growth rate significantly Section V examines the new narrative approach to identifying tax changes that are exogenous to current economic conditions stemming from the seminal work of Romer and Romer 2010 The literature which generally uses vector autoregression VAR models finds that tax cuts that meet the exogeneity criteria raise short term output and other economic activity The narrative literature does not speak to the long term effects though Section VI discusses the results from the literature on simulation models which has generated two main results First debt financed tax cuts will tend to boost short term growth as in standard Keynesian models and in the literature using the narrative approach but also tend to reduce long term growth if they are financed eventually by higher taxes Second revenue neutral income tax reform can provide a modest boost to economic growth Section VII concludes 1Authors William G Gale The Arjay and Frances Fearing

paper on the impacts of technology on employment U S manufacturing has seen tough times over the past few decades Employment in that sector has dropped from around 14 percent of the U S workforce in 1996 to almost 8 percent now Many jobs have shifted overseas as employers seek low cost labor and nations with fewer safety and environmental regulations But in recent years the outlook has turned more bullish There has been a resurgence in American manufacturing After reaching a low point of 11 5 million jobs in 2010 manufacturing employment increased to around 12 3 million in 2016 That still is down from 14 5 million in 2006 but better than the depths of the Great Recession Indeed a recent New York Times article found that manufacturing output has achieved a record high in the most recent quarter Workers now are producing 47 percent more than 20 years ago Through the development of automation robotics and advanced manufacturing the sector has bounced back along with the overall economy Technology is one of the reasons for this resurgence We are seeing the rise of automation and robotics in many sectors Some restaurants now are using robots to deliver food and are deploying self ordering kiosks for customers There are driverless cars in California Washington and Texas Amazon now has around 15 000 robots who work along its 50 000 humans The number of industrial robots is rising In 2013 there were 1 2 million robots in factories and warehouses The total rose to 1 5 million in 2014 and is expected to increase to 1 9 million next year Japan leads the way in use of industrial robots with over 306 000 robots in use compared to 237 000 in North America 182 000 in China and 175 000 in South Korea and Germany each Robots are getting more sophisticated and adept at performing complex tasks The cost differential with humans is narrowing to the advantage of robots The Wendy s restaurant chain recently announced that it was introducing self service kiosks for ordering in its 6 000 restaurants Estimates for labor cost savings in various countries through automation and robotics now are averaging around 16 percent in industrialized nations But places such as South Korea have seen 33 percent cost savings and Japan has seen a 25 percent savings The convergence of these developments means that robots are helping to increase overall output and save money but not helping to add jobs In looking at data from 2010 to 2016 manufacturing has seen 10 to 20 percent increases in output but only a 2 to 5 percent increase in jobs Related Books Going Mobile By

overarching theme emerges economic and societal changes occasioned by technological developments are shaped not just by the availability of new technologies and their features but also by ideologies power structures and human aspirations and agendas Technologies are not exogenous forces that roll over societies like tsunamis with predetermined results Rather our skills organizations institutions and values shape how we develop technologies and how we deploy them once created along with their final impact 1 1 For the impact of available skills and markets on the direction of technological

this chapter the committee considers the current state of 1 productivity growth 2 employment and 3 income distribution In each case the role of technology is considered recent changes are summarized and some potential future developments are considered building on the discussion in Chapter 2 of current and possible future trends in underlying technologies The committee is keenly aware that making forecasts about social phenomena is perilous Doing so with respect to the fast changing and dynamic area of technology is even more challenging Nevertheless interpreting societal and economic responses to developments in technology can at least provide a framework for thinking about the future In his seminal research on economic growth Robert Solow found that most of the increases in human living standards have come not from working more hours and not from using more capital or other resources but from improved productivity that is increases in the efficiency of production as defined by the ratio of output to input In turn productivity growth comes from new technologies and new techniques of production and distribution 2 In the mid 1990s the rate of productivity growth increased significantly in the United States led by the IT producing sectors as well as IT using sectors a change attributed in part to improvements in the nature and use of IT 3 However in the past 10 years U S aggregate productivity growth has slowed according to official statistics from U S government agencies The slowdown preceded the 2008 Great Recession suggesting that the recession is not the only

and has been largely accounted for by slowdowns in the IT producing and IT using sectors 4In some ways this slowdown in productivity growth is counter to the narrative of increasing advances and adoption of IT The remainder of this section discusses open issues and questions as well as possible pathways for resolving them One hypothesis is that there is an increasing measurement problem in the official statistics on productivity This has been a longstanding research challenge recognized at least since Solow5 and Griliches 6 Griliches noted that the economy has been shifting increasingly to sectors where output and output quality are difficult to measure such as government health and finance Unlike counting bushels of wheat or tons of steel outputs for medical treatment or bank loans are less standardized 7 Measurement is also very challenging in sectors with rapid technological changes such as the computer and software industries themselves Output and productivity measurement require measuring output and input price deflators that reflect changes in quality which is an enormous challenge How does one compare a smartphone today with a mainframe from 20 years ago let alone new apps that have no predecessors Great progress was made in the 1990s and 2000s on improving price deflators for the hardware parts of IT 8 but the software side has been more challenging Recent evidence suggests that adoption of cloud computing and other changes are even making it more difficult to assess quality changes for hardware 9A related but more fundamental issue is that productivity is neither a measure of technological progress nor welfare Productivity is based on gross domestic product GDP which is in turn a measure of production or output However technological progress can increase welfare without increasing output For instance if Wikipedia replaces a paper encyclopedia or a free GPS mapping app replaces a stand alone GPS device then consumers can be better off even if output is stagnant or declining 10 4 J G Fernald 2014 Productivity and potential output before during and after the Great Recession NBER Macroeconomics Annual 2014 Volume 29 doi 10 3386 w20248 5 R M

economic well being but not in GDP and in turn not in official productivity statistics While these measurement issues remain an active area of study the most recent research suggests that at most only a small fraction of the productivity slowdown can be attributed to measurement problems 11Another hypothesis is that the reported slowdown in productivity growth in the IT producing and IT using sectors is temporary Brynjolfsson and Hitt found evidence that the productivity benefits of large enterprise systems took up to 7 years to be fully realized as significant organizational and process changes were typically required to make full use of accompanying software and hardware investments 12 The diffusion and adoption of technologies is time and resource intensive and requires much experimentation with failures and variable time lags along the way Building on work by Paul David Syverson discussed the slowdown in productivity growth in the historical context of electrification of the production process at the end of the 19th century 13 He argues that the impact of electrification on productivity came in two distinct waves The first wave arrived quickly and reflected the adoption of electrification within the existing organization of production The second wave delayed by a few decades reflected new ways of organizing production around this new technology Achieving the full productivity benefits and impacts of new technology can take decades and may require complementary co inventions of new business practices infrastructure and so on which can dramatically influence the size and distribution of gains from technology and the nature of its societal effects Similarly while the first power looms allowed weavers to produce 2 5 times as much cloth per hour further improvements in the following 80 years in knowledge and skills increased output per hour 80 fold 14 For IT the value of intan Attention Economy Measuring the Value of Free Digital Services on

business processes and human capital can have a value 10 times greater than the direct costs of computer hardware but they also are costly and time consuming to invent and implement 15In a related manner there is evidence that adopting new technologies requires organizational changes and restructuring of business practices that take time 16 For instance it is easy to imagine significant benefits eventually from the widespread digitization of patient data yet many physicians complain that the adoption process for electronic medical records is slow and cumbersome with current costs exceeding current benefits This perspective may help reconcile the observation of the apparently rapid changes in technology outlined in Chapter 2 with the current sluggish growth in productivity Yet there are more pessimistic views about the prospects for productivity and economic growth Some have suggested that recent post 2000 innovations in information and other advanced technology simply do not have the same high payoff as innovations in earlier periods The argument is that earlier innovations were in the form of general purpose technologies that had wide application to many industries 17 Alternatively some have argued that we are in a period of secular stagnation due to weak aggregate demand 18 The suggestion is that persistently weak aggregate demand is acting as an overall drag on economic growth Firm level evidence for the United States and the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development shows a widening gap between the most and least productive firms within industries in the post 2000 period 19 Such widening productivity dispersion may reflect increased 15 E Brynjolfsson and L M Hitt 2000 Beyond computation Information technology organizational

dampened competition slowing down the diffusion process or the pace of business dynamism that is critical for moving resources to the more productive firms The latter has been shown to be an important part of the process of productivity growth and is discussed further in Chapter 4 From this perspective the hypothesis is that while the changes in technology outlined in Chapter 2 are indeed occurring they are slow to show up in economic growth due to slowing diffusion or business dynamism All of these hypotheses are active areas of research The discussion of future research directions in Chapter 6 emphasizes the significance of exploring such critically important questions It is useful to note that future productivity growth cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating past trends because there is little serial correlation in growth rates from one decade to the next Instead future trends will depend on the invention and deployment of new and improved technologies and on the co inventions by the workforce organizations and institutions needed to effectively use them In the past few years U S employment growth has been fairly robust with accompanying drops in unemployment For instance by early 2016 the unemployment rate fell below 5 percent However much of this employment growth can be interpreted as a recovery from the Great Recession which has been slow despite the fact that it officially ended in 2009 Furthermore jobs lost in the recession are very different from those that appeared during the recovery 20 While many opportunities continue to be created in fields that do not require a bachelor s degree the fastest growing occupational categories all require a bachelor s degree or better and occupations that require a bachelor s degree are growing at twice the rate of those that do not 21 22There have also been substantial shifts in employment in various occupational categories For instance the employment rate in clerical and 20 A P Carnevale T Jayasundera and A

the overall U S employment rate the employment to population ratio remains near a 20 year low The overall U S employment rate exhibited an upward trend through 2000 mostly driven by an increased participation of women in the workforce It began to decline in the post 2000 period with a sharp drop during the 2008 Great Recession from which it has recovered slightly Some of this trend can be accounted for by the aging of the population However declines in the employment rate are especially large for young and less educated individuals Employment rates of prime age 25 54 year old males are still low 84 percent in 2014 near the 50 year low of 81 percent in 2010 as compared to a high of 95 percent in 1967 according to the 23 P Restrepo 2015 Skill Mismatch and Structural Unemployment Massachusetts Institute of Technology http pascual scripts mit edu research 01 PR jmp pdf annual averages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics 24 This highlights that the overall decline cannot be accounted for simply by the aging of the U S population 25 26 While both globalization and technology are seen as important factors many economists view automation as the single most important factor For instance Larry Katz an expert on labor studies and editor of the Quarterly Journal of Economics has said Over the long haul clearly automation s been much more important it s not even close 27Among young and less educated workers the declines have also been especially sharp for certain race ethnicity groups especially non Hispanic blacks In addition almost a third of all the unemployed in 2014 were classified as long term unemployed i e out of the job market for more than 27 weeks and many eventually become discouraged workers people that drop out of the market for employment entirely 28 Such patterns are of particular concern in the context of this report since it is these most vulnerable groups that may be left behind by ongoing changes in technology Predictions that new technologies will make workers largely or almost entirely redundant are as old as technological change itself Although the story might be apocryphal the famous Roman historian Pliny the Elder recounts how the Roman Emperor Tiberius killed an inventor who had supposedly invented unbreakable glass for fear of what this would do to the glassmaking trade Queen Elizabeth I similarly refused to grant William Lee a patent for his mechanical knitting machine arguing Consider thou what the invention could do to my poor subjects 29It is not only emperors and queens who have feared the implications of

Robinson 2011 Why Nations Fail Crown New York in the early 19th century known as Luddites fearing that the new automation coming with power looms stocking frames and spinning frames were threatening to replace their expert positions with low wage laborers destroyed machines and burned the house of John Kay the inventor of the flying shuttle In an attempt to halt destructive acts the British Parliament enacted a law making machine breaking a capital offense 30More recently the economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that the introduction of new technologies would create considerable wealth but would also generate widespread technological unemployment as machines replaced humans In 1930 he predicted that the work week would fall to 15 hours and that the economic problem of providing for basic needs would be solved 31 Economic historian Robert Heilbroner similarly predicted in 1965 As machines continue to invade society duplicating greater and greater numbers of social tasks it is human labor itself at least as we now think of labor that is gradually rendered redundant 32 Nobel Prize winner Wassily Leontief saw an analogy between human labor and horses of the early 20th century and in 1952 predicted that humans will follow horses in becoming redundant Labor will become less and less important More and more workers will be replaced by machines I do not see that new industries can employ everybody who wants a job 33 34However predictions of widespread technologically induced unemployment have not come to pass at least so far 35 Technological changes over the last 200 years and presumably many of those that came before stimulated demand created new markets and fueled wage growth with few adverse consequences for aggregate employment To be sure technologies did and will continue to decimate particular occupations As the Luddites feared artisans lost their jobs in spinning and then weaving as new technologies automated tasks they had previously performed

Acemoglu and Restropo 2016 The Race Between Machine and Man 35 We do note however that the length of the workweek has dropped significantly since the 1800s when a workweek of longer than 70 hours was not uncommon For more discussion of this point see Economic History Association Hours of Work in U S History EH net https eh net encyclopedia hours of work in u s history and R J Gordon 2016 The Rise and Fall of American Growth The US Standard of Living Since the Civil War Princeton University Press Princeton N J Similarly the replacement of horses by automobiles eliminated the need for blacksmiths But as these jobs disappeared new ones sprang up to operate manage and service the new technologies For instance in the late 1800s the replacement of the stagecoach by the railroad went hand in hand with the creation of new work for managers engineers machinists repairmen and conductors Simultaneously there was a boom in a range of new service occupations from teaching to entertainment to sales 36Nonetheless simultaneous automation of a broader range of tasks could create unemployment or perhaps reduce aggregate levels of employment for an extended period of time As noted in the previous section over the past 20 years the share of people working the employment to population ratio has declined While there are many factors at work it is possible that technological substitution for certain types of labor is part of the explanation As compensation falls for tasks that can increasingly be done by machines some people may choose to work less or not at all finding other alternatives including increased leisure or family time applying for disability benefits or investing in education to become relatively more attractive Over the longer term there may be a continuation of the long term decline in the share of hours worked as society as a whole becomes wealthier and leisure becomes relatively more attractive What happens depends in part on whether new technologies automate and replace workers in existing tasks more rapidly than they create new demands for labor Which will be the case is difficult to answer because it is easier to see how new technologies coming down the line will automate existing tasks than it is to imagine tasks that do not yet exist and how new technologies may stimulate greater consumer demand Further the future of employment is not only a question of the availability or necessity of tasks to be performed but how they are organized compensated and more generally valued by society These are matters of business strategy social organization and political choices and not simply driven by technologies themselves Consider self driving cars In principle driving and delivery occupations could be automated with the use of such technologies over the next several decades Visions of a future with fully automated vehicles have captured many people s imagination However there are numerous social and cultural as well as technological roadblocks to such an outcome These include such factors as consumer trust the fact that there will be a long period of mixed use road use with both autonomous driving and manual driving cars sharing the roads and the infrastructure require 36 Acemoglu and Restrepo also provide evidence that there is a large contribution of new occupations to employment growth in the last three decades Acemoglu and Restrepo 2016 The Race Between Machine and Man ments needed to expand usage and performance of self driving cars It is possible that ongoing development of these technologies including infrastructure will create more jobs than are lost in the wake of self driving vehicles but it is likely that the skills required for such jobs will be quite different from those currently possessed by today s truckers and taxi drivers The new jobs are likely to rely more heavily on analytic cognitive and technical skills Indeed even in the near term as self driving technologies are being developed the occupation of trucking37 is likely to be transformed For example additional IT based capabilities for driver simulation training can help improve the skill sets of more drivers than would be possible otherwise In the longer term increased automation will reduce the need for additional drivers and ultimately reduce overall demand for truck drivers Platooning where a single lead vehicle driven by a driver is followed by a string of other self driving vehicles is already emerging as a viable technology for highway driving and can affect employment numbers As transportation costs drop due to partial automation it is possible that lower per unit costs will lead to increased demand e g for more delivery services resulting in a partially counteracting force in the opposite direction toward increased demand for drivers Self driving cars also offer a good illustration of the variable and mixed impact of technology on employment as well as the long and often uneven march of technology development which complicates the ability to make accurate long term projections In addition to eliminating some jobs while creating others technological developments can create new occupations without reducing employment in older occupations New medical imaging technologies are a case in point Prior to the development of computer controlled imaging modalities such as ultrasound computed tomography scanners and magnetic resonance imaging most technicians who worked in radiology departments operated standard X ray machines and fluoroscopes The jobs associated with these technologies were not significantly altered by the arrival of digital imaging Instead new technicians occupations arose the sonographer the computed tomography technologist and the MRI technologist as well as the technicians occupations who service such machines Thus in the case of medical imaging the overall number 37 Truck driving remains a significant source of employment and middle class jobs in the United States In fact according to a recent analysis by NPR in 2014 truck delivery and tractor drivers were the most common occupational category in 29 states see Q Bui 2015 Map The Most Common Job in Every State NPR http www npr org sections money 2015 02 05 382664837 map the most common job in every state See also T Reddy 2007 Fleets Eye Safety Gains to Cut Insurance Costs Transport Topics http www ttnews com articles printopt aspx storyid 17563 for figures on truck driver hiring and claims of inability to fill positions of occupations and hence people employed as technicians expanded Furthermore with the march of technology both in terms of advances in imaging and with developments at the intersection of imaging and other areas of biomedical engineering radiologists began to specialize in particular imaging modalities and in whole new radiology subdisciplines such as interventional radiology extending the range of opportunities for careers within radiology and increasing the need for radiologists 38Nonetheless technologies can also have an impact on how tasks are allocated and how job categories and tasks associated with particular organizational forms and structures are designed For instance they can shift the allocation of tasks across occupations such that some occupations contract as the work they once performed is shifted onto members of other occupations 39 An instructive example is the advent of word processing technologies and online databases in the context of a typical academic department in the university As recently as the 1980s administrative assistants answered phones interacted with students kept paper records of accounts filed documents and typed letters memos and manuscripts for faculty who often wrote first drafts by hand Today administrative assistants continue to answer phones and interact with students but few type documents for faculty Professors now use a computer to create and revise their own documents Some faculty also enter their own data on travel expenses and other activities directly into databases tasks previously performed by administrative assistants These and other changes removed certain tasks from administrative assistants and transferred them to faculty which can be viewed as an instance of disintermediation 40 Because of the increased efficiency of producing and storing documents and because faculty have assumed the task of producing documents universities now employ fewer administrative assistants and some of those who remain have acquired new skills and tasks such as the maintenance 38 S R Barley 1986 Technology as an occasion for structuring Evidence From observations of CT scanners and the social order of radiology

technologies Information Systems Research 5 1 87 106 of websites As noted in Chapter 2 jobs involving physical labor will be increasingly affected by advances in robotics although there is debate about the timeline 41The committee notes that the effects of technologies on employment can be shaped by interests and social dynamics beyond merely the technological dimension For example computer mediated communications especially those facilitated by the Web such as e mail computer teleconferencing and the ability to easily and almost instantaneously transfer documents of all kinds across space and hence time zones were initially thought of as simply more efficient ways to communicate But because these technologies did not require co location companies began using such technologies to both outsource and offshore a variety of tasks and even jobs ranging from clerical to engineering work There is nothing about computer mediated communication technologies that preordained such developments Instead they are the result of choices strategic or otherwise by decision makers in organizations about how the technologies would be deployed and what they would be used to achieve along with market forces encouraging the adoption of cost efficient processes Choices regarding the development of technologies can also be influenced by the same interests and social dynamics For example it has been suggested that the decision to develop technologies that automate rather than augment the human role in the machine tool industry was driven by the combined interests of the U S Air Force and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology servomechanisms laboratory 42Consideration of whether technology can replace human workers has prompted discussion about the subtle complexity of human skills A recent paper43 by economist David Autor invoked the philosopher Michael Polanyi We can know more than we can tell The skill of a driver cannot be replaced by a thorough schooling in the theory of the motorcar the knowledge I have of my own body differs altogether from 41 Bill Gates predicted in 2016 that for pure labor substitution for jobs that are largely physical and visual

20485 National Bureau of Economic Research Cambridge Mass the knowledge of its physiology 44 This phenomenon that tacit knowledge often is greater than explicit cognition is referred to as Polanyi s Paradox Currently computational systems are far from being able to use creativity intuition persuasion and imaginative problem solving or to coordinate and lead teams Autor and others have argued that many highly valued and important human capabilities may never be automated 45 As technology becomes more sophisticated and encapsulated managing human interfaces may become the dominant component of more and more jobs there is already evidence that social skills are in increasing demand and valued in the labor market 46 For instance while drivers for a ride sharing service do not need to be experts on the internal combustion engine or smartphone to do their jobs they do need reasonably good interpersonal skills to be successful in this era of online ratings Educational programs even those in vocational disciplines like business and engineering may need to add interpersonal and creative skills to their mix of hard analytical skills The resistance to automating multiple dimensions of human intellect and of the presence and leadership of people suggests that there will likely be enduring market value for traits and factors that are uniquely human as only humans will be able to perform certain types of work for the foreseeable future if not forever To what extent are these human attributes including creativity empathy interpersonal skills leadership mentoring and physical presence currently valued in the U S labor force and how will these uniquely human capabilities be valued in the U S labor force in the future A number of these uniquely human attributes include cognitive and noncognitive skills On the other hand recent improvements in machine learning have enabled significant technical advances in for example the field of self driving cars suggesting that even Polanyi s archetypal example of driving a motorcar is not immune to automation The rapidly growing attendance at research conferences on artificial intelligence AI like the annual Neural Information Processing Systems and Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence conferences demonstrates that an increasing number of researchers are attempting to address these challenges and most of them now focus on approaches that enable machines to learn how to do tasks from recognizing and labeling objects to understanding speech improving dexterity and mobility and mastering increasingly complex games and puzzles 44 M Polanyi and A Sen 2009 The Tacit Dimension University of Chicago Press Chicago Ill 45 D H Autor 2015 Why are there still so many jobs The history

3386 w21473 It is generally understood that by increasing productivity IT will tend to increase overall income although without a guarantee that these gains will be evenly distributed Furthermore while it is common to focus on average levels of income and income growth the distribution of those gains can also have an effect on well being This is true not only because absolute levels directly affect the quality of life of particular groups but also because broad perceptions of unfairness can have a negative psychological impact and inequality can contribute to sociopolitical tensions Since the mid 1970s the United States has experienced significant growth in inequality in both income and wealth This is the subject of a large amount of literature and has been documented in great detail by Acemoglu Autor Katz Piketty Saez and many others 47 One aspect of this is the growing dispersion between productivity growth and median worker compensation as most of the income growth went to the top of the income distribution Over the past several decades IT and automation have been a significant driver of this increase in inequality although there are also other forces at work Much popular attention has been focused on the rising share of income of the top 1 percent of each of these distributions While this increase has been substantial with the share of income accruing to the top 1 percent of households increasing from about 10 percent to over 20 percent between 1980 and 2012 there have also been increases in earnings inequality within the other 99 percent accounted for largely by the increasing skills premium associated with a 4 year college degree For example the absolute median earnings gap between those with a high school and a college degree approximately doubled from 1980 to 2012 as the real wages of college graduates rose and those of less educated workers fell through about 2000 48A related phenomenon is the falling share of GDP paid to labor relative to owners of capital illustrated in Figure 3 5 49 This trend affects not only income but also wealth to which an individual s income contributes 47 For reviews see for example D H Autor L F Katz and M S Kearney

103 doi 10 3386 w19136 over time It suggests that trends in income are increasingly favoring those who have already accrued wealth This decline in the labor share of GDP if sustained will affect the distribution of wealth as well as that of income expanding the share of total income flowing to wealth holders 50Many factors are likely at work in this landscape of inequality technological change social biases increased globalization and trade the decline in labor union density and power 51 declines in the real minimum wage changing norms regarding executive compensation growing economic deregulation changes in tax rates and growing oligopoly or in some cases simple monopoly52 are among the hypothesized causes of increased inequality of income and wealth over the past 40 years 53 However for the purposes of this study the committee focuses on the role of technology in income and wealth distributions As with employment the case that technological advances have contributed to wage inequality is strong For most of the 20th century real median incomes incomes of people at the 50th percentile grew at least as fast as overall real GDP per person suggesting that the benefits of improved technological progress were widely shared But since the late 1970s productivity and GDP per person have continued to grow while median incomes have stagnated illustrated in Figure 3 2 reflecting growing income inequality over a period of significant technological change There is a debate in the research literature and indeed among committee members about how much of the increase in inequality should be attributed to technology There are three prominent narratives implicating technological change as a force toward greater inequality over the last several decades First many new technologies have replaced labor intensive routine and physical tasks and expanded demand for labor in jobs that require social skills numeracy abstract thinking and flexibility 54 This shift is often said to be responsible for higher returns to a college education and the widening income gap between skilled and less 50 For this and other statistics on wealth inequality see E N Wolff 2012 The Asset Price Meltdown and the Wealth of the Middle Class New York University New York A B Atkinson T Piketty and E Saez 2011 Top incomes in the long run of history Journal of Economic Literature 49 1 3 71

automated the share of income going to capital relative to labor can increase which may also help to explain the falling share of labor in overall GDP as illustrated in Figure 3 5 both in the United States and abroad Third improvements in communication technologies have contributed to what has been termed the superstar phenomenon whereby the most successful performers in any occupation can now command a larger share of the global market This in part reflects their improved ability to sell to not only customers in local markets but also with greater ease to those in regional national and even global markets as improved communications technologies reduce the costs of reaching a broader audience 55 Geography and consumer ignorance have become less important as barriers to entry making

Review 71 5 845 858 1981 easier for sellers with a superior product to gain a dominant market share 56 This phenomenon is also sometimes said to explain the growing proportion of the national income garnered by the top 1 percent of the wage distribution 57Changes in IT also seem to be playing a role in the changing demand for skills and the earnings inequality for the other 99 percent Technology can be a complement for highly skilled workers as well as a substitute for low or medium skill workers This is often called the skill biased technological change hypothesis 58 59 60 When new technologies have different skill requirements than older ones they tend to favor the hiring of workers possessing these skills Unless supply changes sufficiently this will shift wages in favor of the more skilled group 61 In recent decades the impact of IT has been uneven across the skill distribution 62 Since the 1970s males with graduate or college education have seen their wages grow while those with a high school education or less have seen falling wages63 see Figure 3 3 It has been suggested that this divergence is exacerbated by an increasing reliance on technology in the workplace as the skills required to work with these technologies are more readily 56 E Brynjolfsson Y J Hu and M S Rahman Competing in the age of omnichannel retailing MIT Sloan Management Review 54 4 23 2013

perspective is different than the common claim that new technologies always create inequality In fact many new technologies of the 19th century automated previously skilled occupations and expanded unskilled assembly work which paid lower wages than the prior forms of work For instance the Luddites may have been misguided in their tactics of smashing mechanical spinning and weaving machines but they were right that the way these machines were used was bad news for them relatively highly paid textile workers were gradually replaced by machines and less well paid machine tenders In general if there is a mismatch between the skills of the workforce and the skill requirements of new technologies changes in the structure of pay will tend to follow 62 World Economic Forum Global Agenda Council

widen such that more than half of employers report that they have had difficulty finding qualified job applicants to fill certain jobs which they believe to be in part due to education gaps 65 66In the 1980s and 1990s these changes in technology along with complementary factors such as globalization deregulation and deunionization have likely contributed to the reduction in demand for middle level skills and this has been reflected in both the quantity of jobs and in wages for middle skill workers see Figure 3 4 In particular workers doing routine tasks such as production tasks in manufacturing or clerical tasks have seen their demand decline due to multiple factors including changing technology This is reflected in a decline in manufacturing employment even as output has grown to an all time high Globalization has further eroded the demand for such skills in advanced economies like the United States In contrast there have been expanding job opportunities in both high skill high wage occupations like professional technical and managerial occupations and low skill 64 R Valletta 2015 Higher Education Wages and Polarization Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco http www

may be helping to drive a decline in the labor force participation rate and a broader shift in the labor capital relationship as advanced technology is embodied in capital equipment that replaces many workers 69 70 This shift has happened not only in the United States but in many nations around the world Figure 3 5 illustrates the global decline of the labor share of income The reductions in real

provided health insurance 71 In addition to technological change the shift in the labor capital ratio likely reflects increased monopoly power and rents by firms in many industries and the growing share of residential housing in the capital stock 72 73Another factor that is important in this context is that advances in IT often involve significant supply side economies of scale the cost of making the first copy of a new enterprise system video game or mobile app is often significant but the cost of making an additional copy is very low Thus companies whose software has more users will tend to have lower average costs per user Likewise there are often demand side economies of scale as well which are more commonly called network effects Network effects occur when users get more benefits from a product or platform when it is adopted by more users 74 75 For instance the value of Facebook or LinkedIn is greater if other people especially friends family or colleagues also use the same application Similar logic holds for many business to business platforms and to some extent even productivity software like word processors spreadsheets and presentation software because they are compatible between users and enable file sharing and collaboration Economies of scale on the supply side the demand side or both tend to a greater prevalence of winner take all outcomes where the leading firm in a particular platform does exceptionally well Even if the gains are shared across all the workers within the winning firms this still leads to concentration of the gains to a relatively small share of workers 76That said gains have not been evenly distributed with the top employees in firms seeing the biggest gains on average 77 Founders and 71 J A Cobb 2015 Risky business

the biggest winners This is consistent with the rise of the innovator class which suggests that neither labor nor capital owners will necessarily benefit the most from technological advances Instead the rapid proliferation of digital technology may enable a third class people who can create and distribute new products services and business models to prosper immensely 78 In addition there is evidence that pay for top executives like CEOs has grown fastest in industries that use IT the most intensively which is consistent with them being able to gather more detailed information and relay their decisions more effectively across more people and assets This can amplify their power importance and relative pay 79While the gender wage gap has narrowed since the 1980s it is important to note that significant wage gaps by both race and gender persist in the United States According to a recent analysis by the Pew Research Center 80 2015 median hourly earnings for women were just 83 percent of white men s and black workers only 75 percent of white men s Much but not all of these gaps have been explained by varying education and experience or the fact that different groups participate at different rates in different industries and occupational fields Even when controlling for education white men out earned all groups except for Asian men white and Asian women out earned Hispanic and black men and women How these disparities will shift in the future as a result of technological change is an open question gender and occupational fields are discussed further in Chapter 4 An important variable for understanding and shaping future developments is the way education and vocational training institutions might ameliorate the mismatch between new technologies and existing skills The early 20th century was also a period of rapid technological change in the U S economy However existing evidence suggests that wage inequality declined during this era in part because the U

education is the best way to reduce inequality however More out of the box thinking may be necessary for prescribing what the educational system needs to deliver The existing evidence so far suggests that greater numeracy skills and ability to think abstractly might help A cocktail of other skills are also likely to be affected including cognitive physical interpersonal networking and problem solving skills But an emphasis on any fixed set of skills might be too backward looking As technology continues to evolve the future workforce will also likely need to evolve This suggests that flexibility will likely continue to be a valued skill one that may be particularly underprovided by the current schooling system in particular to enable lifelong learning and adaptability to a changing labor market This discussion suggests that for society to make the best use of new technologies without increasing income inequality adjustments are necessary Although the heaviest burden of adjustment is likely to fall on the skills competencies and flexibility of workers the perspective that technology is not a force of nature and can be shaped and adapted by societal decisions suggests that technology can have positive societal impacts if it is designed with certain values in mind Can society continue to harvest the benefits of new technologies while at the same time modifying their implementation so that they create more work for those at the margins of society make better use of existing workers and yield deeper satisfaction for workers The history of numerically controlled or programmed machine tools is instructive on this point In the early days of numerical control the task of writing programs for machine tools was allocated to programmers not machinists The programs were encoded on paper tapes or punch cards and fed to the machine tools Machinists simply monitored the tools This led some to argue that machinists would be deskilled because management desired to separate cognition from execution But with the rapid improvements in the microchip computers became small enough to embed in the machine tools and machinists now had access to the computers and the programs They began to learn to alter and eventually revise the code that controlled their tools In short programming became part of the machinist s task 81 More recent technologies like the Baxter and Sawyer robots from Rethink Robotics take this a step further enabling line workers to program the machines simply by physically guiding them through the steps rather than by writing computer code 82It bears repeating that this discussion of technology and inequality 81 D F Noble 1984 Forces of Production Transaction Publishers 82 Rethinkrobotics Products Software http www rethinkrobotics com productssoftware accessed May 2016 should not be read to imply that all aspects of inequality and its recent increase in much of the Western world can simply be attributed to technological change one must also consider the role played by the demise of unions concessions on wages and job structures the offshoring of work to places with lower wage rates tax policy and the increasing contribution played by financial investments in the accumulation of wealth Indeed increasing inequality in the United States has a political dimension a phenomenon that is of course not new Politically powerful individuals and groups have long deployed their power in order to increase their economic rents This is seen today in the form of some business groups campaigning for special treatment of their line of business or for the continuation of tax loopholes Nevertheless there is a technological element to such rent seeking and to inequality as well Some of the most spectacular salaries on Wall Street are paid by hedge funds that deploy more and more sophisticated computers and algorithms to execute trades or arbitrage information before their competitors in a matter of milliseconds This is just one facet of the potential use of technology in ways that do not necessarily advance social welfare but create large benefits for those who deploy and control it In sum new technologies can participate in eliminating occupations creating new occupations shifting the distribution of tasks among occupations and altering the geographical division of labor 83 The dynamics of employment and wage inequality are driven by forces that are not exclusively or even primarily technological in nature institutional patterns legal structures tax structures and managerial ideologies that emphasize the accumulation of wealth also play a role Most importantly these forces interact with technology and vice versa to shape ultimate outcomes Consequently the ways that any particular technology or a range of new and rapidly changing technologies will affect employment and income are not predetermined but rather a function of choices The committee ends by again cautioning the reader against believing that all the effects of a technology on employment and inequality are inherent in the nature of the technology itself How technologies affect work and employment hinge not only on the constraints and affordances 83 There are some interesting parallels to the effects of import competition For instance Autor Dorn and Hanson 2013 found that rising Chinese imports caused higher unemployment lower labor force participation and reduced wages in the local markets that had manufacturing plants with competing products D H Autor D Dorn and G H Hanson 2013 The China syndrome Local

institutions markets culture and public policies Nevertheless on the basis of previous research the committee believes several generalizations are possible Recent years have yielded significant advances in computing and communication technologies with profound impacts on society Technology is transforming the way we work play and interact with others From these technological capabilities new industries organizational forms and business models are emerging Technological advances can create enormous economic and other benefits but can also lead to significant changes for workers IT and automation can change the way work is conducted by augmenting or replacing workers in specific tasks This can shift the demand for some types of human labor eliminating some jobs and creating new ones

response to World War II was the most extraordinary mobilization of an idle economy in the history of the world During the war 17 million new civilian jobs were created industrial productivity increased by 96 percent and corporate profits after taxes doubled The government expenditures helped bring about the business recovery that had eluded the New Deal War needs directly consumed over one third of the output of industry but the expanded productivity ensured a remarkable supply of consumer goods to the people as well America was the only that saw an expansion of consumer goods despite wartime rationing BY 1944 as a result of wage increases and overtime pay real weekly wages before taxes in manufacturing were 50 percent higher than in 1939 The war also created entire new technologies industries and associated human skills The war brought full employment and a fairer distribution of income Blacks and women entered the workforce for the first time Wages increased so did savings The war brought the consolidation of union strength and far reaching changes in agricultural life Housing conditions were better than they had been before In addition because the mobilization included the ideological argument that the war was being fought for the interests of common men and women social solidarity extended far beyond the foxholes Public opinion held that the veterans should not return jobless to a country without opportunity and education That led to the GI Bill which helped lay the foundation for the remarkable postwar expansion that followed The war also made us more of a middle class society than we had been before It is no exaggeration to say that America won the war abroad and the peace at home at the same time No doubt the historical conditions of America s economic surge during World War II were singular But we have much to learn from that achievement as we face our troubles today Historians economists and politicians have long wondered why this remarkable social and economic mobilization of latent human and physical resources required a war The answer I think is partly ideological World War II provided the ideological breakthrough that finally allowed the U S government to surmount the Clutch Plague Despite the New Deal even President Roosevelt had been constrained from intervening massively enough to stimulate a full recovery By 1938 he had lost his working majority in Congress and a conservative coalition was back stifling the New Deal programs When the economy had begun to bounce back FDR pulled back on government spending to balance the budget which contributed to the recession of 1938 The war was like a wave coming over that conservative coalition the old ideological constraints collapsed and government outlays powered a recovery For a time the government became the purchaser of one half of all the goods produced by the American people A magnificent and little appreciated fact however is that even though the government intervened far more deeply than in World War I by imposing wage and price controls and surtaxes raising funds through war bonds rationing goods and compelling industries to work for war production FDR negotiated a sense of partnership rather than simply imposing the government s will The stereotype of FDR as a regulation lover flies in the face of experience in the 1940s when Roosevelt ended his cold war with business Wartime planning was far more corporatist than New Deal planning with far less class warfare Eleanor Roosevelt was still much more anti business than Franklin and was often furious at him After 1940 antitrust enforcement virtually shut down Liberals were upset that ALCOA was a big bad monopoly But as Secretary of War Stimson observed I d rather have more sinful aluminum now than good aluminum too late for the war Nevertheless the government did finance a competitor in Reynolds Aluminum which helped to motivate ALCOA to produce aluminum and gave the government a second supplier Despite the entente with business FDR was still willing to go forward on the employment of blacks and women in part because he believed that full productivity and wartime morale required it He also continued to advance trade unionism He did insist for example that Ford Motor Company live up to its responsibilities under the Wagner Act When Ford refused Roosevelt cancelled a lucrative government contract This helped to produce the momentum for the big Ford strike in the spring of 1941 that brought the first union into Ford But on other regulatory issues FDR compromised A government that depended on these businesses to mobilize during the war could not be slapping them with antitrust suits at the same time Basically Roosevelt made the decision that he had to mobilize the proprietors of the mines the factories and the shops He realized Congress could provide the money but it could not build the planes design the tanks or assemble the weapons Without the cooperation of industry massive production would never get off the ground So the challenge was to bring the proprietors of the nation s chief economic assets into the defense effort as active participants He recognized also that private business could not find all the capital required for the expansion of the plants nor take the risk that the end of the war would leave them with no orders and excess capacity So the federal government through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation advanced the necessary money to expand the factories often leasing them to industry The government developed new sources of supply for raw materials and created quick mass transportation The government also went into the business of producing synthetic rubber and aluminum as well as other emerging industries and helped stimulate new technologies Contrary to the stereotype of a wartime command economy there was a remarkable entrepreneurial spirit in sharp contrast to the situation in Germany or in socialist centrally planned economies Roosevelt brought in dozens of top business executives as dollar a year men to help run the government commissions so that businesses didn t feel the government was simply telling them what to do He allowed business to realize profits He used government to create markets and to help business set up new plants and equipment which business often leased and later bought cheaply after the war It is hard for us to imagine today how such an entrepreneurial spirit could co exist with war mobilization but one did One reason of course was the opportunity to profit though the wartime tax on excess profits prevented the kind of windfalls made during World War I More fundamentally a spirit developed within each business enterprise to produce better than its competitors to serve the country In his fireside chats Roosevelt explained to the people over and over again why their productive genius had to be mobilized to win the war Buoyed by the strong morale the president fostered business and labor worked together to get the E for excellence citations that he spread around It was not just producing more than your competitor it was producing more than you did the previous quarter and the quarter before that For instance Henry Kaiser s shipyards were able to get the production time for Liberty Ships down from 365 days to 92 62 and finally to one day Overall the economy grew at a rate of 11 or 12 percent annually throughout the war Air Corps aces would visit the factories the pilot would tell the workers that it wasn t the pilots who were heroic it was their planes The war production posters emphasized that factories and GI s were one continuous front a theme that Roosevelt also struck in his speeches The people understood from the start that America s dominant contribution to the war would be its production When he was being urged by his military advisers to function more as a economic czar Roosevelt rejected that role The military was constantly urging him to institute compulsory national service in which people had either to enlist or work in one of the military plants to which the government would assign them Roosevelt successfully resisted that idea throughout the war on the theory that somehow the momentum of democracy would be sufficient If the jobs were out there people would put their mattresses on top of their cars and go to where the jobs were He had this extraordinary vision of the highways filled with people going south going west In one fireside chat he advised people to get maps And the Hammond company in New York sold out their entire stock of 2 000 maps in a single morning Even though the mobilization was chaotic and there were sometimes too many people in some places and too few people in other places it worked And America still produced more than any other country without the regimented manpower that some in the military wanted Roosevelt resisted and delayed most of the decisions that concentrated government power For example in the spring of 1942 when there was a rudimentary system of wage and price control Harold Smith his budget director declared it was time for comprehensive controls But the president was worried that it was adding up to an overly regimented economy and he rejected the proposal In sum one almost totally forgotten lesson of the war is that deep government involvement doesn t have to mean a command economy Despite the mobilization large segments of the economy were unaffected by the controls No one was told where to move or work Production for the government was still freely entered into by producers and government in a contractual arrangement and business ar gued about those contracts all the time Private property remained predominant throughout the country and still there were profits In the World War II experience the things we revere about capitalism the parts that spur energy efficiency and entrepreneurial skill were still in place What the war did was tap that energy not constrain it In the early years of the war Roosevelt consciously pursued a conversion program to shift industry to a wartime footing Lingerie factories began making camou flage netting baby carriages became field hospital food carts Lipstick cases became bomb cases beer cans went to hand grenades adding machines to automatic pistols and vacuum cleaners to gas mask parts Behind these shifts was planning someone had to perceive the similarity between lipstick cases and cartridges Though FDR delayed converting large consumer industries such as autos as long as possible there was a clear and deliberate plan After the war reconversion to civilian industry mostly carried out after FDR s death in April 1945 occurred more abruptly But it was not without a measure of planning To an important degree the Cold War served as an economic stimulus as World War II did in the early 1940s But the Cold War has now ended and there is not even a shred of a conversion policy And one of the dominant lessons of World War II is that unless there is a plan for conversion or reconversion people are subject to the whims of the free market Wartime conversion was not without hardships but most of them resulted from too little planning not too much In 1942 after delaying the government finally had to force the automobile industry to convert their plants to the manufacture of planes Four hundred thousand automobile workers were thrown out on the streets until that conversion could take place All the auto dealers and salespersons were suddenly out of jobs Eleanor Roosevelt had an altercation with General Motors Chairman William Knudsen because he had been unwilling to accept a plan a year earlier What made it finally work was the recognition that there had to be a plan that the government was behind the plan and the plan had public support In 1992 despite all the talk about it there is no collective effort to plan for the aftermath of the Cold War Word War II produced remarkable social gains At war production plants attempts to boost morale such as holding more softball games and building additional canteens and health clubs also fostered a sense of community The logic of mobilization produced a logic of social advance Eleanor Roosevelt in particular was successful in arguing that a fully productive work force requires everyone s talents blacks and women alike and if women are to work in the factories their children require day care She proved that absentee rates were high in the factories because worried women were going home to care for their children She got restaurants to prepare hot meals so women could bring home hot dinners The productivity rates soared as a result of these measures When Henry Kaiser built his big shipyard in California the government paid for a twenty four hour child care center It was a state of the art facility with the best nursery school teachers because it was seen as a pioneering test of early education Workers on every shift could bring their children If they worked at night they could bring their children to sleep If they worked the day shift their children received an education that they had never had before The children especially those from lower class families showed enormous gains But when the war ended all the centers were shut down The day after the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima the teachers got their dismissal notices The war broke down the long resistance to women working outside the home In the 1930s because of the scarcity of jobs many states actually passed laws barring married women from working if their husbands had a job In the Kelsey Hayes strike of 1941 the United Auto Workers went on strike over the hiring of women for men s jobs for fear that it would lower the wage scale Eventually as women were needed to fill vacancies the UAW grasped that the answer was obviously equal pay for equal work Unfortunately that momentum also dissipated with the end of full employment at the end of the war The several facets of the wartime economy worked in tandem The war was financed by a combination of taxes and bonds but FDR s control of the Federal Reserve guaranteed that interest rates would stay low Wage and price control and rationing made sure that full employment and shortages did not create inflation or hoarding as a side effect Public investment provided the capital that the factories needed A labor business entente assured the absence of disruptive strikes It was all of a piece Government was a source of full employment macroeconomic recovery technological breakthrough worker training reindustrialization and a good deal of incidental social progress Can we obtain the same benefits today without a war In retrospect the war economy seems as if it were all neatly planned and somehow inevitable But of course Roosevelt was the great improviser Some of what occurred during the war has no peacetime counterpart the rationing the ten million men in uniform But much of it does For example we could have a great deal more public investment in technology infrastructure and training We do not want or need wage and price controls but to achieve the same restraint we could certainly have what economists call an incomes policy tying wages to real productivity increases We could have an excess profits tax And if they had day care centers in war production plants in 1942 we can certainly have them today With industry short of capital and the banking system reeling a new Reconstruction Finance Corporation would also be sensible Fifty years ago the common desire to win the war and the feeling of revenge against the Japanese and the Nazis created a national sense of community The first task today is to define the common problem facing the nation that requires an overarching vision Absent a war the task of leadership is to create an understanding in the people of our competitive economic position in the world today Leaders must remind the public that we still have the resources and the talent but we must reorganize ourselves and the relationship between the government and the people just as we did during World War II Throughout our nation s history there have been critical moments when the government s relationship to private enterprise had to change allowing both economic expansion and the flourishing of democracy Now is one of those times The World War II experience shows just how bold that effort has to be Americans work longer hours even in multiple part time jobs than their European counterparts Here s how to create a better work life balance As the mainstream consensus on foreign affairs begins to erode it s time to bring economics back into the discussion The overwhelming majority of House Democrats support a 15 federal minimum wage But a centrist bill to institute regional minimum wages is standing in the way The Committee for

government influences the U S market economy The scope of government regulations is vast and reaches all sectors of the economy and all aspects of our daily lives But what exactly is regulation ReportReportSocial Media ToolkitSocial Media ToolkitRelated ContentRegulation is a major way in which government influences the U S market economy The scope of government regulations is vast and reaches all sectors of the economy and all aspects of our daily lives But what exactly is regulation The Merriam Webster dictionary provides this very general and simple definition of regulation an official rule or law that says how something should be done1Regulatory policy scholars Susan Dudley2 and Jerry Brito elaborate on that definition this way Regulations also called administrative laws or rules are the primary vehicles by which the federal government implements laws and agency objectives They are specific standards or instructions concerning what individuals businesses and other organizations can or cannot do Market economies need clear rules to function efficiently Without a legal framework establishing and enforcing property rights and the rules of the game our free enterprise system could not exist Regulations issued by the executive branch affect every aspect of our lives From the moment you wake up until the time you go to sleep regulations influence what you do Yet most people know very little about the impact of regulations or the process by which they are produced 3Recently the international Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD has done considerable research on regulatory policy Their overarching perspective is that regulations are often necessary for a well functioning market based capitalist society but they do not always live up to public expectations or achieve their social goals In other words regulations in practice do not always make things better Regulations are indispensable to the proper function of economies and societies They create the rules of the game for citizens business government and civil society They underpin markets protect the rights and safety of citizens and ensure the delivery of public goods and services At the same time regulations are not costless Businesses complain that red tape holds back competitiveness while citizens complain about the time that it takes to fill out government paperwork Moreover designing and enforcing regulations also requires resources for government and public administrations Regulations can also have unintended costs when they become outdated or inconsistent with the achievement of policy objectives The 2008 financial crisis which resulted in part from poorly designed regulatory regimes and the uneven enforcement of existing regulations and the ensuing and ongoing economic downturn starkly illustrate the potential consequences of regulatory failure 4When CED last spoke on regulatory policy we like the OECD recognized the necessity of regulation but noted how it often fails to serve its role well Government regulation of economic and social activities permeates our lives While regulation in many instances yields important public benefits regulations often are imposed on individuals and organizations with too little thought or analysis of what is gained in comparison with the losses incurred in time money indecision and productivity Further the growth of government involvement in the market system sometimes constrains our ability to achieve fundamental economic and social goals 5Indeed though government intervention in the marketplace is often justified it does not always achieve its first best textbook ideal There is an elegant efficiency in the market price system allowing resources to flow naturally to their highest valued uses as signaled by suppliers and demanders but still there is a role for government where markets fail to price goods and services to reflect social values Where government intervention can help correct prices whether through regulations or fiscal tax and spending policies government will improve economic and social outcomes This is not a blanket endorsement of government intervention however as public policies are often imperfect fixes that can worsen rather than improve outcomes A worthy government role does not mean we should hand over full control of markets to government The free market may still be superior to government in getting most of the prices and flows of resources right It follows that government regulations are more likely to improve rather than impede the performance of the economy when they adhere to broad economic principles rather than impose narrow statutory rules Principles based regulatory approaches have the advantage of being more adaptable to changes in economic conditions and economic opportunities as new markets develop in the economy and particular businesses rise or fall in response to appropriate price signals Admittedly the lack of specificity in principles based regulations can allow unintended behavior to be characterized as compliant On the other hand whereas a highly prescriptive rules based approach makes it harder for businesses and regulators to fudge compliance such brighter line regulations can become so specific and tailored to the situation of the moment that they can easily become obsolete or even counter productive particularly from a public interest or societal perspective as the economy evolves They can also be specifically designed to favor incumbent businesses as well supporting cronyism to the detriment of new business formation and the innovation and productivity growth of the overall economy The case for a highly specific rules based regulatory system is that in our litigious society laws and rules must fully cover every contingency lest the clever manipulate the system to take unfair advantage Even sound and well intended rules this perspective would contend could leave enormous and debilitating uncertainty until all of those contingencies were resolved perhaps even in court However we believe that the benefits of a more concise principles based approach are substantial enough that the nation should change its collective mentality including perhaps a dispute resolution system that could deliver timely judgments possibly with penalties for attempts at manipulation that are fairly determined to be frivolous A summary of recent literature on principles versus rules based systems is presented in Appendix 1 Government decisions are more susceptible to bias through the influence of special interest money and politics whereas free market outcomes are impartial to all the different participants in the marketplace who clearly signal values through the prices they are willing to pay or receive Therefore a well justified approach to government policy is one in which private market prices are still the primary signal to steer resources but regulations or other public policies supplement or correct the signals to more completely reflect public costs and benefits Regulation is just one way the government can intervene in the market economy Two other major ways are through fiscal and monetary policy These three types of public policy levers interact and overlap and can work toward the same goals but also unfortunately cross purposes Sadly government does not plan for and scrutinize the effects of regulatory policy as well as it does for the impact of fiscal and monetary policy There are several reasons for this discrepancy First the effects of regulations are more difficult to measure on both the benefit and the cost side but particularly measuring both on common terms usually in monetary values so they are comparable Second regulations typically do not impact the federal government s budget bottom line as directly or explicitly as fiscal policy does so it is more difficult and there is less incentive for the federal government itself to measure the costs which are often shifted to lower level governments or the private sector even though the effects on the economy broadly can be just as large or larger Any cost estimates produced by those very entities that disproportionately bear the costs of regulatory policies are typically viewed by federal policymakers with skepticism and a presumption of exaggeration given that they come from a self interested rather than purely public interested perspective Regulated entities not surprisingly view claims by regulators with analogous skepticism In theory the major economic justifications for and role of regulation are fairly clear cut In practice however capture special interests or cronyism theories compete with the public interest rationale to explain why and how the government actually regulates Regulation policy refers to how regulations in practice are made maintained and evaluated Worldwide regulation policy over the past few decades has progressed from concepts of regulatory reform or deregulation to regulation management and most recently to regulatory governance In a 2011 report on Regulatory Policy and Governance the OECD describes this progression of concerns and goals The OECD model of regulatory policy is founded on the view that ensuring the quality of the regulatory structure is a dynamic and permanent role of government Governments must be actively engaged in assuring the quality of regulation not reactively responding to failures in regulation In advanced countries this concept is evolving into regulatory governance Regulatory governance is grounded in the principles of democratic governance and engages a wider domain of players including the legislature the judiciary sub national and supra national levels of government and standard setting activities of the private sector The integration of evidence based impact assessment of new and existing regulation building strong institutions for regulatory management and placing a greater focus on users of regulation are all critical elements 6A common business perspective on regulatory policy is that regulations can often be helpful to the economy in encouraging competition leveling the playing field and promoting vibrant and dynamic markets that can be more responsive to evolving public interests On the other hand businesses also complain about regulations being overly burdensome inefficient and sometimes inappropriate and unjustified Of course individual businesses can find much to complain about in specific regulations that impose new costs on them specifically and may seek regulations that give their business competitive advantages over others Ironically to promote a business friendly regulatory climate the public interest large powerful companies sometimes lobby for what are effectively special interest regulations that keep potential new innovative competitors out of the market and thus remove much of the incentive for their own companies to keep innovating CED believes that regulations should support but not necessarily subsidize business activity in ways that maximize the net benefits to society as a whole This is why we favor a more principles based regulatory strategy Regulations are more likely to promote the public interest even if they stay on the books for a long time perhaps without periodic and frequent review if they are based on broad principles rather than narrow rules Broad economic principles last forever but narrow legal rules can become stale over time Broad principles do not favor specific companies over others whereas narrow rules easily can and sometimes do The last CED policy statement on regulatory policy Modernizing Government Regulation The Need for Action was issued in 1998 7 The report concluded that while government regulation is needed to achieve many important economic and social goals the regulatory system produces too few benefits at excessive cost a shortcoming encouraged by the lack of regular scrutiny and analysis of the justification for and effectiveness of regulations The report also observed that current efforts to effect meaningful regulatory reform are severely hampered by distrust on both sides of the regulatory debate and stressed the need to reconcile and narrow the gap between the polar extremes with sound science and analysis that is evidence based guidance transparency and accountability The CED statement made the following policy recommendations Note the repeated theme in these recommendations of getting Congress more involved in implementing evaluating and overseeing regulatory policies and moving away from what is viewed as regulators self evaluations which are more likely to be biased and invested positions But given how much things have changed over the past 18 years in terms of the function or rather dysfunction of Congress it is not clear that we can have the same faith in the capability and motivations of Congress over other parts and levels of government or other stakeholders in the private sector today Beyond that point regulations established via laws enacted by Congress are actually implemented by executive agencies not by Congress If regulations are to be workable at the street level where the practice takes place it will necessarily require expertise in the agencies much more than in the halls of Congress in Washington As a result oversight of agency regulations and their implementation now resides in the OIRA in the OMB within the Executive Office of the President It is not clear that relocating ultimate authority to the Congress would help improve the quality of regulations in practice in the real world On the other hand Congress mandates new regulations and in its decision making needs to understand whether a new cost effective regulation is achievable Therefore strengthening Congress s regulatory resources in some measure does make sense Regulations affect all sectors of the U S economy Susan Dudley and Jerry Brito s primer on regulation follows a day in the life of a regulated American family to illustrate regulatory policy s influence on many areas including telemarketing utilities consumer product safety water quality food nutritional information the pricing of produce and meat automobile safety air bags high occupancy vehicle lanes and highways workplace safety employee benefits both health insurance and retirement savings and television broadcasting When one realizes how these rules affect every aspect of how we earn and spend our money and the quantity quality and price of all these things we buy and sell it is clear that we all are essentially stakeholders in all kinds of regulations Some major aspects and sectors of the U S economy affected by regulations are Susan Dudley s latest May 2015 regulators budget 9 provides estimates on government spending and staffing for the social regulation and economic regulation categories see Figures 1 and 2 and the appendix of Dudley July 2015 10 It shows the tremendous growth in time and money spent on administering federal regulations particularly of the social variety over the past 50 years The past decade has been economically tumultuous and challenging and there is plenty of finger pointing at the government for not doing the right thing in various areas of policy Both since and as a result of the 2008 financial crisis there has been increased concern that the burden of regulation is unnecessarily holding back economic activity There is also recognition that policies must strike the proper balance between the often competing goals of i promoting the stability and longer term growth of the economy which suggests avoiding imprudent risk taking and addressing the fiscal outlook and ii continuing to support the current cyclical shorter term recovery which implies policies that may encourage risk taking and deficit spending This tension between economic goals means that in developing and establishing regulations policy makers will often need to consider whether imposing a regulation that is believed to have long term social and perhaps nonmonetary benefits is worth its short term economic risks and costs This is typically a tradeoff that is both challenging to measure and difficult to make The question Is the United States overregulated is difficult to answer because it is difficult to objectively measure how much we are regulated in terms of impacts on economic activity to be assessed later The term regulatory burden is often used more superficially in reference to paperwork and other administrative costs the costs of complying with regulations One possible measure of such administrative burden is page counts as shown in Figure 3 11 Another measure of regulatory burden is the count of economically significant rules deemed to have an effect of 100 or million or more in a year as illustrated in Figure 4 12Unfortunately these count based measures fail to get to the essence of what makes a regulation truly economically burdensome Are five pages of clear rules worse than one page that is so dense as to be impenetrable Is a significant rule that generates far more benefit than cost bad because its costs breach some arbitrary total cost cap Smarter measures of regulatory burden try to account for regulatory stringency on business and household economic activity such as through the international comparisons made by the OECD and World Bank which will be discussed in the next section Public attitudes about the burden of regulation may be flawed through reliance on opinions of persons not directly involved in the process 13 See Figure 5 Negative sentiment has risen over the past decade but it is unclear how much of this is informed through real life experiences of the burdens of regulation on economic activity versus blaming regulations for the general difficulties of the economy since the last recession versus people s more general philosophical positions informed by hearsay or otherwise from less than relevant personal experience The effects of regulation on economic activity are difficult to measure and thus too often are neglected in the debates over economic policy The World Bank s senior vice president and chief economist Kaushik Basu explains this is because regulations affect the nuts and bolts and plumbing in the economy the fundamental moving parts that are often too deep for us to see or notice He continues to explain that The public discourse on economic policy is overwhelmingly focused on fiscal measures monetary interventions welfare programs and other such highly visible instruments of government action Thus when an economy does poorly a disproportionate amount of our debate centers on whether or not it needs a fiscal stimulus whether there should be liquidity easing or tightening whether its welfare programs have been too profligate or too paltry and so on What gets much less attention but is equally and in some situations even more important for an economy s success or failure is the nuts and bolts that hold the economy together and the plumbing that underlies the economy The laws that determine how easily a business can be started and closed the efficiency with which contracts are enforced the rules of administration pertaining to a variety of activities such as getting permits for electricity and doing the paperwork for exports and imports are all examples of the nuts and bolts that are rarely visible and in the limelight but play a critical role Their malfunctioning can thwart an economy s progress and render the more visible policy instruments such as good fiscal and monetary policies less effective 14The ways in which regulatory policies affect the economy fall into these main categories On the macroeconomic effects Coglianese Finkel and Carrigan conclude that although there has been substantial progress in researchers ability to understand and better measure the economic effects of regulation neither regulatory analysts nor academic researchers have yet to develop the kind of evidentiary foundation needed to provide solid answers to the question Are regulations job killers or job creators 15Keith Hall current director of the Congressional Budget Office wrote for the Mercatus Center that agencies have failed to examine the economic cost of job displacement not based on any empirical evidence that job displacement is costless Although the lack of effective methodologies for forecasting the macroeconomic and dynamic impacts of regulation may be the biggest problem facing regulators the intentional dismissal of the cost of job displacement remains a real shortcoming of agency efforts to promote only those regulations where the benefits are worth their costs 16Regulating for safety reasons is an especially tricky proposition in terms of acknowledging economic side effects or unintended consequences and appropriately weighing benefits against costs Diana Thomas concludes that regulation of health and safety in consumer products ends up a regressive policy placing disproportionate burden on lower income households by driving up the prices of consumer goods and driving down wages 17 Greg Ip of the Wall Street Journal warns that safety regulation can encourage even riskier behavior as we are essentially lulled by a false sense of regulatory security Ip also emphasizes that regulations designed to tamp down risky behaviors widely deemed to be bad can often tamp down economic activity universally considered to be good 18To judge whether a regulation will be good or bad for the economy first one has to identify the purpose or goal of the regulation Is it to achieve a more optimal outcome for the economy and society that the private market cannot deliver on its own because of a fundamental market failure If so what is the nature of the failure and is a regulatory approach and if so what type the best way to address correct or adjust for the failure considering both the benefits and costs of the strategy What kinds of evidence can and should be gathered and considered to evaluate the likelihood of success before a regulation is established Dudley and Brito s regulation primer suggests the following steps in describing How to Analyze a Regulation chapter 8 In other words justify a role for government find the approach regulatory or otherwise most likely to improve the economic outcome and maximize net benefit to society and then consider and address and adjust if needed any undesirable distributional effects These would be the steps an impartial economist would take in building a smart regulation but of course impartial economists are not the ones who propose vote on or implement regulations Economists are on the sidelines ready to analyze when asked the economic effects of regulations already in motion or in place In asking how could regulatory policy do better for the economy we must first acknowledge the current resource constraints that make very challenging the adequate evaluation of regulations in terms of all these types of economic effects There are both data and analytical limitations Federal agencies currently do not do a good job of monitoring and measuring the effects of regulations and collecting data along the way for later analyses Having to compare effects at different points in time involving discount rates place values on human life and deal with uncertain outcomes is technically complicated Robert Hahn has argued that not enough progress has been made in the actual evolving practice of regulatory assessment in terms of the rigor and quality of economic analysis and its potential to improve regulatory policy 19 Yet Hahn also acknowledges that there are understandable and persistent political obstacles to strengthening the role of economic assessments in regulatory decision making Although all regulations must at least implicitly pass a society wide cost benefit test measurement especially of benefits and especially in the case of social regulations can be extremely difficult Given the limits of available knowledge benefits can be highly uncertain Furthermore it is in the nature of many regulations to require investment type activities which provide their uncertain payoffs years in the future Thus even if those benefits were known with certainty which they are not decision makers still could disagree over how many future dollars of benefit are required to justify one dollar of current cost Still further because those remote and uncertain benefits often include claims of the saving of human lives those decision makers are caught in the analytical and ethical quagmire of valuing a human life under various combinations of controversial circumstances The same of course can be true of the valuing of avoidance of injury or illness Environmental regulation is a good and large example the economic costs of environmentally motivated regulatory policies in terms of reduced economic output activities that explicitly enter GDP are much easier to put dollar values on than are the environmental benefits Thus although approving or rejecting a proposed regulation is inevitably and implicitly passing judgment on a cost benefit test in many instances that judgment will of necessity be highly controversial Hassett and Shapiro explain that the economic effects of regulations are fundamentally challenging to evaluate compared with assessing the effects of other types of government policies that are more easily parameterized such as tax policy s effects depending on the breadth and uniformity of the tax base and level of marginal and average tax rates 20 Regulations are varied and hard to generalize because every case is unique and it is difficult to find directly relevant empirical evidence Hassett and Shapiro conclude that policymakers must draw inferences concerning the likely impact of regulations from analogies and based on international comparisons reflecting differences in regulatory climates and stringency Note that this also supports a principles based approach to regulation as broader economic principles typically are applicable and relevant across countries whereas specific rules usually are not International comparisons can help researchers assess the overall country wide or at least industry wide stringency and burden of regulations on broad measures of business and household economic activity but they do not really help us evaluate the effectiveness of particular regulations on the particular more specific activities of particular businesses and households To do that we need more micro level data Here the case for more adequate funding for statistical agencies and programs must be made All stakeholders in regulatory policy should collect adequately detailed data to measure these micro effects so that regulations do what they are supposed to in economically sensible optimal ways Assessing the economic costs and benefits of particular types of regulations cannot be done using macro level data Given that aggregate or average economy wide effects are typically very small the most significant effects are the allocative and distributional effects across geographies industries companies within industries and different types of people which require micro level data to measure 21 It is also true that regulatory policies are not imposed in a vacuum so without the more detailed data it is extremely problematic to attribute changes in business or household behavior entirely to the regulatory policy Micro level data are needed to control for other factors affecting decisions and outcomes A great example of the kind of microdata needed to study the effects of regulations on the very activities that are being regulated and hence whether regulations are achieving their public interest goals is found in a paper by economists Joseph Shapiro and Reed Walker which uses factory level records from the Census Bureau and the Environmental Protection Agency EPA to isolate the effects of environmental regulations from other factors that affect pollution emissions trade productivity and consumer preferences 22 Using a model driven decomposition of the causes of the observed pollution changes the researchers find that environmental regulation explains 75 percent or more of the observed reduction in pollution emissions from U S manufacturing over 1990 2008 One of the four broad principles emphasized in CED s 1998 policy statement was that Where feasible and effective regulations should be applied with a soft touch that allows flexibility of response including the use of market incentives in lieu of command and control directives 23The report went on to explain a full range of regulatory policy approaches in terms of the degree of control the regulation attempts to impose on markets The reporting of information lies at the minimum end and traditional directive rulemaking at the maximum Intermediate positions include a variety of mechanisms that affect economic incentives through the price system such as in the case of environmental policy through pollution taxes or tradable permits Economists of all political persuasions tend to favor regulation via market based adjustment of prices to account for differences between social costs or benefits and private costs or benefits over regulation based on requiring changes to quantities of specific inputs or outputs which would override rather than simply adjust the natural market based price incentives Using the price system allows markets to self correct in response to government adjusted social costs and benefits while preserving the market fluctuating signals contained in the private component of prices in contrast to the latter command and control approach where the government essentially sets quantities and thus pre determines full prices Such market based forms of regulatory policy are also more in keeping with a principles based as opposed to a rules based approach Another advantage of using more market based approaches to regulation is that such practices facilitate the collection of real time objective information on the behavioral effects of these programs Randall Lutter writes that the permit trading approach to environmental regulation has several advantages In addition to promoting the lowest cost means of meeting a specified emissions target environmental regulation also generates emissions permit prices which are unsurpassed at measuring one important aspect of the effects of regulations on regulated entities the current marginal cost of controls averaged across the industry and futures markets for permits can also provide information about current expectations of future control costs 24To widen the market and to narrow the competition is always the interest of the dealers The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order ought always to be listened to with great precaution and ought never to be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined not only with the most scrupulous but with the most suspicious attention It comes from an order of men whose interest is never exactly the same with that of the public who have generally an interest to deceive and even oppress the public and who accordingly have upon many occasions both deceived and oppressed it 25Approximately 240 years ago Adam Smith cautioned the readers of his Wealth of Nations that policy actions touted by businesses and politicians as being in the public interest might actually be positions promoting their own particular and very special interests Fast forward to modern times and crony capitalism the pursuit of private gain through influence in the public sector which is a frequent topic of discussion and debate among the citizenry 26 In the field of regulation such manipulation can potentially have a serious cost Influence over the regulatory process could be used to stifle competition allowing existing businesses to charge higher prices To a degree perhaps beyond even what Adam Smith appreciated regulations could be used to preclude innovation that would challenge incumbent businesses Stifling innovation could in the longer run slow U S productivity growth and advantage other nations that would allow the same innovation to achieve more dynamic economies to challenge ours For that reason building regulatory governance structures that maintain a level playing field and encourage competition is essential Such an attempted manipulation of the regulatory process could be a quite straightforward one on one struggle between a particular private interest and the relevant governmental authorities However there have been occasional alliances between seemingly unlikely private collaborators in attempts to compound their political influence on regulation Economist Bruce Yandle has dubbed such phenomena the Bootleggers and Baptists theory of regulatory policy He first introduced the concept in a short paper in Regulation magazine in 198327 and revisited it in 1999 28 He recently made a short video on the theory 29 His latest more extensive take is in a 2014 book with the same title coauthored with his economist grandson named by the most extreme coincidence Adam Smith 30 As the two authors explain in the book s preface The Bootleggers and Baptists theory takes its name from the classic example of laws requiring liquor stores to close on Sundays which were supported by both alcohol bootleggers and anti alcohol Baptists with both groups willing to spend valuable resources in pursuit of such laws The happy bootleggers eliminated competition one day a week and the devoted Baptists could feel better knowing that demon rum would not be sold openly on their Sabbath day Of course no one will ever see bootleggers carrying signs in front of a state house seeking political support when closing laws are up for reauthorization The point of the theory is precisely that they don t have to the Baptists lobby state house members for them For success to occur according to the theory a respectable public spirited group seeking the same result must wrap a self interested lobbying effort in a cloak of respectability Both members of the politicking coalition are necessary to win The Baptists enable accommodating politicians to say the action is the right thing to do and have folks believe them The bootleggers laugh all the way to the bank and may occasionally share their gains with helpful politicians 31These Bootleggers and Baptists are indeed strange bedfellows but the problem for society is not the oddity of these relationships but rather the disparate and perverse motivations that are thus brought together to shape regulatory policy Instead of the partnership allowing policymakers to better account for a broad and diverse set of viewpoints in their making of government regulations as good public policy this collaboration between Bootlegger and Baptist types produces economic outcomes that are ironically bad for society and the public interest Instead of appropriately correcting or improving situations where the private market on its own would fail to generate an efficient and strong economy regulatory policies that are tailored to bootlegger special interests but cloaked in public interest Baptist costumes end up distorting markets further away from what would be best for society as a whole 32Smith and Yandle explain we are convinced that the rising tide of crony capitalism or what we would call Bootlegger Baptist capitalism is drawing some seriously critical attention to capitalism itself Capitalism has taken lots of hits recently Everything from bailed out banks and auto companies to subsidized solar product firms that fail spectacularly leaves the public with the feeling that the marketplace is seriously flawed Anti capitalism messages seem ubiquitous Yet the proposed remedies for the system s failings all seem to involve more government regulation which means more opportunities for Bootleggers and Baptists to line their purses with transferred rather than newly produced wealth 33In their book Smith and Yandle provide additional modern day examples of Bootleggers and Baptists B B in action with one chapter covering regulation of sinful substances including the original alcoholic beverages tobacco products and marijuana and another discussing the large field of environmental regulation In the next two chapters they relate the B B theory to two more recent and politically charged public policies the Troubled Asset Relief Program TARP following the financial crisis of 2008 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 popularly known as Obamacare In each case the authors identify Baptist type lobbying that yields Bootlegger type benefits cronyism in action The B B scenario is well illustrated in two more recent examples taken from some of the most innovative parts of our economy i taxicabs and ii internet service providers In both cases we can see Bootlegger type special interests trying to pass off their positions as protecting Baptist type public interests New Ride Hailing Companies as Alternatives to Traditional TaxicabsStories about the new ride hailing companies suggest there are some true public interests well served by the newcomers entry into the industry improved access to transportation in areas where it isn t profitable for taxis to wait for passengers as explained in Oglethorpe University president Lawrence Schall s experience as an Uber driver 35 better tailoring of supply to demand in real time via the app system and more efficient peak load pricing where fares rise when demand does to ensure cars are available where and when they are most needed or valued Traditional taxi companies already subject to regulations naturally find it unfair that companies such as Uber do not have to play by the same rules 36But instead of leveling the playing field by raising regulatory burdens on Uber governments could take Uber s success as evidence that their local economies would likely benefit from existing regulatory burdens on the rest of the taxi cab industry On the other hand as Eric Posner cautions the platform technology that Uber and Lyft use is one factor that suggests some regulatory attention will be needed as each company s own platform dedicated to purchasing ride services from that company alone may create monopoly like pricing opportunities 37 Net Neutrality in the Pricing of Internet ServicesIronically as Kevin Hassett and Robert Shapiro have explained in a recent paper the imposition of a single price whereby ISP companies are prohibited from charging higher prices for higher quality services will lower investment reduce supply and hence raise average costs charged to consumers 38 Hahn Litan and Singer 2010 explain that net neutrality takes a legitimate concern that internet services be provided without unjust price discrimination where different prices are charged for the exact same service and takes it to the unjustified extreme where a firm is prohibited from charging different prices for different levels of service reducing economic efficiency by preventing firms and consumers from entering into mutually beneficial agreements 39 A CED blog post focused on what seems to be the general public s misunderstanding of the economics of net neutrality 40In the end even the bootleggers in this case would not actually benefit from a pure unadulterated fully implemented and enforced version of net neutrality the way they think they would But as Roslyn Layton explains there will be plenty of external legal challenges and internal hand wringing over the FCC s new open Internet rules before any such rules become a reality 41Occupational LicensingSimilar to the bootlegger position of the taxi cab industry another current example of regulatory policy supported by incumbents in the industry is occupational licensing A 2015 report by President Obama s Council of Economic Advisers finds that the licensing requirements for certain occupations most commonly in the health and education fields for example physical therapist personal trainer dental hygienist or assistant yoga teacher are typically mandated through state level regulations 42 While ostensibly designed to protect the health and safety of consumers a Baptist goal they also create obstacles to either entering such employment or being geographically mobile in such work thus reducing competition for those who already hold such licenses within their state the bootlegger interests Again the benefits of the bootlegger or crony behavior here in favor of restrictive licensing requirements are clearly focused and easily recognized while the costs of the regulatory burden to the would be competitors who are kept out of the industry and to the consumers who pay more for such services because of the burden passed onto them are much more diffuse In general it seems that cronyism and capture of regulatory policy by special interests is easier when regulations are narrow special tailor made and complex difficult for new business to qualify or comply This means that not only are narrow rules based regulations likely to favor incumbent businesses over new businesses but they are likely to hurt the overall economy s level of innovation and productivity by allowing less productive older businesses to survive and be protected by regulatory hurdles that prevent more productive new businesses from entering the competitive market in the first place The Council on Foreign Relations 2015 report Quality Control Federal Regulation Policy reviews the literature and makes international comparisons 43 Their bottom line conclusion is that the United States needs smarter regulations not fewer From their report Research on the economic effects of regulation is underdeveloped though available evidence suggests most regulations have brought benefits that are worth the economic costs But the federal government could do more to lower burdens on business without compromising the objectives of regulation and the U S regulatory management system has changed little since the early 1980s and focuses almost exclusively on cost benefit analysis before regulations are put into place instead of in hindsight when it is clearer whether a regulation is working The United States used to be the trailblazer in regulatory reform But the rest of the rich world has caught up Survey data show that regulatory burden does not put U S business at a competitive disadvantage see World Bank s Ease of Doing Business index and Timothy Besley s paper on it but the United States does a poorer job of getting rid of regulations that no longer work 44From the World Bank s overview of their Doing Business report Doing Business 2015 Going Beyond Efficiency a World Bank Group flagship publication is the 12th in a series of annual reports measuring the regulations that enhance business activity and those that constrain it Doing Business presents quantitative indicators on business regulations and the protection of property rights that can be compared across 189 economies from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe and over time Doing Business measures regulations affecting 11 areas of the life of a business Ten of these areas are included in this year s ranking on the ease of doing business starting a business dealing with construction permits getting electricity registering property getting credit protecting minority investors paying taxes trading across borders enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency Doing Business also measures labor market regulation which is not included in this year s ranking Data in Doing Business 2015 are current as of June 1 2014 The indicators are used to analyze economic outcomes and identify what reforms of business regulation have worked where and why This year s report introduces a notable expansion of several indicator sets and a change in the calculation of rankings The United States ranks 7th out of 189 countries in this year s Doing Business report ranking particularly high in the financial market areas of ease of getting credit 2 and resolving insolvency 4 As the report explains page 3 emphasis added The 20 economies at the top of the ease of doing business ranking perform well not only on the Doing Business indicators but also in other international data sets capturing dimensions of competitiveness The economies performing best in the Doing Business rankings therefore are not those with no regulation but those whose governments have managed to create rules that facilitate interactions in the marketplace without needlessly hindering the development of the private sector The OECD s recent Future of Productivity report also suggests that regulatory burden in terms of stifling entry of new businesses harming innovation and productivity is relatively low in the United States compared with other countries 45 The United States is not included in the latest 2013 updates to the OECD s indicators on product market regulation but the 2008 data show the United States ranked second only to the Netherlands in terms of having the most market friendly least stringent or burdensome regulatory stance 46 In a recent article on the woes of the U S labor market in the Financial Times Martin Wolf contends that the troubles are not due to regulatory burden that the United States still has the least regulated labor market among all of the OECD countries including having a relatively low minimum wage 20 percent below UK levels in real terms in 2014 47Hassett and Shapiro refer to these regulatory stringency measures as providing relevant analogy in that they correlate with economic outcomes economic growth and investment 48 They describe the OECD s survey of individual governments asking approximately 1 400 questions the answers to which are combined and coded into a single quantitative score ranging from zero most market friendly to six least as a complicated procedure that might appear to have questionable empirical relevance to the macroeconomic differences among countries However the evidence shows they do have relevance They cite a paper by Alesina et al 2003 that found a statistically and economically significant negative relationship between the OECD measure of regulatory stringency and investment 49 Hassett and Shapiro explain the analogy strategy as follows It is our view that since the analysis of regulatory policy necessarily will require that an analyst draw from a large set of empirical analogies these macro econometric estimates can help researchers infer the likely direction and scale of a change in regulation In an ideal setting one could estimate how a given change in policy would change the index and then infer the likely impact on investment by drawing on the empirical literature Alternatively one could assemble micro analogies to the policy under consideration and then collect evidence on the plausibility of the scale of these effects by performing a thought experiment based on the OECD index 50Hassett and Shapiro also stress that regulatory policies often negatively impact economic activity particularly investment not so much because of the level of stringency of the rules per se but because of uncertainty about the nature and scope of the rules as they are anticipated to be finally written implemented and enforced They explain that A new regulation can have an especially destructive negative effect if it involves a threshold event that creates large incentives for investors to wait until an uncertainty is resolved Such a threshold event could occur for example when a regulator s actions are not consistent with his or her past actions and likely to be challenged in court Between the initial regulatory decision and the final resolution firms may radically reduce their affected investments 51This also explains Hassett and Shapiro s worry about net neutrality regulations discussed previously given the tremendous uncertainty about what the rules will finally be after all legal challenges have been resolved All of this suggests that although U S regulatory policies are not a huge burden on the U S economy in general and compared with other countries we could be doing better particularly in the execution and maintenance of regulations In theory we may know a lot about what makes for good regulations but in practice we are not optimizing Our regulations could be better designed and maintained to promote a more vibrant innovative and productive economy How can our nation do a better job at constructing and implementing sound regulation policies and avoiding cronyism including the Bootleggers Baptists problem and otherwise unwise or misguided policies Many researchers and research organizations U S and international have formulated guidelines for better regulatory policy All these recommendations focus on i better information that is the data and economic analysis the tools in the regulatory tool box that are used in the planning and evaluation of regulations ii better oversight and monitoring of the regulatory policy process and the institutions and people involved the regulators or the carpenters who build and maintain the regulations and iii better collaboration between and input from regulators and all stakeholders including businesses and the general public The 2012 OECD Regulatory Policy Committee recommendations52 of the Council On Regulatory Policy and Governance 2012 which built upon 2005 OECD Guiding Principles for Regulatory Quality and Performance 53 provide overarching recommendations on how to improve the quality of regulatory policy Those 12 recommendations are quoting with emphasis added Commit at the highest political level to an explicit whole of government policy for regulatory quality The policy should have clear objectives and frameworks for implementation to ensure that if regulation is used the economic social and environmental benefits justify the costs distributional effects are considered and the net benefits are maximised Adhere to principles of open government including transparency and participation in the regulatory process to ensure that regulation serves the public interest and is informed by the legitimate needs of those interested in and affected by regulation This includes providing meaningful opportunities including online for the public to contribute to the process of preparing draft regulatory proposals and to the quality of the supporting analysis Governments should ensure that regulations are comprehensible and clear and that parties can easily understand their rights and obligations Establish mechanisms and institutions to actively provide oversight of regulatory policy procedures and goals support and implement regulatory policy and thereby foster regulatory quality Integrate Regulatory Impact Assessment RIA into the early stages of the policy process for the formulation of new regulatory proposals Clearly identify policy goals and evaluate if regulation is necessary and how it can be most effective and efficient in achieving those goals Consider means other than regulation and identify the tradeoffs of the different approaches analysed to identify the best approach Conduct systematic programme reviews of the stock of significant regulation against clearly defined policy goals including consideration of costs and benefits to ensure that regulations remain up to date cost justified cost effective and consistent and deliver the intended policy objectives Regularly publish reports on the performance of regulatory policy and reform programmes and the public authorities applying the regulations Such reports should also include information on how regulatory tools such as Regulatory Impact Assessment RIA public consultation practices and reviews of existing regulations are functioning in practice Develop a consistent policy covering the role and functions of regulatory agencies in order to provide greater confidence that regulatory decisions are made on an objective impartial and consistent basis without conflict of interest bias or improper influence Ensure the effectiveness of systems for the review of the legality and procedural fairness of regulations and of decisions made by bodies empowered to issue regulatory sanctions Ensure that citizens and businesses have access to these systems of review at reasonable cost and receive decisions in a timely manner As appropriate apply risk assessment risk management and risk communication strategies to the design and implementation of regulations to ensure that regulation is targeted and effective Regulators should assess how regulations will be given effect and should design responsive implementation and enforcement strategies Where appropriate promote regulatory coherence through co ordination mechanisms between the supra national the national and sub national levels of government Identify cross cutting regulatory issues at all levels of government to promote coherence between regulatory approaches and avoid duplication or conflict of regulations Foster the development of regulatory management capacity and performance at sub national levels of government In developing regulatory measures give consideration to all relevant international standards and frameworks for co operation in the same field and where appropriate their likely effects on parties outside the jurisdiction The OECD s 2014 Framework for Regulatory Policy Evaluation focuses on evaluation practices in OECD countries and concrete examples of best practices 54 Chapter 1 provides insights from three expert papers chapter 2 describes the OECD framework for regulatory policy evaluation chapter 3 documents practices in regulatory policy evaluation across the OECD and chapter 4 describes the results of pilots for the framework in the Netherlands and Canada In their most recent October 2015 reports on regulatory policy Regulatory Policy in Perspective55 and OECD Regulatory Policy Outlook 201556 the OECD catalogs the knowledge to date on best regulatory practices and continued challenges with special focus on the use of regulatory impact assessment stakeholder engagement and ex post or retrospective evaluation They conclude that the ex ante evaluation of regulatory costs and benefits is well developed in the United States with the degree of evaluation efforts proportional to the anticipated impacts of the regulatory proposals They also note that the United States has institutionalized ex post evaluation via executive order discussed below but in terms of stakeholder engagement there is no mandatory requirement for consultation with the general public in the development or maintenance of primary laws calling for regulations initiated by Congress emphasis added a deeper discussion of the issues associated with retrospective review is presented in Appendix 2 The OECD indicators distinguish between primary laws and subordinate regulations statute can be changed only by another statute whereas regulations are subject to OMB OIRA executive review and a required public comment process In chapter 1 of the in Perspective volume written by Martin Lodge of the London School of Economics four main deficits in the current state of regulatory policy in OECD nations oversight participation incentive and adaptation are identified The scope of current U S regulatory policy rules and guidance and recent and current proposals for regulatory process reform are described in the Congressional Research Service report Cost Benefit and Other Analysis Requirements in the Rulemaking Process 57The federal government guidance on U S regulation policy writ large comes mostly from the U S Office of Management and Budget s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs OIRA 58address a compelling public need such as material failures of private markets be based on an assessment of all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives including the alternative of not regulating and maximize net benefits to society unless otherwise constrained by law This guidance requires that regulatory analysis be performed on all rules deemed to be of significant economic impact of 100 million or more in a year and that agencies submit such significant regulations for review by OIRA before publication in the Federal Register in proposed or final form OMB Circular A 460 whose most recent version was issued in September 2003 during the George W Bush Administration is essentially OMB s guidebook for federal agencies on how to do regulatory analysis i e what are best practices The 2003 version refined a prior guide developed in 1996 and published in 2000 The Obama Administration s E O 1356361 Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review January 18 2011 E O 1357962 Regulation and Independent Regulatory Agencies July 11 2011 and the latest E O 1361063 Identifying and Reducing Regulatory Burdens May 10 2012 all placed heavy emphasis on ex post retrospective analyses but only requested that regulatory agencies starting in 2011 develop a preliminary plan and then in 2012 take further steps to institutionalize regular assessments and promote public participation in retrospective review The Trump Administration s E O 1377164 Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs January 30 2017 specifies that to limit the costs associated with regulation at least two regulations must be eliminated for every one that is imposed For the current fiscal year 2017 each agency recommending a new regulation must identify at least two to be repealed Furthermore the total incremental cost of all new regulations for this fiscal year must be no more than zero including the reduction of cost from regulations that are repealed as determined by guidance issued by the Director of OMB Beginning next fiscal year 2018 the OMB Director shall create a regulatory cost budget to limit each agency s incremental net cost again taking into account regulations that are eliminated The Executive Order makes no reference to the benefits that accrue from any regulations including those that are recommended for imposition or repeal Logically if only costs are considered then every existing regulation should be eliminated and no new regulations should be imposed Presumably this logical inconsistency will somehow be dealt with in the guidance issued by the OMB Director Legislation relating to oversight of regulatory policy as described on pages 46 47 in the Dudley primer that has passed since CED s 1998 report includes the following The Congressional Review Act of 1996 CRA contained in the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 allows the Congress to overturn regulations within a specified time through a resolution of disapproval Because such a resolution would be subject to a presidential veto and with a presumption that a president would support his own regulation with a veto the CRA garnered little attention However the CRA also requires each agency issuing a regulation to submit a report to the Congress and the deadline for a resolution of disapproval occurs after the report is filed Because the requirement for a report may have been ignored in some instances a new administration hostile to such a regulation could file a report on a regulation issued at any time after the CRA was enacted and thereby empower the Congress to pass a resolution of disapproval The Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999 section 638 a requires OMB to report to Congress yearly on the costs and benefits of regulations and to provide recommendations for reform The Truth in Regulating Act of 2000 gives Congress authority to request that the GAO conduct an independent evaluation of economically significant rules at the proposed or final stages The Information Quality Act of 2000 requires OMB to develop government wide standards for ensuring and maximizing the quality of information disseminated by federal agencies Recent legislative proposals from the 114th Congress calendar years 2015 and 2016 for better regulatory policy practice fall into two general categories as sorted in Susan Dudley s September 2015 testimony 65 Proposals before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee either i improve analysis for decision making before regulations are issued and ii institutionalize retrospective review of regulations after they are put in place discussed in detail later On the former S 1818 the Principled Rulemaking Act would codify the language of President Clinton s Executive Order 12866 and President Obama s Executive Order 13563 66 This would give congressional support to the EO s nonpartisan principles could be applied to independent agencies and would make compliance with legislative requirements subject to judicial review S 1820 the Early Participation in Regulation Act of 2015 would require agencies to publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking ANPR at least 90 days before publishing a proposed major rule 67 This would be valuable to solicit input from stakeholders before decisions are made S 1607 the Independent Agency Regulatory Analysis Act would explicitly authorize the president to require that independent regulatory agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission the Federal Communications Commission and the Consumer Product Safety Commission comply with regulatory analysis requirements 68 Currently the analyses supporting regulations issued by independent agencies tend to be less robust The Administrative Conference of the United States recommended in 2013 Benefit Cost Analysis at independent Regulatory Agencies that independent regulatory agencies adopt more transparent and rigorous regulatory analysis practices for major rules 69 according to government data cited in the Dudley testimony more than 40 percent of the rules developed by independent agencies over the past 10 years provided no information on either the costs or the benefits expected from their implementation 70 Additionally the recently House passed pending in Senate H R 26 and S 21 Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny REINS Act also focuses on documenting and considering the economic costs of regulations before they are put in place The legislation Revises provisions relating to congressional review of agency rulemaking to require a federal agency promulgating a rule to publish information about the rule in the Federal Register and include in its report to Congress and to the Government Accountability Office GAO a classification of the rule as a major or non major rule and a complete copy of the cost benefit analysis of the rule including an analysis of any jobs added or lost differentiating between public and private sector jobs Defines major rule as any rule that is made under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or that the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget finds has resulted in or is likely to result in 1 an annual effect on the economy of 100 million or more 2 a major increase in costs or prices for consumers individual industries federal state or local government agencies or geographic regions or 3 significant adverse effects on competition employment investment productivity innovation or the ability of U S based enterprises to compete with foreign based enterprises But we conclude that there has been disproportionate emphasis on greater scrutiny of new regulations based on the common presumption that there is too much regulation overall at perhaps the price of too little effort toward expanding the practice of retrospective review and too little recognition that regulations may be suboptimal in a variety of ways in the variety of cases that evolve over time As the world changes including but not limited to advances in technology regulations even those based on principles rather than narrow specific rules can become obsolete and even counterproductive It is not surprising that scholars of regulation around the world have cited retrospective review as one of the areas where other nations have made advances and the United States while still a world leader has lost some of its comparative edge We believe that our nation must invest more in continuing review of its stock of regulations and in the data and other resources to support it That does not determine precisely what organization should perform such review We are skeptical that an analytical body of a sufficient size and strength could be created within the Congress Retrospective review must rely heavily on the street level body of knowledge and information already resident within the executive agencies and with the associated leadership resources in OIRA However we also are concerned that the instincts of self justification within those agencies the reflex to defend the judgments taken by those same executive offices in the past could prevent objective retrospective review Still the success of self review at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration documented below demonstrates that open minded self criticism can be achieved even more so with the expertise and leadership at OIRA with the President s own authority and the persuasive power of his budget office behind it One way to circumvent any tendencies of agencies to be closed mindedly defensive about their own regulations in any review process would be either to expand the resources of OIRA so that it could have a separate shop that focuses of retrospective review Alternatively a new and independent office could take on that responsibility What would not work is requiring existing staff at OIRA or the agencies already required to assure the quality of new regulations also to take on the responsibility for retrospective review Both functions would suffer beyond any self protective instinct in the retrospective review function The office charged with retrospective review could select existing regulations for the earliest review guided by priorities set by the Congress Those priorities could include the significance of the regulations as measured by the cost impact in dollar terms and the length of time that the regulations have been in force as well as the degree of public demand solicited through the current comment process We see this function as an ongoing challenge of regulation so we do not see the government institution to fulfill the function as a one time temporary commission with unpaid citizen members The Congress must play a stronger role in regulation There is always the potential for a costly Catch 22 dilemma for the executive should a less than fully informed Congress mandate the creation of a new regulation that must pass a cost benefit test while imposing conditions such that the creation of such a regulation is impossible The Congress does need more expertise to ensure that the legal foundations that it builds for future regulations are sound So better creation and ex post review of regulation will cost money It is important that the nation not swallow whole the fallacy that more resources for regulators mean more regulation It must be made to mean better regulation It can mean better data to facilitate stronger and more frequent review and therefore the cleaning out or improvement of obsolete or deficient regulations that otherwise would evade scrutiny All that is needed is the leadership and the understanding to make that happen It is imperative for a dynamic prosperous economy State and local governments lack capacity even more than the federal government to collect and analyze data on regulation merits and effectiveness Federal government analysts can inform and support regulatory policy practices at the state level particularly as some recompense for mandates on state and local governments that get passed along from federal government via federal regulations and fiscal policies An example is the Obama Administration s paper on best practices state level occupational licensing mentioned earlier in the section on crony capitalism On the other hand states and localities have better ground level hands on information and familiarity about the activities and industries they are regulating The federal government can learn from state experiences too Variation in state and local level regulatory policies and practices can provide an opportunity to learn about the economic effects of alternative strategies NYU Schwartz s study 2010 provides a comprehensive look across the states in terms of regulatory review practices Where little federal level variation in regulatory policies has taken place over time making the gathering of an evidence base challenging state and local level variation provides a natural way of controlling for other identifiable and measurable factors and estimating the effects of alternative policy specifications Researchers should be circumspect however about lessons that might not be so transferable and applicable going from one level of government to another For companies that do business in all 50 states plus DC the 52nd referenced by Schwartz is Puerto Rico the variety of state level regulations makes regulatory burden and red tape all the more costly How well aligned are regulations across states Or should they be aligned at all What makes certain types of regulatory policy more appropriately administered at the federal versus the state level How much progress has been made in regulatory policy and governance since CED s 1998 statement The one recommendation where some progress has been made is the earlier statement s recommendation number 6 more retrospective review of regulations but only in that more executive orders calling for it but not quite demanding it have been issued not because of any marked improvement in actual practice We largely agree with the recent conclusions of the Council on Foreign Relations proposals for regulatory reform should continue to emphasize better ongoing evaluation and oversight of regulatory policy that might be directed guided and even conducted outside the executive branch regulatory agencies themselves A deeper discussion of regulatory governance is included in Appendix 3 But today it is also important to consider whether the cronyism including Bootleggers and Baptists problem is more or less likely in the legislative versus executive branches recognizing that unelected bureaucrats are perhaps less likely to be so influenced by money in politics issues including campaign contributions than elected members of Congress are Who in the executive branch and who in the legislative branch would best be given the responsibility for unbiased evaluations of regulations and how can we best keep cronyism and special interests away from regulatory analyses and decision making At the same time policymakers will need to devote adequate resources to whichever entities are charged with conducting these impartial analyses to make sure that such evaluations can be done in a comprehensive systematic effective and yet timely and cost efficient manner CED Reaction to Policy RecommendationsThere is no question from our own observation as well as the judgments of the OECD and the World Bank that U S regulatory processes and practices could be improved We find some of the ideas in the literature highly promising others less so At the headline level we have already noted that approval of any regulation is at least an implicit assertion that its benefits exceed its costs We believe that to the greatest possible degree comparison of costs and benefits should be explicit We recognize that cost benefit analysis can be extraordinarily challenging and believe that sound cost benefit analysis in a world of uncertainty should make all of its assumptions explicit and should provide alternative upper and lower bound estimates of its key components We also believe that our proposed retrospective review should allow reconsideration on the basis of those sensitivity analyses We believe that such cost benefit analysis is the gold standard of the regulatory process We fear that some alternative decision rules however well meaning might yield inferior outcomes For example an aggregate regulatory budget or regulatory cost cap could yield perverse results A new regulation with benefits exceeding costs could be rejected by an aggregate regulatory cost cap or budget But at the same time old regulations whose costs exceeded their benefits would be protected against a cost cap or budget solely because of their incumbency Similarly a regulatory pay as you go rule which required repealing one regulation before imposing another could delay a fully justified regulation Another global approach to regulation is a sunset requirement such that all regulations would automatically expire unless reaffirmed through some formal process We fear that a well meaning mandatory sunset requirement would soak up considerable resources to reimpose justified and uncontroversial regulations resources that would better be devoted to the difficult and more important issues In short a regulatory cost cap or budget a cut as you go requirement or mandatory sunsetting rules all seem to be second or third best alternatives to a basic fundamental policy of rigorous cost benefit analysis and retrospective review If we were assured that those basics were unattainable we would consider falling back on the second best alternatives But we see no reason to declare pre emptive surrender on the most sound options available to our regulatory system There are other recommendations that we find highly appealing We believe that even statutorily independent regulatory agencies should be subject to the same process and review requirements as the line executive regulatory agencies Independent does not mean alien We believe that early public input should be solicited and given careful consideration We also align ourselves with the governance principles in the 2014 OECD report 71This CED review of U S regulatory policy leads to the following key takeaways and recommendations Economically wise regulation policy is easier in theory than in practice The problem of biased inefficient and outdated regulations could be better avoided if policymakers would pursue an overarching strategy of favoring principles based over rules based regulation which would be more immune to special interest hijacking and manipulation Measurement challenges and resource constraints continue to prevent adequate levels and quality of both ex ante and ex post retrospective evaluation of regulations to ensure that policies are beneficial and optimal The United States is doing better at ex ante justification but could and should strive to do more monitoring and evaluation of regulations after they are put in place Some other countries have surpassed the United States in regulatory management in this regard Federal regulations go on auto pilot without regular scrutiny a lot like mandatory spending and tax expenditures and in contrast to discretionary annually appropriated spending Charging an agency with retrospectively evaluating regulations might be one way to better reevaluate regulations ensure regulations continue to serve their intended purpose and monitor regulations to catch any sub optimal drift in their performance over time The independent body in charge of reevaluation of regulations could be charged with criteria to order the existing stock of regulations for review But we believe this to be a permanent function of looking for regulations that have fallen behind the changing times not a once for all housecleaning Toward the goal of more regular scrutiny of regulations a reinvigoration of the congressional reauthorization process is needed Legislators need more resources so that they can develop realistic standards for new regulations and can pay better attention to the function and performance of regulations after they are put in place too More and better data on the effects of regulatory policies are needed This has been recommended for decades but we really should be doing better now that the costs of collecting maintaining and analyzing data in real time have come down and will continue to decline rapidly At the same time funding for the statistical agencies should be preserved and enhanced to take advantage of the increasing productivity of investments in data More sharing and disclosure of information with stakeholders and the public more transparency is needed Regulatory policy making should involve other parts and levels of government and the public not just the federal executive agencies Increased stakeholder participation will shed light on and help avoid inefficient regulations that benefit special interests over the public interest These recommendations continue the spirit of our 1998 recommendations Unlike our recommendations in 1998 however we now put less emphasis on Congress doing the heavy lifting We also conclude that no matter who is in charge of developing and maintaining regulations the regulations will be more supportive of the economy and the public interest as well as more sustainable over time if based on broadly defined commonly agreed upon economic principles rather than narrowly defined technical rules If we are to improve the regulatory policymaking process and the ultimate quality and effectiveness of the regulations themselves we will need to determine which entities are best able to consider construct administer and review regulations in ways that help businesses the economy and our society See a more detailed discussion of issues of stakeholder involvement in Appendix 4 Reorienting our approach to regulation in this way will help to achieve our goal of regulations that are better justified and regularly monitored reevaluated and scrutinized to be economically smarter not just administratively simpler Principles based regulation is not an original idea Following are some valuable contributions from the recent literature Frantz and Instefjord 2014 72 present an academic theoretical paper on rules versus principles based financial regulation They explain that with regulatory competition and race to the bottom where regulators compete for businesses by watering down principles to nothing principles based strategies can essentially be captured by special interests and thus preferred by firms Without regulatory competition however special interests firms prefer rules based systems where the cost of ambiguity is borne by society They go on to explain that We study the relative strengths and weaknesses of principles based and rules based systems of regulation In the principles based systems there is clarity about the regulatory objectives but the process of reverse engineer ing these objectives into meaningful compliance at the firm level is ambiguous whereas in the rules based systems there is clarity about the compliance process but the process of forward engineer this into regulatory objectives is also ambiguous The ambiguity leads to social costs the level of which is influenced by regulatory competition Regulatory competition leads to a race to the bottom effect which is more harmful under the principles based systems Regulators applying principles based systems make dramatic changes in the way they regulate faced with regulatory competition whereas regulators applying rules based systems make less dramatic changes making principles based regulation less robust than rules based regulation Firms prefer a rules based system where the cost of ambiguity is borne by society rather than the firms however when faced with regulatory competition they are better off in principles based systems if the direct costs to firms is sufficiently small We discuss these effects in the light of recent observations Arnold Kling s 2012 AEI piece Why We Need Principles Based Regulation 73 argues When we think of regulation we think of specific rules that spell out the boundaries between what is approved and what is forbidden For example requiring credit card issuers to give 45 days notice prior to a rate increase I call this bright line regulation BLR What I want to propose is an alternative approach called principles based regulation PBR With PBR legislation would lay out broad but well defined principles that businesses are expected to follow Administrative agencies would audit businesses to identify strengths and weaknesses in their systems for applying those principles and they would punish weaknesses by imposing fines Finally the Department of Justice would prosecute corporate leaders who flagrantly violate principles or who are negligent in ensuring compliance with those principles The banks will always be savvier than the consumers and nimbler than the regulators so bright line regulation is bound to fail James Surowiecki74 wrote skeptically about the approach as advocated in April 2008 by Henry Paulson then Treasury Secretary with Surowiecki sniffing But the best principles in the world won t help much if those in charge aren t willing to enforce them They go on to say As with any regulatory approach principles based regulation must be well executed in order to work A key element is that the principles should have clear meaning They cannot be vague as in the United Kingdom where one finds principles like A firm must observe proper standards of market conduct or A firm must conduct its business with integrity To me those are not principles They are just glittering generalities that offer no concrete guidance to a firm Businesses often use internal mission statements and lists of principles as a tool to align employees with the goals of top management However in many instances the statements are so general that they have no implications for any particular way of conducting business The truly meaningful statements of corporate philosophy are those that provide strong signals of what type of business directions the firm will and will not take Similarly for PBR to work the principles have to clarify rather than obfuscate Legislative commentary should include specific examples of conduct that falls outside of the principles in order to provide further guidance Principles based regulation is not a cure all There are many regulatory problems that are better addressed with bright line regulation For example the algorithm for calculating the Annual Percentage Rate of interest should be standardized and clearly specified by regulators And any regulatory system will have gaps and flaws After all those who design and implement regulations are as human as the people who run the businesses that they regulate But in an increasingly complex and fast paced market environment there are likely to be many regulatory issues where principles based regulation will prove to be more robust Burgemeestre et al 2009 75 Rule based versus Principle based Regulatory Compliance is a thorough analysis of the different approaches and points out that for the case of customs regulations the United States tends to follow the rules based approach while the EU practices the principles based approach There is an ongoing debate in law and accounting about the relative merits of principle based versus rule based regulatory systems In this paper we characterize what kind of reasoning underlies the two styles of regulation We adapt an original account of Verheij et al 1998 to take aspects of the implementation context into account such as the process of adoption of a new norm and the roles of the participants The model is validated by a comparison between EU and US customs regulations intended to enhance safety and security in international trade The EU regulations AEO self assessment are essentially principle based whereas the American system C TPAT is rule based Black et al 2007 in Law and Financial Markets Review76 Black is with London School of Economics Making a success of Principles based regulation explain The UK Financial Services Authority FSA leads the way in the development of Principles based regulation of the financial services industry It is proposing a significant shift towards reliance on broadly stated Principles rather than more detailed rules The implications of a more Principles based approach for regulators those regulated by the FSA and those whose interests the regulatory regime is designed to protect are the subject of ongoing dialogue The potential benefits claimed of using Principles are that they provide flexibility are more likely to produce behavior which fulfils the regulatory objectives and are easier to comply with Detailed rules it is often claimed provide certainty a clear standard of behavior and are easier to apply consistently and without retrospectivity However they can lead to gaps inconsistencies rigidity and are prone to creative compliance to the need for constant adjustment to new situations and to the ratchet syndrome as more rules are created to address new problems or close new gaps creating more gaps and so on Blog by Northwestern University law professor Harlan Loeb 2015 77 on Principles Based Regulation and Compliance A Framework for Sustainable Integrity provides a useful illustration of the problem of absence of principles based regulation and the General Motors GM ignition switch recall They explain Because most global companies concentrate on making their systems operate as efficiently and functional as possible they can lack the agility and appropriate mindset to navigate and manage reputational risk and its underlying drivers with alacrity Compounding the challenge can be corporate dependence on rules based compliance systems to manage risk These are situations in which agents are motivated by incentives that reflect legal regulatory and political constraints rather than and frequently at the expense of moral and ethical imperatives Professor Caroline Kaeb at the University Connecticut Business School concludes that rules based compliance systems possess far greater hidden costs that prevent maximum compliance at a level of economic efficiency In addition rules based systems often pose design challenges Their rules are over or under inclusive Therefore they are unsustainable since global risk has become fragmented and increasingly qualitative simultaneously They go on to describe the recent problems experienced by General Motors The recent compliance crisis surrounding GM s ignition switch recall failure underscores the implications from the organizational absence of a principles based regulation culture A Wall Street Journal78 commentator points to the root cause of this high profile compliance failure as a culture of silence at GM GM s compliance system defied well established behavioral insights by not relying on the individual as the agent for principles based compliance and integrity but rather ignoring and allegedly even silencing the individual in the organization Many regulatory policy experts across the political spectrum call for better review of regulations after they are put in place to get rid of stale outdated and inefficient regulations The findings from ex post retrospective reviews could also serve to validate ex ante assessments Susan Dudley provides a concise retrospective review of retrospective review in a May 2013 brief for George Washington University s Regulatory Studies Center with an overview of the history and current status of the practice as well as arguments for more of it Michael Mandel and Diana Carew of the Progressive Policy Institute in a May 2013 report wrote of the adverse effects of regulatory accumulation the natural buildup of regulations over time on economic growth and its disproportionate burden on small businesses in terms of the hurdles to business formation hiring of workers and expansion of product markets They describe three types of regulatory accumulation i pebbles in a stream where too many regulations in the aggregate cause a blockage effect that increases costs and slows innovation ii interaction between small numbers of existing regulations intended or not obvious or not that raise costs for businesses and iii behavioral overload that forces management to prioritize compliance with regulations over growth and innovation Multiple presidents from both parties and with increasing emphasis over time have pushed for greater retrospective review of regulations via executive orders Yet retrospective review of the cumulative effects of regulation is not commonly practiced because it is time consuming analytically challenging expensive staff and data intensive and difficult to operationalize in an effective and impartial manner In a working paper for George Mason University s Mercatus Center The Role of Retrospective Analysis and Review in Regulatory Policy Randall Lutter 2012 observed that the most prominent practitioner of retrospective analyses is apparently the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA which has completed at the time of his writing 92 separate evaluations of the costs and the effectiveness of various facets of its regulatory program since 1973 and describes examples of specific retrospective analyses and the insights that were gained Lutter praises the NHTSA for the unusual rigor of their analyses and their apparent comfort with self criticism which sets the agency apart He speculates that this may stem from the NHTSA s engineering culture and unparalleled access to timely and high quality data both not the case in most other regulatory agencies which encourages the practice of data driven decision making rather than ex post data supported policy advocacy Lutter s paper also describes how the data driven NHTSA practices the most rigorous forms of analyses of their own regulations both prospectively and retrospectively He mentions a 1998 detailed reappraisal a quintessential retrospective review of the cost and effectiveness of the 1983 rule mandating center high mounted stop lamps on cars and light trucks and the original prospective study that had randomly assigned vehicles to have the special stop lamps under consideration Such use of randomized controlled trials as a means of informing regulatory policymaking and retrospective review is championed by former OIRA Administrator Cass Sunstein in a 2014 paper on The Regulatory Lookback Harvard Kennedy School But for the vast majority of regulatory agencies that aren t naturally so data driven in the development and administration of their regulations further efforts to emphasize and institutionalize retrospective review are needed Recently several legislative proposals for regulatory reform have been introduced as discussed in Susan Dudley s testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on 9 16 15 S 708 the Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015 sponsored by Sen Angus King Independent from Maine would establish a Regulatory Improvement Commission responsible for evaluating regulations that have been in effect for at least 10 years and making recommendations for their modification consolidation or repeal Congress would vote up or down on a full package of recommendations and federal agencies would have 180 days to implement the approved set of actions S 1683 the SCRUB Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act of 2015 sponsored by Sen Orrin Hatch Republican from Utah would establish a Retrospective Regulatory Review Commission to review and make recommendations to repeal rules or sets of rules that have been in effect more than 15 years Congress would approve the full package of recommendations via joint resolution The Commission s report would include estimated costs of the reviewed rules and would sort the most burdensome rules into two categories cut immediately or save for later cuts Agencies would be required to repeal rules in the first category within 60 days of the joint resolution s approval and as new regulations are issued agencies would be required to cut as they go or cut go and repeal rules in the second category to offset the costs of new regulations S 1817 the Smarter Regulations through Advance Planning and Review Act of 2015 sponsored by Sen Heidi Heitkamp Democrat from North Dakota would promote an evaluation mindset and require agencies to be forward looking and include in proposed major regulations a framework for measuring effectiveness benefits and costs and plans for gathering the information necessary to do so It would require assessment to take place within 10 years of a rule s promulgation to measure benefits and costs evaluate how well the rule accomplishes its objectives and determine whether the rule could be modified to achieve better outcomes These proposals are explicitly supported by former OIRA Administrator Susan Dudley and implicitly achieve policy goals laid out by many other regulatory policy experts The regulatory commission idea is modeled by Mandel Carew 2013 after the Base Realignment and Closing BRAC Commission Their conception is that The Regulatory Improvement C ommission would consist of eight members appointed by the President and Congress who after a formal regulatory review would submit a list of 15 20 regulatory changes to Congress for an up or down vote Congressional approval would be required for the changes to take effect but Congress would only be able to vote on the package as a whole without making any adjustments 80The current practice for retrospective review is regulatory agency self review which Mandel and Carew state is problematic because it is costly and time consuming for the agencies to review regulations already in place and agencies have little incentive to be self critical The Government Accountability Office GAO in April 2014 GAO 14 268 reported on the progress of agency retrospective reviews conducted over the 2011 13 period GAO found that agencies had made some progress in the practice of retrospective review and that the reviews often made a difference in bringing about improvements to the clarity and effectiveness of regulations and in reducing the burden on regulated entities probably taken as referring to compliance costs This is illustrated in Figure 6 But GAO also concluded that more guidance from OIRA was needed to improve the transparency and usefulness of the information to policymakers and the general public and to strengthen the links between retrospective analyses and the regulatory agencies performance and priority goals The GAO report identified the major strategies and barriers that affect agency implementation of retrospective analyses Strategies i establish a centrally coordinated review process to develop review plans ii leverage existing regulatory activities to identify needed changes iii use existing feedback mechanisms to identify and evaluate regulatory reforms and iv facilitate tracking of reviews and interagency discussion and collaboration on best practices Barriers i competing priorities hinder agencies ability to conduct retrospective analyses ii agencies reported difficulty obtaining sufficient data to identify improvements attributed to regulations and iii deciphering and analyzing data to be able to attribute effects to regulations vs other factors is difficult In his testimony that dissents from Susan Dudley s positions on the merits of current legislative proposals for retrospective review Sidney Shapiro states that the regulatory system has become out of balance with a hugely cumbersome and time consuming rulemaking process taking five years or longer and that the one size fits all requirements that would be imposed by the proposed bills discussed threaten to exacerbate the problem He argues that what is needed to make the regulatory policy process function more efficiently is to provide more resources and legal authority to the regulatory agencies themselves and to free them from unnecessary analytical requirements So some approaches that would help put retrospective review into better practice are Data need to be collected as regulations go along not long after the fact Agencies need to be forced to or more strongly encouraged to analyze data at regular intervals and in an impartial manner The regulatory system needs to better provide and align resources and incentives to undertake and enforce retrospective review Who is responsible for designing and implementing regulations and can that person or entity be trusted to pursue and enforce economically beneficial regulatory policy Can we better avoid regulatory capture and cronyism and the strange bedfellows of Bootleggers and Baptists Regulation policy experts including former OIRA Administrator Susan Dudley such as in her 2015 Case Western Reserve Law Review article and the OECD have some recommendations on improving regulatory process to keep it impartial transparent to stakeholders and the public comprehensive broadly applicable without special exemptions and free of cronyism or capture of regulators by special interests The OECD s 2014 The Governance of Regulators OECD Best Practice Principles for Regulatory Policy established seven principles for the governance of regulators emphasis is added where the principles most align with CED s objectives and role Role clarity An effective regulator must have clear objectives with clear and linked functions and the mechanisms to coordinate with other relevant bodies to achieve the desired regulatory outcomes Preventing undue influence and maintaining trust It is important that regulatory decisions and functions are conducted with the upmost integrity to ensure that there is confidence in the regulatory regime This is even more important for ensuring the rule of law encouraging investment and having an enabling environment for inclusive growth built on trust Decision making and governing body structure for independent regulators Regulators require governance arrangements that ensure their effective functioning preserve its regulatory integrity and deliver the regulatory objectives of its mandate Accountability and transparency Businesses and citizens expect the delivery of regulatory outcomes from government and regulatory agencies and the proper use of public authority and resources to achieve them Regulators are generally accountable to three groups of stakeholders i ministers and the legislature ii regulated entities and iii the public Engagement Good regulators have established mechanisms for engagement with stakeholders as part of achieving their objectives The knowledge of regulated sectors and the businesses and citizens affected by regulatory schemes assists to regulate effectively Funding The amount and source of funding for a regulator will determine its organization and operations It should not influence the regulatory decisions and the regulator should be enabled to be impartial and efficient to achieve its objectives Performance evaluation It is important that regulators are aware of the impacts of their regulatory actions and decisions This helps drive improvements and enhance systems and processes internally It also demonstrates the effectiveness of the regulator to whom it is accountable and helps to build confidence in the regulatory system Stakeholder engagement is an important ingredient in the good governance of regulators Steven J Balla and Susan E Dudley 2014 in a report for the OECD on Stakeholder Participation and Regulatory Policymaking in the United States 81 a summary graphic is provided in Figure 7 identify the different ways stakeholders can participate in the regulatory policymaking process Advances in online technology have certainly allowed more of the general public to become aware of regulations both proposed and in place and submit comments about them via the regulations gov website Managed by the eRulemaking Program Management Office in partnership with regulatory agencies and the OMB Regulations gov is your source for information on the development of Federal regulations and other related documents issued by the U S government Through this site you can find read and comment on regulatory issues that are important to you Balla and Dudley also describe how advances in internet technology and access have inspired some non profit and academic institutions to develop their own innovative approaches to interfacing with stakeholders and the general public regarding regulatory policy But despite the recent progress Balla and Dudley conclude that the current state of stakeholder participation in rulemaking is mostly a one way street Descriptions of regulatory policies in the pipeline are provided to the public and comments are solicited but there is little evidence that feedback collected via public comment is systematically accounted for in actual decision making Our review demonstrates that there are extensive opportunities for stakeholder participation at all stages of the regulatory process These opportunities however are typically oriented toward facilitating the provision of information on the part of stakeholders Instruments of participation in other words do not generally advance stakeholder engagement in deliberative decision making where deliberation is characterized by reflection on positions held by others and the possibility of changes in one s own preferences as a result of such reflection The Administrative Conference of the United States Petitions for Rulemaking identifies agency procedures and best practices for accepting processing and responding to petitions for rulemaking It seeks to ensure that the public s right to petition is meaningful while still respecting the need for agencies to retain decisional autonomy Building upon ACUS previous work on the subject it provides additional guidance that may make the petitioning process more useful for agencies petitioners and the public The ACUS made these final recommendations on improving communication and engagement between regulatory policymakers and general public stakeholders informed by New York University s Institute for Policy Integrity s recommendations to the ACUS which included the enhanced use of online platforms to educate the public the facilitation of consultations with petitioners before and after submission the creation of public comment periods for all petitions the collection of statistics on agency petitions and the establishment of default timelines for responses Regulation Merriam Webster http www

critical issues 1530 Wilson Blvd Suite 400Arlington VA 22209 A budget deficit is when spending exceeds income The term applies to governments although individuals companies and other organizations can run deficits A deficit must be paid If it isn t then it creates debt Each year s deficit adds to the debt As the debt grows it increases the deficit in two ways First the interest on the debt must be paid each year This increases spending while not providing any benefits Second higher debt levels can make it more difficult to raise funds Creditors become concerned about the borrower s ability repay the debt When this happens they demand higher interest rates to provide a greater return on this higher risk That further increases each year s deficit The opposite of a budget deficit is a surplus It occurs when spending is lower than income A budget surplus allows for savings If the surplus is not spent it is like money borrowed from the present to create a better future If a deficit is financed by debt then it has the opposite effect It is money borrowed from the future to pay for the present standard of living A balanced budget is when revenues equal spending Most U S states must balance their budgets The federal government does not have that restriction Many situations can cause spending to exceed revenue An involuntary job loss can eliminate revenue Sudden medical expenses can quickly send spending skyward Spending can easily outpace revenue if the consequences of debt aren t too painful That occurs in the early stages of credit card debt The debtor keeps charging and only paying the minimum payment It s only when interest charges become excessive that overspending becomes too painful Like families governments also lose revenue during recessions As workers lose jobs there aren t enough taxes coming in Unlike families the federal government can keep adding each year s deficit to the debt for a long time As long as interest rates remain low the interest on the national debt is reasonable The federal budget deficit is not an accident The president and Congress intentionally create it in each fiscal year s budget That s because government spending drives economic growth It s a result of expansionary fiscal policy Job creation gives more people money to spend which further boosts growth Tax cuts also expand the economy For this reason politicians get re elected for running budget deficits if they are creating jobs and growing the economy They lose elections when unemployment is high and when they raise taxes There are immediate penalties for most organizations that run persistent deficits If an individual or family does so their creditors come calling As the bills go unpaid their credit score plummets That makes new credit more expensive Eventually they may declare bankruptcy The same applies to companies who have ongoing budget deficits Their bond ratings fall When that happens they have to pay higher interest rates to get any loans at all These are called junk bonds Governments are different They receive income from taxes Their expenses benefit the people who pay the taxes Government leaders retain popular support by providing services If they want to continue being elected they will spend as much as possible Most voters don t care about the impact of the debt As a result deficit spending has increased the U S debt to unsustainable levels The World Bank says this tipping point is when a country s debt to gross domestic product ratio is 77 percent or higher There are only two ways to reduce a budget deficit You must either increase revenue or decrease spending On a personal level you can increase revenue by getting a raise finding a better job or working two jobs You can also start a business on the side draw down investment income or rent out real estate Decreasing spending is easier in the short term Many experts recommend cutting out non essentials like Starbucks coffees and cable subscriptions It also works for someone with a spending addiction if they get help But increasing revenue is more sustainable in the long run Constantly evaluate and improve your skills to maximize your revenue from the job market Governments can only increase revenue by raising taxes or increasing economic growth Tax increases are tricky If they are too excessive they will slow growth Politically they often end a politician s career Increasing growth can only be done moderately If growth is faster than the ideal range of 2 3 percent it will create a boom which leads to a bust Cutting spending also has pitfalls Government spending is a component of GDP If the government cuts spending too much economic growth will slow That leads to lower revenues and potentially a larger deficit The best solution is to cut spending on areas that do not create many jobs Most governments prefer to finance their deficits instead of balancing the budget Government bonds finance the deficit Most creditors think that the government is highly likely to repay its creditors That makes government bonds more attractive than riskier corporate bonds As a result government interest rates remain relatively low That allows governments to keep running deficits for years The United States finances its deficit with Treasury bills notes and bonds That s the government s way of printing money It is creating more credit denominated in that country s currency Over time it lowers the value of that country s currency As bonds flood the market the supply outweighs the demand Many countries including the United States are able to print their own currency As bills come due they simply create more credit and pay it off That lowers the value of the currency as the money supply increases If the deficit is moderate it doesn t hurt the economy Instead it boosts economic growth The United States benefits from its unique position The U S dollar functions as a global currency It s used for most international transactions For example almost all oil contracts are priced in dollars As a result the United States can safely run a larger debt than any other country The consequences aren t immediate Creditors are satisfied because they know they will get paid Elected officials keep promising constituents more benefits services and tax cuts Telling them they will get less from the government would be political suicide As a result most presidents increased the budget deficit It becomes a self defeating loop as countries take on new debt to repay their old debt Interest rates on the new debt skyrockets It becomes ever more expensive for countries to roll over debt If it continues long enough a country may default on its debt That s what caused the Greek debt crisis in 2009 For most of its history the U S budget deficit remained below 3 percent of GDP It exceeded that ratio to finance wars and during recessions Once the wars and recessions ended the deficit to GDP ratio returned to typical levels An examination of the deficit by year reveals the deficit to GDP ratio tripled during the financial crisis Part of the reason was slower economic growth But part was increased spending to get growth back on track Military spending also doubled to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan Also during the 2008 financial crisis the dollar s value strengthened by 22 percent when compared to the euro Investors consider the dollar to be a safe haven investment The dollar rose again in 2010 as a result of the eurozone debt crisis As the dollar s value rises interest rates fall That s why U S legislators didn t have to worry about rising Treasury note yields even as the debt doubled In 2016 interest rates began rising That will make the interest on the national debt double by 2020 The debt will increase the deficit to the point where investors will question whether the United States can pay it off That will send interest rates even higher At that point Congress will be forced to reduce its budget deficit Long run growth is defined as the sustained rise in the quantity of goods and services that an economy produces Predict how population growth will affect the level of capital per workerEconomic growth is the increase in the market value of the goods and services that an economy produces over time It is measured as the percentage rate change in the real gross domestic product GDP Measuring the GDP Economic growth is the percentage rate increase in the GDP Long run growth is directly impacted by the GDP Long run growth is defined as the sustained rise in the quantity of goods and services that an economy produces The GDP of a country is closely tied to the growth of the population in addition to prices and supply and demand There are specific determinants that impact the long run growth of an economy When the economic growth matches the growth of money supply an economy will continue to grow and thrive In this case population growth would increase but the need for goods and services would also increase As a result more jobs would be available and the employment rate would also increase However when economic growth is not balanced the result can include inflation and excessive growth Inflation occurs when the price of goods and services are rising which causes purchasing power to fall if wages don t also rise A decrease in the demand for goods and services will lead to a decrease in revenue and employment A high rate of population growth will cause less capital per worker lower productivity and lower GDP growth Inflation Inflation occurs when the price of goods and services are rising which causes purchasing power to fall if wages don t also rise Inflation is a negative effect of economic growth that is not balanced When the GDP growth is only caused by increases in population not increases in supply demand revenue the growth is excessive In order for an economy to be successful it must meet the needs of the population supply demand revenue and employment When a population grows too fast the economic system cannot support the changes Excessive growth leads to an imbalance in supply and demand and higher levels of unemployment The quality of living decreases when the economy cannot support the population growth The aggregate production function examines how the productivity depends on the quantities of physical capital per worker and human capital per worker Discuss how aggregate production impacts long run growthThe aggregate production function examines how productivity or real GDP per worker depends on the quantities of physical capital per worker and human capital per worker The production function relates the physical outputs of production to the physical inputs or factors of production The aggregate production takes the physical outputs and inputs into account to determine the allocative efficiency of the economy as a whole Aggregate production functions create an estimated framework to determine how much of an economy s growth is related to changes in capital or changes in technology Production functions assume that the maximum output is attainable from a given set on inputs The aggregate production function describes the boundary representing the limit of output attainable from each feasible combination of input To understand how the aggregate production impacts long run growth it is important to understand the stages of production Graphing Production The production function of a firm or economy can be graphed using the total average and marginal products The aggregate production is determined based on the stages of production and the results of the graph The long run growth of a firm can change the scale of operations by adjusting the level of inputs that are fixed in the short run which shifts the production function upward as plotted against the variable input Aggregate production functions study the short run inputs and outputs of a firm or economy The results allow adjustments to be made which improves the long run growth by balancing the inputs and outputs In economics and long run growth worker productivity is influenced directly by fixed capital human capital physical capital and technology Examine the role of human capital in production and economic growthIn economics and long run growth worker productivity is influenced directly by fixed capital The four types of fixed capital include useful machines instruments of the trade buildings as the means of procuring revenue improvements of land and the acquired and useful abilities of all the inhabitants or members of society One way to increase worker productivity is to invest in better machinery for example A worker with a more productive tool in more productive Another way to increase productivity is to find ways to increase the revenue of the product generated by the workers Since productivity is measured in dollars per worker being able to generate more revenue from the same output is reflected in an increase in worker productivity Perhaps most interesting though is how to change worker productivity through human capital Human capital is defined as the stock of competencies knowledge social and personal attributes including creativity embodied in the ability to perform labor so as to produce economic value Many economic theories tie education to economic growth explaining that it is an investment in human capital development Human capital has been shown to increase economic development productivity growth and innovation Education Education increases human capital and worker productivity A human resource is transformed into human capital with the effective inputs of education health and moral values When individuals and societies invest in human capital it strengthens the future of the long run economic growth The qualitative and quantitative progress of a country is inevitable when human development is a priority Over time when worker productivity increases the quality and quantity of the goods and services will also increase When a society invests in human capital it increases worker productivity and economic growth Human capital and increased worker productivity are critical because they are different from the tangible monetary capital or revenue It is important thought that an economy recognizes the importance of monetary capital Worker productivity in the long run is related to real income If the real income falls over time it will negatively impact worker productivity Economic revenue goes up and down due to shocks in the business cycle Human capital grows cumulatively over a long period of time When a society focuses on human capital and in turn worker productivity the long run economic growth will be steady Economic inputs towards education health and worker productivity impacts future generations by ensuring that they will be more advanced and efficient than the current generation The increase in worker efficiency is the direct result of a superior quality of manpower created through increased human capital In economics technological change is a term used to describe the change in a set of feasible production possibilities Assess the value of technology to a nation s economic growthIn economics growth is defined as the increase in output per capita of a country over a long period of time One primary factor that influences the growth of an economy is technological change Technological change is a term used to describe the change in a set of feasible production possibilities Technological improvement has the ability to increase the amount of output an economy can produce even if the level of inputs remains constant Technological Change Technological change causes the production possibility frontier to shift outward and initiate economic growth Technology is defined as the making modification usage and knowledge of tools machines techniques systems and methods of organization in order to solve a problem improve a preexisting solution to a problem or achieve a goal In economics improvements in technology have helped develop more advanced economies for example today s global economy ENIAC ENIAC the first general purpose computer was a technological advancement that affected both productivity and the types of outputs that could be produced In a developing country the government works to ensure that the technologies skills knowledge and methods of manufacturing are tested and developed so that they can be passed on to a broader audience The expansion and sharing of technology leads to the further development of goods processes applications materials and services All of these areas are critical to the advancement of an economy in the long run The field of economics is constantly evolving as is the production of goods and services In order to advance and continue to grow all markets need to make use of new technology to stay competitive In the case of long run economic growth using the most advanced technology provides a market with a competitive advantage Advances in technology creates an increased level of output with the same inputs which improves productivity Government activity and policies have a direct impact on long run growth It can invest and operate through monetary and fiscal policy Discuss the long run implications on growth from government policiesIn macroeconomics long run growth is the increase in the market value of goods and services produced by an economy over a period of time The long run growth is determined by percentage of change in the real gross domestic product GDP In order for an economy to experience positive long run growth its outputs and inputs must be in balance for an increase to occur in supply demand revenue and employment The long run economic growth is determined by short run economic decisions Gross Domestic Product The change in GDP is used to determine economic growth within a country Government activity and policies have a direct impact on long run growth Long run growth can be redirected and improved when changes are made to short run actions When an economy or industry experiences imbalanced in economic growth the government can respond in order to assist in securing the market Examples of possible government activity include Government activity impacts long run growth It is critical that increasing populations have access to productive resources It is also important that markets stay balanced in order to be successful and thrive Economic growth has the potential to make all people richer but may have downsides such as increased inequality and environmental impacts Compare and contrast the consequences of economies in which growth is a goalEconomic growth is defined as the increase in the market value of goods and services produced by an economy over a period of time It is measured as the percentage increase in the real gross domestic product GDP In other words economic growth is an expansion of the economic output of a country Over the long run economists might look at the per capita rate of GDP growth the growth of the ratio of GDP to the population GDP The percentage increase in the GDP of a country is used to measure the country s economic growth There are numerous arguments in support of economic growth that describe its positive impact on society Arguments in favor of economic growth include There are a series of arguments that are opposed to economic growth Arguments opposed to growth include A citizen s guide to the fascinating though often complex elements of the US tax system How do taxes affect the economy in the long run Primarily through the supply side High marginal tax rates can discourage work saving investment and innovation while specific tax preferences can affect the allocation of economic resources But tax cuts can also slow long run economic growth by increasing deficits The long run effects of tax policies thus depend not only on their incentive effects but also their deficit effects Economic activity reflects a balance between what people businesses and governments want to buy and what they want to sell In the short run demand factors loom large In the long run though supply plays the primary role in determining economic potential Our productive capacity depends on the size and skills of the workforce the amount and quality of machines buildings vehicles computers and other physical capital that workers use and the stock of knowledge and ideas By influencing incentives taxes can affect both supply and demand factors Reducing marginal tax rates on wages and salaries for example can induce people to work more Expanding the earned income tax credit can bring more low skilled workers into the labor force Lower marginal tax rates on the returns to assets such as interest dividends and capital gains can encourage saving Reducing marginal tax rates on business income can cause some companies to invest domestically rather than abroad Tax breaks for research can encourage the creation of new ideas that spill over to help the broader economy And so on Note however that tax reductions can also have negative supply effects If a cut increases workers after tax income some may choose to work less and take more leisure This income effect pushes against the substitution effect in which lower tax rates at the margin increase the financial reward of working Tax provisions can also distort how investment capital is deployed Our current tax system for example favors housing over other types of investment That differential likely induces overinvestment in housing and reduces economic output and social welfare Tax cuts can also slow long run economic growth by increasing budget deficits When the economy is operating near potential government borrowing is financed by diverting some capital that would have gone into private investment or by borrowing from foreign investors Government borrowing thus either crowds out private investment reducing future productive capacity relative to what it could have been or reduces how much of the future income from that investment goes to US residents Either way deficits can reduce future well being The long run effects of tax policies thus depend not only on their incentive effects but also on their budgetary effects If Congress reduces marginal tax rates on individual incomes for example the long run effects could be either positive or negative depending on whether the resulting impacts on saving and investment outweigh the potential drag from increased deficits That leaves open questions on how large incentive and deficit effects are and how to model them for policy analysis The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation each use multiple models that differ in assumptions about how forward looking people are how the United States connects to the global economy how government borrowing affects private investment and how businesses and individuals respond to tax changes Models used in other government agencies in think tanks and in academia vary even more The one area of consensus is that the most pro growth policies are those that improve incentives to work save invest and innovate without driving up long run deficits The Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center TPC has developed its own economic model to analyze the long run economic effects of tax proposals In TPC s model simple reduced form equations based on empirical analysis determine the impact of tax policy on labor supply saving and investment TPC used this model to estimate the long run economic and revenue effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Congressional Budget Office 2014 How CBO Analyzes the Effects of Changes in

Center When prices are held below natural levels resources such as talent and investor capital leave an industry to seek a better return elsewhere This means that there will be less discovery and innovation and fewer new drugs will become available to consumers Often this change happens over the long term longer than the tenure of any policy maker Thus it is vitally important to remind policy makers of the effects of price controls whenever they are proposed as government policy DISRUPTING SUPPLY AND DEMANDThe determining of market prices through the dynamic interaction of supply and demand is the basic building block of economics Consumer preferences for a product determine how much of it they will buy at any given price Consumers will purchase more of a product as its price declines all else being equal Firms in turn decide how much they are willing to supply at different prices In general if consumers appear willing to pay higher prices for a product then more manufacturers will try to produce the product will increase their production capacity and will conduct research to improve the product Thus higher expected prices lead to an increased supply of goods This dynamic interaction produces an equilibrium market price when buyers and sellers transact freely the price that results causes the quantity demanded by consumers to exactly equal the supply produced by sellers But when government adopts a price control it defines the market price of a product and forces all or a large percentage of transactions to take place at that price instead of the equilibrium price set through the interaction between supply and demand Since supply and demand shift constantly in response to tastes and costs but the government price will change only after a lengthy political process the government price will effectively never be an equilibrium price This means that the government price will be either too high or too low When the price is too high there is an excessive amount of the product for sale compared to what people want This is the situation with many U S and European farm programs government in an effort to increase farm incomes purchases the output that consumers do not want This in turn prompts farmers to raise more cows and convert more land to pasture or cropland However the higher prices discourage consumers from buying farm products causing an excess of supply e g a butter mountain Government then exacerbates this situation by continuing to purchase the excess crop at the set price Serious problems also result when government sets prices below the equilibrium level This causes consumers to want more of the product than producers have available When the federal government restricted gasoline price increases in the 1970s long lines formed at gas stations and only those motorists who waited long hours in line received the scarce gasoline In both cases of government price controls serious welfare loss results because not enough of the good is sold The wasted chance to create both producer and consumer surplus from those sales is known as deadweight loss because it is income that is lost forever In addition to creating deadweight loss an artificially high price transfers profits from consumers to producers these rents are often wasted because producers spend them on lobbying and other influence activities to maintain the regulated price In the case of a low price producers transfer profits to consumers Consumers in competing for a limited amount of the controlled product may waste as much as they gain from getting it at a low price For instance the people who waited in the 1970s gas lines probably shouldered as much cost from the lost time queuing as they saved from the price controls on gasoline Researchers Robert Deacon and Job Sonstelie have even argued that the gas lines cost consumers more than they saved from the controlled gas prices Thus the artificially low prices not only hurt producers but also consumers PRICE CONTROLS AND HISTORYGovernment gains favor with voters and constituents when it lowers the price of popular goods Government also gains favor from lobbyists and firms when it raises prices to promote the health of the industry Given these benefits to policymakers it should not surprise us that price control is common in the history of western economies Early twentieth century economist Henry Bourne documented the effects of price controls on France in the years following the French Revolution when city residents found it difficult to purchase grain The grain shortages were not due to any agricultural problems Bourne noted that 1793 France was a prosperous agricultural nation capable of feeding itself Instead the threat of famine was due to internal procurement and distribution problems created by the government For example agents for the city of Paris the military and the government competed with each other in trying to purchase grain This created local shortages where none had existed before and led to social unrest The city of Paris in an effort to appease the public decided to subsidize flour This prompted bakers from neighboring towns to travel to Paris to purchase flour creating even more shortages in the city The French Convention which governed the nation at that time tried to address the problem by establishing maximum prices for grain and instructing farmers to supply it to local markets As one might expect farmers did not cooperate with the new law Markets were empty of grain further shortages developed official tallies of grain supplies failed to find and keep track of stocks urban riots continued The Convention passed another law later in 1793 extending maximum prices to other essential supplies Those price controls in combination with government requisitioning and corruption created chaos in the French economy Merchants responded by reducing the quality of their goods and the black market blossomed Bourne noted It was the honest merchant who became the victim of the law His less scrupulous compeer refused to succumb The butcher in weighing meats added more scraps than before other shopkeepers sold second rate goods at the maximum price The common people complained that they were buying pear juice for wine the oil of poppies for olive oil ashes for pepper and starch for sugar The last century provided many examples of price control generated economic problems in communist Europe Economist David Tarr noted some of these problems in his study of the distribution of domestically produced television sets in communist Poland Because the Polish government kept TV prices artificially low demand far outstripped supply and televisions became scarce A consumer who wanted a TV had to sign on to a waiting list In most cases the consumer had to visit the store every day to keep his place on the list Tarr calculated that the social cost of the queue for television sets was 10 times the size of the standard deadweight loss and that the cost of the price controls on televisions to the Polish economy was more than the industry s total sales In the 1980s the Ministry of Finance in Japan regulated brokerage fees and prohibited firms from competing for customers on that basis However as documented by economists Kevin Hebner and Young Park large corporate customers were very important and lucrative for the securities dealing industry The industry found other possibly corrupt ways to compete for corporate business Securities firms would guarantee corporate investors that certain funds would achieve a minimum return effectively reimbursing the client if the investment declined in value Securities companies funded this expensive practice with profits earned from the government fixed charge for brokerage services to both small and large customers Hence the securities firms turned the price control scheme into a transfer scheme that moved resources from household savers to large corporate investors If government prevents firms from competing over price firms will compete on whatever dimensions are open to them In the era of U S airline regulation when the Civil Aeronautics Board set prices airlines tried to attract customers with food empty seats and frequency of flights This form of competition can be as expensive as competing on price Despite high prices and protection from new entrants established carriers competed away their rents and did not earn high profits PRICE CONTROLS TODAYDespite this worrisome history of price controls government continues to follow the practice In some cases government disguises these policies with elaborate pricing schemes but they still lead to serious problems for producers and consumers Rent ControlRent control provides a classic example of the distortions created by price controls There are various forms of rent control but they all take the shape of legally imposed below market rates for rental housing The results are well documented and perverse First a shortage of rental units arises as landlords become less interested in renting at below market rates Instead the landlords choose to live in the units themselves rent them to relatives or sell them This shortage leads to a host of related distortions For example since there is a queue of people willing to rent each apartment and landlords are not permitted to discriminate based on price the landlords will discriminate on whatever characteristic they please Landlords may also ask for under the table payments from tenants or require renters to hand over an initial fee in order to sign the lease Moreover landlords have little incentive to maintain apartments it is more difficult to recoup the cost of improvements through the government established price and at the same time there is a strong demand for apartments regardless of their condition Consequently the quality of housing stock declines and the area may come to attract less affluent residents This hurts neighborhood businesses New housing stock is less profitable to construct if government controls rental prices thus fewer investors will engage in that activity and economic development will slow In 1990 the federal government passed legislation setting new price levels that state governments would pay for pharmaceuticals provided by Medicaid The rules varied across drugs but in some cases Medicaid was entitled to pay no more than the lowest price that the drug company charged to any other customer Such a scheme may sound reasonable but it distorts incentives in the drug market Medicaid uses the existing network of chains and independent pharmacies to distribute drugs to its members but many of these organizations do not have the scale to bargain for good prices nor the control to influence the prescribing physician In these circumstances they would not normally get the lowest price in the market that goes to large buyers and HMOs or others who can move market share Faced with having to charge Medicaid the lowest price given to any other customer pharmaceutical firms reduced discounts The legislation resulted in an increase in drug expenditures for many private buyers as drug manufacturers tried to raise prices on government sales MARKET FAILUREOne of the reasons that governments invoke price controls is to ensure that goods and services are sold at a fair price In a situation with numerous well informed consumers purchasing from multiple sellers who can develop a reputation for high or low quality the free market works well The market price is fair due to the competition between innovators and between buyers However there are occasions when entrants are discouraged or the information available to one or more parties is poor In such cases government may impose price controls in an effort to protect citizens from exploitation This might occur if patients had to choose drugs without the help of physicians for example In such a case patients might need government protection from high prices for the wrong medicine Our modern healthcare system largely removes this concern by employing informed physicians pharmacists and formulary committees who affect drug choice Early Puritan communities described in Hugh Rockoff s book Drastic Measures A History of Wage and Price Controls in the United States abandoned detailed wage and price controls shortly after imposing them in 1630 and 1633 because they were ineffectual Subsequent laws against excessive prices were more vague and according to Rockoff aimed to prevent sales influenced by fraud ignorance or short run monopolies rather than lowering the equilibrium price in a particular market His interpretation is that the Puritans faced under developed colonial markets and so competition could not be relied upon to regulate prices and protect consumers A market failure such as lack of entry can be mitigated with the right price control at least in theory The difficulty lies in the execution Typically no entity is well informed enough to be able to exactly identify the imperfection choose the correct price to rectify the situation and then provide ongoing adjustment and enforcement Competition is a better tool than price controls for protecting consumers the Puritans appear to have realized that and gradually ceased using them As Rockoff writes One would expect that as markets grew producing a smoother flow of information the need for regulation would have decreased Indeed that seems to have happened More typically governments try to fix the bad effects of price controls with subsidies to the discouraged activity In the case of the pharmaceutical industry these subsidies go to research and development A subsidy could restore the free market outcome by lowering the cost of research Again however the difficulty arises in choosing the level of the subsidy deciding whether and how to award it to for profit corporations and avoiding inefficient lobbying and corruption In practice these are very difficult issues to manage in a way that benefits consumers LOWERING PRICES THROUGH THE MARKETThe private sector has found several successful methods for reducing the price paid by a buyer In most cases government can use similar techniques to get a low price for prescription drugs without disrupting the competitive market The most common approach is to take advantage of scale A buyer representing a large volume of market transactions can negotiate for a better price by threatening to backward integrate or to move its business to a competing supplier if the product is not patent protected Moreover a large buyer provides efficiencies to the seller Lower transaction costs one invoice one negotiation one shipment guaranteed volume and economies of scale create cost savings for the supplier that the two parties can share The private sector provides countless examples of this approach for example big supermarket chains pay lower prices for packaged goods than corner stores because of large scale central purchasing A slightly more subtle point of relevance to the pharmaceutical industry is that a buyer with significant volume can often get an even lower price by helping its supplier increase market share Insurance organizations can agree to educate or encourage physicians to prescribe a certain drug In return for altering market share in the provider network the drug manufacturer offers the provider a lower price A buyer can explicitly foster competition where none exists For example several large corporations in the Detroit area recently began funding a small low cost airline named Pro Air that operates out of that airport The Detroit airport is otherwise dominated by Northwest Airlines which charges relatively high prices due to the lack of competition General Motors Masco and Daimler Chrysler each pay Pro Air a fixed sum of money per month in exchange for a certain number of flights for their employees This gives the start up airline stability and causes its competitors to realize that it cannot be driven out of business By encouraging the entry and survival of a low cost competitor to Northwest Airlines the companies save both on the flights their employees take on Pro Air and also through any price reduction Northwest undertakes in response to the competition Another way to obtain lower prices through the market is for an independent organization to provide information on the competing alternatives to individual buyers Using this information an informed consumer can identify the product that best fits her needs and can demand a discounted price when purchasing a different product Many large corporations take this approach with health plans for employees the employee may choose among a set of approved plans and the corporation provides ratings or a scorecard to help employees compare the plans The ratings cause plans to compete for customers on the price and quality dimensions CONCLUSIONThe imposition of price controls on a well functioning competitive market harms society by reducing the amount of trade in the economy and creating incentives to waste resources Many researchers have found that price controls reduce entry and investment in the long run The controls can also reduce quality create black markets and stimulate costly rationing In the case of pharmaceuticals the most damaging area is likely to be the reduction in innovation which will harm all future generations of patients Although policymakers know that price controls can be very harmful they continue to have strong incentives to legislate low prices for themselves This often leads to the adoption of more sophisticated price controls The government pegs its price to some reference price in the economy rather than choosing a fixed number or sets its price a fixed amount below that of other customers These schemes destroy welfare by inserting a new incentive into what would otherwise be a well functioning market either the price to non government customers is higher or the price to poorer customers rises More generally the reference price chosen by the government rises because of the price control not because of a change in the underlying forces of demand or supply The overwhelming evidence against price controls naturally leads to consideration of other methods of lowering purchasing costs The private sector uses a number of methods that are both effective and consonant with a market economy Such approaches when used by the private market are much less damaging to economic welfare than a government price control Daily dose of liberty delivered straight to your inbox View full list of newslettersCato

States economy has suffered from two glaring macroeconomic problems over the past decade The first is a severe and chronic shortfall of spending by households businesses and governments relative to the economy s productive potential or a shortfall of aggregate demand This demand shortfall has kept growth in both jobs and wages too slow The second problem is a rapid deceleration in the pace of productivity growth Productivity is the amount of income or output generated in an average hour of work in the economy Productivity growth in turn provides the potential ceiling on how fast average income can rise These are both serious problems and policymakers should be concerned with each One policy instrument that can address both is a large sustained increase in infrastructure investment Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump mentioned infrastructure investment as an economic priority during their presidential campaigns last year so there is some hope that proposals to boost this investment could have bipartisan support This brief assesses the effectiveness of an increase in the nation s investment effort in infrastructure as a means to close the aggregate demand shortfall as well as a means to boost productivity growth Its key findings are There is no fixed definition of what infrastructure investment includes Generally however it includes capital investments in transportation utilities and environmental projects Sometimes investments in the construction and maintenance of schools and hospitals are included in measures of infrastructure investment A defining feature of infrastructure investment in the United States is the prominent public role in investment Public funds directly finance more than half of infrastructure investment in the United States and even private infrastructure investments often receive substantial direct or indirect public subsidies including tax breaks CBO 2008 2015 Infrastructure investment that is publicly owned is often referred to as the public capital stock This capital stock is simply the roads buildings bridges ports utilities airports and other structures and equipment that are financed by public funds and whose ultimate owners are governments There are a number of compelling rationales for such a strong public role in infrastructure provision Many of the capital projects undertaken for infrastructure investment would result in a natural monopoly For example once the enormous upfront effort of building a new highway is made the marginal cost of allowing an extra car on it is trivial This provides an entry barrier to any profit seeking economic agent thinking about building a competing highway Given the resulting monopoly a strong public role in either the provision or regulation of the sector is necessary to promote economic efficiency Further many of the spillover benefits of infrastructure investments are hard to precisely allocate to individual economic agents For example the construction of a dam provides benefits to farmers homeowners who are protected from floods fishermen who can use the reservoirs and so on This makes charging precise fees based on the use of infrastructure difficult and it argues that the public benefits of infrastructure should simply be paid for with public funds Finally some infrastructure investment provides services that society has decided should be available to all as basic rights safe drinking water for example even if some customers are not profitable to serve for a strictly private entity In 2014 federal state and local governments combined spent 416 billion just on transportation and water infrastructure projects 1 The federal government spent 96 billion of that and state and local governments spent 320 billion The federal role is strongest in new capital spending as opposed to operation and maintenance Nearly 40 percent of all state and local capital spending on transportation and water infrastructure is financed by grants from the federal government In addition federal revenues foregone by providing tax exemptions for bond financing of infrastructure projects averages roughly 30 billion annually In short governments at all levels but particularly the federal government are big players every year in infrastructure investment Overall spending on infrastructure as a share of gross domestic product GDP has been in long term decline Figure A shows a broad measure of infrastructure investment as a share of the nation s potential GDP The first lower line shows public investment in water and transportation The second higher line includes public investments in the construction of educational and hospital structures as well as investments in conservation development utilities ports and airfields Think of these as narrow and broad measures of infrastructure Each saw sharp reductions in the 1970s and the rebound since then has still left them far below the levels that prevailed on average before 1979 The data below can be saved or copied directly into Excel The data underlying the figure Notes The broad infrastructure series includes public investment in hospital and

is strong evidence that because the prices of infrastructure investments are rising more rapidly than overall prices a greater share of nominal spending must be undertaken just to keep the quality of infrastructure intact Figure B shows two measures of transportation and water infrastructure taken from a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office CBO One deflates the transportation spending by the overall deflator for gross domestic product while the other deflates it by an infrastructure specific deflator The latter measure which more accurately reflects the services provided by a given

this chart on your website Given the large role the federal government plays in providing resources for infrastructure investment and given that this investment effort has fallen in recent decades recent calls to boost the rate of infrastructure investment would seem to have prima facie merit The rest of this paper highlights the near term and long term potential benefits from an increased federal infrastructure investment effort Since the Great Recession began increased infrastructure investment has been suggested as a primary tool to restore the economy to full health Infrastructure was not part of the first stimulus package meant to fight the Great Recession the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 despite some calls for it to be included Mishel Eisenbrey and Irons 2008 The rationale at the time for excluding infrastructure was that stimulus must be timely targeted and temporary Elmendorf and Furman 2008 Infrastructure investment apparently violated the timely part of this mantra policymakers were worried that the recession would come and go so fast and that recovery would be so quick that the economy would be back at full health before meaningful infrastructure investments could be mobilized Some of this logic even persisted with the writing of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ARRA which had a smaller infrastructure component than is commonly recognized only about 15 percent of total spending in ARRA was on infrastructure CEA 2010 The debates surrounding ARRA and infrastructure often centered on whether or not enough viable infrastructure projects were shovel ready meaning again that policymakers worried that infrastructure investment could not be mobilized quickly enough to help the economy while it was still in its unrecovered state Given that unemployment in 2016 was still significantly higher 4 9 percent than its 4 6 percent average in 2006 and 2007 the years immediately preceding the Great Recession this fear was obviously not well founded Infrastructure projects started in 2008 2009 or even in 2013 could have helped the economic recovery Even as of March 2017 many measures of economic slack indicate that the economy could benefit from a boost in aggregate demand The share of prime age age 25 54 adults who were employed for example was 1 4 percentage points lower in March 2017 than the average share in 2006 and 2007 This may not sound like a lot but this translates into roughly 1 9 million workers just in this age group who need to find jobs before the economy can be declared as having returned to pre Great Recession health The clearest evidence that demand growth remains too slow relative to the economy s potential capacity is the unusually slow growth of nominal wages this deep into a recovery Despite unemployment in March 2017 essentially matching its 2007 average nominal wage growth for production and supervisory workers for the year ending in March 2017 was 2 3 percent In 2007 this wage growth was 4 0 percent This sluggish wage growth has in turn made it hard for the Federal Reserve to maintain price inflation at their 2 percent target Finally the agonizingly slow recovery from the Great Recession and the anemic economic recovery and expansion following the 2001 recession even as it was aided by an enormous housing market bubble have raised fears that the shortfall in aggregate demand relative to the economy s productive capacity could be a chronic problem moving forward This problem often referred to somewhat confusingly as secular stagnation suggests that macroeconomic policy including fiscal policy will need to adopt a more expansionary stance in the future see Krugman 2013 and Summers 2016 on this point So far the lessons of these analyses have not been heeded For example fiscal policy has not been more expansionary during the recovery from the Great Recession relative to past recoveries In fact the recovery from the Great Recession has seen the most austere path of spending during any post World War II recovery a fact that explains most of the recovery s slowness Bivens 2016 A renewed push to increase infrastructure investment could move fiscal policy from being a drag on growth to being a boost to growth in coming years Perhaps relevant to upcoming fiscal policy debates infrastructure investment is routinely estimated to be a much more efficient fiscal stimulus than almost any form of tax cut and it is significantly more efficient than those tax cuts whose benefits fall mostly on high income households To determine relative efficiency we look at the additional economic output generated by each 1 added to the federal budget deficit from a given fiscal policy intervention Table 1 provides a range of comparisons of various types of fiscal policy interventions Many of these are taken from the research literature that existed before ARRA Since then most research on fiscal stimulus undertaken when monetary policy is accommodating has found even higher multipliers most famously perhaps in Blanchard and Leigh 2013 But the relative ranking of various fiscal policy interventions has largely been confirmed 2To give a quick sense of the employment consequences of infrastructure investment in the near term note that an output multiplier of 1 5 means that each 100 billion in infrastructure spending would boost GDP by 150 billion This increase in GDP would in turn boost employment by a bit over 1 million workers see Bivens 2011 for the relationships between output and employment Note The bang for the buck is estimated by the one year dollar change in gross domestic product GDP for a given dollar reduction in federal tax revenue or increase in spending Multiplier indicates how much total output GDP changes in response to a 1 increase in deficit resulting from the fiscal policy change Source Zandi 2010 Table 4Copy the code below to embed this chart on your website The primary virtue of infrastructure investment as fiscal stimulus is that it is spent Tax cuts and even direct transfer payments can be saved by households Because transfer payments tend to be directed toward low income and hence cash constrained households they tend to not be saved and hence rival infrastructure investment as stimulus But infrastructure investment is guaranteed always and everywhere to be spent Since 2008 research on the causal effect of infrastructure spending on short run output and employment has been bolstered by the examination of large exogenous fiscal events the large fiscal boost provided by ARRA in the United States the large but quite variable fiscal contraction undertaken by countries in the European Union EU and anti corruption efforts in Italy Acconcia Corsetti and Simonelli 2014 examine the fiscal shock that occurs in Italian provinces when public construction projects are halted in response to findings of Mafia involvement A law issued to combat public corruption provides for forceful and sudden halts to construction activity when local police find evidence of Mafia involvement This provides an exogenous shock to fiscal spending that can be linked to subsequent changes in economic output Such exogeneity is needed in studies of fiscal stimulus because of the ever present possibility of two way causality fiscal changes can affect economic growth but economic growth can also in theory affect fiscal changes Using this high quality instrument that isolates exogenous fiscal changes i e fiscal changes uncorrelated with changes in economic output Acconcia Corsetti and Simonelli 2014 estimate multipliers on public investment of between 1 5 and 1 9 Blanchard and Leigh 2013 examine the large but varied fiscal adjustments undertaken by EU members in response to the Euro crisis of 2009 2010 They regress the fiscal adjustments against the predicted pace of output growth in the next two years 2011 and 2012 They find a systematic and negative relationship between the fiscal adjustments and the forecast error of subsequent output growth suggesting that fiscal multipliers are substantially larger than forecasters assumed a priori They interpret their results as indicating an overall fiscal multiplier of 1 5 They also find that spending adjustments matter more than revenue adjustments in restraining output growth Jovanovic 2017 extends Blanchard and Leigh s 2013 results by examining the fiscal adjustment in government consumption and government investment separately They find that reductions in government investment have significantly larger negative effects on subsequent output growth than reductions in consumption spending Finally Leduc and Wilson 2014 and Wilson 2012 assess the impact of increased infrastructure spending under ARRA Wilson 2012 uses the fact that much of the ARRA highway spending across states was allocated according to formulas that were exogenous to economic conditions for example miles of highway lanes per resident or the share of youth in each state s population Wilson s preferred estimate indicates that each 125 000 in announced highway spending was associated with one added job If this highway spending created jobs across economic sectors in exact proportion to existing employment shares this would be consistent with an output multiplier of 1 3 If instead employment generated by this spending were more concentrated in higher productivity sectors it would be consistent with a larger output multiplier Figure C shows the trajectory of employment from December 2007 to June 2011 in the highest fifth of states ranked by ARRA highway funds versus the lowest fifth of states Employment fell less stabilized sooner and began growing more rapidly in states that saw a larger influx of ARRA funds The data below can be saved

Bivens 2017 notes that recent rapid decelerations in productivity growth are likely symptoms of the extended period of slack between aggregate demand and the economy s productive capacity that characterized the post 2007 period Productivity is a measure of average income or output generated in an hour of work in the economy One key determinant of productivity growth is capital deepening supplying the economy s workforce with more and better tools For example as construction workers moved from working with shovels and pickaxes to working with cranes and earthmovers productivity growth in that sector naturally increased A key reason for the rapid deceleration of productivity growth in recent years has been a long period of weak private investment As labor markets normalize and begin putting upward pressure on wage growth there is strong reason to believe that firms will begin searching harder for ways to reduce upward labor cost pressure and will begin investing in labor saving capital and technology Figure D replicates a table from Bivens 2017 showing the relationship between lagged values of real compensation growth and private fixed investment It shows a strong positive relationship between the two The data below can be saved or copied directly into Excel The data underlying the figure Source Bureau of Economic Analysis BEA National Income and Product Accounts NIPA series Table 1 16 and unpublished data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Total Economy Productivity databaseCopy the code below to embed this chart on your website By taking up the last of any remaining demand slack an increase in infrastructure investment could have an immediate effect in restoring productivity growth to more normal levels More importantly there remains a strong economic rationale for investing in infrastructure even after the economy reaches and settles into full employment Much of the nation s capital stock is comprised of public capital Highways airports dams sewer systems and utilities are all necessary inputs for private production but they are largely supplied with public funds When the public capital stock is allowed to degrade through lack of investment this could in theory lead to slower private sector productivity growth Before delving into evidence assessing this effect however it is important to note that improving private sector productivity is just one reason to support expanded public investment If for example public investment had no impact at all on private sector productivity but allowed public goods to be delivered more efficiently there would be a benefit If we were to receive clean water and air safe food and medicine and transportation services for less money than we spend currently this would be a perfectly fine way to enjoy the economic returns to expanded public investment even if they do not boost private sector productivity Further the possibility that the benefits of public investment are more broadly shared than the benefits of private sector investment constitutes another compelling reason to support it While studies examining the link between inequality and public investment are few several methodologically sound papers have suggested that countries with larger public capital stocks tend to have greater equality of incomes see for example Calder n and Serv n 2004 This should not be a shock by its nature public capital is more broadly based in its ownership than private capital in the United States the wealthiest 1 percent of households own more than 40 percent of private wealth and so its benefits should be more broadly distributed Getachew 2008 Finally it should be remembered that many possible benefits of public investment may not show up as increases in cash incomes Clean water and air and shorter commute times provide clear economic benefits but these benefits do not generally show up in measurable cash incomes Serious research on the productivity of public investment was begun almost singlehandedly by David Aschauer in a series of papers in the late 1980s and early 1990s see Aschauer 1989 1990 for two of these The Aschauer findings were generally based on a time series estimation of public investment in the theoretical context of an aggregate production function model Aschauer 1989 estimated these aggregate production functions augmented with public capital stocks an innovation relative to much empirical growth literature and found that the elasticity of private sector output with respect to public capital was between 0 24 and 0 36 The implication of this finding was that the rate of return to public capital was roughly three times higher than that of private capital Aschauer s work was buttressed by that of Munnell 1990 1992 who would later become an undersecretary for the Treasury under President Clinton as well as by the work of Holtz Eakin 1988 and Lynde and Richmond 1992 1993 However the approach pioneered by Aschauer soon came under criticism from a variety of angles Critics of the time series component particularly Aaron 1990 and Gramlich 1994 argued that the link between public capital and productivity suffered from problems of both causality and simultaneity The causality criticism is that faster output growth may simply allow for stepped up investments in public capital rather than increased public investment driving faster output growth The simultaneity criticism is that neither public investment nor productivity is a stationary time series and therefore the simple regression of one upon the other may yield an apparent relationship that is in reality spurious That is maybe both series just happened to be rising over time and the correlation between the two simply reflected these contemporaneous trends without indicating an actual economic relationship between the series One suggested econometric fix for the problem of simultaneity is the transformation of the public capital and productivity data into first differences essentially looking at the year over year change in each series While this transformation does produce two stationary series and is hence a plausible statistical fix Munnell 1992 correctly points out that this fix does not allow one to examine long run relationships between public capital formation and productivity growth and that the economic hypothesis of the relationship between the two which is indeed a long run relationship hence cannot be tested if this particular statistical fix is adopted Given that most empirical growth studies are concerned exactly with such long run relationships this makes the first differencing fix fatal to the project of fairly assessing the impact of public capital investments on growth The simultaneity problem is most clearly addressed by Heintz 2010 who uses more advanced econometric techniques specifically a vector error correction model to search for a cointegrating relationship between the two series A cointegrating relationship exists between two nonstationary time series if some linear combination of them is stationary Heintz 2010 confirms that a cointegrating relationship does exist between public capital and private productivity and uses this relationship to estimate a statistically and economically significant long run relationship between public capital stocks and private productivity Heintz 2010 and Everaert and Heylen 2001 also point out that solving the simultaneity problem through error correction models largely solves the causality problem along the way Specifically Heintz allows for the level of public capital to affect both the level and the change in private output He finds a statistically significant relationship between the level of public capital and the change in private productivity If however the direction of causality actually ran from greater private productivity to larger public capital stocks then there should be no such relationship between the level of public capital and the change of productivity Table 2 shows regression results from replicating Heintz s 2010 methodology with more up to date data Data and methods are described in detail in the technical appendix The dependent variable is the ratio of private sector output to capital stock while the coefficient of interest is the lagged ratio of public to private capital For a timespan that mirrors Heintz s 1949 to 2007 we find a coefficient on infrastructure capital of 0 16 quite close to his 0 2 For the period from 1949 2015 i e including more recent years than were available to Heintz the coefficient is essentially the same 0 147 However the 1950s saw a more rapid pace of infrastructure investment than what came thereafter largely due to the construction of the interstate highway system To test whether or not the infrastructure productivity association is driven by this one time burst of spending we look only at the 1959 period Again the coefficient is essentially unchanged The coefficient values imply that a 10 percent increase in the public capital stock boosts private sector output by 1 5 2 percent To provide a more intuitive interpretation one can multiply this coefficient by the current ratio of private to public capital stocks to get the extra output obtained from each 1 increase in the public capital stock This also corresponds tightly to the rate of return to public investment that is often noted in the literature For the results from Table 2 this implied rate of return is very large hovering between 30 and 40 percent Notes The dependent variable is the change in private sector productivity measured as the ratio of private sector output to private sector capital stock Data and methods are discussed in the technical appendix T statistics are in brackets Three

the distribution of their findings focusing strictly on 33 studies they survey that generate estimates of the rate of return to public investment in the United States The results range from 19 percent to 73 percent The average rate of return is 16 7 percent and the median is 12 8 percent If one excludes the top three and bottom three estimates the average return drops slightly to 14 5 percent

examined by Bom and Ligthart 2014 is substantially larger than the gross rate of return used by CBO in its assessment of the macroeconomic effect of federal investment CBO 2016 Thus it seems that CBO estimates of the benefits of public investment particularly infrastructure investment are too low given the other evidence in this literature Finally another striking feature of these estimates are how consistently they tend to rise over time as more up to date data and research methods are used The studies are aligned on the horizontal axis chronologically and the pattern of more recent studies yielding higher estimated rates of return is clearly visible in the chart There is strong evidence that a period of increased infrastructure investment effort could provide large benefits to the American economy It could provide a fiscal expansion in an economy where aggregate demand growth has been stubbornly slow for years even in the face of prolonged expansionary monetary policy It could also aid the capital deepening that is necessary for boosting productivity growth especially during a period that has seen anemic private sector investment In any proposal to boost the nation s infrastructure investment there will be many details to work out but such details seem worth wrestling with given the large potential benefits at stake This paper was made possible by a grant from the

before the U S Congress He earned his Ph D from The New School for Social Research The large estimates of rates of return on public investment found by Aschauer 1989 were subsequently criticized on the grounds that they suffered from problems of simultaneity Essentially the argument was that the statistical relationship between public investment and output found by Aschauer 1989 was spurious driven only by the presence of nonstationarity in one or the other of the series A data series is nonstationary if its mean or other statistical properties change over various parts of the sample in this case if the mean or other statistical properties vary over time If a nonstationary series is used in regression analysis it can yield regression results that are spurious Heintz 2010 however notes that if both series public capital and output have a unit root in levels are nonstationary in the same way but are stationary in growth rates then an error correction model can be used to undertake regression analysis and the simultaneity problem can be dealt with For his output measures he uses private sector GDP and for public capital he uses a measure of core infrastructure essentially in line with how we define it in Figure A He regresses the change in the ratio of output to private capital on lagged values of the dependent variable the private capital stock the labor force and the infrastructure capital stock as well as changes in private and infrastructure capital stocks and the labor force Table A1 confirms that each of the data series has a unit root in levels but is stationary in first differences For each series the hypothesis of a unit root cannot be rejected in levels but it can be rejected at the 5 or 1 percent level of significance for the first differences Given this confirmation we can employ the Heintz 2010 error correction model Notes T statistics are reported with p values in parentheses Three asterisks denote significance at the 1

be noted that these are multipliers that hold when monetary policymakers accommodate the fiscal expansion If monetary policymakers instead engage in contractionary measures to offset any fiscal expansion the best estimate of these or any other multiplier is zero 3 Because this is commonly misunderstood it is important to realize that a multiplier of 1 does not mean that stimulus has somehow

could improve our mental and physical health and even mitigate climate change research showsAnna ThomasAnna Thomas co ordinates the Campaign for a Shorter Working WeekMon 9 Nov 2015 02 15 EST Last modified on Wed 20 Sep 2017 14 39 EDTI worked 100 hour plus weeks as a hospital doctor in the early 1990s Those dangerous rotas left me low and unable to string a sentence together let alone give sick people what they needed Doctors crazy hours were reduced but it seems they may be returning with the new junior doctors contract Meanwhile David Cameron will head to Brussels for EU negotiations planning to insist that UK workers should continue to be able to opt out of the 48 hour maximum working week Long working hours are on the agenda But what about tackling the issue at its roots What if everyone had a shorter working week We would be healthier and happier and society would be less unequal and more sustainable It has probably never entered the heads of most economists that hours could be shortened and output maintainedA top public health doctor recently said that long working hours was a big cause of mental ill health and a big 2015 study linked long working hours with an increased risk of stroke and heart disease Less time at work would mean more time to care for children and family be a school governor look in on elderly neighbours or organise a game of football It would mean more time to create the community spiderweb of connections and favours and reciprocation that keeps the world going round More than 6 million of us in Britain work more than 45 hours a week while 1 85 million of us are unemployed While it would need to happen gradually alongside some reskilling and training a shorter working week for all would mean fairer distribution of available work It would reduce the number of people working far too many hours and also the number with no work at all For people on lower incomes it would have to go hand in hand with a living wage something that Britain now agrees on across the political spectrum For higher earners it would fulfil pent up demand in London for example only 3 of jobs with average or higher salary levels are advertised as part time according to Timewise Foundation It would help with gender equality too as men would have more time to look after the kids and the house About 85 of in work British men work more than 30 hours a week but only 57 of in work women Shorter hours could also help mitigate climate change According to a report from the US Center for Economic and Policy Research reduced greenhouse gas emissions go hand in hand with shorter working hours for a variety of factors including lower levels of consumption With all these benefits cutting the working week should be at the top of every politician s agenda But it bumps up against some big prejudices Would the economy fall apart How would our open all hours society function And wouldn t we turn into a nation of couch potatoes The quick answer to all this is to look at other countries People in the Netherlands work five hours a week less than in Britain according to the OECD and in Germany six hours less The Dutch and German economies are doing fine and the Dutch people are better known for their love of cycling than their inability to part from their sofas Productivity output per working hour improves with shorter hours Across the world s richest countries higher productivity correlates with lower working hours see also OECD data Ford s original workers were found less productive working more than 40 hours a week a situation likely to be even more the case for people who work with knowledge rather manually who ever had their best ideas when they were exhausted All this means that we may well be able to work a shorter week and get just as much done The 20th century British economist John Hicks said It has probably never entered the heads of most economists that hours could be shortened and output maintained It is true that some workplaces such as restaurants and hospitals for example would not be able to run nine to five Monday to Thursday Tackling this is simply a management issue and the result would be a better sharing of available work Perhaps the biggest obstacle is cultural rooted in the Lutheran work ethic and our self valuation according to how hard we strive It is challenging to tackle such deep rooted social and personal norms But given how exhausted many of us are by the end of the week and how welcome the idea of more time caring for our loved ones our communities and ourselves the side of life that cannot be made more productive it seems like a challenge worth taking on A shorter working week is being tried in Sweden where some care homes and hospitals are experimenting with a six hour day and in companies such as Serps Invaders an Edinburgh digital marketing company where all staff work four days a week and can also work remotely and take a day s leave without notice It s not a new idea John Maynard Keynes predicted in the 1930s that by about now we would all be working a mere 15 hours a week It s about time we got on with it If you re seeing this message it means we re having trouble

is massive disruption of jobs experts say a wider array of education and skills building programs will be created to meet new demands There are two uncertainties Will well prepared workers be able to keep up in the race with AI tools And will market capitalism survive By Lee Rainie and Janna AndersonMachines are eating humans jobs talents And it s not just about jobs that are repetitive and low skill Automation robotics algorithms and artificial intelligence AI in recent times have shown they can do equal or sometimes even better work than humans who are dermatologists insurance claims adjusters lawyers seismic testers in oil fields sports journalists and financial reporters crew members on guided missile destroyers hiring managers psychological testers retail salespeople and border patrol agents Moreover there is growing anxiety that technology developments on the near horizon will crush the jobs of the millions who drive cars and trucks analyze medical tests and data perform middle management chores dispense medicine trade stocks and evaluate markets fight on battlefields perform government functions and even replace those who program software that is the creators of algorithms People will create the jobs of the future not simply train for them and technology is already central It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead Jonathan GrudinMultiple studies have documented that massive numbers of jobs are at risk as programmed devices many of them smart autonomous systems continue their march into workplaces A recent study by labor economists found that one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment to population ratio by about 0 18 0 34 percentage points and wages by 0 25 0 5 percent When Pew Research Center and Elon University s Imagining the Internet Center asked experts in 2014 whether AI and robotics would create more jobs than they would destroy the verdict was evenly split 48 of the respondents envisioned a future where more jobs are lost than created while 52 said more jobs would be created than lost Since that expert canvassing the future of jobs has been at the top of the agenda at many major conferences globally Several policy and market based solutions have been promoted to address the loss of employment and wages forecast by technologists and economists A key idea emerging from many conversations including one of the lynchpin discussions at the World Economic Forum in 2016 is that changes in educational and learning environments are necessary to help people stay employable in the labor force of the future Among the six overall findings in a new 184 page report from the National Academies of Sciences the experts recommended The education system will need to adapt to prepare individuals for the changing labor market At the same time recent IT advances offer new and potentially more widely accessible ways to access education Jobholders themselves have internalized this insight A 2016 Pew Research Center survey The State of American Jobs found that 87 of workers believe it will be essential for them to get training and develop new job skills throughout their work life in order to keep up with changes in the workplace This survey noted that employment is much higher among jobs that require an average or above average level of preparation including education experience and job training average or above average interpersonal management and communication skills and higher levels of analytical skills such as critical thinking and computer skills A central question about the future then is whether formal and informal learning structures will evolve to meet the changing needs of people who wish to fulfill the workplace expectations of the future Pew Research Center and Elon s Imagining the Internet Center conducted a large scale canvassing of technologists scholars practitioners strategic thinkers and education leaders in the summer of 2016 asking them to weigh in on the likely future of workplace training Some 1 408 responded to the following question sharing their expectations about what is likely to evolve by 2026 In the next 10 years do you think we will see the emergence of new educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers in the skills they will need to perform the jobs of the future The nonscientific canvassing found that 70 of these particular respondents said yes such programs would emerge and be successful A majority among the 30 who said no generally do not believe adaptation in teaching environments will be sufficient to teach new skills at the scale that is necessary to help workers keep abreast of the tech changes that will upend millions of jobs See About this canvassing of experts for further details about the limits of this sample Participants were asked to explain their answers and offered the following prompts to consider Several common expectations were evident in these respondents answers no matter how hopeful or fretful they were about the future of skills and capabilities training efforts It is important to note that many respondents listed human behaviors attributes and competencies in describing desirable work skills Although these aspects of psychology cannot be classified as skills and perhaps cannot be directly taught in any sort of training environment we include these answers under the general heading of skills capabilities and attributes A diversifying education and credentialing ecosystem Most of these experts expect the education marketplace especially online learning platforms to continue to change in an effort to accommodate the widespread needs Some predict employers will step up their own efforts to train and retrain workers Many foresee a significant number of self teaching efforts by jobholders themselves as they take advantage of proliferating online opportunities Respondents see a new education and training ecosystem emerging in which some job preparation functions are performed by formal educational institutions in fairly traditional classroom settings some elements are offered online some are created by for profit firms some are free some exploit augmented and virtual reality elements and gaming sensibilities and a lot of real time learning takes place in formats that job seekers pursue on their own A considerable number of respondents to this canvassing focused on the likelihood that the best education programs will teach people how to be lifelong learners Accordingly some say alternative credentialing mechanisms will arise to assess and vouch for the skills people acquire along the way A focus on nurturing unique human skills that artificial intelligence AI and machines seem unable to replicate Many of these experts discussed in their responses the human talents they believe machines and automation may not be able to duplicate noting that these should be the skills developed and nurtured by education and training programs to prepare people to work successfully alongside AI These respondents suggest that workers of the future will learn to deeply cultivate and exploit creativity collaborative activity abstract and systems thinking complex communication and the ability to thrive in diverse environments One such comment came from Simon Gottschalk a professor in the department of sociology at the University of Nevada Las Vegas The skills necessary at the higher echelons will include especially the ability to efficiently network manage public relations display intercultural sensitivity marketing and generally what author Dan Goleman would call social and emotional intelligence This also includes creativity and just enough critical thinking to move outside the box Another example is the response of Fredric Litto a professor emeritus of communications and longtime distance learning expert from the University of S o Paulo We are now in the transitional stage of employers gradually reducing their prejudice in the hiring of those who studied at a distance and moving in favor of such graduates who in the workplace demonstrate greater proactiveness initiative discipline collaborativeness because they studied online Other respondents mentioned traits including leadership design thinking human meta communication deliberation conflict resolution and the capacity to motivate mobilize and innovate Still others spoke of more practical needs that could help workers in the medium term to work with data and algorithms to implement 3 D modeling and work with 3 D printers or to implement the newly emerging capabilities in artificial intelligence and augmented and virtual reality Jonathan Grudin principal researcher at Microsoft commented People will create the jobs of the future not simply train for them and technology is already central It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead Seriously You re asking about the workforce of the future As if there s going to be one Anonymous scientific editorAbout a third of respondents expressed no confidence in training and education evolving quickly enough to match demands by 2026 Some of the bleakest answers came from some of the most respected technology analysts For instance Jason Hong an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University wrote There are two major components needed for a new kind of training program at this scale political will and a proven technology platform Even assuming that the political will and budget existed there s no platform today that can successfully train large numbers of people MOOCs Massive Open Online Courses have a high dropout rate and have serious questions about quality of instruction They are also struggling with basic issues like identification of individuals taking the courses So in short we can train small numbers of individuals tens of thousands per year using today s community colleges and university systems but probably not more Several respondents argued that job training is not a primary concern at a time when accelerating change in market economies is creating massive economic divides that seem likely to leave many people behind An anonymous scientific editor commented Seriously You re asking about the workforce of the future As if there s going to be one Employers either run sweatshops abroad or hire people in the first world to do jobs that they hate while more and more unskilled and skilled people end up permanently on welfare or zero hour contracts And the relatively job secure qualified people who work in the professions are probably a lot closer than they think they are to going over that same cliff The details of how they earn their credentials aren t going to be an issue Most participants in this canvassing wrote detailed elaborations explaining their positions though they were allowed to respond anonymously Their well considered comments provide insights about hopeful and concerning trends These findings do not represent all possible points of view but they do reveal a wide range of striking observations Respondents collectively articulated five major themes that are introduced and briefly explained in the 29 page section below and then expanded upon in more detailed sections Some responses are lightly edited for style or due to length The following section presents a brief overview of the most evident themes extracted from the written responses including a small selection of representative quotes supporting each point Some responses are lightly edited for style or due to length These experts envision that the next decade will bring a more widely diversified world of education and training options in which various entities design and deliver different services to those who seek to learn They expect that some innovation will be aimed at emphasizing the development of human talents that machines cannot match and at helping humans partner with technology They say some parts of the ecosystem will concentrate on delivering real time learning to workers often in formats that are self taught Commonly occurring ideas among the responses in this category are collected below under headings reflecting subthemes Most experts seem to have faith that rapid technological development and a rising wariness of coming impacts of the AI robotics revolution are going to spur the public private and governmental actions needed for education and training systems to be adapted to deliver more flexible open adaptable resilient certifiable and useful lifelong learning Educators have always found new ways of training the next generation of students for the jobs of the future and this generation will be no different Justin ReichJim Hendler a professor of computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute predicted The nature of education will change to a mix of models College education which will still favor multi year residential education will need to be more focused on teaching students to be lifelong learners followed by more online content in situ training and other such elements to increase skills in a rapidly changing information world As automation puts increasing numbers of low and middle skill workers out of work these models will also provide for certifications and training needs to function in an increasingly automated service sector Michael Wollowski an associate professor of computer science at the Rose Hulman Institute of Technology commented We will definitely see a vast increase in educational and training programs We will also see what might be called on demand or on the job kind of training programs We kind of have to as with continued automation we will need to retrain a large portion of the workforce I strongly believe employers will subscribe to this idea wholeheartedly it increases the overall education of their workforce which benefits their bottom line Nevertheless I am a big believer in the college experience which I see as a way to learn what you are all about as a person and in your field of study The confidence in your own self and your abilities cannot be learned in a short course It takes life experience or four years at a tough college At a good college you are challenged to be your best this is very resource intensive and cannot be scaled at this time Justin Reich executive director at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT Teaching Systems Lab observed Educators have always found new ways of training the next generation of students for the jobs of the future and this generation will be no different Our established systems of job training primarily community colleges and state universities will continue to play a crucial role though catastrophically declining public support for these institutions will raise serious challenges David Karger a professor of computer science at MIT wrote Most of what we now call online learning is little more than glorified textbooks but the future is very promising No matter how good our online teaching systems become the current four year college model will remain dominant for quite some time Online teaching will increase the reach of the top universities which will put pressure on lesser universities to demonstrate value One potential future would be for those universities to abandon the idea that they have faculty teaching their own courses and instead consist entirely of a cadre of less well paid teaching assistants who provide support for the students who are taking courses online A few respondents said already established institutions cannot be as fully successful as new initiatives Jerry Michalski founder at REX commented Today s educational and training institutions are a shambles They take too long to teach impractical skills and knowledge not connected to the real world and when they try to tackle critical thinking for a longer time scale they mostly fail The sprouts of the next generation of learning tools are already visible Within the decade the new shoots will overtake the wilting vines and we will see all sorts of new initiatives mostly outside these schooling academic and training institutions which are mostly beyond repair People will shift to them because they work because they are far less expensive and because they are always available Barry Chudakov founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp says education has been liberated because thanks to digital innovation everyone can embed learning continuously in their everyday lives He wrote The key to education in the next 10 years will be the understanding that we now live in a world without walls and so the walls of the school physical and conceptual need to shatter and never go up again In the hopefully near future we will not segregate schooling from work and real world thinking and development They will seamlessly weave into a braid of learning realization exposure hands on experience and integration into students own lives And again the experience of being a student now confined to grade school secondary school and university will expand to include workers those looking for work and those who want or need to retrain as well as what we now think of as conventional education One way we will break down these walls we are already doing so will be to create digital learning spaces to rival classrooms as places where learning happen s Via simulation gaming digital presentations combined with hands on real world experience learning and re education will move out of books and into the world The more likely enhancement will be to take digital enhancements out into the world again breaking down the walls of the classroom and school to inform and enhance experience An anonymous respondent echoed the sentiment of quite a few others who do not think it is possible to advance and enhance online education and training much in the next decade writing These programs have a cost and too few are willing to sacrifice for these programs More such arguments are included in later sections of this report Some respondents expressed confidence in the best of current online education and training options saying online course options are cost effective evolving for the better and game changing because they are globally accessible Those with the most optimism expect great progress will be made in augmented reality AR virtual reality VR and AI While some say 2026 will still be early days for this tech many are excited about its prospects for enhancing learning in the next decade Already today there are quite effective online training and education systems but they are not being implemented to their full potential Edward FriedmanEdward Friedman professor emeritus of technology management at the Stevens Institute of Technology wrote Already today there are quite effective online training and education systems but they are not being implemented to their full potential These applications will become more widely used with familiarity that is gained during the next decade Also populations will be more tech savvy and be able to make use of these systems with greater personal ease In addition the development of virtual reality AI assistants and other technological advances will add to the effectiveness of these systems There will be a greater need for such systems as the needs for new expertise in the workforce increase and the capacity of traditional education systems proves that it is not capable of meeting the need in a cost effective manner The president of a technology LLC wrote Training teaching are all going online partly because of high costs of campus education Richard Adler distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future predicted AI voice response telepresence VR and gamification techniques will come together to create powerful new learning environments capable of personalizing and accelerating learning across a broad range of fields Ray Schroeder associate vice chancellor for online learning at the University of Illinois Springfield commented It is projected that those entering the workforce today will pursue four or five different careers not just jobs over their lifetime These career changes will require retooling training and education The adult learners will not be able to visit physical campuses to access this learning they will learn online I expect that we will see the further development of artificially intelligent teaching specialists such as Jill Watson at Georgia Tech the virtual graduate assistant who was thought to be human by an entire class of computer science students I anticipate the further development and distribution of holoportation technologies such as those developed by Microsoft using HoloLens for real time three dimensional augmented reality These teaching tools will enable highly sophisticated interactions and engagement with students at a distance They will further fuel the scaling of learning to reach even more massive online classes Fredric Litto an professor emeritus of communications and longtime distance learning expert from the University of S o Paulo replied There is no field of work that cannot be learned totally or in great part in well organized and administered online programs either in traditional course formats or in self directed independent learning opportunities supplemented when appropriate by face to face hands on practice situations Tawny Schlieski research director at Intel and president of the Oregon Story Board explained New technologies of human computer interaction like augmented and virtual reality offer the possibility of entirely new mechanisms of education Augmented and virtual reality tools make learning more experiential they engage students with physical movement and they enable interactive and responsive instructional assets As these tools evolve over the next decade the academics we work with expect to see radical change in training and workforce development which will roll into although probably against a longer timeline more traditional institutions of higher learning Many respondents said real world campus based higher education will continue to thrive during the next decade They generally expect that no other educational experience can match residential universities capabilities for fully immersive person to person learning as well as mentoring and socializing functions before 2026 They said a residential university education helps build intangible skills that are not replicable online and thus deepens the skills base of those who can afford to pay for such an education but they expect that job specific training will be managed by employers on the job and via novel approaches Some say major universities core online course content developed with all of the new tech bells and whistles will be marketed globally and adopted as baseline learning in smaller higher education locales where online elements from major MOOCs can be optimally paired in hybrid learning with in person mentoring activities The most important skills to have in life are gained through interpersonal experiences and the liberal arts Human bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion empathy vulnerability and social emotional intelligence Frank ElavskyUta Russmann communications marketing sales professor at the FHWien University of Applied Sciences in Vienna Austria said In the future more and more jobs will require highly sophisticated people whose skills cannot be trained in mass online programs Traditional four year and graduate programs will better prepare people for jobs in the future as such an education gives people a general understanding and knowledge about their field and here people learn how to approach new things ask questions and find answers deal with new situations etc all this is needed to adjust to ongoing changes in work life Special skills for a particular job will be learned on the job Frank Elavsky data and policy analyst at Acumen LLC responded The most important skills to have in life are gained through interpersonal experiences and the liberal arts Human bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion empathy vulnerability and social emotional intelligence These skills are imperative to focus on as the future is in danger of losing these skillsets from the workforce Many people have gained these skills throughout history without any kind of formal schooling but with the growing emphasis on virtual and digital mediums of production education and commerce people will have less and less exposure to other humans in person and other human perspectives Isto Huvila professor at Uppsala University replied The difference between educating to perform and educating to make the future is the difference between vocational education and higher university education Spending four years at a university is not only about learning skills but about bildung self cultivation and socialising in a group that is capable of fostering collaboration much better than an ad hoc group of people But this does not mean that alternative means and paths of learning and accreditation would not be useful as complementary to the traditional system that has limitations as well Dana Klisanin psychologist futurist at Evolutionary Guidance Media R D wrote Educational institutions that succeed will use the tools of social media and game design to grant students access to teachers from all over the world and increase their motivation to succeed Online educational programs will influence the credentialing systems of traditional institutions and online institutions will increasingly offer meet ups and mingles such that a true hybrid educational approach emerges Will training for skills most important in the jobs of the future work well in large scale settings by 2026 Respondents in this canvassing overwhelmingly said yes anticipating that improvements in such education would continue However many believe the most vital skills are not easy to teach learn or evaluate in any education or training setting available today Dozens of descriptive terms were applied by respondents as they noted the skills capabilities and attributes they see as important in workers lives in the next decade The skills needed to succeed in today s world and the future are curiosity creativity taking initiative multi disciplinary thinking and empathy These skills interestingly are the skills specific to human beings that machines and robots cannot do Tiffany ShlainWhile coding and other hard skills were listed as being easiest to teach to a large group in an online setting soft human skills were seen by most respondents as crucial for survival in the age of AI and robotics Devin Fidler research director at the Institute for the Future predicted As basic automation and machine learning move toward becoming commodities uniquely human skills will become more valuable There will be an increasing economic incentive to develop mass training that better unlocks this value Susan Price a digital architect at Continuum Analytics commented Increasingly machines will perform tasks they are better suited to perform than humans such as computation data analysis and logic Functions requiring emotional intelligence empathy compassion and creative judgment and discernment will expand and be increasingly valued in our culture Tiffany Shlain filmmaker and founder of the Webby Awards wrote The skills needed to succeed in today s world and the future are curiosity creativity taking initiative multi disciplinary thinking and empathy These skills interestingly are the skills specific to human beings that machines and robots cannot do and you can be taught to strengthen these skills through education I look forward to seeing innovative live and online programs that can teach these at scale Ben Shneiderman professor of computer science at the University of Maryland observed Students can be trained to be more innovative creative and active initiators of novel ideas Skills of writing speaking and making videos are important but fundamental skills of critical thinking community building teamwork deliberation dialogue and conflict resolution will be powerful A mindset of persistence and the necessary passion to succeed are also critical Louisa Heinrich founder at Superhuman Limited commented Lateral and system thinking skills are increasingly critical for success in an ever changing global landscape and these will need to be re prioritised at all levels of education An anonymous technologist commented Programming and problem solving learning how to work with artificial intelligence and robotics will become more important and more and more workers will be replaced by software hardware based workers Automation will reduce the need for the current workforce and the divide between the upper class and the lower class will continue to eat the middle class Some who are pessimistic about the future of human work due to advances in capable AI and robotics mocked the current push in the U S to train more people in technical skills An anonymous respondent commented Teach a billion people to program and you ll end up with 900 000 000 unemployed programmers An anonymous program director for a major U S technology funding organization predicted We will see training for the jobs of the past and for service jobs The jobs of the future will not need large numbers of workers with a fixed set of skills most things that we can train large numbers of workers for we will also be able to train computers to do better Among the many other skills mentioned were process oriented and system oriented thinking journalistic skills including research evaluation of multiple sources writing and speaking understanding algorithms computational thinking networking and programming grasping law and policy an evidence based way of looking at the world time management conflict resolution decision making locating information in the flood of data storytelling using data and influencing and consensus building A few people mentioned that young adults need to be taught how to have face to face interaction including one who said they seem to be sorely lacking in these skills and can only interact with a cellphone or laptop Because so many intricacies of the workplace the human soft and hard are learned on the job respondents said they expect apprenticeships and forms of mentoring will regain value and evolve along with the 21st century workplace D Yvette Wohn assistant professor of information systems at the New Jersey Institute of Technology wrote Formalized apprenticeships that require both technical skills and interpersonal interaction will become more important Ian O Byrne an assistant professor of literacy education at the College of Charleston replied In the future we ll see more opportunities for online personalized learning This will include open online learning experiences e g MOOCs where individuals can lurk and build up capacity or quench interests I also believe that we ll see a rise in the offering of premium or pay content that creates a space where one to one learning and interaction will allow mentors to guide learners while providing critical feedback We will identify opportunities to build a digital version of the apprenticeship learning models that have existed in the past Alternative credentials and digital badges will provide more granular opportunities to document and archive learning over time from traditional and nontraditional learning sources Through evolving technologies e g blockchain this may provide opportunities for learners to document and frame their own learning pathways An instructional designer with 19 years of experience commented The pattern I m seeing is toward individualized learning almost on the level of tutoring or apprenticeship We ve seen again and again that the broader the audience focus the less the course seems to deliver As for what the skills of the future are they ll be specialized to their fields with a university degree assumed to be a certificate in the ability to learn more about a particular subject specialty You may get a degree in computer software development but the truth is that you still need to be taught how to write software for say the mortgage company or insurance company that hires you The key to the future will be flexibility and personal motivation to learn and tinker with new things As they anticipate the appearance of effective new learning environments and advances in digital accountability systems many of these experts believe fresh certification programs will be created to attest to workers participation in training programs and the mastery of skills Some predict that many more workers will begin using online and app based learning systems Charlie Firestone communications and society program executive director and vice president at The Aspen Institute replied There will be a move toward more precise and better credentialing for skills and competencies e g badging and similar techniques Employers will accept these more as they prove probative And online learning will be more prevalent even as an adjunct to formal classroom learning New industries such as green energy and telemedicine will increase new employment opportunities Despite all of these measures the loss of jobs from artificial intelligence and robotics will exceed any retraining program at least in the short run Sam Punnett research officer at TableRock Media wrote I suspect employers will recognize the new credentialing systems Particularly those certificates awarded for studies in emerging disciplines currently data science appears all the rage and those that reflect an upgrade of previously acquired skills Traditional credentials will continue to hold value but I believe they will be considered in light of a candidates perceived ability in learning how to learn The four year degree and subsequent graduate studies will continue to be less of a guaranty towards employment without work experience Certificates are being viewed more favourably and many universities are lagging in their connection between their pedagogies and working world requirements William J Ward a university communications professor DR4WARD commented Higher Education is doing a poor job of preparing students with the skills they need to succeed in the workforce Online and credentialing systems are more transparent and do a better job on delivering skills People with new types of credentialing systems are seen as more qualified than traditional four year and graduate programs Many workplaces place a higher value on real world work portfolios than they do on a degree or certification yet their hiring systems including AI bots programmed to scan resum s still use the commonly accepted credentials as a basis for interviewing candidates Some respondents hope to see change Schools today turn out widget makers who can make widgets all the same They are built on producing single right answers rather than creative solutions Jeff JarvisA software engineering and system administration professional commented The reliability of the traditional educational system is already being questioned in some fields it s considered common sense that certifications and degrees mean little and that a portfolio references and hands on interviews are much more important for assessing a candidate s ability The unfortunate reality is that many HR departments still post job listings saying degrees and certifications are required as a way of screening candidates Both of those cost a lot of money and neither mean a lot for a candidate s competence I hope this will change both job listings and quality of degrees certifications but don t see it happening soon Meryl Krieger career specialist at Indiana University Bloomington s Jacobs School replied Credentialing systems will involve portfolios as much as resum s resum s simply are too two dimensional to properly communicate someone s skillset Three dimensional materials in essence job reels that demonstrate expertise will be the ultimate demonstration of an individual worker s skills I see credentialing as a piece of a very complex set of criteria these will also incorporate an individual s ability to communicate and work with teams huge in employer requests for new employees which can more readily be documented and tracked through online portfolio tools than through traditional resume formats Thus the educational and training programs of the future will become in their best incarnations sophisticated combinations of classroom and hands on training programs The specific models will necessarily be responding to individual industry requirements Jeff Jarvis a professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism wrote Schools today turn out widget makers who can make widgets all the same They are built on producing single right answers rather than creative solutions They are built on an outmoded attention economy Pay us for 45 hours of your attention and we will certify your knowledge I believe that many not all areas of instruction should shift to competency based education in which the outcomes needed are made clear and students are given multiple paths to achieve those outcomes and they are certified not based on tests and grades but instead on portfolios of their work demonstrating their knowledge While the first three themes found among the responses to this canvassing were mostly hopeful about advances in education and training for 21st century jobs a large share of responses from top experts reflect a significant degree of pessimism for various reasons Some even say the future of jobs for humans is so baleful that capitalism may fail as an economic system The next themes and subthemes examine these responses A large share of respondents predicted that online formats for knowledge transfer will not advance significantly in the next decade The 30 who expressed pessimism were often deeply doubtful about the capabilities of current education systems to adapt to pivot to respond to new challenges as quickly as necessary Interestingly being able to adapt and respond to looming challenges was seen by nearly everyone in this canvassing as one of the most highly prized future capabilities these respondents especially agree that it is important and they say that our human institutions government business education are not adapting efficiently and are letting us down Many of them say that current K 12 or K 16 education programs are incapable of making adjustments within the next decade to serve the shifting needs of future jobs markets Among the other reasons listed by people who do not expect these kinds of transformative advances in job creation and job skill upgrading Some among the 70 of respondents who are mostly optimistic about the future of training for jobs also echoed one or more of the points above mentioning these tension points while hoping for the best Following are representative statements tied to these points and more from all respondents Thomas Claburn editor at large at Information Week wrote I m skeptical that educational and training programs can keep pace with technology Traditional models train people to equate what they do with who they are i e what do you want to be when you grow up rather than to acquire critical thinking and flexible skills and attitudes that fit a rapidly changing world Pamela RutledgeAndrew Walls managing vice president at Gartner wrote Barring a neuroscience advance that enables us to embed knowledge and skills directly into brain tissue and muscle formation there will be no quantum leap in our ability to up skill people Learning takes time and practice which means it requires money lots of money to significantly change the skill set of a large cohort B Remy Cross assistant professor of sociology Webster University commented Lacking a significant breakthrough in machine learning that could lead to further breakthroughs in adaptive responses by a fully online system it is too hard to adequately instruct large numbers of people in the kinds of soft skills that are anticipated as being in most demand As manufacturing and many labor intensive jobs move overseas or are fully mechanized we will see a bulge in service jobs These require good people skills something that is often hard to train online John Bell software developer and teacher at Dartmouth College replied Even today access to information is not the limiting factor in skills education for anyone who can go online While there have been generational gains in the developments of online communities a large scale educational experience either MOOC or on demand broadcasts will not be able to duplicate that Stowe Boyd managing director of Another Voice and a well known thinker on work futures discussed the intangibles of preparing humans to partner with AI and bot systems While we may see the creation and rollout of new training programs he observed it s unclear whether they will be able to retrain those displaced from traditional sorts of work to fit into the workforce of the near future Many of the skills that will be needed are more like personality characteristics like curiosity or social skills that require enculturation to take hold Individual training like programming or learning how to cook may not be what will be needed And employers may play less of a role especially as AI and bot augmented independent contracting may be the best path for many rather than a job Homesteading in exurbia may be the answer for many with forty acres and a bot as a political campaign slogan of 2024 Luis Miron a distinguished university professor and director of the Institute for Quality and Equity in Education at Loyola University in New Orleans wrote Bluntly speaking I have little confidence in the educational sector K 16 having the capacity and vision to offer high quality online educational programs capable of transforming the training needs of the wider society The most important skills are advanced critical thinking and knowledge of globalization affecting diverse societies culturally religiously and politically Pamela Rutledge director of the Media Psychology Research Center wrote The core assumptions driving educational content are not adapting as fast as the world is changing Traditional models train people to equate what they do with who they are i e what do you want to be when you grow up rather than to acquire critical thinking and flexible skills and attitudes that fit a rapidly changing world We have traditional institutions invested in learning as a supply side model rather than demand side that would create proactive self directed learners This bias impacts the entire process from educators to employers It is changing but beliefs are sticky and institutions are cumbersome bureaucracies that are slow to adapt New delivery systems for skills related to technology will be more readily accepted than traditional ones because they avoid much of the embedded bias Successful education models will begin developing mixed methods to leverage technology with traditional delivery and rewrite certification processes with practice relevant standards Justin Reich executive director at the MIT Teaching Systems Lab observed There will continue to be for profit actors in the sector and while some may offer choice and opportunity for students many others will be exploitative with a great er focus on extracting federal grants and burdening students with debt than actually educating students and creating new opportunities John Paine a business analyst commented The competing desires 1 to make educational activity available to all and 2 to monetize the bejeezus out of anything related to the internet will limit the effectiveness of any online learning systems in a more widespread context danah boyd founder of Data Society commented I have complete faith in the ability to identify job gaps and develop educational tools to address those gaps I have zero confidence in us having the political will to address the socio economic factors that are underpinning skill training For example companies won t pay for reskilling and we don t have the political power to tax them at the level needed for public investment in reskilling Furthermore we have serious geographic mismatches underlying discriminatory attitudes and limited opportunities for lower to mid level career advancement What s at stake are not simply skills gaps it s about how we want to architect labor benefits and social safety nets And right now we talk about needing to increase skills but that s not what employers care about It just sounds nice When computer science graduates from CUNY and Howard University can t get a job what s at stake is not skills training Among the future worker capabilities with the highest value in these respondents eyes are the ability to adapt or pivot and the motivation to up skill as needed Many respondents emphasized that the most crucial skill is that people have to learn how to learn and be self motivated to keep learning My biggest concern with self directed learning is that it requires a great deal of internal motivation And I am not confident that individuals will find their way David BersteinDavid Bernstein a former research director wrote The most important skills needed to succeed in the workplace will be flexibility and the ability to adapt and continuously learn My biggest concern with self directed learning is that it requires a great deal of internal motivation And I am not confident that individuals will find their way just as those who enter college today don t know what they want to be when they grow up often until after they graduate So everyone will still need some basic skills interpersonal communications basic arithmetic along with some general culture awareness so they can have that flexibility Any 3 year old can use their parent s smartphone or tablet without reading the manual What I worry about is how well they will adapt when they are 35 or 55 Calton Pu professor and junior chair in software at the Georgia Institute of Technology wrote The most important skill is a meta skill the ability to adapt to changes This ability to adapt is what distinguished Homo sapiens from other species through natural selection As the rate of technological innovation intensifies the workforce of the future will need to adapt to new technology and new markets The people who can adapt the best and fastest will win This view means that any given set of skills will become obsolete quickly as innovations change the various economic sectors precision agriculture manufacturing 4 0 precision medicine just to name a few Therefore the challenge is not only to teach skills but also how to adapt and learn new skills Whether the traditional programs or new programs will be better at teaching adaptive learning remains to be seen Cory Salveson learning systems and analytics lead at RSM US responded The nature of work today and in future is such that if people want to keep increasingly scarce well paying jobs they will need to educate themselves in an ongoing manner for their whole lives Some of these experts say those who aren t motivated to continue to learn and grow will be left behind Scott Amyx CEO of Amyx said online training is advancing and will continue to evolve but The education system is at an inflection point Many ambitious federal and state programs have fizzled to produce dismal to no statistical change in the caliber of K 12 education It s those less educated and less skilled who are most sensitive to technological displacement Online mediums and self directed approaches may be limited in effectiveness with certain labor segments unless supplemented by human coaching and support systems Beth Corzo Duchardt a professor at Muhlenberg College replied Self directed study is a variable that changes the alchemy of teaching and learning It is true that most online courses require self direction Indeed when I advise students I don t recommend that students take online courses unless they have demonstrated an aptitude for self direction But in person courses may also be self directed This works well for some students but not others Students who are self directed often have had a very good foundational education and supportive parents They have been taught to think critically and they know that the most important thing you can learn is how to learn And they are also are more likely to come from economic privilege So not only does the self direction factor pose a problem for teaching at scale the fact that a high degree of self direction may be required for successful completion of coursework towards the new workforce means that existing structures of inequality will be replicated in the future if we rely on these large scale programs Among the 30 of respondents who said they did not think things would turn out well in the future were those who said the trajectory of technology will overwhelm labor markets killing more jobs than it creates They foresee a society where AI programs and machines do most of the work and raise questions about people s sense of identity the socio economic divisions that already distress them their ability to pay for basic needs their ability to use the growing amount of leisure time constructively and the impact of all of this on economic systems It should also be noted that many among the 70 who expect positive change in the next decade also expressed some of these concerns The problem of future jobs is not one of skills training it is one of diminishing jobs How will we cope with a workforce that is simply irrelevant Jennifer ZickermanCory Doctorow activist in residence at MIT Media Lab and co owner of Boing Boing boingboing net responded It s an article of faith that automation begets more jobs than it displaces in the long run but this is a theory free observation based on previous automation booms The current automation is based on general purpose technologies machine learning Turing complete computers a universal network architecture that is equally optimized for all applications and there s good reason to believe that this will be more disruptive and create fewer new jobs than those that came before Glenn Ricart Internet Hall of Fame member and founder and chief technology officer of US Ignite said Up to the present time automation largely has been replacing physical drudgery and repetitive motion things that can and should improve the quality of people s work lives But in the next decade or two there is likely to be a significant amount of technological innovation in machine intelligence and personal assistants that takes a real swipe out of the jobs we want humans to have in education health care transportation agriculture and public safety What are the new jobs we want these people to have If we haven t been able to invent them in response to international trade pacts why are we sure we will be able to create them in the future Richard Stallman Internet Hall of Fame member and president of the Free Software Foundation commented I think this question has no answer I think there won t be jobs for most people a few decades from now and that s what really matters As for the skills for the employed fraction of advanced countries I think they will be difficult to teach You could get better at them by practice but you couldn t study them much Jennifer Zickerman an entrepreneur commented The problem of future jobs is not one of skills training it is one of diminishing jobs How will we cope with a workforce that is simply irrelevant The question isn t how to train people for nonexistent jobs it s how to share the wealth in a world where we don t need most people to work Nathaniel BorensteinNathaniel Borenstein chief scientist at Mimecast replied I challenge the premise of this question that humans will have to be trained for future jobs The jobs of the future are likely to be performed by robots The question isn t how to train people for nonexistent jobs it s how to share the wealth in a world where we don t need most people to work Paul Davis a director based in Australia predicted Whilst such programs will be developed and rolled out on a large scale I question their overall effectiveness Algorithms automation and robotics will result in capital no longer needing labor to progress the economic agenda Labor becomes in many ways surplus to economic requirements This shift will dramatically transform the notion of economic growth and significantly disrupt social contracts labor s bargaining position will be dramatically weakened The nature of this change may require the world to shift to a Post Economic Growth model to avoid societal dislocation and disruption John Sniadowski a systems architect replied The skill sets which could have been taught will be superseded by AI and other robotic technology By the time the training programs are widely available the required skills will no longer be required The whole emphasis of training must now be directed towards personal life skills development rather than the traditional working career based approach There is also the massive sociological economic impact of general automation and AI that must be addressed to redistribute wealth and focus life skills at lifelong learning Tom Sommerville agile coach wrote Our greatest economic challenges over the next decade will be climate change and the wholesale loss of most jobs to automation We urgently need to explore how to distribute the increasing wealth of complex goods and services our civilization produces to a populace that will be increasingly jobless in the traditional sense The current trend of concentrating wealth in the hands of a diminishing number of ultra rich individuals is unsustainable All of this while dealing with the destabilizing effects of climate change and the adaptations necessary to mitigate its worst impacts Some of these experts projected further out into the future imagining a world where the machines themselves learn and overtake core human emotional and cognitive capacities Timothy C Mack managing principal at AAI Foresight said In the area of skill building the wild card is the degree to which machine learning begins to supplant social creative and emotive skill sets This section features responses by several more of the many top analysts who participated in this canvassing Following this wide ranging set of comments on the topic a much more expansive set of quotations directly tied to the set of four themes begins on Page 40 Baratunde Thurston a director s fellow at MIT Media Lab Fast Company columnist and former digital director of The Onion replied Online training and certification will grow significantly in part due to the high expense of formal higher education along with its declining payoffs for certain occupations Why go 100 000 in debt for a four year university when you can take a more targeted course with more guaranteed income generation potential at the end From the employer perspective this type of learning will only grow We are creating a system of on demand labor akin to cloud based labor where companies provision labor resources at will and release them at will not by the year or month but by the job labor unit or small time unit including minutes The automation of human labor will grow significantly And having a workforce trained in discrete and atomizable bits of skills will be seen as a benefit by employers This of course is a terrible soulless insecure life for the workers but since when did that really change anything There will also be a parallel call for benefits professional development and compensation that smooths out the rough patches in this on demand labor life but such efforts will lag behind the exploitation of said labor because big business has more resources and big tech moves too fast for human scale responses of accountability and responsibility To quote Donald Trump Sad Doc Searls journalist speaker and director of Project VRM at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society wrote I don t expect the evolution of work in the connected world to require new educational and training programs Instead I expect we ll see much more adaptive forms of education especially of the self made kind Look at Linux and open source development The world runs on both now and they employ millions of human beings Many or most of the new open source programmers building and running our world today are self taught or teach each other to a higher degree than they are educated by formal schooling Look at Khan Academy and the home schooling movement both of which in many ways outperform formal institutional education The main qualification for programming work isn t a degree It s proven capability This model for employment of self and others will also spread to other professions By the way I don t like the term job It demeans work and reduces the worker to a position in an org chart The great educator John Taylor Gatto who won many awards for his teaching and rarely obeyed curricular requirements says nearly all attempts to reform education make it worse We are by nature learning animals We are each also very different both from each other and from who we were yesterday As a society we need to take advantage of that and nurture our natural hunger for knowledge and productive work while respecting and encouraging our diversity a fundamental balancing feature of all nature human and otherwise Jeff Jarvis professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism wrote At a roundtable on the future convened by Union Square Ventures a few years ago I heard this economic goal presented We need to see the marginal cost of teaching another student fall to zero to see true innovation come to education allowing change to occur outside the tax based and thus safe confines of public education I don t think we ll ever reach zero MOOCs are not the solution But we will likely see a radical economic disruption in education using new tools and means to learn and certify learning and that is the way by which we will manage to train many more people in many new skills Cory Doctorow activist in residence at MIT Media Lab and co owner of Boing Boing boingboing net responded There is for the immediate and medium term a huge shortage of IT talent of course especially security researchers and professionals In part this is driven by the legal and educational framework that takes a zero tolerance approach to the hacking that kids historically engaged in on their way to becoming security researchers If a kid today hacks her school s censoring firewall to look at a blocked site she is expelled and possibly arrested not streamed into an Advanced Placement computer science class We also have a poorly constituted math curriculum for understanding algorithms which is really understanding the statistics of machine learning models An earlier and more enduring focus on stats and statistical literacy which can readily be taught using current affairs for example analyzing the poll numbers from elections the claims made by climate change scientists or even the excellent oral arguments in the Supreme Court Texas abortion law case would impart skills that transferred well into IT programming and especially security Amy Webb futurist and CEO at the Future Today Institute commented Gill Pratt a former program manager of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA recently warned of a Cambrian Explosion of robotics About 500 000 years ago Earth experienced its first Cambrian Explosion a period of rapid cellular evolution and diversification that resulted in the foundation of life as we know it today We are clearly in the dawn of a new age one that is marked not just by advanced machines but rather machines that are starting to learn how to think Soon those machines that can think will augment humankind helping to unlock our creative and industrial potential Some of the workforce will find itself displaced by automation That includes anyone whose primary job functions are transactional bank tellers drivers mortgage brokers However there are many fields that will begin to work alongside smart machines doctors journalists teachers The most important skill of any future worker will be adaptability This current Cambrian Explosion of machines will mean diversification in our systems our interfaces our code Workers who have the temperament and fortitude to quickly learn new menu screens who can find information quickly and the like will fare well I do not see the wide scale emergence of training programs during the next 10 years due to the emergence of smart machines alone If there are unanticipated external events environmental disasters new pandemics and the like that could devastate a country s economy and significantly impact its workforce which might catalyze the development of online learning opportunities Mike Roberts Internet Hall of Fame member and first president and CEO of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN responded MOOCs and related efforts are in their infancy so yes there will be considerable expansion as more is learned about what works and what doesn t work These developments are contributing to a crisis of self confidence in higher ed where traditional scholarship is being challenged on many fronts including the basic definition of education Human brains are complex and it becomes tiresome to see simplistic approaches to education issues Generally an educated person possesses a level of knowledge about the world that allows him or her to use analytical skills induction deduction probability etc to arrive at conclusions that guide behavior The jury is very much out on the extent to which acquisition of knowledge and reasoning skills requires human interaction We now have empirical evidence that a substantial percentage half or more can be gained through self study using computer assisted techniques The path forward for society as a whole is strewn with obstacles of self interest ignorance flawed economics etc If one believes in the singularity it doesn t matter because human machine symbiosis will bury the problem Judith Donath of Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society replied A lot has been written about the need for STEM science technology engineering and mathematics education Here I want to focus on other areas 1 Teaching and Healing As computers robots and other machines take over many jobs we need to reposition the social status of jobs that involve interpersonal care day care teachers nurse elderly coach The issue is not just training but cultural re evaluation of teaching and healing as highly respected skills While technology can assist with this work we mustn t lose sight of the importance of human connections as an end in and of themselves 2 Craft and Repair For the benefit of both the individual and the environment we need to strongly support learning design craft building repair Few of us make anything we use from the building we live in to the objects we own and these things are mostly manufactured as cheaply as possible to be easily bought discarded and bought again in a process of relentless acquisition that often brings little happiness Education here should be integrated into everyday life not just for when one is in school E g much rental housing is in bad repair with tenants waiting weeks months years for even simple fixes a running toilet broken lights a hole in a wall Very easily accessible learning for how to fix these things themselves and making it economically rewarding in the case of a common good is a simple basic example of the kind of ubiquitous craft learning that at scale would be enormously valuable Some of this can be taught online a key component is also online coordination 3 An Informed Citizen What should people know what skills should they have to be informed participants in a democracy Certainly science and technology are important but we need to refocus liberal education not ignore it History in all its complexity Critical thinking how to debate how to recognize persuasive techniques how to understand multiple perspectives how to mediate between different viewpoints Key skill how to research how to evaluate what you see and read David Weinberger a senior researcher at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society said Judging from what we re seeing happening now on the web it seems likely that many of the innovative platforms will be peer to peer Sites like Stack Overflow for software engineers demonstrate a new moral sense that learning in private is selfish Public learning is becoming the norm Brad Templeton chair for computing at Singularity University wrote We will see the start of these technologies but they will not be widespread at the hard problem of adult retraining in 10 years Instead most focus will be on childhood education for the poorer sectors of the world The most important skill flexibility won t be taught easily this way but must become a focus of K 12 education John Markoff former senior writer at The New York Times said We have now passed through the first generation of MOOCs and a new generation of online learning technology is beginning to emerge Udacity is a good example of the trajectory Sebastian Thrun was one of the inventors of the MOOC concept After starting a company to pursue the idea he pivoted focusing specifically on skill oriented education that is coupled directly to the job market Vint Cerf vice president and chief internet evangelist at Google and an Internet Hall of Fame member noted The internet can support remote training and learning These need not be MOOCs Even mobiles can be sources of education I hope we will see more opportunities arising for sharing this kind of knowledge Marcel Bullinga trend watcher and keynote speaker futurecheck replied The future is cheap and so is the future of education I saw an ad already for 1 000 bachelor s level training with an app of course Schools and universities will transform in the same way as shops have done in the past 10 years from analog human first to digital mobile AI first New online credential systems will first complement then gradually replace the old ones The skills of the future Those are the skills a robot cannot master yet Leadership design human meta communication critical thinking motivating cooperating innovating In my black and white moments I say Skip all knowledge training in high schools Main teaching goal We enable you to survive in an ever changing world with ever changing skills and not yet existing jobs of the future We make you better than a robot We let you cooperate with robots We build your self trust We turn you into a decent polite social person And most importantly we do not mix education with religion never Anil Dash entrepreneur technologist and advocate AnilDash predicted These credentials will start to become widespread but acceptance and quality of the training programs will map to the existing systemic biases that inform current educational and career programs Henning Schulzrinne Internet Hall of Fame member and professor at Columbia University wrote Training programs have had the problem that short duration generic programs are often not very effective except as a way to incrementally add very specific skills learn how to operate the new industry specific tool X in a week to the existing repertoire The subject matter specific part of a B S degree in a technical or scientific field takes at least two years often more and these are high intensity full time years often without other responsibilities such as family mostly for students at an age where learning is still natural and easy A large part of this time is spent not in a classroom but becoming fluent through monitored practice including group work internships and other high intensity high interaction apprentice like programs It is hard to see how workers can afford to spend two years without income support while still fulfilling their adult responsibilities such as taking care of their family or elderly parents There are possibilities for adding limited skill sets to otherwise qualified workers e g the ability to program in Python for somebody who already has an economics degree increasing their ability to get their work done The MOOC style programs have shown themselves to be most effective for this delta learning for practicing professionals not turning a high school graduate into somebody who can compete with a college graduate Jamais Cascio distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future responded We will certainly see attempts to devise training and education to match workers to new jobs but for the most part they re likely to fall victim to two related problems 1 The difficulty of projecting what will be the jobs of the future in a world where the targets keep shifting faster and faster Jobs that seem viable may fall victim to a surprising development in automation see for example filmmaking new categories of work may not last long enough to support large numbers of employees 2 We re in an era of general purpose computing which means that our systems are not physically or procedurally limited to a narrow type of work Automation and semi automation e g self checkout stands don t need to completely eliminate a job to make it unable to support large numbers of workers As learning systems improve we will soon if we re not already be at a point where adaptive algorithms can learn new jobs faster than humans Kate Crawford a well known internet researcher studying how people engage with networked technologies wrote We clearly need new educational and training programs to address the deepening precarity of the labor market But to make it successful in that the right training could be developed to make it possible that everyone will have jobs is very unlikely Paul Jones clinical professor and director at the University of North Carolina replied We learn more today by training and information sipping than in the past Training is useful but not the end of education only a kind of education As for sipping you need not know the name of every bear to know you should avoid bears Yet the continual construction of knowledge and cultures requires more from us So far training formally as in Kahn Academy and Lynda com are unarguably effective for continual updates for basic skills No programmer or developer could keep up without the informal training of Stack Overflow Wikipedia hasn t destroyed bar trivia but it has made a dent in our conversational expertise Who played guitar lead on All or Nothing No need for debate A little information sip will let us know We re fine and informed but not educated or learned But what is left out Collaborative construction of knowledge in new areas deeper investigation into known areas and the discovery of entirely new areas of knowledge This is our challenge how to create wisdom from knowledge not just jobs from training and information Bob Frankston internet pioneer and software innovator commented This is a nuanced question We trained generations of people to be phone operators by making it easy to operate the phone aka dialing Today programming is increasingly become a trade The problem with many websites is not so much the training of the programmers as much as getting managers and C level people who understand the new concepts of a world being redefined by software And that s even more true for policymakers We need to think about co evolving work and workers And as always critical thinking will remain the biggest challenge Frank Pasquale author of The Black Box Society The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information and professor of law at the University of Maryland said The biggest danger for the United States educational system is premature vocationalism Rigorous science and humanities courses help students learn how to learn Skills training all too often does not Of course it can complement core academic courses and is likely to be part of a lifetime of learning for those switching occupations But turning high school and college into narrow vocational education programs would make their graduates more vulnerable to robotic replacement not less We need to invest in higher education shoring up support for traditional universities and colleges lest they eventually become bastions for reproduction of an elite leaving the rest of society to untested experiments or online programs Online learning is a good complement for existing colleges but cannot replace them Online only programs emphasize the upside of high tech approaches but rarely grapple with the downside Big data surveillance will track the work students do ostensibly in order to customize learning Get stuck on a lesson Just keep interfacing with a keyboard camera and perhaps haptic sensors Or perhaps IM some reserve army of tutorial labor via digital labor platforms like Mechanical Turk or TaskRabbit Want to prove you aren t faking exams Just let cameras record your every move and keystroke perhaps your eye movements and facial expressions too With new platforms Silicon Valley has lured some universities into giving away lectures for free The colleges think they re establishing good karma with the public but disrupters hope for a more chaotic endgame students deciding to watch free courses then proving their credentials to certifiers who give out badges to signify competence in a skill set The certifiers most likely won t be burdened with any of the teaching research community service counseling career or otherwise recreation social events extracurriculars or other long standing features of residential university communities They will just verify that student X can do task Y It could be a very profitable business If students pay less for actual instruction by experts they have more money to spend on badges This is the for profit model shift money away from instruction and amenities and toward administrator salaries and marketing Unburdened by legacy staff and faculty ed tech firms could muster a just in time workforce to develop new educational technologies Investors could continue unbundling the university into least cost providers of content units student surveillance and badge granting That vision may draw capital but it probably won t be attractive to many students There are serious worries about rapid centralization and reuse of student data by under regulated firms For instance black boxed instructional technology is often run by algorithms that can t be accessed by the students it is assessing Tom Ryan CEO of eLearn Institute Inc responded The degree and perhaps the prestige of the institution gets you the first interview but it is your ability to do good work that keeps the job and move s you to the next level How individuals develop the skills will be less important than having the skills As mastery learning evolves so will our performance based assessment systems providing universities and businesses a greater set of evidence and qualifications then is currently available Our traditional educational systems are burdened by legacy bureaucratic practices that don t contribute to mastery of learning and distract from great teaching and learning People in rural areas don t have physical access to a higher education campus or highly skilled trainers Current job responsibilities don t allow flexible work schedules to seek skills to improve their position K 12 teachers are constantly pulled from class time with students for professional development or during class are required to take attendance complete grade assessments fill out grade checks practice fire drills all degrading quality teaching time If online systems just removed these barriers they would be a great benefit but there is so much more these systems can offer Many of the new skills necessary for jobs of the future require digital skills to be successful Too often education leaders and politicians make unilateral decisions about the interaction between teacher and learner instead of building and maintaining an environment for great teaching and learning to take place Large school systems can t scale major improvements in current systems without leveraging the tools that society and industry are using to transform their practice Barry Chudakov founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp replied One serious drawback to fast tracking needed educational and training programs the people who are creating the jobs of the future have so little time to reflect and gain perspective on the people they will need and how adding these people to their corporate culture changes that culture These entrepreneurs are so busy building technology infrastructures filing patents testing beta incarnations of ideas and processes not to mention navigating the thicket of regulations and restrictions that surround many emerging technologies and industries that they simply don t have time to look around and see the implications of the changes their companies are creating In the near future we will explode the notion of education as a rite of passage for youth happening within the walls of an institution Educational institutions will not disappear but they will change in ways that make them almost unrecognizable by today s models Just as Pokemon Go lifts people out of their chairs into real world environments to explore imaginary captures we will change learning from a passive to an active dynamic experience Three dynamics that will affect all learning and retraining efforts 1 Newer tools are changing our sense of identity 2 We are moving from the fixed point of view that the book gave us to a multiple simultaneous narrative of flow in a networked environment 3 Again since what we think is what we think through we are applying that logic of visual presentation to our presentation and sense of self The first skill needed to succeed in the workforce of the future will be the ability to understand manage and manipulate data Everyone in a technology based profession will need to be a quant quantitative analyst or keep up with the quants Because all human processes and activities can now be quantified and there is considerable exploration and technology development in the application of quantification to everything from our sleep patterns and shopping habits to our emotions and online behaviors many new and important business models are emerging from quantification and the learning algorithms that drive it The second and much more important skill needed to succeed in the workforce of the future will be the ability to find meaning and value in data combined with the problem condition or opportunity the data is outlining Said simply the greatest skill will be the ability to think through the cloud of facts data experience and strategic direction that products and services require Design thinking or visual thinking will be a critical part of managing a data driven world Data mining and management can be taught effectively Thinking problem solving reflection and visioning are difficult to teach at scale Elisabeth Gee professor at Arizona State University and author of What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy commented First many jobs of the future won t require workers with a lot of training Second degrees and credentials have been increasingly promoted by institutions more driven by profit than an interest in preparing students in any meaningful way for employment If the government doesn t step in to restrict such institutions we ll continue to see students graduate with huge debt and little prospect of decent employment Lastly we don t need large scale training of workers we need real education not job focused and opportunities for people to pursue diverse pathways for career development and lifelong learning Patrick Tucker technology editor at Defense One and author of The Naked Future observed Online education offers the opportunity to gather data on student performance continuously or telemetrically What telemetric education offers is the opportunity to continuously and constantly evaluate a student to gain a much more comprehensive understanding of ability retention of information even how other behaviors and factors such as time of day other calendar items nutrition amount of time on Pokemon Go influence learning It offers a more true moving score Learning will become easier and much more of it will happen outside of school settings all of which will diminish the importance of schools and teachers as we know them today But platforms like Coursera can amplify the talents of gifted and effective instructors and reduce the cost of education in the coming decade for all Some schools and colleges will thrive and prosper at a level not seen in their history But they will do so only by transitioning away from today s classroom model toward something else like data driven skills workshops at the high school level and startup incubators or problem solving workshops at the college level We may be conflicted about replacing classes with platforms but if we are to be honest with ourselves we know that we can t prepare coming generations for the challenges of a technological and globalized economy the same way we prepared previous generations to be factory workers The greatest thinker of the 21st century whoever he or she is will understand more about how she thinks and learns than any student in any previous generation and all before ever stepping foot inside a schoolhouse Imagine for a moment the power of knowing beforehand how well you would perform on a test Laura Matzen of Sandia National Laboratory and some of her colleagues have demonstrated that the brain s electrical activity detectable via electroencephalogram EEG predicts how well studied material has been incorporated into memory and thus how well a subject will perform on memory tests Telemetric education also offers the opportunity for everyone to raise his or her hand and be heard That opportunity doesn t come easily in a crowded classroom especially not for women or minority students many of whom feel that if they ask the wrong question or display ignorance they ll confirm some unflattering broadly held perception about their social group David Golumbia associate professor of digital studies at Virginia Commonwealth University commented As an educator I am completely unconvinced by the current rhetoric that says our educational system is unable to meet the needs of current or future workforces This whole argument is a sham meant to attack the fundamental purpose and basis of education Most empirical evidence shows that the premises of this question are incorrect most high skilled jobs of the sort implied here have an oversupply of qualified talent We need more of an emphasis on the fundamental purpose of education not on skills Stephen Downes researcher at the National Research Council of Canada commented We will see educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers because for the most part mechanisms will be in place that enable them to train themselves Within 10 years we should be beginning to see that the idea of providing training education or training is misguided because it s overly expensive and less effective than self managed learning I find it interesting even that the question itself presumes that skills must be taught Which of these skills can be taught effectively via online systems It s not that the skills are taught per se but rather that the skills are learned A wide range of activities may enable skills to be learned especially multidisciplinary skills such as critical thinking or social interaction without specifically teaching those skills There are very few skills that require specific and personal instruction from an expert to learn frankly I can t think of any which means that within 10 years we should at least be able to countenance the possibility that all or nearly all educational programs may be automated Of course they will continue to require the time and participation of the individual learner and in many cases social interaction with other learners but the labor intensive learning industry we have developed to this point will not be required I see no major objections to this argument 1 It may be argued that personal interaction is required in order to get to know a student and therefore anticipate what they need However in 10 years it will be arguable and probably demonstrable that your own computer networks will know you better than any individual instructor could even an instructor who worked with you your entire life Sure there are disasters like the Facebook news stream but people are already amazed at how much Google knows about them And we know that with enough data analytics can outperform humans even in complex tasks 2 It may be argued that personal interaction is required in order to evaluate a student s level of achievement Most actual assessment not to be confused with multiple choice tests in school or professional programs is based on expert recognition The submitted behavior an essay performance in surgery piloting an aircraft in a simulation is not assessed according to whether a set of indicators is achieved this would possibly be a necessary but never a sufficient condition The expert looks at the overall behavior and assesses whether that competency has been met The expert is serving as a proxy for the community at large With modern communications technology this proxy is no longer required Through the course of any given day as a person goes through various activities they interact with dozens of other people either in person or through online interaction Each person responds to them in some way not by testing them but by for example engaging them in conversation asking questions following advice etc These responses over time form a comprehensive and constantly changing assessment of the person An anonymous postdoctoral fellow at Rice University s Humanities Research Center observed So much has been said and challenged over the past three decades about online education I d like to answer this by asking a different set of questions which address recent developments in robotics and artificial intelligence How will autonomous factories in Chicago U S share what they ve learned with factories in Pingdingshan China What credentialing system will self driving cars require How will artificially intelligent laborers learn the skills needed to run a household business government institution or political organization When will universities allow artilect nonhuman artificial intelligence students to enroll in their traditional undergraduate and graduate degree programs and how would students learn the more ephemeral skills like critical thinking from a thinking machine

FACEBOOKTWITTERYOUTUBELINKEDININSTAGRAMFLICKRRSS 2019 The Aspen Institute All Rights ReservedMay 24 2018 Alastair Fitzpayne Ethan PollackSUMMARYDespite today s low unemployment rate workers today face a range of uncertainties and challenges In the post World War II era many workers could expect a stable career at a single company that would assume responsibility for investing in the workers skills over time This stability has now given way to careers consisting of multiple jobs in potentially different occupations and industries 1 For many work is becoming more independent short term and project based At the same time new technologies are demonstrating the ability to perform tasks previously done by workers As these trends continue workers will need to update their existing skills and acquire new skills throughout their careers This new environment demands changes to the outdated education model in which Americans could expect the education and skills they obtain when they are young to last their entire career Updating this model to better serve today s workers requires a variety of approaches Employers play a unique and vital role in workforce training but workers must also be given additional tools to acquire new skills and learning opportunities over the course of their careers This issue brief proposes the creation of worker controlled Lifelong Learning and Training Accounts LLTAs These accounts would be funded by workers employers and government and could be used by workers to pay for education and training opportunities The accounts are not designed to be long term savings vehicles balance limits and limited investment returns are intended to encourage workers to regularly use their LLTA funds for training throughout their careers Based on economic modeling conducted by District Economics Group 23 million Americans would contribute to these accounts to fund training over the next ten years costing the federal government roughly 25 billion over this same time period This proposal is designed to provide significant incentives to low income workers to participate in training given the financial challenges they face participating in savings based programs Consistent with that goal 79 percent of the cost of the proposal would benefit individuals who make under 30 000 BACKGROUNDEducation continues to be vital in today s economyThe ability to acquire post secondary credentials remains critically important in today s economy Higher levels of education correspond with lower unemployment rates and higher median earnings Chart 1 While four year degrees continue to provide an earnings premium other types of credentials also provide considerable economic returns In one study vocational certificates and associate degrees corresponded to more than 30 percent higher earnings than a high school degree alone 2 At the same time there are important differences between racial groups indicating that higher education is not benefiting students equally 3 The advance of automation further suggests that additional education will be important as the economy evolves The McKinsey Global Institute predicts that occupations that currently require a secondary education or less will see a net loss of jobs due to automation while occupations requiring college degrees will experience job growth 4 Lifelong learning and training are increasingly importantTechnology will continue to play a key role in reshaping the economy making it increasingly important that workers have access to education and training Rapid advances in technology including artificial intelligence and automation are transforming industries and jobs Autonomous vehicles are poised to alter the transportation industry the growth of e commerce is transforming retail and the use of data analytics and robotic technologies is restructuring warehouses and factories These changes will impact workers in two primary ways First new technologies will result in changes to the activities workers are being asked to perform in their existing jobs A recent McKinsey report estimated that 23 percent of current work activity hours in the U S could be automated by 2030 and that in about 60 percent of occupations at least one third of the constituent activities could be automated 5 As machines are increasingly capable of doing tasks previously done by humans workers will be required to take on new and different tasks Often this involves machines doing routine tasks that workers had previously done with workers increasingly relied on to perform activities that require core skills that are difficult to automate including critical thinking social skills management decision making planning and innovation 6 For example with the introduction of self service kiosks workers who used to work behind a cash register are now expected to be more customer facing requiring more social skills and knowledge 7 Similarly when Electrolux the world s second largest manufacturer of home appliances automated its production process it asked its workers to focus on the creative task of designing and implementing changes to the factory floor and robot layout to maximize efficiency 8 More broadly the World Economic Forum estimates that by 2020 more than one third of the core skill sets of most occupations will be skills that are not considered crucial to today s workforce 9 At the same time an increasing number of workers will need technology and digital skills ranging from basic digital literacy to advanced computer science in order to interact with new technologies at work The Brookings Institution created a digitalization index to measure changes in the digital content of 545 occupations covering 90 percent of the workforce it found that jobs are increasingly requiring digital skills with the average digitalization index across all occupations rising 57 percent between 2002 and 2016 10 Similarly research by Burning Glass Technologies looked at nearly 27 million job postings and found that 80 percent of all middle skill jobs are digitally intensive and that these jobs are growing twice as fast as those not requiring digital skills 11 As technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning continue to evolve and change the workplace workers will need not only to acquire new skills but also to keep them updated over time Second automation will result in some jobs being eliminated requiring workers to switch occupations or industries entirely The most vulnerable jobs are characterized by repetitive predictable activities like operating machinery preparing fast food and collecting and processing data The impact of this displacement could be significant it is estimated that up to 32 percent of workers may need to transition to entirely different occupations by 2030 12 Some industries that are most susceptible to automation such as retail disproportionately employ low wage workers and provide vital entry level jobs 13 Impacted workers will need to retrain for new jobs which likely would require very different skills from those their current job requires As technology eliminates some jobs it will also create others and helping workers acquire the skills necessary to take advantage of these opportunities is essential 14 Each of these challenges highlights the need to develop better systems to encourage lifelong learning Workers must have the ability to update their existing skills and acquire new skills throughout their careers The current approach is inadequateUnfortunately the country s education and training systems are not up to the task Investment in higher education continues to dwarf the amount spent on training The federal government currently spends over 180 billion on higher education but only about 12 billion on training and employment programs per year 15 While the education system also includes elements of workforce development especially at the community college level it was largely designed for younger students pursuing traditional post secondary degrees rather than for mid career workers looking to quickly develop new skills at an affordable cost Government programs such as Coverdell Accounts and the American Opportunity Tax Credit also require students to be enrolled in school at least half time which is not feasible for many workers At the same time educators face major challenges updating their curricula and integrating work based opportunities to reflect the pace of changing skills needs 16 Traditionally companies have played a significant role in helping workers maintain the skills necessary to succeed in the workforce Unfortunately based on the data available employers have also been investing less in worker training from 1996 to 2008 the percentage of workers receiving employer sponsored training fell 42 percent and on the job training fell 36 percent 17 In 2011 Accenture surveyed U S employees and found that only 21 percent had received any employer provided formal training in the past five years 18 Employer provided tuition assistance has also been falling in recent years from 66 percent of surveyed businesses offering tuition assistance benefits in 2008 19 down to 53 percent in 2017 20 In addition the employer provided training that is provided disproportionately benefits the most educated workers 21 Without intervention business investment in workers is likely to continue to decline In a recent Accenture survey of 1 200 CEOs and other top executives 74 percent said that they plan to use artificial intelligence to automate tasks in their workplace over the next three years Yet only 3 percent reported planning to significantly increase investments in training over the same time period 22 The Aspen Institute s Future of Work Initiative has proposed the creation of a business tax credit similar to the Research and Development credit to encourage further business investment in worker training 23 In addition an employer based system is ill suited for the rising number of workers who are in short term or project based work arrangements and lack stable employers willing to train them over the course of their careers From 2005 to 2015 the percentage of the workforce engaged in alternative work arrangements including independent contracting and temporary on call and contract firm work as their primary source of income rose from 10 7 to 15 8 percent This increase was spread across industries and accounted for 94 percent of net job growth over that period see Chart 2 24 Currently about one third of workers regularly participate in independent work in some capacity 25 and the number of independent workers is predicted to grow 26 As work evolves more of the burden is falling on workers to update their skills throughout their careers A 2012 Accenture survey found that 68 percent of respondents believed strongly that it was their responsibility to keep their skills up to date in their current job rather than their employer s 27 A recent Freelancers Union survey found that 65 percent of independent workers said they were updating their skills to remain competitive in a changing job market with 55 percent participating in skill related education in the past month In contrast 45 percent of traditional workers reported updating their skills and only 30 percent had recently participated in education or training 28 To succeed in a rapidly changing economy workers will need to update and learn new skills over the course of their careers both to adapt to the evolving skills that will be needed to perform in their jobs and to help them transition to new jobs in the event that their industry or occupation faces significant disruption And while some workers will be able to rely on their employers to help them acquire new skills many will not and will need financial assistance and a portable system to access new education and training opportunities PROPOSAL LIFELONG LEARNING AND TRAINING ACCOUNTSBased on these trends policymakers should create tax advantaged Lifelong Learning and Training Accounts which workers could use at any time during their careers to pay for education and training Since these accounts would belong to workers they would be portable from job to job and the decision on how to use the accounts would be made by workers not employers Individual Contributions Beginning at the age of 18 an individual would be eligible to contribute up to 2 000 per year into a Lifelong Learning and Training Account 29 Like 401 k contributions these would be made on a pre tax basis though this tax preference would not be available to workers with an Adjusted Gross Income AGI over 50 000 100 000 married filing jointly or an account balance in excess of 10 000 30 Earnings would be tax deferred as long as the account balance remained below 10 000 If the account balance exceeded 10 000 earnings on that excess would be taxable Government Contributions The government would match individual contributions by providing a direct contribution to these accounts The rate at which contributions would be matched by the government would decline as income rises with a larger contribution for low income workers and a smaller contribution for middle income workers a feature modeled after the Saver s Credit Contributions by high income workers would not be eligible for matching contributions from the government 31 Employer Contributions In order to reinforce the unique and vital role that employers play in workforce training employers would be eligible to contribute to the account up to 2 000 annually For workers who earn under 50 000 in wages employer contributions would be excluded from workers taxable income Moreover workers could receive contributions from multiple employers if they worked for more than one employer at a given time Similar to individual contributions employer contributions could be based on a one year look back basis Contribution Restrictions and Balance Limitation Contributions to the accounts would not be permitted once the account reaches a balance of 10 000 an amount sufficient to pay for the tuition expenses of most two year community college or training programs The balance limitation is intended to encourage workers to use these accounts frequently throughout their careers in contrast to other accounts such as 401 k plans that are designed to be long term savings accounts Once the balance has been drawn down workers could replenish the account up to the overall limit 32 Account Administration and Investment The U S Department of the Treasury would be responsible for determining the lowest cost option to administer the accounts Funds would be required to be held in principal protected assets such as Treasury bonds money market funds or passbook savings style investments Eligible Expenses Funds from the LLTA could be used to pay for any education and training program that results in the attainment of a recognized postsecondary credential which includes industry recognized certificates or certifications and licenses that are approved at the state level 33 LLTA funds could also be used to pay for any program provided by an eligible education institution as defined in Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 HEA 34 Funds could also be used to pay for testing and application fees for industry recognized credentials 35 Withdrawal Process To minimize compliance burdens for the individual account owner and the federal government individuals would be prohibited from making direct withdrawals To use the funds for eligible education and training the individual would need to first enroll in an eligible education or training program To pay for the program the individual would provide their account number which the eligible provider would then use to directly access the funds The funds would transfer from the account to the provider simplifying compliance and reducing the incidence of ineligible withdrawals Denial of Double Benefit If an individual is using an LLTA to pay for an eligible education and training expense then no other education tax benefit e g 529 s American Opportunity Tax Credit tuition and fees tax deduction could be used in connection with the payment for those same education and training expenses that year This treatment is consistent with the current rules around today s education tax benefits that prevent individuals from using more than one tax benefit However non tax education benefits could be used by individuals using an LLTA just as they can with other education tax benefits Non tax education benefits include Pell grants scholarships work study and other grants Encouraging LLTA Usage To encourage workers to use their LLTA accounts employers should present employees with the option to withhold and deposit a portion of their paycheck into their LLTAs Taxpayers who are receiving the Earned Income Tax Credit EITC should be given the option to deposit the tax credit into their LLTA Unused Balances To ensure that these savings are used for training purposes program rules would not allow unused LLTA balances to be rolled over tax free to retirement accounts If individuals wanted to terminate their account they would be required to include the unused balance in ordinary income at this point However unused balances could be rolled over into ABLE accounts which are tax advantaged savings accounts for individuals with disabilities 36 Modeling According to economic modeling conducted by District Economics Group this proposal would result in 23 million workers contributing to LLTA accounts over the next ten years The specific subsidy design makes the proposal highly targeted to lower income individuals in fact individuals who make under 30 000 account for 79 percent of the program s overall cost The cost of the proposal is estimated to be 25 billion over ten years BENEFITSLifelong Learning and Training Accounts would provide several benefits A better trained workforce Workers would have a strong incentive and new opportunity to invest in additional education and training over their careers Low and middle income worker contributions would be matched by the government providing workers with resources to access opportunities to learn new skills or upgrade their existing skills Worker training generally has a high rate of return benefiting workers businesses and the economy as a whole 37 38 Retraining mid career workers Finding the time and resources to seek new training opportunities in the middle of a career is a major challenge and one that the country s current education and training system is not well designed to help facilitate LLTAs could help address this challenge in part by encouraging continuous skill building rather than waiting until it is necessary to make a mid career transition Improving unemployed workers ability to find new jobs Job loss can be traumatic especially when it comes in the context of a wave of outsourcing or automation that affects an entire industry Lifelong Learning and Training Accounts could give laid off workers additional resources to use during periods of unemployment to accumulate new skills better equipping them to find new jobs More flexibility to shift jobs or careers Currently workers career paths are partially dependent on the training they receive from their employers But employers are generally only willing to train workers for the jobs they currently have This creates a lock in effect making it difficult for workers to transition to different occupations or industries Providing workers with an additional tool to obtain the skills necessary to move between occupations and industries will help workers find jobs that better leverage their interests and strengths Less reliance on the safety net About a quarter of wage earners receive benefits from one or more social safety net programs 39 As the LLTA helps more workers upskill and reskill their wages will likely rise lessening their reliance on these programs For example a 1 per hour increase in wages for the bottom 40 percent of workers would reduce the participation rate in public assistance programs by 2 5 percentage points and public expenditures would fall by 7 3 billion annually 40 POLICY CONSIDERATIONSAs policymakers design lifelong learning systems there are additional considerations that could improve the effectiveness of this approach EXAMPLES OF OTHER LIFELONG LEARNING ACCOUNTSOther countries are adopting policies that provide lifelong learning and training opportunities to their workers Singapore recently established individual learning accounts for each citizen over the age of 25 to spend on education and training programs from a list of 500 approved providers 43 The government seeds these accounts with a direct subsidy to individuals of 500 called the SkillsFuture Credit and even higher subsidies for mid career professionals In 2017 over 285 000 Singaporeans benefited from the credit 44 In 2015 France established individual training accounts that workers can use to pay for 24 hours of training per year over eight years in a wide variety of programs 45 Businesses fund this benefit with a one percent tax on payrolls In the United States the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning CAEL has developed and championed Lifelong Learning Account demonstration programs in a handful of states and cities including Maine Washington Chicago and New York City 46 The State of Maine launched a Lifelong Learning Accounts program in 2005 that was coordinated by its Department of Labor The program used its existing Career Center staff and offices to do outreach to employers and workers Additional program support was provided by the Maine Centers for Women Work and Community which assisted workers with their education planning The Lifelong Learning Accounts themselves were established through the state s existing Section 529 college savings program known as NextGen which is administered by the Finance Authority of Maine and which includes a matching contribution for low and middle income workers In addition similar legislation has been introduced in a number of other states 47 This idea has a history of bipartisanship in Washington D C In prior Congresses Sens Cantwell D WA and Snowe R ME and Reps Emanuel D IL Ramstad R MN Larson D CT Polis D CO Kilmer D WA Roskam R IL and Paulsen R MN proposed legislation to create tax advantaged lifelong learning accounts 48 Helping workers access lifelong learning opportunities should be a public policy priority Lifelong Learning and Training Accounts could help reverse the decline in the amount of training that workers are receiving In addition the proposal could help workers better manage their economic future by incentivizing workers

It translates talent into broader economic virtue and lends meaning as well as structure to most people s lives In Europe the majority of workers hold permanent contracts However tectonic shifts are re shaping the ways that work is performed First the very architecture of the corporation is changing profoundly largely powered by the Internet and digital technologies Second the perceived volatility of the economic recovery and the continuous exposure of the private sector to disruptive innovation push businesses to offer short term contracts to respond quickly if a crisis strikes Thus many more job seekers are forced into short term contracts part time work or other forms of labour which they see as undesirable At the same time in the digital economy precarious or temporary do not necessarily mean sub optimal more people voluntarily check out of the traditional 9 to 5 job routine to pursue more independent and flexible work arrangements Autonomy can be experienced as more empowering and satisfactory This rise in freelancing runs parallel to the growth of the gig economy where digital technologies enable teams to be assembled around a given project and often across borders while platforms seamlessly connect buyers with sellers Much of the latter takes place under the heading collaborative economy which is offering opportunity not only for people seeking more flexibility but also to those who have often had fewer chances of landing a permanent job The nature of work and the ways it is performed have changed multiple times and throughout human history However the pace of change has accelerated significantly largely due to digital technologies Many of today s jobs and most sought after skills did not exist a decade ago while routine occupations are vulnerable to automation Job polarisation and job displacement have intensified in advanced economies At the same time technological innovations offer new and flexible opportunities which often include those traditionally at the fringes of the labour markets Policymakers need to manoeuvre between these two trends preserving the core of a social market economy while being open to innovation and technology driven change that impacts organisations and individuals alike Skills continue to be the best guarantor of social mobility and opportunity But skills are not static and need to be updated and fine tuned throughout working lives This too often contrasts with Europe s educational systems which tend to be frontloaded Opportunities for life long learning are critical to support the numerous transitions that will likely characterise future employment Well crafted public policies need to keep track of changes in the world of work using data and digital technologies to better understand evolving trends and offer more targeted support to individuals Active labour market policies will seek to buttress potential fallouts and adapt to new realities For instance they will ease the transition from employment to freelancing and back seeking ways to provide more security to gig economy workers or making greater efforts to provide customised skills and trainings that maximise employment potential Work has always covered a diverse set of economic realities It includes paid employment own account work volunteering as well as unpaid family work Today work is increasingly becoming an umbrella concept for tasks performed under different legal functional and geographic frameworks Jobs are being broken down into projects that may either be outsourced to independent professionals and experts or be reconfigured into projects that assemble physical or virtual teams across borders and time zones Non essential tasks and functions have long been outsourced to allow companies to cut costs and focus their added value on core competences Retail companies have used external contractors for their call centres and 24 7 customer support services for decades Similarly consulting and accounting firms outsource basic research and accounting tasks while publishing houses outsource type setting and editing to production teams on other continents This allows them to benefit from time zone differences to get a speedier turn around on their projects at lower costs Companies have moved from vertical integration to restructured contractual relations allowing them to tap into global value chains and international talent as their needs and growth strategies evolve In fact as a global landscape of abundant and specialised knowledge becomes increasingly accessible companies embrace the open innovation paradigm In short this involves harnessing external ideas and knowledge from multiple sources and combining these with internal capacities and R D The result is the ability to deliver efficient and innovative solutions to the marketplace In today s economy the ability to scale rapidly and internationally is fundamental thereby transforming the crowd into part of the value added chain In addition to its global dimension outsourcing has taken on an added dimension through the rise of the gig economy1 It has created a dynamic environment in which temporary positions are common and organisations contract with independent workers for short term engagements Tasks can be broken down and distributed even more widely through apps and online platforms The bidding style process through which tasks are offered assigned and performed allows for real time interactive and often mutual rating of the performance of service providers both for seller and buyer and the reliability of users Whether it is looking for a babysitter on care com assigning a local house errand on Taskrabbit or turning to 99designs com to get designers from around the world to submit brand logo ideas in a contest round the clock the gig economy offers ways to tap into talent services and expertise at a global level with unprecedented affordability and transparency while rewarding the reputation demand and compensation of the best performers On demand work is on the rise as is a project focused approach to work What has been referred to as the Hollywood model is a discernible trend across numerous sectors How does this work in practice Once a specific project product or assignment is identified a team of different people from different professions with distinct but complementary skills comes together and collaborates in order to accomplish the task Once the project is completed the team disassembles and reconfigures with other members on another project just like in Hollywood teams and artists move on to the production of another film The pharmaceutical industry is an interesting area within which this model has developed For decades the entire process from early stage research to consumer sales was undertaken within one company Recently research is often ceded to startups or research labs where teams of scientists senior executives and or supporting managers and staff work on a single development project with venture capitalist funding If successful the team might sell the medication or its marketing rights to a company disband and move on to another project This short term highly flexible project based business approach assembles people who hold specific skills and expertise for the particular requirements of the project and with a limited time and financial commitment The adaptability of this approach is its advantage particularly in conditions of economic uncertainty It contrasts with the traditional corporate model where employees are hired in longer term open ended jobs In this project based reality there are real concerns that the bidding or competition processes between workers may negatively impact employment protection and safety standards To reap the opportunities offered public policy needs to adapt and better target those who fall through the cracks of the traditional social system which was designed for full time workers with permanent contracts Adam Davidson What Hollywood can teach us about the Future of Work New York Times 5 5 2015 Robert Weisman Pharma gives drug development the Hollywood treatment Boston Globe 27 9 2015While the majority of workers are on permanent contracts the preference for lean teams has led to a marked shift from employees to independent suppliers of services and independent contractors Self employment in the EU constitutes 16 4 percent of the labour market2 with wide variation across Member States Temps3 agency workers on call workers contract company workers independent contractors independent professionals or freelancers as well as part timers have been on the rise4 see Figure 1 In the case of Belgium for example the number of hours worked by agency workers rose by over 11 in 2015 alone 5 Similarly in the USA recent research suggests that all net employment growth since 2005 appears to have occurred in alternative i e non standard work arrangements including temporary gig and contract work The overall percentage of workers engaged in alternative work arrangements rose from 10 1 in February 2005 to 15 8 in late 2014 6 In the post 2008 period companies are much more reluctant to offer full term employment contracts given the volatile economic environment and the accelerating pace of global competition This is more than likely to prevail in the years ahead Source Eurostat These trends are feeding a patchwork of parallel employment realities that characterise today s developed economies Non standard work in its numerous varieties may offer greater flexibility and autonomy At the same time it does tend to be less paid than the full time equivalent and is associated with less access to training It is not the preferred option for many and it also brings greater risks due to frequent periods without or with very little income as well as less favourable conditions in terms of accessing social security and necessary protection healthcare accident coverage and pensions primarily On the other hand these new forms of work can be a great accelerator for individuals who have been persistently shut out of the formal labour market This is not to be under estimated in times of a sluggish economic recovery creating too few jobs and where concerns about the consequences of socio economic marginalisation range from petty crime to the risks of radicalisation Although there is widespread conviction that long term corporate jobs are the norm and that temporary work is a novel form of non standard work the opposite is likely the case Long term corporate jobs guaranteeing full time life long job security and benefits only became dominant in the trentes glorieuses after 19457 These developed as assembly lines and industrial machinery grew more complicated in times of full employment making the need for a stable trained workforce to control quality and maximise production more pressing on the employers side In parallel the urban concentration of workers encouraged the advocacy for better employment conditions and eventually privileges in exchange for loyalty Full time life long corporate jobs that emerged in the post World War II period have been overwhelmingly occupied by prime and working age men The employment trajectories of women younger workers people with a migrant background or also people with disabilities have been rather different characterised by lower rates of employment and higher rates of part time temporary or self employment They have also faced more implicit forms of discrimination in the workplace even though officially the legal framework for equal opportunities and non discrimination should prevent this8 Labour reallocation i e the sum of job creation and job destruction is intensifying As new jobs are created others risk being destroyed 9 Depending on which tasks we currently assume may be replaced estimates on the impact of automation on jobs vary but there are certain telling trends Machines are already capable of answering email and drafting summaries of sports games We may soon see driverless cars at the traffic lights drones delivering goods and algorithms replacing accountants bank staff and legal assistance 10The sectors most at risk of contraction in the future world of work are those that rely heavily on routine tasks such as low skill manufacturing jobs but also some craft and clerical occupations Figure 2 Where tasks are routine automation is likely As the trend towards more service oriented economies is likely to continue11 job growth in the future can be expected to be in the service sector and particularly in non routine elementary occupations such as personal care services Source Future Skills Supply and Demand in Europe Forecast 2012 Cedefop Note Medium risk of automation affects 5 to 70 of tasks High risk of automation affects over 70 of tasks Source Arntz M T Gregory and U Zierahn The Risk of Automation for Jobs in OECD Countries A Comparative Analysis 2016 OECD Automation is by no means a synonym for work extinction Indeed substitution may mean the destruction of certain jobs but not the destruction of employment 12 Certain estimates expect automation to lead to a net loss of more than 5 1 million jobs across 15 major advanced economies see Figure 3 13At the same time the digital revolution has generated a surge in demand for new jobs and occupational categories that did not even exist a decade ago 14These include people with a high technology quotient such as big data specialists social media managers cognitive computing engineers Internet of Things architects and blockchain developers The transformative trends of the digital revolution have also highlighted that some jobs will quite simply always be performed by humans either because of the sort of skills required or simply because of our preferences Child care care for the elderly social work mental health care for instance easily stand out as jobs with low risk of automation The fact that certain tasks can be performed by technology means that time is freed up for workers to perform other tasks and create value As automation and artificial intelligence are leaping into new areas the human robot partnership will further transform the nature of work Until now the challenge for workers was to learn how to operate machines Looking ahead interactions will change with humans monitoring rather than operating machines and creatively defining what needs to be done and how and then using robots to achieve precisely that If recent trends are telling indicators creativity emotional intelligence and transversal skills are undoubtedly what will make the difference in the future Figure 4 Research has shown that occupations requiring strong social interpersonal skills and non routine analytical skills have grown dynamically since 1980 with consistent wage growth 15 Even in the tech industry it is jobs that require both technical and interpersonal skills that are on the rise Source Future Skills Supply and Demand in Europe Forecast 2012 Cedefop Cultures of sharing negotiating with others and finding compromises seems to be what can save us from the robots Europe s advantage in the future highly automated world of work lies in its creativity and highly skilled workforce Figure 5 A 2015 study16 finds that 21 of US employment is highly creative including occupations like artists architects web designers IT specialists and public relations professionals Economies like the UK where creative occupations make up a large proportion around 24 of the workforce may be better placed than others to resist the employment fallouts of automation In this transformative context charting a successful course in the world of work depends to a large extent on the quality of firms Entrants and young firms remain the biggest contributors to employment creation in the OECD countries17 see Figure 6 However it is highly productive and internationally active firms that have an exceptional impact on economic growth and expansion of employment On average about one percent of the internationalised high performing manufacturing firms in Europe produce more than 75 of output or foreign sales 18 The changing world of work means that they will increasingly compete for the pool of available global talent Unweighted average in the non financial business sectorSource Science Technology and Industry Scoreboard 2015 OECD Indeed the most job creating and productive firms the so called frontier firms as well as the younger gazelles a subset of rapidly growing firms are seeking high skilled and digitally savvy workers19 see Table 160 1 As productivity gains result from investments in knowledge based capital it is no coincidence that top growth occupations in employee numbers are mostly high skilled ones including software and sales professionals where ICTs increase the returns to labour for highly skilled workers performing cognitive tasks 20A particular concern for Europe is the projected skills shortage in the area of ICT Information and Communications Technology which is forecast to lead to up to 825 000 unfilled vacancies by 2020 This is not only a lost opportunity for job seekers but also has the potential to be a real break on productivity and innovation as well as the wider modernisation of the economy Source LinkedInThe profound changes underway are also accompanied by substantial transformations in people s working life Until recently there has been a rather linear pattern in the transition from education and training to work and retirement This linearity is now largely a thing of the past Given the changes in the workplace people will have to increasingly learn new skills to remain employable throughout their working life They will be increasingly likely to change employers jobs employment status and professions numerous times and at faster paces than ever before And given that people live longer they will most likely also have to work longer either out of choice or necessity While some have the tools and mindset to embrace this flexibly not all are equipped with the skills competences and support system to be able to respond to these changes At present multiple and divergent realities coexist in Europe s job markets It remains difficult for women to re enter the labour market after they have taken time out to raise children Young graduates who have spent numerous years in full time university education have the hardest time getting their first job and often lack the skills necessary in spite of their formal qualifications Similarly 45 year olds who where laid off due to sectoral restructuring find it difficult to get a new job as they are often deemed too expensive or even too old to retrain In short many people find themselves excluded from gainful employment let alone the opportunity to pursue quality work a challenge which has been accentuated by the crisis For these reasons training and reskilling will matter more throughout people s working lives Education obtained before one s professional life will have to be regularly topped up Transitions will be more frequent and complex particularly with regards to family and care responsibilities on the one hand and employment and training on the other These will have to be better supported than they are today At the same time work life balance preferences are changing Millennials are keen to have more diversity and also more flexibility in their work patterns and commitments They are reinventing the essence of economic exchange professional fulfilment and even consumption itself through the collaborative economy and a growing army of prosumers with products and services being delivered on demand and just in time As for more mature workers especially highly skilled they are less and less interested in retirement and prefer to stay in the workforce for longer albeit with flexible arrangements 21Work tenure is also changing at a rapid pace In the US the median tenure of workers aged 25 to 34 years is 3 years which is three times less than that for workers aged 55 to 64 10 4 years As for the EU 28 the changes for the 25 34 year olds between 2000 and 2014 are telling too Job tenure of 10 years and over decreased from 17 5 to 12 5 while job tenure for 3 5 years increased from 17 7 to 19 4 22 This shorter tenure is not just the result of shorter time spent on the job market it is also a conscious choice It follows that one might soon have 15 20 different jobs in a lifetime As work patterns change and preferences shift one dimension that does remain constant is a rather fundamental human need for belonging to a community Freelancers and independent professionals are forming groups and associations formally informally and virtually One such group is the Freelancers Union based in New York Through associations such as these they exchange experiences seek advice even lobby on work and welfare related issues They also create community co working spaces which allow new businesses to be created and create hubs of innovation that help kick start entrepreneurial ideas In the new world of work attention is increasingly on the individual The de construction of work the multiplication of professional pursuits in one s lifetime the growing burden on individual adaptation to employment driven by automation and competition in the high value segment are some of the more evident manifestations While the jury is out on which of these trends will have positive or negative outcomes resilient skills will be the game changers There s never been a better time to be a worker with special skills or the right education because these people can use technology to create and capture value However there s never been a worse time to be a worker with only ordinary skills and abilities to offer because computers robots and other digital technologies are acquiring these skills and abilities at an extraordinary rate Brynjolfsson E and McAfee A 2014 The Second Machine Age Work Progress and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies New York W W Norton CompanyThe novel fluidity of work puts a premium on personal initiative and professional resilience The link between employer and employee is being loosened and this has repercussions for both For employers who have to operate in a global context of high economic uncertainty investing in the systematic development of their staff is often a challenge This is particularly so in the case of temporary or contract staff At the same time it matters hugely to a company s success to be able to access a workforce with directly usable skills and qualifications As for workers the burden of employment is shifted to her his abilities to adapt and remain relevant and to ensure adequate access to welfare decent and fair work conditions and sustainable employment protection While many are driven by the preference for agency and autonomy not all workers have the tools to be equally self resilient nor to sustainably tackle societal personal and professional risks Access to up and re skilling opportunities that have currency on the job market and to adequate welfare protection are the most fundamental challenges that workers and job seekers are confronted with in the changing world of work In recent years the polarisation of today s workforce between highly skilled well paid jobs and lower paid low skilled ones has intensified 23 Meanwhile the share of the low educated is contracting across all major occupational groups even in elementary occupations where it fell by four percentage points between 2008 and 2012 Such an environment may compound the efficient matching of skills and jobs available in Europe Evidence from Sweden suggests a link between displacement rates and educational level well educated native born prime age men have the highest chances of re employment Workers who are involuntarily separated from their job due to economic or increasingly technological reasons tend to suffer wage losses upon entering a new job typically attributed to a loss of job specific skills 24The risks of growing polarisation and displacement can be addressed by bolstering the resilience of workers through re skilling and up skilling opportunities throughout one s life especially at a time when career transitions and self or temporary employment are increasingly the new normal In work access to training remains highly dependent on the type of contract almost one in two employees on permanent contracts receive training compared to 32 of employees with fixed contracts and 19 of self employed 25 Thus it is often the case that those who need life long training the most are those who have the least access to it Zygmunt Bauman one of the world s leading sociologists has described the current uncertainty and unpredictability as well as the inequalities in the ways risks and opportunities are experienced as living in liquid times 26 The post crisis environment is characterised by particularly high levels of unpredictability for both workers and businesses The transitions that the digital revolution is bringing to all aspects of our work and life both in their challenges and their opportunities are likely to magnify the sense of unpredictability and complexity even further Public policy therefore needs to respond more dynamically to the changing reality of the world of work Rather than being about the anonymous and largely uniform membership of the labour market it needs to respond to the diverse journeys people undertake throughout their life and careers with anticipation and innovation This requires a comprehensive approach that includes refitting education supporting firms in growth and job creation through investing in skills customising and ensuring portability of social rights and developing indicators that enable public investment to lead to effective social outcomes The European Commission s initiative to launch a European Pillar of Social Rights aims to identify the most transformative trends within work and welfare systems the changing needs in employment and social policies and the good practices in meeting these challenges and opportunities In effect a dedicated focus of the on going public consultation process March December 2016 is on the Future of Work The changing world of work requires a multi layered policy response covering the entire life trajectory from cradle to retirement Education training and the opportunity for retraining throughout one s life need to be the starting point The most important capital for the world of work ahead is skills and yet many youths as well as adults across Europe have considerable basic cognitive and non cognitive skills deficits even if they hold formal qualifications 27Percentage of qualification mismatched who are in each literacy mismatch statusSource Skills Outlook 2013 OECD The importance of non cognitive skills for the labour market has been widely recognised Such skills range from achievement motivation perseverance problem solving resilience self control team work initiative the ability to socialise and to follow an ethical code of behaviour 28 However today s education systems are not always proficient in the provision of these sorts of skills In many EU Member States training in basic economic and financial literacy is not part of the standard curriculum and training on digital literacy and entrepreneurship has still much room to cover Note This framework is inspired by the T Skill framework see endnote 31 Refitting education for the demands of the world of work requires novel forms of schooling and teaching with a focus on the application of knowledge Transversal competences such as better management of one s own learning social and interpersonal relations and communication need to be integrated in all learning methods from pre school to training schemes for mature workers Figure 8 29 As David Deming of Harvard University once observed the most advanced preschool classrooms look a lot like the modern work world Children move from art projects to science experiments to the playground in small groups and their most important skills are sharing and negotiating with others 30 Similarly social skills need to be part of the curriculum to create conditions for complementing technology with the human touch In many business and medical schools so called flipped classrooms focus on interactive discussion while lectures are to be followed online outside of the classroom Vocational training schemes that successfully complement vocational skills with instruction in maths science and language like in Germany s dual education system are well equiped for the changing employment landscape while providing flexibility for life long learning Apart from promoting new ways of learning it is equally important to ensure access to world class education and talent to make sure that the EU s younger generation sources from international best practices In the collaborative work culture and economy of the future having broader analytical skills and knowledge and being able to learn fast by linking up different perspectives from different disciplines appears more relevant than ever 31 This competence is often referred to as T shaped skills where the T represents the depth of an expertise in a single field whereas the horizontal bar is the ability to collaborate across disciplines The European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund will inject over EUR 30 billion to support skills development in the period 2014 2020 while the Erasmus programme supports skills development in education and training with nearly EUR 15 billion Moreover through the European Structural and Investment Funds ESIF the EU plans to invest EUR 454 billion in Europe s cities and regions while channelling funding to over 2 million enterprises to support growth increase competitiveness develop projects and most importantly create new jobs In addition to the ESIF bridging the investment gap through the implementation of the European Fund for Strategic Investments EFSI can have a significant impact on improving Europe s job prospects Human capital formation is a core priority area of EFSI while its most successful spending vehicle to date is aimed at SMEs and mid cap companies It is estimated that 1 8 million jobs can be created directly or indirectly through the leveraging effect of the Investment Plan on the assumption that projects selected do not crowd out private investment 32Mainstreaming EFSI to areas with highest unemployment levels can help address labour market disparities across the EU while synergy should also be established with the smart specialisation strategy Complementary support to skill development can generate additional positive gains in the volume of employment Indeed the EFSI regulation states clearly that projects in the field of human capital culture and health should include education training the development of ICT skills and digital education Member States should offer customised training programmes to improve the skills matching performance of the labour market in the sectors benefiting from the EFSI Beyond complementing Member States actions a dedicated human capital investment instrument could be added to the EFSI providing pooled finance for investment in this area in the same way that the framework already does for SMEs The increased likelihood of job changes contractual and on demand work means that it will be more difficult to target training and retraining Therefore the risk of human capital depletion could grow As already mentioned employers may be more selective when investing in their employees training or reskilling This means that new arrangements will have to be crafted to effectively share the burden of regular training between individual workers employers and the state Today publically financed education is mainly directed towards children and young adults not yet in employment In the future such arrangements need to focus just as much on workers and job seekers aiming to fundamentally improve their employability Innovative public private partnerships between schools universities and private training providers should be encouraged to invest in skills development and human capital of a fluid and highly mobile workforce Such a skills endowment could be pre financed through education linked loans that would only have to be paid back when and if the recipient achieves a certain level of income through their subsequent employment This investment approach draws from the English student loans model Re designing employment services and active employment policies for a flexible world of work calls for governments to find more innovative ways of policy intervention Supporting employability can no longer be a one off action It involves a series of measures and instruments that may be personalised at different stages of one s working life As workers are more likely to change employers jobs sectors and even countries benefits and protection must be linked to the individual and not to jobs or unemployment which disadvantages those with non standard employment or risks unwillingly incentivising informal work or inactivityOne way of going about customisation of social policy could be the establishment of notional personal human capital accounts to create a pool of resources for everyone to use throughout their careers Depending on specific requirements the resources could be used for training and retraining purposes related to work assignments Apart from a fraction of their salary being designated for the function workers would be in the position to benefit from tax free contributions to their schemes from employers and or public and private partners The scheme could be relevant for all workers whether holding fixed contracts or being self employed further levelling the field in the world of work Care and non care personal and household services in Europe are increasingly outsourced by households to third parties The care sector which has a notable potential in terms of job creation is largely characterised by undeclared labour and therefore uncertain and even risky working conditions Certain schemes however have been particularly successful in creating formal jobs leading to standard contracts and full social protection coverage The Titres Services voucher model established in Belgium since 2004 is one such successful example Workers are employed by an organisation private or public for profit or not that sells the services to different households Households pre purchase vouchers usually on line and use these to request the services they need cleaning washing ironing gardening shopping meal preparation etc from the company The company then assigns the tasks to a worker The price of each hourly voucher is set by the state which also offers a 30 tax deduction to users of Titres Services thereby providing users with an incentive to prefer a formal arrangement for these services over undeclared work For the worker the accumulation of vouchers by working in different households each day offers them access to a formal labour contract guaranteeing the same rights as any other worker including paid vacation health and pension rights Depending on the number of vouchers collected the worker may choose to work part time or full time and after three consecutive months with the same provider fixed term contracts become open ended Employers can benefit from a reduction in their social contribution if they recruit long term unemployed participating in activation programmes Unemployed persons and recipients of social assistance are targeted by this measure as 60 of jobs under the scheme must be attributed to such categories of people The scheme is quite costly for the public purse due to the tax reduction offered However the direct and indirect advantages far outnumber the costs Among these decrease in unemployment new social contributions new receipts on personal income tax the impact on consumption from new workers the indirect creation of new jobs like administrative jobs in the agencies and freeing up women who use the vouchers to free up time so they can pursue their own careers And of course the societal benefits of creating new jobs particularly for low skilled workers under decent working conditions and social protection and reducing the informal sector ORSEU 2013 Developing personal and household services in the EU A focus on housework activities Report for the DG Employment Social Affairs and Social Inclusion We still know little about the new dynamics described above and how firms and workers cope with them Measuring resilience targeting investment assessing the return and turning public intervention to where it is needed the most requires the use of micro data Big data offers an unprecedented opportunity to track and anticipate gaps in skills map mismatches and polarisation in the job market and marry employers need with employees capabilities It also offers transparency for individuals to understand potential career options education and training requirements and how these are remunerated in the labour market Modernising and expanding job classifications may also be necessary given the transformations underway What is more big data offers policymakers the chance to leverage behavioural insights and avoid inefficiencies in implementation Experience of agencies such as the UK Behavioural Insights Team with the Department for Work and Pensions shows that studying the behaviour of job seekers can substantially increase policy returns There is a case for accelerating and streamlining the adoption of data driven and evidence based policy and decision making A number of ongoing projects yield very promising results including Vacancies for ICT Online Repository Victory project which is a big data related pilot initiative to map online vacancies for jobs and associated skills Another example is data4policy eu which supports big data and other innovative data driven approaches for evidence based policy making Finally combining the potential of big data with more regular labour force surveys would permit to better monitor changes in the pace and nature of work relationships This is fundamental to understand the forces affecting the European economy the working conditions and the quality of life of European workers These precise efforts are already underway in the US with the RAND Princeton Contingent Worker Survey RPCWS in 2015 The Contingent Worker Survey tracks alternative or non standard work relationships in the United States It had not been conducted since 2005 meaning there was a substantial lack of data on on going labour market developments To respond to this data void Lawrence F Katz from Harvard University and Alan B Krueger from Princeton University based themselves on the Bureau s Contingent Worker Survey and expanded it to gain more complete information on work arrangements Having more dynamic data is core to be able to monitor and diagnose developments in Europe s labour markets Effectively investing in people requires that governments make their instruments for social investment user centred Drawing on the pools of available data governments identify future needs for policy intervention as well as emerging vulnerabilities and opportunities that may be better tapped into through early activation measures The world of work is part and parcel of the changing economy heavily influenced by globalisation international value and supply chains more division of labour and digital disruption Work is no longer a static concept but an umbrella term for roles performed in a different manner and under different legal arrangements Public policy needs to adapt to this new situation and benefit from the agility that comes with it while mitigating the downsides Europe has a strong manufacturing base a diverse and talented workforce and a large creative economy that offer a rich backdrop for a future of work with creative and fulfilling jobs By orchestrating more tailor made customised interventions based on granular insights provided by big data sources it can achieve better results and foster the context within which both individuals and firms can thrive Governments need to find more innovative ways to offer life long and personalised support for employment skills and welfare adapted to

in short supply forcing companies to examine their workforce capabilities According to PwC s latest CEO survey 38 of CEOs globally say they re extremely concerned about the availability of key skills as a threat to business growth It s a consequence of living in an era when employers estimate that a third of the desired core skill sets of most occupations will change by 2020 1 To meet the promise of this age mid career upskilling and transition must be a critical focus for both companies and individuals now Gone are the days when you can roll out one size fits all training programs and expect to see results To be effective the experience needs to be as individualized as each worker and as dynamic as the evolving roles And advances need to come faster with a significant buy in from those who will ultimately be responsible for skills employees To meet the promise of this age mid career upskilling and transition must be a critical focus for both companies and individuals now 1 The World Economic Forum The Future of Jobs Employment Skills and Workforce Strategy for the Fourth Industrial Revolution January 2016 Understanding what skills your organization needs both for today and tomorrow is the first step in this transformation Your organization is moved by the skills that you have says Matthew Sigelman CEO of Burning Glass Technologies a firm that monitors skills in the workforce in real time The evolution of individuals in a company ultimately translates to the evolution of a company The nature of work will fundamentally change as automation and AI take hold Your organization is moved by the skills that you have The evolution of individuals in a company ultimately translates to the evolution of a company We ll see hybrid jobs where workers use skills and competencies in combinations rarely exhibited today Consider the use of AI to augment disease diagnosis In addition to knowing how to interact with the technology workers would need domain knowledge what to look for in health records knowledge of patient privacy concerns and strong communication skills to engage doctors and insurance companies And with the Human Resources function increasingly relying on data and predictive analytics for recruiting and performance management HR professionals need technical competencies plus business acumen and communication skills These hybrid roles work across domains and generally demonstrate competency in three areas Business and science skills including domain specialties such as marketing organizational design and finance or specific focus areas across physical and social sciences The ability to share data across domains is contributing to new discoveries and innovations Human or soft skills including communication critical thinking adaptability problem solving leadership creativity and innovation These become even more essential in a digital organization Technology skills including a wide range of information technology skills from basic data literacy to applying artificial intelligence to real world problems This area is most commonly cited as a gap for mid career workers as data and analytics are becoming more democratized and more useful across organizations To compete and thrive in this era CEOs need individuals who have all three sets of skills But where do you find these rare superstars While CEOs are concerned about the availability of digital skills in their workforce they continue to acknowledge that soft skills are also vital and just as hard to find Companies winning the skills battleground are those that focus on the human experience while investing in technology and can attract people who function well in multidisciplinary teams and influence others across the organization While CEOs are concerned about the availability of digital skills in their workforce they continue to acknowledge that soft skills are also vital and just as hard to find Despite a growing awareness of the need for new skills few companies have effective programs in place but more are waking to reskilling 42 of global CEOs we ve surveyed say they are implementing continuous learning initiatives to a large extent 2 Follow the steps below to get your own upskilling initiative started Much of your success will depend on your ability to understand the capabilities you ll need for future success Where do you want your organization to go What do you need to get there Assess the skills and capabilities of your current workforce against the capabilities you ll want in the future not what you need now The goal is to identify gaps so you can help individuals focus on specific areas to reskill or upskill Create a real time system that helps monitor progress over time 2 PwC s 2018 Global CEO Survey January 2018 Explore adjacencies jobs that may seem different but actually share similar skills to give workers options to shift into new roles For example a skills assessment at a software company revealed that the less in demand graphic designer role actually shared many of the same skills as the critically needed digital marketer role Once you have a baseline understanding of skills promote transparency so each of your people understands where they are now against the future skills they ll need to master Sponsor learning paths that allow for individualized learning journeys When learning is fun and paired with coaching lightweight frequent check ins employees and their managers sustain momentum and lessen the risk that the investment in reskilling will be abandoned Productivity and innovation may mean infusing new energy into your workforce Experienced hires with diverse skills and backgrounds change the makeup of your organization and change how work gets done Diversity in approach is especially true in digital transformations where traditional best practices don t lead to needed outcomes Ensure your talent pool is aligned with your business objectives and hire accordingly Integrating people with new ways of thinking into your workforce can help accelerate change and promote innovation across the organization To truly accelerate skill change in your organization you ll need to create new spaces and new experiences More companies are experimenting with incubator or accelerator programs where individuals with diverse skills and mindsets convene in multidisciplinary teams to break through siloed thinking They apply their skills to real challenges the organization faces and create totally new solutions This new way to serve customers patients or end users will change the fabric of how work is done More companies are modernizing the work environment for everyone providing employees with new flexible ways of working and new opportunities to practice skills their organizations value While this can mean piloting chatbots and apps it can also mean raising the level of human interaction in customer service While you are changing from within look outside your organization to academic institutions governments and policy makers Reskilling workers and preparing the workforce for the future will require help from them When it comes to education consider creating partnerships with academic institutions to help revise curriculums and create opportunities for lifelong learning Develop or expand apprenticeship or internship opportunities to build skills through real world experience and to create a talent pipeline for future workers 18 of CEOs globally say they expect to grow their company s workforce through such programs 3Develop or expand apprenticeship or internship opportunities to build skills through real world experience and to create a talent pipeline for future workers When thinking about policy be aware of issues that affect worker flexibility and engage in policy discussions For many workers job mobility retraining and rotation will become a crucial way of improving their employability and earning potential Many people feel tethered to their current job because of the pressures of debt and the need for employer benefits Incentives aimed at encouraging mobility and development of skills will be important All of this work is ongoing continually monitored and revised As you progress ask yourself How is the profile of my staff changing How are my needs changing Find ways to reshape the opportunities for your people to apply new skills in new ways 3 Ibid Gone are the days when education and work were two separate phases in people s lives To succeed in the future individuals need to adopt a continuous learning mindset and proactively engage in reskilling themselves Fortunately the majority of workers appear to understand this already a PwC survey found that 74 say they believe it s their own responsibility to update their skills rather than relying on any employer Here are some steps individuals can take toward reskilling Much of the success of an individual s reskilling efforts will hinge on being self motivated As LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman says embrace a start up of you mentality which means adopting a more entrepreneurial approach and carving your own path

Chief Human Resources Officers CHROs facing the workforce changes of today s enterprises Here we present a summary of highlights with a focus on the Australian perspective and argue that the banks and telcos are retrenching over 50 000 people in the next 2 3 suggesting we are not doing enough to retain workers while they upskill or reskill so they can transition to the new roles created The full report from WEF can be accessed hereThe new world of work offers numerous opportunities for individuals and businesses to flourish the economy to prosper and society to progress However in order to make the most of these opportunities we will need to approach them differently to how we have approached opportunities in the past Much has been said about the industries set to lose out with the advent of artificial intelligence AI Yet the Future of Jobs Report shows that the increased demand for new roles will offset the decreasing demand for others However these gains will mean difficult transitions for millions of workers around the world Governments organizations educational institutions and the community will need to collaborative to ensure that workers develop the skills required for these new jobs Sharon Mackie Goh CEO and Chief Customer Officer at Your New Gig says we do not fully understand the extent of job loss to new roles The changes required to participate in the workforce for some will be significant and this is why we need to start having the conversation now so people can reflect adjust and then move forward While individuals must be proactive in their quest to upskill and re skill governments will need to assist by creating environments and systems that rapidly and creatively support these efforts Businesses also need to recognise that investing in their people has many benefits Otherwise skills shortages and gaps may significantly hamper the adoption of new technology by business Whether we like it or not our job market is already being influenced by new technology and for organisations responding to new ways of working In 2018 an average of 71 of total task hours across 12 industries covered in the report are performed by humans compared to 29 by machines By 2022 this average is expected to have shifted to 58 task hours performed by humans and 42 by machines In real terms this means nearly half of companies expect to experience some reduction in their full time workforce by 2022 However 38 of businesses expect to extend their workforce to new productivity enhancing roles while more than 25 expect automation to lead to the creation of new jobs In order to cope with this rapidly changing landscape between one half and two thirds of businesses expect to expand their workforce to include contractors temporary staff and freelancers who will perform specialised work They also intend to engage workers on a more flexible basis and to embrace off site working arrangements While this solution may fill skill gaps it raises other questions including how organisations can best manage a more fluid workforce of contractors and project teams while simultaneously continuing to instill the values culture and purpose to their workforce Two concurrent trends which are driving business growth are the continued rise of tech jobs and skills and human centric jobs and skills those that depend on intrinsic human qualities These trends mean that over the next five years there will be an increasing demand for We can also expect to see new specialist roles such as Roles leveraging those distinctive human skills will include Jobs that are expected to become increasingly redundant over the 2018 2022 period are routine based middle skilled white collar roles which are susceptible to advances in new technologies and process automation These include Mackie Goh suggests that you could add middle management to this list particularly in large businesses who are experiencing structural changes With the rapidly changing world of work it only follows that the demand for skillsets will also change The table below illustrates the kinds of skills that will be in demand and on the decline by 2022 Mackie Goh says this data shows there is a focus on what is often termed soft skills We see them as a combination of attitude communication aptitude and social skills and prefer to call them EQ or non technical skills Also there will be a need for us to have varying levels of digital literacy she says According to the Foundation of Young Australians FYA New Work Order report there are four levels of digital literacy You would think that the majority of people are or will need to work towards becoming a digital citizen or digital worker while many of the roles needed for the future will require a high level of digital building capability says GohBased on this data it s obvious that reskilling our workers will be necessary The Future of Jobs Report indicates that globally by 2022 at least 54 of all employees will require significant re and upskilling Of these around 35 will need training of up to six months 9 will need six to 12 months of training while 10 will require more than a years training According to the report Australian businesses anticipate that nearly half of Australians 49 won t require any reskilling at all with 55 of businesses confident about their strategies to deal with changing technology Mackie Goh says in stark contrast however banks and telcos have announced that they will be releasing thousands of employees over the next two three years While all have programs in place to support these people by paying for outplacement services or courses they are not considering reskilling with the intention that they remain with the company However they will look to hire in areas where there are skill gaps We have to acknowledge that companies cannot be expected to retain all their people however there is an argument to say they can allow people time and allocate more learning dollars to their budgets so they can reskill rather than recruit to solve their needs she says Most of the allocation of a business s learning budget today leans toward senior management You only have to look at the number of Executive coaches and courses offering services today If that is correct then you would have to challenge the reports 49 will not require reskilling In terms of responding to shifting skills needs 87 of businesses were looking to automate the work while 84 planned to hire new permanent staff with skills relevant to new technologies Almost three quarters 74 planned to retrain their employees while 73 are going to hire new temporary staff with the relevant skills Half of businesses surveyed anticipated using their internal departments to retrain their workers while 29 expected to outsource this to private training providers In order to maximise the gains and minimise the losses expected governments companies and community will need to find win win solutions for their workers and their bottom lines The introduction of automation technology has the potential to make or break businesses which is why it s imperative that companies face this challenge head on in order todevelop a motivated agile workforce who are equipped with the right skills for the future job market Businesses will need to invest considerable time and money in reskilling their workforce However the Future of Jobs Report found that most companies intended to limit their skills training provision for the next five years to employees already performing today s in demand jobs instead of thinking more long term and creatively In order to increase the availability of future skills and address an impending skills scarcity it will be necessary for organisations and individuals to take a more inclusive and proactive approach and create a culture of lifelong learning to enable a wider range of workers to be retrained It s important to provide learning opportunities to all potentially displaced workers such as the less skilled or middle managers While some may resist in the short term we need to change mindsets to encourage everyone to embrace new job types and new ways of working Australia Post with their Post People 1st initiative is a great example of reskilling their existing workforce This initiative delivers a range of employment and development opportunities for their people When the company reformed their letters service it made a commitment that there would be no forced redundancy of any employees directly impacted by the restructure Instead Australia Post prioritises and supports their people through retraining or redeployment Ensuring a sufficient pool of appropriately skilled talent will also give companies a distinct competitive advantage Companies who invest in their people will increase productivity and have a motivated workforce The impact of AI is something we need to deal with now rather than an abstract concept of the future While it presents opportunities the Fourth Industrial Revolution also poses a number of challenges that must be addressed Firstly policy makers regulators and educators must commit to help those who are displaced repurpose their skills or retrain to acquire new skills They will need to work together to improve education and training systems in order to secure the skills and talent required for the new world of work Organisations need to think longer term about the types of jobs that will be available within their company the type of talent they need to fill these gaps and how best to secure that talent While moving towards a gig economy may be part of the solution they will still face the challenge on how to manage a transient workforce and keep company values culture and morale intact Individual workers must take personal responsibility for their own life long learning and career development While many individuals will need to be supported through periods of job transition and phases of retraining and upskilling by governments and employers those who are proactive about increasing their skillsets will be in a prime position to take advantage of the numerous opportunities that impending technological developments will bring Mackie Goh says it s time for all of Australia needs to start working together as there is so much to do Business government educational institutions and community must work together so we are ready for the challenges and opportunities that are already on our doorstep she says AI is unlikely to replace human workers However it s still uncertain as to what types of jobs will be created how permanent they will be working as a freelancer or contractor and the changes that can brings and what kind of training they may require To prepare the workforce for these changes Australia must understand the trends that are shaping the future of work and commit to helping workers adapt to rapid economic shifts This will include changing education and training systems labour market policies and developing a new attitude towards the way businesses approach their core business in particular around skills development and employment arrangements While this may not be easy for everyone involved it is imperative to adopt this mindset as we need to be prepared We d love to hear from you Email enquiries

Creating workforce development programs that work for everyone It s a growing problem By 2020 management consultancy firm Korn Ferry predicts that the technology media and telecommunications industries may be short of more than 1 1 million skilled workers globally Modern developer skills advanced data science and management cloud based skills and artificial intelligence AI and machine learning are all in great demand Jennifer Byrne chief technology officer at Microsoft US said By 2030 McKinsey predicts that as many as 375 million workers roughly 14 of the global workforce may need to switch occupational categories as digitalisation automation and advances in AI disrupt the world of work So how can businesses prepare for the future find the skills they need and get the most from their current talent pool and processes We need to significantly lower the barrier to skills adoption for every employee in every organisation Byrne said Future workforce strategies that address training and certification coaching and mentoring aligned to broader digital transformation objectives should be a board level initiative Companies that invest in their current and future workforces invest in themselves Byrne urges companies to focus their attention on ongoing skills development and make learning part of the company culture so that employees are empowered to take responsibility for their own education gain confidence in working with new technologies and be more willing to develop beyond what they know right now Creating an environment where learning is a core value and a growth mindset is embedded into every aspect of a company can shift human dynamics towards curiosity and open mindedness about new ways of working she said That reduces the friction often present in technologies rolled out across an organisation and hopefully creates more viral adoption of technology Last year Microsoft customer AT T initiated a retraining effort after discovering that nearly half of its 250 000 employees lacked the necessary science technology engineering and maths skills needed to remain competitive We could go out and try to hire all these software and engineering people and probably pay through the nose to get them but even that wouldn t have been adequate Bill Blase the company s senior executive vice president of human resources told CNBC AT T s answer is an initiative known as Future Ready a US 1 billion web based multiyear effort which includes online courses collaborations with Coursera Udacity and leading universities and a career centre that allows employees to identify and train for future jobs Microsoft partner Siemens meanwhile is also investing significantly in its talent pipeline It spends more than 500 million US 580 million a year on training reskilling and upskilling its employees worldwide New technologies and new knowledge are arising in ever shorter cycles Janina Kugel chief human resources officer at Siemens wrote in a LinkedIn article The digital transformation and the importance of humans These rapid developments mean our workforce has to acquire new skills To remain fit for work and ensure that we ll have marketable skills in the future we have to acquire new qualifications on a constant basis This form of continuing education is a top priority at Siemens As businesses look to instil a mindset of continuous learning across all levels of their organisations then they need to invest more time helping employees expand their knowledge base in a variety of different ways including training mentorship hackathons and other creative forms of skills development Massive open online courses MOOCs and other forms of online training virtual reality and mixed reality for jobsite training and AI for more precise insights into individual learning patterns and potential are all great examples of technology helping itself Byrne said Microsoft aims to not only develop a dynamic learning culture within its own organisation but is doing what it can to prepare its customers workforces for the changes that digital transformation will undoubtedly continue to bring We want to help equip learners with the digital skills that are necessary for 21st century jobs and excite learners about the power of technology Byrne explained Our Digital Literacy programme helps instil learners with confidence in their ability to use technology We also offer MOOCs created by Microsoft and other leading partners that teach key skills and concepts in technology Our Microsoft Professional Program aligns curriculum a specific MOOC content and a capstone project to specific roles in technologies Digital skills are only part of what employers need to develop however They also need to focus on the human capabilities needed to work effectively alongside technology social and emotional skills which computers don t have At a basic level everyone needs more technical skills Byrne said The surprise though is the greater need for human skills Technology can automate most things but the aim of automation has always been to create more operational efficiency in order to free up the workforce for higher value or more qualitative work That work usually requires interpersonal skills creativity and an understanding of human behaviour And one must not forget what all of this progress is actually for It s up to all of us to shape the digital transformation in a way that serves human interests Siemens Kugel said After all ultimately the idea behind the digital transformation is to make the world a better place for people not for technologies Perhaps then as we look to a future where almost two thirds of today s students will do jobs that don t even exist yet we can expect to see the entire notion of work and workplaces change almost beyond recognition Most companies are acutely aware that addressing the needs of their current and future workforces is an imperative Byrne explained Beyond that basic acknowledgment there is a growing understanding that the notion of workforce itself needs to be re imagined When we think about the workforce today the common denominator is people People and jobs are interchangeable in today s conversations However now the conversation is shifting toward skills within jobs and I believe that is the next big evolution in the way we will think about how technology will profoundly impact the workforce of the future Could we redefine the very notion of a job and move toward a more shared and agile approach to accomplishing work where specific skills and competencies are more important than singular career paths Number of views 3158 Comments Sign up here to receive our monthly email newsletter "}
