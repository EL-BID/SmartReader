More than 40 percent of the world’s population has access to the internet, with new users coming online every day. Among the poorest 20 percent of households, nearly 7 out of 10 have a mobile phone.
 The poorest households are more likely to have access to mobile phones than to toilets or clean water. We must take advantage of this rapid technological change to make the world more prosperous and inclusive. This Report fi nds that traditional development challenges are preventing the digital revolution from fulfi lling its transformative potential. For many people, today’s increase in access to digital technologies brings more choice and greater convenience. Through inclusion, effi ciency, and innovation, access provides opportunities that were previously out of reach to the poor and disadvantaged. In Kenya, for example, the cost of sending remittances dropped by up to 90 percent after the introduction of M-Pesa, a digital payment system.
 New technologies allow women to participate more easily in the labor market—as e-commerce entrepreneurs, in online work, or in business-process outsourcing. The world’s 1 billion persons with disabilities—80 percent of whom live in developing countries—can lead more productive lives with the help of text, voice, and video communication. And digital ID systems can provide better access to public and private services for the 2.4 billion people who lack formal identifi cation records, such as a birth certifi cate. While this is great progress, many are still left out because they do not have access to digital technologies. Those in extreme poverty have the most to gain from better communication and access to information.
 Nearly 6 billion people do not have high-speed internet, making them unable to fully participate in the digital economy. To deliver universal digital access, we must invest in infrastructure and pursue reforms that bring greater competition to telecommunications markets, promote public-private partnerships, and yield effective regulation. The Report concludes that the full benefi ts of the information and communications transformation will not be realized unless countries continue to improve their business climate, invest in people’s education and health, and promote good governance. In countries where these fundamentals are weak, digital technologies have not boosted productivity or reduced inequality. Countries that complement technology investments with broader economic reforms reap digital dividends in the form of faster growth, more jobs, and better services. The World Bank Group stands ready to help countries pursue these priorities.
 We are already working with clients to promote competitive business environments, increase accountability, and upgrade education and skills-development systems to prepare people for the jobs of the future. Foreword xiv FOREWORD While people around the world make more than 4 billion Google searches every day, 4 billion people still lack access to the internet. The fi ndings of this Report should be used by all who are working to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. The greatest rise of information and communications in history will not be truly revolutionary until it benefi ts everyone in every part of the world. Jim Yong Kim President The World Bank Group xv This Report was prepared by a team led by Deepak Mishra and Uwe Deichmann and comprising Kenneth Chomitz, Zahid Hasnain, Emily Kayser, Tim Kelly, Märt Kivine, Bradley Larson, Sebastian Monroy-Taborda, Hania Sahnoun, Indhira Santos, David Satola, Marc Schiffbauer, Boo Kang Seol, Shawn Tan, and Desiree van Welsum.

The M-Pesa digital payment platform, by exploiting scale economies from automation, generates signifi cant fi nancial sector innovation, with great benefi ts to Kenyans and others. Inclusion, effi ciency, innovation—these are the main mechanisms for digital technologies to promote development. Although there are many individual success stories, the effect of technology on global productivity, expansion of opportunity for the poor and the middle class, and the spread of accountable governance has so far been less than expected (fi gure O.2).
2 Firms are more connected than ever before, but global productivity growth has slowed. Digital technologies are changing the world of work, but labor markets have become more polarized and inequality is rising—particularly in the wealthier countries, but increasingly in developing countries. And while the number of democracies is growing, the share of free and fair elections is falling. These trends persist, not because of digital technologies, but in spite of them. So, while digital technologies have been spreading, digital dividends have not. Why?
 For two reasons. First, nearly 60 percent of the world’s people are still offl ine Digital technologies—the internet, mobile phones, and all the other tools to collect, store, analyze, and share information digitally—have spread quickly. More households in developing countries own a mobile phone than have access to electricity or clean water, and nearly 70 percent of the bottom fi fth of the population in developing countries own a mobile phone. The number of internet users has more than tripled in a decade—from 1 billion in 2005 to an estimated 3.2 billion at the end of 2015.1 This means that businesses, people, and governments are more connected than ever before (fi gure O.
1). The digital revolution has brought immediate private benefi ts—easier communication and information, greater convenience, free digital products, and new forms of leisure. It has also created a profound sense of social connectedness and global community. But have massive investments in information and communication technologies (ICTs) generated faster growth, more jobs, and better services? Indeed, are countries reaping sizable digital dividends? Technology can be transformational.
 A digital identifi cation system such as India’s Aadhaar, by overcoming complex information problems, helps willing governments to promote the inclusion of disadvantaged groups. Alibaba’s business-to-business OVERVIEW Strengthening the analog foundation of the digital revolution Digital technologies have spread rapidly in much of the world. Digital dividends—the broader development benefi ts from using these technologies—have lagged behind. In many instances digital technologies have boosted growth, expanded opportunities, and improved service delivery. Yet their aggregate impact has fallen short and is unevenly distributed. For digital technologies to benefi t everyone everywhere requires closing the remaining digital divide, especially in internet access.
 But greater digital adoption will not be enough. To get the most out of the digital revolution, countries also need to work on the “analog complements”—by strengthening regulations that ensure competition among businesses, by adapting workers’ skills to the demands of the new economy, and by ensuring that institutions are accountable. 3OVERVIEW institutions, amplify the voice of elites, which can result in policy capture and greater state control. And because the economics of the internet favor natural monopolies, the absence of a competitive business environment can result in more concentrated markets, benefi ting incumbent fi rms. Not surprisingly, the better educated, well connected, and more capable have received most of the benefi ts—circumscribing the gains from the digital revolution. and can’t participate in the digital economy in any meaningful way.
 Second, some of the perceived benefi ts of digital technologies are offset by emerging risks (fi gure O.3). Many advanced economies face increasingly polarized labor markets and rising inequality—in part because technology augments higher skills while replacing routine jobs, forcing many workers to compete for low-paying jobs.

The long-term development impact is by no means defi nitive, being continuously shaped by the evolution of technology (connectivity) and the country’s choice of economic, social, and governance arrangements (complements).
4 Countries that are able to swiftly adjust to this evolving digital economy will reap the greatest digital dividends, while the rest are likely to fall behind (fi gure O.3 and box O.1). The triple complements—a favorable business climate, strong human capital, and good governance— will sound familiar—and they should because they are the foundation of economic development. But digital technologies add two important dimensions. First, they raise the opportunity cost of not undertaking the necessary reforms.
 They amplify the impact of good (and bad) policies, so any failure to reform means falling farther behind those who do reform. With digital technologies, the stakes have risen for developing countries, which have more to gain than high-income countries, but also more to lose. Second, while digital technologies are no shortcut to development, they can be an enabler and perhaps an accelerator by raising the quality of the complements. Online business registries ease market entry for new and innovative fi rms. Well-designed internet-based training helps workers upgrade their skills. New media platforms can increase citizen participation.
 And digital enablers—digital fi nance, digital identifi cation, social media, and open data—spread To maximize the digital dividends requires better understanding of how technology interacts with other factors that are important for development—what the Report calls “analog complements.” Digital technologies can make routine, transaction-intensive tasks dramatically cheaper, faster, and more convenient. But most tasks also have an aspect that cannot be automated and that requires human judgment, intuition, and discretion. When technology is applied to automate tasks without matching improvements in the complements, it can fail to bring broad-based gains. The digital revolution can give rise to new business models that would benefi t consumers, but not when incumbents control market entry. Technology can make workers more productive, but not when they lack the know-how to use it.
 Digital technologies can help monitor teacher attendance and improve learning outcomes, but not when the education system lacks accountability.3 What should countries do? Making the internet universally accessible and affordable should be a global priority. The internet, in a broad sense, has grown quickly, but it is by no means universal. For every person connected to high-speed broadband, fi ve are not. Worldwide, some 4 billion people do not have any internet access, nearly 2 billion do not use a mobile phone, and almost half a billion live outside areas with a mobile signal.
 The unfi nished task of connecting everyone to the internet—one of the targets in the recently approved Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—can be achieved through a judicious mix of market competition, public-private partnerships, and effective regulation of the internet and telecom sector. Access to the internet is critical, but not suffi cient. The digital economy also requires a strong analog Source: WDR 2016 team.

 It explores the impact of the internet, mobile phones, and related technologies on economic development. Part 1 shows that potential gains from digital technologies are high, but often remain unrealized. Part 2 proposes policies to expand connectivity, accelerate complementary reforms in sectors beyond information and communication technology (ICT), and address global coordination problems. What are the digital dividends? Growth, jobs, and services are the most important returns to digital investments. The fi rst three chapters show how digital technologies help businesses become more productive; people fi nd jobs and greater opportunities; and governments deliver better public services to all.
 How do digital technologies promote development and generate digital dividends? By reducing information costs, digital technologies greatly lower the cost of economic and social transactions for fi rms, individuals, and the public sector. They promote innovation when transaction costs fall to essentially zero. They boost effi ciency as existing activities and services become cheaper, quicker, or more convenient. And they increase inclusion as people get access to services that previously were out of reach. Why does the Report argue that digital dividends are not spreading rapidly enough?
 For two reasons. First, nearly 60 percent of the world’s people are still offl ine and can’t fully participate in the digital economy. There also are persistent digital divides across gender, geography, age, and income dimensions within each country. Second, some of the perceived benefi ts of the internet are being neutralized by new risks. Vested business interests, regulatory uncertainty, and limited contestation across digital platforms could lead to harmful concentration in many sectors. Quickly expanding automation, even of mid-level offi ce jobs, could contribute to a hollowing out of labor markets and to rising inequality.
 And the poor record of many e-government initiatives points to high failure of ICT projects and the risk that states and corporations could use digital technologies to control citizens, not to empower them. What should countries do to mitigate these risks? Connectivity is vital, but not enough to realize the full development benefi ts. Digital investments need the support of “analog complements”: regulations, so that fi rms can leverage the internet to compete and innovate; improved skills, so that people can take full advantage of digital opportunities; and accountable institutions, so that governments respond to citizens’ needs and demands. Digital technologies can, in turn, augment and strengthen these complements—accelerating the pace of development. What needs to be done to connect the unconnected?
 Market competition, public-private partnerships, and eff ective regulation of internet and mobile operators encourage private investment that can make access universal and aff ordable. Public investment will sometimes be necessary and justifi ed by large social returns. A harder task will be to ensure that the internet remains open and safe as users face cybercrime, privacy violations, and online censorship. What is the main conclusion? Digital development strategies need to be broader than ICT strategies. Connectivity for all remains an important goal and a tremendous challenge.
 But countries also need to create favorable conditions for technology to be eff ective. When the analog complements are absent, the development impact will be disappointing. But when countries build a strong analog foundation, they will reap ample digital dividends—in faster growth, more jobs, and better services. benefi ts throughout the economy and society, further strengthening the interaction between technology and its complements. Digital transformations— digital divides The internet and related technologies have reached developing countries much faster than previous technological innovations. For Indonesia to reap the benefi ts of steamships took 160 years after their invention and for Kenya to have electricity, 60 years; but for Vietnam to introduce computers, only 15 years.
 Mobile phones and the internet took only a few years. More households in developing countries own a mobile phone than have access to electricity or improved sanitation (fi gure O.4, panel a). Greater internet access has led to an explosion in the production and consumption 6 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 nearly 70 percent own a mobile phone. The lowest mobile penetration is in Sub-Saharan Africa (73 percent), against 98 percent in high-income countries. But internet adoption lags behind considerably: only 31 percent of the population in developing countries had access in 2014, against 80 percent in high-income countries.
 China has the largest number of internet users, followed by the United States, with India, Japan, and Brazil fi lling out the top fi ve. The world viewed from the perspective of the number of internet users looks more equal than when scaled by income (map O.1)—refl ecting the internet’s rapid globalization. Connected businesses Internet adoption has increased across businesses in all country income groups. Nearly 9 of 10 businesses in high-income OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries had a broadband internet connection in 2010–14, compared with 7 for middle-income countries and 4 for low-income countries. But adoption rates for more sophisticated technologies such as secure servers, enterprise network, inventory management, and e-commerce are much lower in most developing countries.
 Connected governments Governments are increasingly going digital, and a greater share of government jobs in developing countries is ICT-intensive than in the private sector. By 2014, all 193 member states of the United Nations (UN) had national websites: 101 enabled citizens to create personal online accounts, 73 to fi le income taxes, and 60 to register a business. For the most common core government administrative systems, 190 member states had automated fi nancial management, 179 used such systems for customs processing, and 159 for tax management. And 148 of them had some form of digital identifi cation, and 20 had multipurpose digital identifi cation platforms. So far, developing countries have invested more in automating back-offi ce functions than in services directed at citizens and businesses. The divide in digital access and use persists The lives of the majority of the world’s people remain largely untouched by the digital revolution.
 Only around 15 percent can afford access to broadband internet. Mobile phones, reaching almost four-fi fths of the world’s people, provide the main form of internet access in developing countries. But even then, nearly 2 billion people do not own a mobile phone, and nearly 60 percent of the world’s population has no access to the internet. The world’s offl ine population is of information around the world (fi gure O.4, panel b). But while the internet has reached almost all countries quickly, the intensity of its use has been lower in poorer countries—in large part because it has not spread as widely within those countries.
 And despite many great examples of the uses of new technologies in developing countries, advanced economies have been using them even more effectively.5 Connected people On average, 8 in 10 individuals in the developing world own a mobile phone, and the number is steadily rising. Even among the bottom fi fth of the population, Sources: World Development Indicators (World Bank, various years); WDR 2016 team; http://www .internetlivestats.com/one-second/ (as compiled on April 4, 2015).

Based on internet population, 2014 mainly in India and China, but more than 120 million people are still offl ine in North America (fi gure O.5). The digital divide within countries can be as high as that between countries.
 Worldwide, nearly 21 percent of households in the bottom 40 percent of their countries’ income distribution don’t have access to a mobile phone, and 71 percent don’t have access to the internet. Adoption gaps between the bottom 40 percent and the top 60 percent and between rural and urban populations are falling for mobile phones but increasing for the internet. In Africa, the digital divide across demographic groups remains considerable (fi gure O.6, panel a). Women are less likely than men to use or own digital technologies. Gaps are even larger between youth (20 percent) and those more than 45 years old (8 percent).

And their use of e-government is highly uneven—citizens in the top 20 percent of income in the most connected EU country are 45 times more likely to use e-services than those in the bottom 20 percent of income in the least connected EU country (fi gure O.6, panel b). Within countries, greater e-government use by individuals is associated with education, employment, urban residence, being male, and broadband access. How the internet promotes development Digital technologies have dramatically expanded the information base, lowered information costs, and created information goods. This has facilitated searching, matching, and sharing of information and contributed to greater organization and collaboration among economic agents—infl uencing how fi rms operate, people seek opportunities, and citizens interact with their governments.
 The changes are not limited to economic transactions—they also infl uence the participation of women in the labor force, the The increased connectivity has had limited effect in reducing information inequality. For example, there are more contributions to Wikipedia from Hong Kong SAR, China, than from all of Africa combined, despite the fact that Africa has 50 times more internet users.6 The amount of information published on the web, and its origin, often corresponds to what one sees in the offl ine world as well. For instance, 85 percent of the user-generated content indexed by Google comes from the United States, Canada, and Europe, similar to the share of global scientifi c journals originating in these countries. In fact, the information produced and consumed in the digital economy has little bearing on the number of users of digital technologies. Given that nearly one-fi fth of the world’s population is illiterate, the spread of digital technologies alone is unlikely to spell the end of the global knowledge divide.
 Countries that have bridged the digital-access divide often face a new divide in digital capabilities. In the European Union (EU), businesses are more likely than citizens to use the internet to interact with the government. Citizens use e-government mostly for getting information and not for transacting with Sources: World Bank 2015; Meeker 2015; ITU 2015; GSMA, ; UN Population Division 2014. Data at .

In all these cases, a fundamental ease of communication for people with disabilities, and the way people spend their leisure. By overcoming information barriers, augmenting factors, and transforming products, digital technologies can make development more inclusive, effi cient, and innovative (fi gure O.7 and box O.2). Spotlight 1 in the full Report explores the links between these three mechanisms in the broader economic literature.
 The internet promotes inclusion Before the internet arrived, some transactions were so expensive that a market for them did not exist. Two types of transactions fall into this category. First is when two parties to a potentially benefi cial transaction simply didn’t know about each other and faced exorbitantly high search and information costs. Second is when one party had a lot more information than the other. In the economics literature, such situations are known as information asymmetries between buyers and sellers, and in the absence of trust and transparency, many transactions do not take place. By reducing the cost of acquiring information and making more information available transparently, digital technologies can make new transactions possible.

 Mobile phone records, business-tobusiness e-commerce, the sharing economy, online reputation mechanisms, and digital identifi cation systems all help to overcome these information barriers. While they make the market more effi cient, the biggest benefi t seems to be their market creation effects: Box O.2 e-commerce with Chinese characteristics: Inclusion, effi ciency, and innovation in Taobao villages The dynamic growth and rapid spread of e-commerce in China is best illustrated by the Shaji phenomenon. The economy of Dongfeng village in Shaji town (Jiangsu Province) shifted from pig farming in the 1980s to plastic waste recycling in the 1990s. In 2006, a migrant from the village returned to open an online shop to sell simple furniture. His success encouraged other villagers to do likewise, and by the end of 2010, the village had 6 board processing factories, 2 metal parts factories, 15 logistics and shipping companies, and 7 computer stores serving 400 households engaged in online sales throughout China and even in neighboring countries.
 Shaji was one of the fi rst “Taobao villages”—named after an online shopping platform run by the Alibaba Group—where at least 10 percent of households are engaged in online commerce.a The Taobao villages, and the rise of e-commerce in China more generally, illustrate how the internet promotes inclusion, effi ciency, and innovation. Inclusion. While the economies of China’s coastal urban areas have grown rapidly over the last three decades, rural and western parts of the country have lagged behind. But China’s large investments in rural connectivity are beginning to pay off . More than 90 percent of villages will have fi xed broadband access by the end of 2015.
 Online commerce has allowed producers in towns and villages to participate in the national and even global economy. At the end of 2014, there were more than 70,000 merchants in 200 Taobao villages, and many more in other rural areas. Most of the stores are small, with an average of 2.5 employees. About one-third of owners are female, and one-fi fth were previously unemployed. About 1 percent are persons with disabilities.
 One of Alibaba’s top “netpreneurs,” confi ned to a wheelchair after an accident, built a thriving online livestock business. Effi ciency. Besides the Taobao e-commerce site for consumers, Alibaba and other Chinese fi rms operate business-to-business platforms. They facilitate intra- and inter-industry trade in China’s already effi cient production sector, as well as exports. They also make it easier for foreign fi rms to sell in China. Consumers benefi t from greater selection and convenience on online retail sites.
 Online trade has not only helped raise rural incomes but also made shopping more effi cient. Purchasing power in rural areas is only about one-third that in cities, but the aggregate consumption of China’s 650 million rural residents is vast, contributing to the national goal of moving from an export- and investment-driven economy to one that is more consumption based. And the boom in online trade has spawned numerous logistics companies that provide quick delivery—sometimes by bicycle in towns and villages. Innovation. Taobao and other e-commerce platforms are examples of innovation generated by the economies of scale that emerge when transaction costs drop drastically. Since these platforms are highly automated, fees can be kept low, and operations are often fi nanced by advertising alone.
 Some problems cannot easily be solved solely by automation, such as creating trust in the market and preventing fraud. Online ratings, escrow services, and confl ict resolution mechanisms address them. One of the most valuable assets Alibaba and other e-commerce operators accumulate is data. Each transaction contributes to better knowledge about the economy and consumer behavior. This information supports new business lines, such as extending credit to small fi rms based on automated evaluations of creditworthiness. This can also advance fi nancial inclusion.
 In early 2015, for instance, Alibaba’s Ant Financial teamed up with the International Finance Corporation to expand credit to female entrepreneurs in China. Sources: WDR 2016 team, based on information from the China State Information Center, China Association for Employment Promotion, and Alibaba company reports. a. . 11OVERVIEW Many internet businesses or services use a platform or “two-sided market” model. The platforms match buyers with sellers or a service user with a provider.
 In a ride sharing service, the platform automatically matches drivers and passengers (innovation), the driver takes advantage of a fl exible income-earning activity not otherwise accessible (inclusion), and the passenger benefi ts from greater convenience and often lower prices (effi ciency). Online crowdfunding, job matching, room sharing, and music sites operate similarly (fi gure O.8). The dividends: Growth, jobs, and service delivery The benefi ts of digital technologies fi lter throughout the economy (fi gure O.9). For businesses, the internet promotes inclusion of fi rms in the world economy by expanding trade, raises the productivity of capital, and intensifi es competition in the marketplace, which in turn induces innovation.
 It brings opportunities to households by creating jobs, leverages human capital, and produces consumer surplus. It enables citizens to access public services, strengthens government capability, and serves as a platform for citizens to tackle collective action problems. These benefi ts are neither automatic nor assured, but in numerous instances digital technologies can bring signifi cant gains. This mechanism operates in two ways. First, the dramatic decline in the price of digital technologies has led businesses and governments to replace existing factors—labor and non-ICT capital—with ICT capital and to automate some of their activities. Airlines use online booking systems to fi ll planes.
 Supermarkets substitute cashiers with automated checkout counters. Manufacturers use real-time inventory and supply chain management systems. And governments invest in information management systems and offer online services for a wide range of tasks—from issuing drivers’ licenses to fi ling taxes. Second, digital technologies augment the factors not substituted and make them more productive. They help managers to better supervise their workers, politicians to monitor the service providers, and workers to use technology to become more productive, thus raising the returns to their human capital. By streamlining tasks and raising the productivity of existing factors, the internet can greatly increase economic effi ciency across fi rms, workers, and governments.
 The internet promotes innovation The extreme case of effi ciency is when transactions are executed automatically, without human input, and transaction costs fall to essentially zero. This is the realm of the “new economy,” such as search or e-commerce platforms, digital payment systems, e-books, streaming music, and social media. The fi xed cost of building the platform may be large, but the marginal cost of carrying out another transaction or adding another user is tiny. This gives rise to increasing returns to scale, which stimulate new business models and provide a major advantage to online fi rms competing with their offl ine counterparts. The zero marginal cost attracts new sellers and buyers to the fi rm’s platform, creating virtuous network effects, where the benefi t to a buyer increases as more sellers join in, and vice versa. An auction site attracts more bidders the more the sellers use it, and a search engine learns and becomes more useful the more searches are performed.
 Scale and zero marginal costs also explain why many of the social network sites have become the preferred vehicles for social mobilization and political protests. By enabling almost frictionless communication and collaboration, the internet can support new delivery models, encourage collective action, and accelerate innovation. The 2016 WDR presents many examples of how the internet promotes inclusion, effi ciency, and innovation. In the internet economy the three mechanisms often operate together. So the one-to-one mapping in fi gure O.7 simplifi es a more complex reality.

Isolating the impact of digital technologies is therefore diffi cult at an aggregate level. Firm-level analysis provides a more reliable picture.9 The internet enables many small fi rms to participate in global trade, thus leading to more inclusion; it makes existing capital more productive, raising effi ciency; and by stimulating competition, it encourages innovation.
 Expanding trade The internet enables more products to be exported to more markets, often by newer and younger fi rms. A 10-percent increase in internet use in the exporting country is found to increase the number of products traded between two countries by 0.4 percent. A similar increase in internet use of a country pair increases the average bilateral trade value per product by 0.6 percent.10 Firms selling on eBay in Chile, Jordan, Peru, and South Africa are younger than fi rms in the offl ine markets.
11 In Morocco, rural artisans, some of them illiterate, sell globally through the Anou crafts platform. At the other end of the spectrum, businesses trade on global e-commerce sites such as Alibaba’s in an online market that could reach more than US$6 trillion over the next fi ve years. Online platforms overcome trust and information problems through feedback and rating systems and by offering escrow and dispute resolution mechanisms. Easier trade of intermediate products encourages further “unbundling” of production processes, not just in the markets for goods but also for services.12 Firms in India, Jamaica, and the Philippines have captured a share of these global markets for services that range from traditional back-offi ce services to long-distance online tutoring. Improving capital utilization Perhaps the greatest contribution to growth comes from the internet’s lowering of costs and thus from raising effi ciency and labor productivity in practically all economic sectors.
 Better information helps companies make better use of existing capacity, optimizes inventory and supply chain management, cuts downtime of capital equipment, and reduces risk. In the airline industry, sophisticated reservation and pricing algorithms increased load factors by about one-third for U.S. domestic fl ights between 1993 and 2007. The parcel delivery company UPS famously uses intelligent routing algorithms to avoid left turns, saving time and about 4.5 million liters of petrol per year.
 Many retailers now integrate their suppliers in The internet can lead to more trade, better capital use, and greater competition The ICT sector is a fairly modest part of the overall economy. Its share in GDP is around 6 percent in OECD member countries and considerably less in developing countries (fi gure O.10, panel a). In the United States, home to 8 of the world’s 14 largest technology companies by revenue, the contribution of the ICT sector to GDP is around 7 percent. The corresponding number for Ireland is 12 percent—a country that does not boast its own Silicon Valley, but attracts many foreign fi rms through its competitive business environment and favorable tax rates. In Kenya, which hosts one of the largest ICT sectors in Africa, the value added share of ICT services in GDP was 3.
8 percent in 2013. The contribution of ICT capital to GDP growth has been fairly constant over the past two decades. In high-income countries, it has fallen from 0.7 percentage points in 1995–99 to 0.4 percentage points in 2010–14 (fi gure O.10, panel b).
 In developing countries, the contribution of ICT capital to GDP growth has been fairly modest—around 15 percent of growth— refl ecting lower digital adoption. With rapid diffusion of digital technologies into developing countries, this number could rise in the future. In addition, the indirect contributions of ICT capital to economic growth, through improvements in total factor productivity (TFP), could be large as well, although rigorous evidence linking the two is still missing. The rapid adoption of digital technologies in the economy has meant that its benefi ts are widely dispersed and its indirect growth impacts diffi cult to estimate.

The internet can also facilitate market entry. Internet fi rms can start and scale up quickly with relatively little staffi ng or capital investment. Cloud computing—the leasing of computing and data storage real-time supply chain management to keep inventory costs low. Vietnamese fi rms using e-commerce had on average 3.6 percentage point higher TFP growth than fi rms that did not use it (fi gure O.

And Botswana and Uruguay maintain unique ID and trace-back systems for livestock that fulfi ll requirements for beef exports to the EU, while making the production process more effi cient. Advancing competition When fully automated internet-based services drive marginal transaction costs to zero, the consequences for market structure are somewhat ambiguous. Low marginal costs imply large economies of scale, which favor natural monopolies. In the offl ine world, such sectors—for example, electricity production—often require some form of regulation to protect consumer interests.
 But the characteristics of internet-based services could also encourage competition. Pricecomparison websites, for example, should reduce prices for consumers, even though the evidence shows that price dispersion on the internet persists, in part because companies are getting better at price discrimination—offering different prices to different 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 19 95 –9 9 20 00 –0 4 20 05 –0 9 20 10 –1 4 19 95 –9 9 20 00 –0 4 20 05 –0 9 20 10 –1 4 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Ire lan d Ko re a, Re p.

But even the poor benefi t to some extent through indirect job creation and better access to work and markets. As governments and the private sector get better at tailoring digital services to the poor, those gains will likely increase.
 Creating jobs The number of direct jobs created by digital technologies is fairly modest, but the number enabled by it can be large. In developing countries, the ICT sector accounts for only about 1 percent of the workforce on average: less than 0.5 percent in Bolivia and Ghana, and just under 2 percent in Colombia and Sri Lanka. In OECD countries, about 3–5 percent of the employment is in this sector. Instagram, a photo sharing app, had just 13 employees in 2012 when it was bought by Facebook for US$1 billion. Facebook had 5,000 employees at the time—compared with 145,000 at Kodak at its peak in photographic fi lm in the 1990s.
 Yet Facebook’s market value is several times what Kodak’s was back then.13 ICT jobs, however, tend to pay well, and each high-tech job generates 4.9 additional jobs in other sectors in the United States.14 In Kenya, the M-Pesa digital payment system creates additional income for more than 80,000 agents. And China’s State Information Center estimates that the recent boom in the country’s e-commerce sector has created 10 million jobs in online stores and related services, about 1.3 percent of the country’s employment.
 New opportunities for entrepreneurship and self-employment are also growing rapidly in the digital economy. The internet’s ability to reduce transaction costs increases opportunities for people who face barriers in fi nding jobs or productive inputs. This promotes inclusion for women, for persons with disabilities, services—reduces startup costs and allows fi rms to add capacity as the need arises, which also reduces risk to investors. Although many internet fi rms seem to operate in separate markets, most if not all compete with offl ine fi rms. Instant messaging apps compete with telecoms, search engines and social media sites compete with traditional media for advertising revenue, e-commerce fi rms compete with brick-andmortar fi rms, and mobile money competes with traditional banks. Innovations triggered by this onlineoffl ine competition generally benefi t consumers, especially when offl ine markets are distorted.
 Transport service companies such as Uber, Lyft, Olacabs, and Didi-Kuaidi Dache have disrupted taxi markets that tend to be overregulated with restricted entry and high prices. Similarly, TransferWise and Xoom have reduced regulatory rents in the fi nancial sector and cut the prices of international currency transfers by up to 90 percent. In Uganda, eKeebo allows independent or amateur chefs to provide and share home-cooked meals, circumventing restaurant licenses. The internet supports job creation and makes workers more productive People have an enormous desire to communicate and connect. The personal welfare gain from having access to digital technology is clearly great. Does it also increase people’s economic opportunities?
 People certainly use mobile phones and the internet more for social purposes than for professional ones. But an emerging literature also indicates that people realize tangible economic benefi ts. Quantifying these benefi ts is diffi cult, but qualitative evaluation of the evidence shows that benefi ts accrue most to those already better off (table O.1). Those who have the skills to leverage Table O.1 Benefi ts of digital technologies for workers and consumers: A scorecard Channel Impact so far Potential impact Poor Nonpoor Poor Nonpoor Creating jobs In the ICT sector and occupations Negligible Negligible In sectors that use ICT Increasing worker productivity Increasing returns to human capital Connecting people to work and markets Benefi ting consumers Increasing consumer surplus Source: WDR 2016 team.

L L L L L L M M M M M H H H H H H H 15OVERVIEW remain high—almost 15 percent for an additional year of tertiary education in developing countries. The biggest gains from digital technologies for the poor are likely to come from lower information and search costs. Technology can inform workers about prices, inputs, or new technologies more quickly and cheaply, reducing friction and uncertainty.
15 That can eliminate costly journeys, allowing more time for work and reducing risks of crime or traffi c accidents (box O.4).16 Using technology for information on prices, soil quality, weather, new technologies, and coordination with traders has been extensively documented in agriculture (see sector focus 1 in the full Report). In Honduras, farmers who got market price information via short message service (SMS) reported an increase of 12.5 percent in prices received.17 In Pakistan, mobile phones allow farmers to shift to more perishable but higher return cash crops, reducing postharvest losses from the most perishable crops by 21–35 percent.
18 The impacts of reduced information asymmetries tend to be larger when learning about information in distant markets or among disadvantaged farmers who face more information constraints.19 Increasing the consumer surplus Where the internet has led to a full automation of services, many jobs have been lost—few travel agents, booksellers, or music store employees are left. But these same dynamics have been a boon to consumers. There are new digital goods and services—such as e-books, digital music, and search engines. And the internet has transformed existing ones—such as taxi and for people in remote areas (box O.3).
 Impact outsourcing brings internet-based jobs to the poor and vulnerable. The government of the Indian state of Kerala set up the Kudumbashree project to outsource information technology services to cooperatives of women from poor families; 90 percent of the women had not previously worked outside the home. Samasource and Rural Shores link clients in the United States and the United Kingdom with workers in Ghana, Haiti, India, Kenya, and Uganda. Of global online workers on the Elance freelancing platform, part of Upwork, 44 percent are women, and many wish to balance work and family life. Among respondents to a survey of online workers for this Report, the ability to work fl exible hours from home is considered the greatest advantage of online work. Increasing labor productivity For the economy as a whole, the most profound impact of the internet on individuals is that it makes workers more productive.
 By handing off routine and repetitive tasks to technology, workers can focus on activities with higher value. Judicious use of massive open online courses (MOOCs) or online teaching tools like Khan Academy lets teachers spend more time fostering discussion and working with students who fall behind. Researchers can dedicate more time thinking and innovating rather than searching for information or duplicating other people’s work. Managers can work more easily with teams across borders. These benefi ts are largest for the higher skilled. In fact, there has never been a better time to be a high-skilled worker, as the returns to education Box O.
3 Bridging the disability divide through digital technologies Over 1 billion people around the world have disabilities, and 80 percent of them live in developing countries. Persons with disabilities face barriers to communicate, interact, access information, and participate in civic activities. Digital technologies are helping overcome some of these barriers. Technology enables multiple means of communication—voice, text, and gestures—to access information and engage with others. Voice recognition, magnifi cation, and text-to-speech functionality benefi t persons with visual, cognitive, learning, and mobility disabilities. Short message service (SMS), instant messaging, telephone relay, and video captions reduce communication barriers for persons with hearing and speech disabilities.
 Hands-free navigation and gesture-controlled interfaces assist persons with severe mobility impairments in using digital devices. But the mere existence of technology is an insuffi cient condition to bridge the gaps in the socioeconomic inclusion of persons with disabilities. A supportive ecosystem is needed to drive the implementation of accessible digital technologies. Source: Raja 2015, for the WDR 2016. 16 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 an average of US$50 a month for services it now gets for free on the internet. Time-use data in the United States suggest that the median individual gains more than US$3,000 annually from the internet.
 In Estonia, digital signatures saved 20 minutes per transaction. And a study of the time costs of searching for information shows that the average online search tends to be 15 minutes faster, the results are more accurate and relevant, and the experience more enjoyable than offl ine search in a library. On average, people might realize a consumer surplus as high as US$500 a year from such services, adding up to vast benefi ts when aggregated over all users. The internet can make governments more capable and responsive Governments provide services that are typically nontradable, often lack scale, and are not subject to market competition. Raising effi ciency in the public and hospitality services, health, education, and retail. This has increased the variety of goods and services available, including those for leisure.
 The internet thus enhances consumer welfare, but in ways that are hard to measure. People’s perceptions are that digital technologies have certainly made them better off. In 12 countries surveyed in Africa, 65 percent of people believe that their family is better off because they have mobile phones, whereas only 20 percent disagree (14.5 percent not sure).20 And 73 percent say mobile phones help save on travel time and costs, with only 10 percent saying otherwise. Two-thirds believe that having a mobile phone makes them feel more safe and secure.
 Some studies have attempted to quantify the economic value of these gains. A McKinsey survey of consumers in France, Germany, the Russian Federation, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States in 2010 found that a household is willing to pay Box O.4 Digital dividends and the bottom billion The poor benefi t from digital technologies, but only modestly in relation to the true potential. Nearly 7 of 10 people in the bottom fi fth of the population in developing countries own a mobile phone, improving their access to markets and services. In rural Niger, agricultural price information obtained through mobile phones reduces search costs by 50 percent.a In rural Peru, access to mobile phones boosted household real consumption by 11 percent between 2004 and 2009, reducing poverty by 8 percentage points and extreme poverty by 5.
4 percentage points.b The poor can benefi t from digital technologies even when they don’t own a mobile phone or a computer. For example, a digital ID, by giving millions of poor people an offi cial identity, increases their access to a host of public and private services. In Narma Dih—a village in Bihar, India, with no electricity or all-weather roads—poor farmers benefi t from digitally enabled agricultural extension services from Digital Green, an NGO (nongovernmental organization) that trains farmers using locally produced how-to videos.c Yet the poor are capturing only a modest share of the digital dividends. While a majority of the poor have a mobile phone, they can’t access or aff ord the internet.
 In Latin America, fewer than 1 in 10 poor households is connected to the internet. In the Central African Republic, one month of internet access costs more than 1.5 times the annual per capita income. Even mobile phones are expensive: the median mobile phone owner in Africa spends over 13 percent of her monthly income on phone calls and texting. And many poor lack the basic literacy and numeracy skills needed to use the internet. In Mali and Uganda, about three-quarters of third-grade children cannot read.
 In Afghanistan and Niger, 7 of 10 adults are illiterate. In advanced economies the poor face the prospects of stagnant wages and fewer opportunities, as they are increasingly forced to compete with those displaced by automation. Digital technologies can also exacerbate socioeconomic disparities. For example, the internet voting on municipal budget proposals in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil and citizen engagement initiatives such as Uganda’s U-report show that the new users are more likely to be male, young, university educated, and wealthy—those already better off before the internet’s advent.d Rapid technological progress will increasingly enable the poor to aff ord and use many digital services. But their ability to reap dividends from these investments will be largely determined by providing the analog complements.

E-procurement helped India and Indonesia inject more competition into the process by increasing the probability that the winning bidder comes from outside the project’s region. This also improved the quality of infrastructure.
 But a majority of public sector digital technology projects fail to achieve the project objectives, resulting in considerable fi scal waste.22 Digital technologies can also improve management by monitoring the performance of workers. A small but growing impact evaluation literature reports generally positive effects of technology-based monitoring on worker absenteeism when combined with other institutional reforms.23 In Uganda, where teacher absenteeism is estimated at 27 percent, head teachers use mobile phones to record attendance and transmit data to a central database that generates weekly reports. Combined with incentive pay for teachers tied to attendance, the program reduced absenteeism by 11 percentage points. The internet also provides real-time data for better planning and management of service facilities.
 In Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, and Zambia, health workers use mobile phones to report counterfeit drugs and stock-outs. Aggregated in a central database and geographically mapped, this information helps administrators address drug and equipment shortages. Providing citizens the opportunity to give specifi c feedback quickly has helped improve performance in many instances. Mobile-phone apps like SeeClickFix and FixMyStreet in the United States and the United Kingdom let users report potholes, graffi ti, and illegal dumping. Governments can report back on fi xes, closing the feedback loop. Internet call centers enabling citizens to report problems and track the status of their requests are now standard in Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Muscat, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul, and Ulaanbaatar, to name a few cities.
 The Nairobi water company uses MajiVoice, and one of the electricity supply companies in the Dominican Republic, EDE Este, uses a similar system to receive complaints, track their resolution through an automated workfl ow, and regularly update citizens on progress. When implemented well, citizens eagerly take up the opportunity to give feedback, and resolution time declines (see fi gure O.12). Advancing voice Governments, particularly those in digitally advanced countries like Estonia, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore, are beginning to take advantage of data analytics and digital platforms for faster, more informed, and integrated policy making. The internet also opens new avenues for participatory democracy. Iceland has experimented with crowdsourcing its constitution, and Brazil and Estonia have explored sector is thus challenging, and one might expect the internet to bring large benefi ts in public service provision.
 There are indeed many examples where the internet has raised the capabilities of the public sector. Better tools for communicating with citizens and providing information also allow greater participation—through inclusion in government assistance programs, or feedback to and monitoring of public offi cials. And the internet helps citizens to connect online and organize for collective action in order to put pressure when government performance falls short of people’s expectations. Expanding participation Lack of identity is an impediment for poor people to exercise their basic democratic and human rights. Where civil registration systems are weak or nonexistent, many of the poor are simply not counted. Digital identifi cation can help overcome barriers to participation.
 Many countries have introduced general- purpose digital identity (ID) schemes or specifi c systems for elections or to manage postconfl ict transfers—with numerous benefi ts, including making the public sector more effi cient. Nearly 900 million Indians have been issued digital IDs in the past fi ve years, which they are using to open bank accounts, monitor attendance of civil servants, and identify recipients of government subsidies. Nigeria’s e-ID revealed 62,000 public sector “ghost workers,” saving US$1 billion annually. But the most important benefi t may be in better integrating marginalized or disadvantaged groups into society. Digital technologies also enable the poor to vote by providing them with robust identifi cation and by curtailing fraud and intimidation through better monitoring. Mobile phones enable citizens to report instances of violence and voter intimidation, improving electoral participation.
 In Mozambique, SMS messages allowed citizens to report electoral irregularities and increased voter turnout by 5 percentage points.21 Ushahidi and Uchaguzi are crowdsourced applications that report and map election violence in Kenya. By multiplying the sources of information, the internet can reduce the risk of media capture and make censorship diffi cult. Improving public sector capability The internet raises effi ciency and productivity through automation and data-driven management. Almost all countries have tried to automate tax and customs administration, as well as budget preparation, execution, and accounting. Results have been mixed.
 E-fi ling reduces tax compliance costs, and one-stop computerized service centers and online portals have 18 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 The risks: Concentration, inequality, and control So, the internet can be an effective force for development. But as the Report documents, the benefi ts too often are not realized, and the internet sometimes makes persistent problems worse. Why? The key insight is that for complex occupations, business activities, or public services, the internet usually can make only a portion of tasks cheaper, more effi cient, or more convenient through automation. Another portion still requires capabilities that humans possess in abundance but computers do not. Many traditional tasks of an accountant or bank teller are now automated, such as making calculations or processing withdrawals.
 Others require complex reasoning or socioemotional skills, such as designing tax strategies or advising clients. Likewise, many public services involving provision of information or routine permissions can be automated. But others, such as teaching or policing, need a high degree of human discretion, tacit knowledge, and judgment. Many problems and failures of the internet surface when digital technology is introduced but the important analog complements remain inadequate. What are these complements? The main ones are regulations that ensure a high degree of competition, skills that leverage technology, and institutions that are accountable (fi gure O.
13). • When the internet delivers scale economies for fi rms but the business environment inhibits competition, the outcome could be excessive concentration of market power and rise of monopolies, inhibiting future innovation. • When the internet automates many tasks but workers do not possess the skills that technology augments, the outcome will be greater inequality, rather than greater effi ciency. • When the internet helps overcome information barriers that impede service delivery but governments remain unaccountable, the outcome will be greater control, rather than greater empowerment and inclusion. The interplay between internet investments and reforms in complementary areas is at the core of policy debates about technology impacts. A 2008 study by Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz,27 drawing on earlier work by Jan Tinbergen, framed these dynamics in the labor market as a “race between education and technology.
” As technology progresses, some skills become obsolete. Workers must acquire new participatory lawmaking. By dramatically lowering the cost of communication and coordination, social media can overcome the traditional barriers to citizen collective action. A growing empirical literature has also shown that cellphones and the use of Twitter and Facebook aided protests during the Arab Spring in the Arab Republic of Egypt,24 antiwar demonstrations in the United States,25 and citizen mobilization across Africa.26 Source: WDR 2016 team.

 The risk of allowing underregulated entrants into a market must therefore be weighed against the benefi ts to consumers from lower prices and greater convenience. The third potential risk comes from the dominant position of many online platforms and internet intermediaries. Economic history shows that fi rms are tempted to exploit a dominant position. Large internet fi rms may be no exception. The economics of the internet favor natural monopolies,28 and some platforms now dominate their markets. They enjoy such high profi ts that they can quickly capture new markets by buying out competitors or developing a rival service; local startups, including those in developing countries, are left with tiny niche markets.
 Some of the biggest internet fi rms now face scrutiny from regulators. Google, which captures almost one-third of global digital advertising revenue,29 has been investigated for preferential placement of its own products, exploiting third-party content, and exclusionary practices in its placement of advertising.30 Amazon, the largest sales platform for book publishers, has used its market power to enforce its pricing policies. Safaricom, operating the M-Pesa payment system, resisted the entry of competing service providers. The vast amount of identifi able personal information that many of these companies collect raises further challenges (box O.5).
 It is too early to tell whether these problems will diminish the overall economic benefi ts from the internet or be mitigated by the sector’s low entry costs and rapid technological change. Consumers have generally benefi ted from the internet-based business models of existing and new fi rms. Markets are extremely dynamic, so many advantages from scale or moving fi rst may be temporary. And greater size skills that help them become more productive with the help of that technology. Adjustment takes time and will be painful for many, but this is how economies progress. The sections that follow discuss risks and complements in the private sector, in labor markets, and in the public sector.
 Growing concentration: The nexus between regulations and technology One of the main mechanisms for the internet to promote economic growth is competition. Information fl ows increase and speed up so that customers have more choice and can compare prices more easily. Firms that use technology more effectively will do well and force others to follow suit. There is considerable evidence that this is happening throughout the economy, but three potential problems could emerge. First, while the internet has spread quickly in the private sector of some countries, adoption among non-ICT fi rms has been slow in other countries. Larger, fast-growing, skill-intensive, export-oriented, and urban fi rms tend to use digital technologies more.
 The causes of these differences are not well understood. Differences in adoption rates may simply refl ect differences in income, sector characteristics, and management capabilities, but they could also be due to barriers to adoption (fi gure O.14). One possibility is high import duties for digital goods and services in some countries. Another is market distortions and protections that allow fi rms to maintain profi ts without threats from more innovative entrants. For example, fi rms in Mexico that faced competition from China increased the number of computers per employee and became twice as likely to use the internet for purchasing as those that didn’t face signifi cant competition.
 Second, when online businesses enter the turf of their offl ine counterparts, disruption can be great, and regulators are often unsure whether or how to react. Recently, “on-demand economy” fi rms Uber and Airbnb have challenged established taxi and hotel industries. Their platform business model is scalable and global and has spawned numerous local imitators. In cities from Paris to Delhi to Beijing, the reaction has been a scramble by offl ine incumbents to keep these new competitors out, usually by appealing to regulators to enforce established sector regulations such as the knowledge of the city (in the case of London cabbies) or insurance requirements. This can be a valid appeal when regulations protect public safety and ensure minimum service levels. But these new models often succeed because they enter heavily distorted markets with virtual monopolies Source: WDR 2016 team.
 Vested interests Regulatory uncertainty Digital monopoly Analog economy Digital economy (4–5% of GDP; 1–2% of jobs) Figure O.14 Factors explaining the lower adoption of digital technologies by businesses 20 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 Rising inequality: The race between skills and technology If the internet and related technologies promote growth, how are the gains shared in the labor market? While digital technologies raise productivity and enhance overall welfare, labor market disruptions can be painful and can result in higher inequality. Global trends provide some indication. One is that the share of national income that has gone to labor, especially routine labor, has fallen quite sharply in many developing countries—though Brazil and Ukraine are exceptions (fi gure O.15).
31 Inequality has allows large fi rms to provide services and products at low cost or free of charge, and their high profi ts fuel investments in research and development (R&D). At the same time, it is clear that competition and market structure on the internet are in many ways not so different from the offl ine world. Policies need to ensure that all innovative companies can enter markets and compete on equal terms. Otherwise, the economic performance between fi rms of different size and in different countries could diverge further and contribute to similarly divergent performance of national economies. Box O.5 What Facebook “Likes” reveal—the convenience-privacy trade-off When economists such as George Stigler and Richard Posner wrote about privacy and economics in the early 1980s, they raised many issues debated today, but at that time the “storage and retrieval of information, and its accurate dissemination, [were] often extremely expensive.
”a Today, an enormous collection of identifi able information is making service delivery more effi cient and more relevant. Service providers can better target or price their products based on known characteristics and preferences. Search engines provide more relevant search results. Health and auto insurers can better price premiums with verifi able information about exercise or driving behavior. And governments can use data systems to reduce the bureaucratic burden for citizens. In Estonia’s e-government system, citizens never have to provide the same information twice.
 The problem is that few people know how these large amounts of data are collected and used—and who controls them. Users are not always aware of and providers often don’t tell what information is collected. The secret snooping by governments can be for legitimate law enforcement reasons, but sometimes violates laws and rights, as the Edward Snowden revelations about spying by the security agencies of the United States, the United Kingdom, and others have shown. A consequence has been a new “data nationalism,” where countries are demanding that data about their residents be stored within their territory or favoring domestic technology that may be inferior or more expensive, but is trusted more. Data collectors often sell the data to others. One data broker assembled an average of 1,500 pieces of information about more than half a billion consumers worldwide from information people provided voluntarily on various websites.
 But even easily accessible data such as Facebook “Likes” can predict sensitive characteristics including “sexual orientation, ethnicity, religious and political views, personality traits, intelligence, happiness, use of addictive substances, parental separation, age, and gender.”b And smartphone sensors can infer a user’s “mood, stress levels, personality type, bipolar disorder, demographics (e.g., gender, marital status, job status, age), smoking habits, overall wellbeing, progression of Parkinson’s disease, sleep patterns, happiness, levels of exercise, and types of physical activity or movement.”c The risks? Cybercrime such as identity theft when data stored insecurely fall into the wrong hands.
 Discrimination when customers are charged a higher premium or interest rate, or denied a job based on erroneous information they can’t easily correct. Persistence of dated information that denies protection from embarrassing but irrelevant information or a second chance, which prompted Europe’s “right to be forgotten” ruling. And perhaps most important, reduced trust and thus suboptimal use of the internet. These concerns vary across societies. Fifty-eight percent of Nigerians and 57 percent of Indians believe private information on the internet is very secure, but only 18 percent of French and 16 percent of German respondents do.d Sources: WDR 2016 team, based on Peppet 2014; Castro 2013; Economist 2014; Kosinski, Stillwell, and Graepel 2013.

 d. CIGI and Ipsos 2014. 21OVERVIEW increased more where this shift in incomes toward capital and away from labor has been higher (fi gure O.16). A number of recent studies have linked technological change to this rising inequality (see chapter 2 in the full Report). A related trend is the polarization—or “hollowing out”—of the labor market, not only in advanced economies, but increasingly also in many developing countries.
 The share of employment in high-skilled occupations is up, as is the share of low-skilled jobs. The share of middle-skilled employment, in contrast, is down in most developing countries for which detailed data are available (fi gure O.17). And these types of jobs are often near the top of the income distribution in low-income countries, as in Africa. A notable exception to these global trends is China, where growing mechanization in agriculture has led to a (perhaps temporary) increase in routine, midlevel labor. Exceptions also include some countries rich in natural resources and commodity exporters, which include several countries in Central Asia and Latin America.
 What explains all this? Machines can increasingly perform routine tasks more quickly and cheaply than humans, and much of what is considered nonroutine today—such as translation, insurance underwriting, or even medical diagnostics—computers might do just as well tomorrow. Unlike previous technological transformations such as the mechanization of Figure O.15 Labor shares of national income are falling in many countries, including some developing countries Trends in labor shares in output since 1975 percentage points every 10 years –15 –10 –5 0 5 10 Poland Mexico Hungary Estonia Bahrain Slovenia Lithuania South Africa Norway Luxembourg Micronesia, Fed.

But it will likely take longer in lower-income countries. Most of them are still fairly low-tech, with only about onethird of urban jobs in a sample of developing countries using any ICTs at work. And wage rates are still low, with a larger share of manual nonroutine labor, so investments in technology will be less profi table for fi rms. This does not mean, however, that lower income countries need not pay attention to these trends.
 Most important, even without signifi cant employment shifts, the nature of jobs is changing toward skills that remain hard for technology to emulate: that is, advanced cognitive and socioemotional skills. The policy response, besides rethinking social protection systems, is better and more responsive education and training—areas where reforms take many years to pay off. It is important to keep in mind the historical perspective that job displacement and job losses from technological change are an integral part of economic progress. It is precisely rising productivity—as technology replaces some human labor but augments the skills of remaining and new workers—that generates agriculture or the automation of manufacturing, the internet affects well-paying white-collar jobs even more than blue-collar jobs. Some mid-level workers will have additional skills that allow them to switch to better-paid nonroutine occupations in which technology tends to augment human capital and make skilled workers more productive. These workers will gain from technological disruption.
 In developing countries, returns to education are highest among those with tertiary education, and they are higher and rising faster in ICT-intensive occupations.32 Those who do not have such skills will need to seek work in lower-skilled, nonroutine occupations, such as janitorial services, hospitality, or personal care. Demand for such services could increase, but perhaps not enough to prevent downward wage pressure as the available workforce in these sectors grows. These dynamics are consistent with the rising returns to education and income inequality we see in many countries. The implications for developing countries depend on the pace of technological disruption. The share of occupations that could experience signifi cant automation is actually higher in developing countries Sources: WDR 2016 team, based on ILO KILM (ILO, various years); the International Income Distribution database (I2D2; World Bank, various years); National Bureau of Statistics of China (various years).

OECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. growth and frees human and fi nancial resources for deployment in sectors with higher returns. It also reduces the need for humans to do physically hard, repetitive, or dangerous work. Such trends will be welcome in countries that are rapidly aging or where the population is declining, or in professions where skills are in short supply.
 Telemedicine and automated diagnostics, for instance, allow medical experts to serve many more people, even remotely in areas with a shortage of doctors. And fears of “technological unemployment” go back to the industrial revolution. Even such thinkers as the economist John Maynard Keynes and the writer Isaac Asimov submitted to this fallacy. Keynes, in the 1930s, predicted 15-hour workweeks by the end of the 20th century, and Asimov, in a 1964 essay, expected that one of the most pressing problems for humanity by 2014 would be boredom “in a society of enforced leisure.” Yet over the centuries, economies have adapted to massive changes in labor markets— the largest by far, being the shift out of agriculture. In 1910, there were 12 million farmworkers in the United States.
 One hundred years later, there were only 700,000 in a population more than three times larger. Still, nobody can predict the full impact of technological change in coming decades, which may be faster and broader than previous ones. What is clear, however, is that policy makers face a race between technology and education, and the winners will be those who encourage skill upgrading so that all can benefi t from digital opportunities. Engendering control: The gap between institutions and technology The internet was expected to usher in a new era of accountability and political empowerment, with citizens participating in policy making and forming self-organized virtual communities to hold government to account. These hopes have been largely unmet. While the internet has made many government functions more effi cient and convenient, it has generally had limited impact on the most protracted problems—how to improve service provider accountability (principal-agent problems) and how to broaden public involvement and give greater voice to the poor and disadvantaged (collective action problems).
 Whether citizens can successfully use the internet to raise the accountability of service providers depends on the context. Most important is the strength of existing accountability relationships between policy makers and providers, as discussed in the 2004 World Development Report, Making Services Work for Poor People. An examination of seventeen digital engagement initiatives for this Report fi nds that of nine cases in which citizen engagement involved a partnership between civil society organizations (CSOs) and government, Lit hu an ia Uz be kis tan Ma lta O EC D Mo ng oli a Ky rg yz Re pu bli c La tvi a Cy pr us Se yc he lle s Ta jik ist an Bu lga ria Do m ini ca n Re pu bli c Ge or gia Ur ug ua y Cr oa tia Pa ra gu ay W es t B an k a nd G az a Uk ra ine Ar ge nti na Ni ge ria Pa na m a Ni ca ra gu a Se rb ia So uth A fri ca Bo liv ia Ma ur itiu s Ma lay sia Ma ce do nia , F YR Co sta Ri ca Ec ua do r Ro m an ia Ind ia Th ail an d Al ba nia An go la El Sa lva do r Gu ate m ala Ba ng lad es h Ch ina Ca m bo dia Ne pa l Eth iop ia 0 20 40 60 80 100 Sh ar e of e m pl oy m en t t ha t c an be c om pu te riz ed (% ) Adjusted (technological feasibility + adoption time lags) Unadjusted (technological feasibility) 24 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 Grande do Sul, online voting increased voter turnout by 8 percentage points, but online voters were disproportionately wealthier and more educated (fi gure O.19). Even in developed countries, engaging citizens continues to be a challenge. Only a small, unrepresentative subset of the population participates, and it is often diffi cult to sustain citizen engagement.
 There is no agreement among social scientists on whether the internet disproportionately empowers citizens or political elites, whether it increases polarization, or whether it deepens or weakens social capital, in some cases even facilitating organized violence. The use of technology in governments tends to be successful when it addresses fairly straightforward information and monitoring problems. For more demanding challenges, such as better management of providers or giving citizens greater voice, technology helps only when governments are already responsive. The internet will thus often reinforce rather than replace existing accountability relationships between three were successful (table O.2). Of eight cases that did not involve a partnership, most failed.
 This suggests that, although collaboration with government is not a suffi cient condition for success, it may well be a necessary one. Another ingredient for success is effective offl ine mobilization, particularly because citizen uptake of the digital channels was low in most of the cases. For example, Maji Matone, which facilitates SMS-based feedback about rural water supply problems in Tanzania, received only 53 SMS messages during its fi rst six months of operation, far less than the initial target of 3,000, and was then abandoned. Political participation and engagement of the poor has remained rare, while in many countries the internet has disproportionately benefi ted political elites and increased the governments’ capacity to infl uence social and political discourse. Digital technologies have sometimes increased voting overall, but this has not necessarily resulted in more informed or more representative voting.

6). Closing the gap between changing technology and unchanging institutions will require initiatives that strengthen the transparency and accountability of governments. Making the internet universal, aff ordable, open, and safe First-generation ICT policies involving market competition, private participation, and light-touch regulation have led to near-universal access and affordability of mobile telephony, but have so far been less successful in spreading internet services. Much of the explanation lies in continued policy failures such as regulatory capture, troubled privatizations, ineffi cient spectrum management, excessive taxation of the sector, and monopoly control of international gateways. At the same time the absence of global consensus in dealing with the next-generation issues— such as privacy, cybersecurity, censorship, and internet governance—is resulting in more circumspect and diverse approaches to regulating the internet (box O.7 and fi gure O.
20). Supply-side policies: Availability, accessibility, and aff ordability A useful framework for analyzing supply-side ICT policies is to consider the value chain that stretches from the point where the internet enters a country (the fi rst mile), passes through that country (the middle mile) to reach the end user (the last mile), and certain hidden elements in between (the invisible mile). • The fi rst mile can be improved by liberalizing the market for satellite dishes and eliminating monopoly status over the international gateway and cable landing stations. • Strengthening the middle mile involves liberalizing the market for building and operating backbone networks, encouraging open access to the incumbent’s network, requiring all major infrastructure programs (such as roads, railways, pipelines, and energy distribution) to include provision for an optical fi ber link, setting up internet exchange points, and creating local caches for frequently used content. • Government policies can encourage the provision of last mile connectivity by permitting competing facilities, especially for intermodal competition (between cable, wireless, and digital subscriber line), and mandating the incumbent to make local access lines available to competitors at wholesale prices (local loop unbundling). • The most critical portion of the invisible mile involves spectrum management, which requires increasing the amount of spectrum available, ensuring competitive access, encouraging sharing of essential facilities, such as radio masts, and liberalizing the market for spectrum resale.
 In addition to pure ICT policies, almost everything that the private sector, citizens, or governments do on the internet requires some essential building blocks (box O.8). Demand-side policies: Open and safe internet use The challenges facing internet stakeholders today are as much about how networks are used (demand) as how they are built (supply). Global interconnectedness introduces new vulnerabilities in areas where coordination mechanisms are weak, still evolving, or based on nongovernment models. Threats to cybersecurity, and censorship are undermining confi dence and trust in the internet and increasing costs to businesses and governments, resulting in economic losses Source: WDR team, based on Spada and others 2015.

An early internet pioneer, John Gilmore, claimed, “the Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.”a And Bill Clinton in 2000 said, “trying to control the internet is like trying to nail Jell-O to a wall.
”b Yet private software vendors and state institutions have fi gured out ways to censor access to internet content, whether by shutting down the entire national web domain, as the Arab Republic of Egypt did in 2011 for fi ve days; by preventing access to specifi c domestic or foreign websites; or by targeting individuals’ blog posts or other social media postings. Google received 6,951 requests from governments in 2013 to remove content from search results, with the largest numbers from Turkey, the United States, and Brazil. Other countries, including China and the Islamic Republic of Iran, block Google and some other internet sites completely, although such restrictions may change in the future. Governments of all types restrict access to content such as child pornography, hate speech, insults, or criticisms of authority fi gures, challenges to cultural or religious morals, or reporting of uprisings or accidents. When accountable governments determine what should be censored, the result refl ects broad societal preferences. In autocratic countries, where use of the internet in government is often as high as in democratic countries (fi gure BO.
6.1), leaders face a dilemma. If they permit open discourse on the internet, they risk challenges to their authority. If they do not, they risk isolating themselves from the global information economy. This is a balancing act, and countries are becoming more sophisticated in calibrating their control—for example, censoring content that might encourage collective action, but not individual criticism. Internet fi ltering and censorship impose welfare and economic costs.
 First, the cost of censoring or fi ltering internet content diverts public funds from other uses. Monitoring domestic internet traffi c and selectively blocking foreign websites requires large fi nancial resources, technical knowhow, and dedicated staff —all of which could be deployed for more productive tasks. Second, fi ltering and methods to circumvent it can slow the speed of internet access, which hurts business users. Third, fi ltering can restrict access to economically or scientifi cally useful information, such as the Google Scholar search engine for academic papers— indispensable in universities and labs.

7 Is the internet a public good? The internet does not have all of the characteristics of a pure public good. Access to the internet often requires a fee, so individuals can be eff ectively excluded from its use. But once on the internet, the consumption of information by one user does not reduce its availability to others, so in that sense it is nonrivalrous (although capacity constraints can slow down access). One way to describe the internet is as a club good that is excludable but nonrivalrous, similar to cable television; or if bandwidth is scarce, as a private good with strong positive externalities—everyone benefi ts as more people come online. As more essential services and information migrate to the web, anyone without access almost becomes a second-class citizen.
 And all citizens benefi t when everyone else is better informed and when public services are provided electronically at lower cost. The private sector should take the lead in providing internet infrastructure and services because the business case is usually compelling. But public investment or intervention is sometimes justifi ed where the private sector is unable to provide aff ordable access. Historical precedents include the United States Communications Act of 1934, which called for universal “wire and radio communication service,” even in remote rural areas. Some countries have gone further. Finland, for example, has defi ned access to the internet at broadband speeds as a legal right and pursues a universal access policy.

(Box continues next page) Box O.8 The four digital enablers The WDR 2016 looks at how the internet increases productivity of businesses, opportunities for people, and the eff ectiveness of governments. Across these domains, four major enablers of digital development are critical. Four spotlights in the Report discuss their benefi ts and potential risks. Digital fi nance.
 Banks have been early and eager adopters of digital technologies, but many of the major innovations, such as online payments, mobile money, and digital currencies, have come from nonbank institutions, including telecom and internet companies. Some of these innovations took root fi rst in developing countries, where they overcame shortcomings in traditional fi nancial systems. Their benefi ts are distributed widely. Secure online payments fuel e-commerce. Electronic transfers reduce the cost of sending remittances. Peer-to-peer lending can vastly improve the fi nancial access of startups.
 Governments can make payments and social transfers at lower cost and with less fraud and leakage. However, if fi nancial regulations don’t keep pace with the rapid technological progress, these innovations could risk aff ecting the stability of the overall system. Social media. Social networks are fundamental to human society, and digital technologies have accelerated their formation. More than one-fi fth of the world’s population is now believed to be a member of one or more social media platforms. These platforms have been credited with facilitating economically benefi cial interactions, channeling users’ 28 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 Supply side Censorship and content filtering First mile Middle mile Last mile Invisible mile Cybersecurity Online privacy Internet governance Open-access ecosystem for innovation, tech hubs, and maker spaces Multistakeholder approach Global cooperation Awareness and investment Competition policies Effective regulation New technologies Public-private partnership Demand side Universalizing connectivity Figure O.

Some analysts think that social media played a critical role in recent events such as the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street, and thereby were instrumental in spreading democratic ideas, although many remain skeptical of their actual impact. There is still much to learn about the role social media can play in development. While a source for innovative ideas, social media also remain conduits for gossip, slander, misinformation, harassment, bullying, and crime. One important lesson is that the impact of social media on development seems to be highly specifi c to context.
 Variation in access to technology, education, and broader sociopolitical context matters. For instance, there is evidence that people in more autocratic countries are less likely to forward information (for example, by re-tweeting it). Digital identity. Being able to prove who you are may seem trivial, but it can be transformational for those excluded from jobs and services. Simple electronic identifi cation systems, often using biometric characteristics, have become an eff ective platform for secure bank transactions, voting, accessing social services, paying utility bills, and much more. Many countries, from Moldova to Nigeria and Oman, have introduced digital IDs.
 India is on track to register its entire population using its Aadhaar digital ID. In Estonia and other countries, thousands of diff erent types of public and private transactions are verifi ed with a unique electronic ID system, including legally binding contracts and voting in national elections. Data revolution. In harnessing data for development, attention focuses on two overlapping innovations: “big data” and open data. Big data are voluminous or fast, and they come from myriad sources—from satellites to sensors and from clouds to crowds. Big data analytics is being deployed to improve traffi c planning, estimate macro aggregates (also referred to as “nowcasting”), track the spread of epidemics, and improve credit scoring and job matching.
 Open data are those that are freely and easily accessible, machine-readable, and explicitly unrestricted in use. Governments are, or could be, the most important source of open data. Exuberant estimates of the current and potential economic value of big data and open data range from hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars per year. Yet sustained, impactful, scaled-up examples of big data and open data in developing countries are still relatively rare. Most big data are in private hands—large telecom and internet companies—which are reluctant to share it for fear of jeopardizing customer privacy or corporate competitiveness. Public agencies, too, are reluctant to share data, even when they have large public benefi ts.
 For example, of countries surveyed by the Open Data Barometer, one-third of the high-income countries and 85 percent of developing countries had made little or no progress in opening map data. Reasons include lack of technical skills, inadequate resources, and unwillingness to expose data to scrutiny. Box O.8 The four digital enablers (continued) 29OVERVIEW • Workers, entrepreneurs, and public servants who have the right skills to take advantage of opportunities in the digital world • An accountable government that effectively uses the internet to empower its citizens and deliver services. What these priorities highlight is that core elements of the development agenda—business regulations that ease market entry, education and training systems that deliver the skills that fi rms seek, and capable and accountable institutions—are becoming more important with the spread of the internet. Not making the necessary reforms means falling farther behind those who do, while investing in both technology and its complements is the key to the digital transformation.
 Internet use still varies greatly between countries, as does the quality of complements, and both tend to move up with income (fi gure O.21). Policy priorities change as countries move along the digital transformation (fi gure O.22). Countries where internet use is still low should lay the foundation—such as removing barriers to internet access and adoption, promoting basic and digital literacy, and using the internet for elementary government functions like provision of information. As countries transition to higher levels as well as higher security spending.
 For privacy and data protection, different countries are taking quite different approaches. That makes it harder to develop global services. Ensuring safe and secure access will require enhanced international collaboration, based on a multistakeholder model. Analog complements for a digital economy The internet has great potential to promote economic development, but only some of that potential has so far been realized. It disrupts established markets for products, services, and labor, and it disrupts the public sector—major reasons for the frequent reluctance to adopt and deploy the internet more broadly. But the benefi ts will come to those who embrace the changes the internet brings, not to those who resist them.
 And the way to get internet-enabled inclusive growth without long-term disruption is to strengthen the analog complements of digital investments (box O.9). Three policy objectives emerge from the analysis in the Report: • A business environment where fi rms can leverage the internet to compete and innovate for the benefi t of consumers Box O.9 Technology and complements: Lessons from academic research Recent research on growth, labor markets, and governance has taken a fresh look at the interplay between technology and other factors. These insights inform the discussion of policy priorities in this Report. Rules.
 Technology interacts with rules (such as regulations and standards) to create new ideas, such as new ways of producing goods and services. Technology is traded across markets and borders, while most rules are established locally. When it encounters rules that do not match, technology fails to deliver the expected benefi ts. New businesses can acquire internet technology to reduce prices and increase convenience for consumers, but they will not be able to enter the market and compete if local regulations protect incumbents. Skills. Technology interacts with workers’ skills.
 It allows routine tasks to be automated. Workers with the right abilities will leverage technology to become more productive. Consider a modern offi ce assistant who uses digital technologies to perform routine tasks quickly, and now spends far more time on personal interaction, complex scheduling, and other tasks that computers cannot easily perform. Institutions. Technology interacts with discretion. Many tasks in government can also be automated, but others involve a high degree of judgment.
 That means that even as the internet can make many public service functions more effi cient, the benefi ts will be limited when government offi cials and workers do not have the incentives to use the technology for the public good. Teacher attendance can be fairly easily monitored using digital technologies, but the quality of teaching depends on the teacher’s training, resources, ability, and motivation.

Regulations that promote competition and entry Digital adoption by fi rms varies among countries, and there are reasons for it to be slow. Most fundamentally, adoption requires knowledge about the technology, access to it, and knowledge of how to best apply it.
 But the most important driver is competitive pressure, as fi rms adopting new technology of internet use, they require effective competition regulation and enforcement—including easy fi rm entry and exit; a greater focus on advanced cognitive and socioemotional skills that are augmented by technology; and effective e-government delivery systems for provider management and citizen engagement. Countries in advanced stages of the digital transformation need to tackle some of the most challenging tasks. They need to fi nd ways to facilitate “new economy” competition, to ensure lifelong learning and respond to the changing nature of work, and to use Figure O.21 The quality of complements and technology rises with incomes Source: WDR 2016 team.

 Data at . Note: Technology is measured by the Digital Adoption Index (DAI). DAI is based on three sectoral subindexes covering businesses, people, and governments, with each subindex assigned an equal weight: DAI (Economy) = DAI (Businesses) + DAI (People) + DAI (Governments). Each subindex is the simple average of several normalized indicators measuring the adoption rate for the relevant groups. Similarly, complements is the average of three subindicators: starting a business; years of education adjusted for skills; and quality of institutions. EMERGING TRANSITIONINGN TRANSFORMING 0.

And to allow more innovative companies to enter markets easily, countries need to improve fi rm registration and create greater market transparency to reduce price collusion, market sharing, and rigged public procurement. E-government systems such as online business registration and e-procurement systems can simplify these processes and produce more openness. Increase competition through eff ective regulation and enforcement State control in economic sectors, barriers to entrepreneurship, and restrictions on trade and investment reduce the incentives for fi rms in protected sectors to use digital technologies. Most countries have a competition authority, although many were set up fairly recently and enforcement varies, especially when the state or politically connected fi rms benefi t from market restrictions.
 Moreover, the internet makes it easy to deliver services online from anywhere in the world, so how trade in services is regulated becomes increasingly important. Ethiopia, India, and Zimbabwe have the greatest restrictions on service trade, but many other countries restrict specifi c services such as legal or accounting tasks. Countries can increase the competitiveness of their economies and encourage greater use of digital technologies by gradually reducing market distortions while building up effective competition enforcement. This applies as raise productivity and those who don’t fall behind. This highlights the critical role of a country’s business climate. It includes laws and regulations that ensure easy entry and exit of fi rms, and an open trade regime that exposes companies to foreign competition and investment.
 There is a political economy dimension to this as well—special interests infl uence regulators to keep markets closed to competition. This lessens the need for fi rms to reach for the technological frontier. Where banks are heavily regulated and protected from new market entrants, they have less incentive to invest in effi ciency-boosting technology that might also help them serve customers better or reach new ones. But competition policy and enforcement are complex, and many low-income countries lack capacity to design and implement them effectively. Lower the barriers to digital adoption In countries where the digital economy is still emerging, the priority is to facilitate connectivity and develop the foundation for effective competition regulation. Although 74 mostly middle- and high-income countries have unilaterally removed tariffs on ICT capital goods, computers and smartphones are still treated as luxury goods in some countries, including Turkey, where taxation adds almost half to the price of mobile handsets.
33 Djibouti’s tariff on computers is 26 percent. Many countries treat their telecom fi rms as cash cows. Where fi rms may have limited knowledge about how the internet can improve their business, Note: ICT = information and communication technology. Figure O.22 Policy priorities for countries that are emerging, transitioning, or transforming EMERGING TRANSITIONING TRANSFORMING REGULATIONS that promote competition and entry SKILLS to leverage digital opportunities INSTITUTIONS that are capable and accountable Remove barriers to adoption Foundational skills and basic ICT literacy Mobile phone– based services and monitoring Competition regulation and enforcement Prepare for careers instead of jobs e-government delivery and citizen engagement Platform competition Facilitate lifelong learning Participatory policy making and digital collaboration 32 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 have the benefi t of being able to learn from the experience in the transforming countries before devising their own solutions. Skills for the digital economy Technological change means that many routine tasks will soon be done by machines.
 In contrast to previous episodes, the internet will also make many tasks carried out in white-collar jobs redundant. This puts a premium on different types of skills that automation complements rather than replaces (fi gure O.23). Education systems have been slow to respond to this challenge. Furthermore, the pace of change is fast, and the types of skills in demand change quickly. So workers will have to upgrade their skills frequently throughout their careers.
 These dynamics already play out in many transforming and some transitioning countries, but even for emerging countries it is not too early to prepare. Start early with foundational skills Skills development starts at birth and lasts a lifetime. Good parenting and early stimulation prepare children for school, where cognitive and socioemotional foundations are laid. Technology can play a role. Even though the record on simply providing laptops or tablets to students is mixed, videoconferencing with English speakers from the Philippines has improved learning among fi rst graders in Uruguay. Khan Academy provides resources for independent learning, and using a gaming approach to math teaching benefi ted grade four children in Mumbai.
 But in these and many other cases, one factor was more important: the quality of teaching. It is no coincidence that Finland, one of the most connected and best-performing countries in educational testing, uses very little technology in the classroom. It takes time to improve the quality of teachers, much to traditional businesses that use the internet as to internet platforms (box O.10). Tailor “new economy” regulations to ensure competition Internet fi rms create new business models and change market structure, posing new challenges for regulatory authorities. On-demand economy fi rms like Uber and Airbnb scaled up traditional ride sharing and subletting to a global scale.
 But regulators struggle to determine whether these companies are taxi or hotel companies or simply software providers. Offl ine competitors complain that they do not follow the same regulations. Where these industries tend to be overregulated and their markets distorted, as is often the case in the taxi business, this new competition can encourage a general overhaul of the industry. In the United States, cities like New York and states like Massachusetts have begun to develop appropriate regulations for these platforms, imposing safety and tax obligations but also reducing their competitors’ regulatory burdens. Similar regulatory puzzles are posed by fi rms such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google. For example, Google is known as a search engine company but is better described as an advertising fi rm.
 These fi rms confound conventional competition law because they do not act as traditional monopolies. Their services are often free to consumers. But given their dominance in the markets for online ads and books, they have considerable leverage over marketers and booksellers. This is similar to credit card companies’ position with respect to retailers. Research by economists such as Jean Tirole has shown that regulations in such industries must be carefully tailored to guarantee competition and avoid harm to consumers. These are very challenging problems, and most pressing in the transforming countries.
 Developing countries Box O.10 Opening the M-Pesa mobile money platform to competition Safaricom’s mobile money system is a well-known success story. It was able to grow quickly because Kenya’s banking regulators initially decided to take a hands-off approach. For seven years, Safaricom maintained a dominant position through exclusivity agreements locking agents into the system. Initially such arrangements were perhaps justifi ed because Safaricom incurred high costs developing the system. But in 2014, Kenya’s Competition Authority changed the rules and opened the system to alternative mobile operators.
 The transaction cost of transfers of up to K Sh 500 (US$4.91) fell from K Sh 66 to K Sh 44 (US$ 0.43). Source: Plaza, Yousefi , and Ratha 2015, for the WDR 2016. 33OVERVIEW that traditional education systems do not teach and that are hardest to measure. Many countries are rethinking their approach.
 Singapore is moving from a fairly rigid “effi ciency driven” model that tried to get the best results from inputs (teachers and fi nance) to an “ability driven” model that emphasizes project work and fewer assessments in place of frequent testing. Colombia’s Escuela Nueva model, now serving 5 million students in 16 countries, also focuses on group learning and problem solving. These approaches change the relationship between teacher and student. No longer simply sources of information, teachers now must instruct students in how to fi nd information and apply it in a new and unexpected context. This requires changes in teacher training. There are many examples of how digital technologies can assist teachers and students—by allowing group however.
 But technology can help here as well, as Rio de Janeiro’s Educopedia platform shows (box O.11). Using technology to closely guide teaching is a second-best option that can improve learning outcomes at modest cost where teacher training is unlikely to improve quickly. This is the model used by the for-profi t Bridge Academy in Kenya and elsewhere, where scripted instruction and automated administrative tasks help provide education at low cost. Although yet to be evaluated rigorously, such approaches hold promise to improve education. Rethink curricula and teaching methods Today’s education systems need to prepare students for a career and not only a job.
 Modern labor markets require creativity, teamwork, problem solving, and critical thinking in ever-changing environments—skills Cognitive Literacy, numeracy, and higher-order cognitive skills (for example, reasoning and creative thinking) Raw problem-solving ability versus knowledge to solve problems Verbal ability, numeracy, problem solving, memory, and mental speed Social and behavioral Socioemotional skills and personality traits Openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeability, and emotional stability Self-regulation, grit, mind-set, decision making, and interpersonal skills Technical Manual dexterity and the use of methods, materials, tools, and instruments Technical skills developed through postsecondary schooling or training or acquired on the job Skills related to specific occupations (for example, engineer, economist, IT specialist) Source: WDR 2016 team, adapted from Pierre, Sanchez Puerta, and Valerio 2014. Note: IT = information technology. Figure O.23 The types of skills needed in a modern economy Box O.11 Mobilizing technology in teaching in Rio’s Educopedia Rio de Janeiro’s education department developed the Educopedia online platform of lessons and other resources in 2010 to improve public school teaching. The system focuses as much on providing materials for the teacher to improve lessons as on giving students access to learning resources.
 The system uses multimedia resources including videos, interactive quizzes, and digital libraries. It now serves almost 700,000 students. It has yet to be formally evaluated, but together with other reforms it likely contributed to a more than 20-percent increase in the Basic Education Development Index in middle schools between 2009 and 2012. And 80 percent of Rio’s students agreed that Educopedia helps their learning eff orts. Source: Bruns and Luque 2014. 34 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 Improve informational services and monitoring Although internet access is still low in many emerging economies, mobile phones are widespread and have great potential for improving services.
 In the health sector, simple mobile phone–based reminders for taking medications have been effective for HIV patients in Malawi and for providing maternal health information in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Phones can support the monitoring of teachers or other government workers where absenteeism is a problem, even if monitoring alone is insuffi cient to improve service quality or outcomes (box O.12). Monitoring also becomes important in provision by nonstate entities in weak institutional contexts, where for-profi t or non-profi t organizations deliver services often funded by the government. And digital technologies can improve electoral accountability. In Afghanistan, Kenya, and Mozambique, election monitoring using cellphones helped uncover fraud and reduced election violence.
 This can complement— or, even in low-capacity settings, replace—more demanding approaches such as biometric identifi cation (see spotlight 4 in the full Report). Strengthen e-government delivery and citizen engagement Where investments to automate government service delivery have advanced, complementary improvements in regulations, interdepartmental cooperation, and streamlining become more important. Rather than just replicating cumbersome processes such as business regulations online, automation provides an opportunity for simplifying steps, increasing the impact as well as the transparency. E-procurement systems reduce the risk of corruption, but countries have invested less in them than in more complex budget or treasury systems. With greater internet use in a country, the scope for work among classrooms connected online, apps that stimulate creativity and problem solving, and games designed for education (“gamifi cation”). Develop advanced technological skills and encourage lifelong learning As more and more parts of the economy rely heavily on the internet, demand for advanced ICT skills will also grow.
 Only a small share of the workforce will be involved in developing software or systems design, but exposing children to coding and basic ICT concepts can infl uence career choices for some and impart a basic understanding to many. NairoBits, a youth organization in Kenya, exposes underprivileged young people from informal settlements to web design and other ICT skills, while AkiraChix reaches out to “geek girls.” Women tend to be underrepresented in ICT fi elds, and encouraging girls to enter such professions and ICT companies to create welcoming environments for women will increase the available workforce in fi elds with rising demand for labor. With technology likely continuing to get more advanced and affecting ever more occupations, workers need to continuously reevaluate and upgrade their skills. Much of that will happen outside the formal education system, but governments can provide the incentives for fi rms and workers to create the mechanisms for lifelong learning. Institutions that are accountable to citizens Although the internet has enabled many governments to provide some basic services more effi ciently, technology so far has not strengthened accountability.
 For policies, this implies a dual strategy: tailoring the application of digital technologies to environments with limited accountability in the short term, and strengthening institutions in the longer term (table O.3). Table O.3 Priority policies for better service delivery Emerging countries: Laying the foundation for more effective institutions Transitioning countries: Building capable and accountable institutions Transforming countries: Deepening collaborative institutions • Improve information services to citizens • Strengthen monitoring of and payment to providers • Establish population registers • Scale up nonstate provision of services • Increase electoral accountability • Strengthen government delivery systems • Strengthen provider management • Get regular user feedback on service quality • Increase transparency in priority areas • Improve collaboration across and beyond government • Enhance participatory policy making 35OVERVIEW collection of identifi able information creates privacy and security concerns. Automation changes work in ways that challenge existing social protections and reveal the inadequacy of existing labor laws. And scale economies create antitrust concerns.
 Digital safeguards that mitigate these risks become increasingly important as the digital transformation proceeds. Developing privacy policies The fl ood of data collected on the internet brings many benefi ts to consumers and citizens but also raises the risk of abuse through cybercrime, discrimination, or manipulation. As of 2014, some 107 countries had privacy laws, but only 51 of them were developing countries. The basic principles of privacy law are well established. They should give users more control (and perhaps co-ownership) over their data and make digital engagement with citizens also increases. As long as access is not universal, there is a risk of leaving those unconnected behind.
 But citizen feedback systems have reduced problems such as petty corruption or poor services in the Dominican Republic, Nigeria, and Pakistan. As one Kenyan water utility manager said, “By introducing an automated complaint management system we took a noose and put it around our own necks. We are now accountable!” Deepen collaboration and participatory policy making Even in countries with advanced e-government systems, their use remains surprisingly low. Many citizens prefer traditional ways of interacting with the government such as phones or mail, so parallel systems remain in place and savings go unrealized. Providing incentives such as faster tax refunds for e-fi ling or greater convenience through simplifi ed and closely integrated services across agencies increases their use.
 Estonia’s X-Road framework integrates services from all parts of government as well as private or civil society groups according to protocols that govern data exchange and security standards.34 Practically any transaction—from paying the parking meter to voting in national elections—can be done from a smartphone. Tangible benefi ts for citizens will lead to universal use of e-government services, making such platforms also suitable for broad-based participatory policy making. Digital safeguards Strengthening analog complements will ensure a high social and economic return from digital investments. But a downside risk remains. Returning to the Report’s framework (fi gure O.
24), large-scale Box O.12 Can continuous monitoring and small sanctions improve provider performance? Traditional monitoring systems are expensive and complex. New technologies lower these costs, allowing rewards or punishment to be more immediate and frequent. The idea comes from criminal justice innovations. Usually lawbreakers face a low probability of being caught, but a large punishment.
 When people face a high probability, but fi nes are lower, violations become rarer. The idea could be extended to public service monitoring. In Niger, a well-designed monitoring system enabled by mobile phones motivated teachers because they felt their far-away superiors cared about their work and looked out for them.

24 Digital safeguards in the WDR’s framework 36 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 Governing the internet The internet emerged from U.S. government research in the 1970s, but as it grew into a global network of networks, its governance structure has evolved. Today, the internet is managed by an international coalition of governments, industry, technical experts, and civil society—in what is referred to as the multistakeholder model. U.S.
 users are now a small minority of total internet users, given the dramatic growth in the number of users in developing countries, especially in Asia. Many countries are demanding more meaningful representation in the discussions of how the internet should be governed. In addition, the lack of trust among nations following the Edward Snowden episode, the surveillance by state agencies, and the increasing confl icts between national policy and regulations and global norms have raised questions about internet governance. Several countries have advocated for a multilateral model of governance, which would give national governments greater power in overseeing the internet, much the same way the United Nations, the International Telecommunication Union, or the World Bank are currently governed. The promoters of “multistakeholderism” argue that state control of the internet would not leave space for the range of players currently involved in internet governance and could pave the path for greater suppression of privacy and restrictions on access to information and on rights of free expression. The inability of the stakeholders of the internet to reach a consensus on future governance mechanisms can be costly; some have even suggested that the internet is at risk of splitting up into several local or regional internets.
 The broad-based, participatory approach involving all stakeholders is seen by many to be best suited to ensure an effi cient and unrestricted global fl ow of information essential for economic development. Creating a global digital market The internet is encouraging more cross-border exchanges of goods and services, allowing consumers and fi rms to bypass national borders. But crossborder issues—such as barriers to data fl ows and uncoordinated intellectual property rights regimes—are impairing the growth of internet fi rms and robbing consumers of gains from increased digital trade. This has also meant that many startups from smaller countries with relatively modest domestic markets, particularly in Europe (box O.13), are moving their business to the United States as soon as they achieve a certain scale. The small scale imposed by cross-border barriers may also partly explain why e-commerce fi rms are opting out at the point of collection easier.
 Even when such laws exist, preventing abuse is diffi cult, especially where legal and enforcement capacity is weak. Adapting social protection systems to changing labor markets Better skills will help many workers cope with the effects of internet-enabled automation. But changes in the labor market also require rethinking social protection and tax systems. The on-demand economy leads to more informal employment, transferring insurance and occupational obligations to freelance workers. Strict labor regulations, common in developing countries, and overreliance on labor taxation encourage faster automation by making hiring more expensive. It would be better to strengthen workers’ protection independently from work contracts by delinking social insurance from employment, offering independent social assistance, and helping workers retrain and fi nd new employment quickly.
 In many countries this requires major reforms. And countries just starting to develop social protection systems and deepening labor laws should design them for the 21st-century workplace, rather than copy what industrialized countries created for a very different world of work. Building antitrust enforcement capacity Regulatory reform that improves the business environment is the fi rst priority. But even in countries with comprehensive competition policies, including easy market entry and exit, there will be cases in which mergers, collusion, or discriminatory pricing harm consumers by creating overly dominant enterprises or by keeping innovative competitors out. Because the internet is still quite new and its impact on markets constantly evolving, developing the capacity to investigate and prosecute complex violations to competition law will take time. Cases pursued in high-income countries can provide guidance.
 Global cooperation to solve global problems The internet is truly an international network. It can be better managed with coordination across nations and serve as a powerful platform to facilitate global cooperation. Three priority areas are governing the internet, creating a global digital market, and providing global public goods—including those that promote poverty reduction and environmental sustainability. 37OVERVIEW problems—climate change, ozone depletion, air pollution, epidemics—are features of globally interconnected environmental, economic, and social systems and require global cooperation. What’s the role of development agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and international organizations in a world where their fi nancial heft is small? The data and technology revolutions arrive in time to bridge the gap between their resources and ambition by amplifying the impacts of action and including more people in the formulation and execution of plans.
 But for this to work, development actors must tackle policy constraints, internal and external. Start with the how of development operations. With new technologies, development agencies can be more inclusive by tapping on benefi ciary wisdom in designing interventions. They can raise effi ciency by using rapid feedback to refi ne and improve their actions through trial and error. But these approaches won’t come easily in organizations that emphasize spending and outputs over results, have burdensome structures for accountability, and see any failures as damning rather than informative. If traditional agencies can’t adapt, some of their business may be taken up by disruptive newcomers.
 Next, the what. Development agencies can support information services that help individuals and systems managers make better decisions in ways that promote poverty reduction. These services have fi xed often losing money in Africa while being profi table in China and India. Some countries are considering regulations that make it legally binding for data of or about their citizens to reside within their national borders, also referred to as data localization or data nationalism. While such barriers may stem from legitimate concerns about privacy and security for their citizens’ information, they can be costly. A study of six developing countries and the EU-28 found that such regulations can reduce GDP by up to 1.
7 percent, investments up to 4.2 percent, and exports by 1.7 percent.35 Restrictions on data fl ows face the risk of becoming a new tool for protectionism—disguised to impede trade and economic activity or to encourage domestic data-driven sectors. At the same time, countries should make it easier for fi rms to protect their intellectual property (IP) rights—but within limits that do not give excessive protections to large, wellconnected fi rms at the cost of stifl ing innovation and creativity. The process to apply for IP licenses should be harmonized, streamlined, and globalized—so fi rms need only to register their patent or trademark in any signatory country to protect it across member countries.
 Providing global public goods Sustainable development and poverty reduction are a focus of global partnerships. Many environmental Box O.13 European Union: A fragmented market for digital trade Despite being a single market with free fl ows of goods, services, and people for many decades, the European Union (EU) still functions like a fragmented market for digital trade. Consumers in the EU prefer to shop from online stores within their national borders. While 44 percent of consumers made an online purchase from a domestic business in 2014, only 15 percent did so from a business in another EU country. Firms also face many diffi culties selling their goods and services online into other EU markets.
 For example, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Malmo, Sweden, are separated only by an 8-kilometer bridge, but a package sent from Copenhagen to Malmo costs €27, whereas the same package sent from Malmo to Copenhagen costs €42. Firms facing large costs to adapt to various national laws believe that the costs outweigh the benefi ts of selling online. In May 2015, the European Commission (EC) announced plans to create a Digital Single Market, in three main policy areas. First, the EC wants to increase the access for consumers and fi rms to these digital goods and services by facilitating e-commerce, improving parcel delivery, and dealing with geoblocking, where access to online services or content is restricted to specifi c countries. Second, it will examine the regulatory environment for telecoms, media, online platforms, and data protection. Third, it will encourage more ICT investment and innovation through better standards and interoperability, and more use of “big data” and cloud computing.
 If EU reforms to create a common digital market are successful, they could become a model for other world regions.

Diffi culties in measuring technology’s role are another partial explanation for the gap between individual cases of substantial benefi ts and modest macro effects. Technology impact is diffused throughout the economy, the world of work, and many aspects of personal life. And many benefi ts come in the form of higher quality or convenience—nonmonetary benefi ts not refl ected in GDP numbers.

So the private sector will tend either to shy away from providing these services, or will price them at a level that shuts out poor people who could benefi t. One area where the need for international cooperation and support is particularly acute is the collection and distribution of data on weather, climate, and transboundary water fl ows, which are critically important to tackle climate change, improve natural resource management, and support agriculture. External agents and international organizations can help with targeted funding—for instance, fi lling the gap in African weather stations.
 They can support the complementary investments for information platforms. And they can fi nd ways to encourage public and private sectors, in both the developed and developing world, to open and share data for public goods. Reaping digital dividends for everyone Digital technologies are transforming the worlds of business, work, and service delivery. These advances are making the leading parts of the economy and society more productive—even as many still wait for the most basic benefi ts of the digital revolution. This Report argues that to ensure that everyone will reap the dividends of the internet, focusing on access to technology is essential but far from suffi cient. Why?
 Because technology needs to be complemented by improvements in areas that determine whether fi rms, people, and governments can make effective use of new digital tools. The analog foundation cannot be strengthened overnight. It requires overcoming some of the most protracted development challenges: how to create an environment for fi rms to thrive, how to build effective education and training systems, and how to make service providers more responsive to citizens. The stakes are high, because the digital revolution leaves behind countries that do not make the necessary reforms. For those that do, technology investments will produce ample digital dividends, and these dividends will be widely shared among all stakeholders. Notes 1.

S P O TL IG H T 1 42 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 To understand how the internet and related digital technologies affect development, it is important to understand what they actually do. It turns out that old economics explains the new economy quite well. In 1937, Ronald Coase—who would receive the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1991—published “The Nature of the Firm,” which asked why fi rms exist.1 Even though economics considers the market the most effi cient way to organize economic activity, large companies tend to operate in a self-contained command-andcontrol environment.
 What Coase realized was that using the price mechanism incurred a number of additional costs, such as the effort of fi nding buyers or suppliers, and negotiating contracts and enforcing them. As long as the cost of making an exchange of an intermediate good or service in the market is larger than the profi t from that exchange, it is rational for a fi rm to produce it in-house. Most of these Coasian transaction costs stem from the costs of acquiring and sharing information. Many years later, the internet and other digital technologies have vastly reduced many of these costs, with major implications for market and nonmarket exchanges among businesses, people, and governments. This spotlight describes how the decline of these transaction costs affects economic development. But fi rst, a working defi nition of the technologies covered in this Report.
 While the World Development Report 2016 is not about specifi c technologies, it generally covers the impacts of digital technologies and services that greatly facilitate the creation, storage, analysis, and sharing of data and information. The Report uses the terms “digital technologies,” “internet,” and sometimes “information and communication technologies (ICTs)” somewhat interchangeably. “Internet” emphasizes the central importance of connectivity. Faster computers and cheaper storage are useful in their own right. But the reason that all of these technologies have had such a massive impact on almost all aspects of life is that these devices are linked so that information can be distributed and accessed effortlessly from anywhere. The internet promotes inclusion, effi ciency, and innovation Technology development has vastly reduced the cost and increased the speed of all the digital technologies that drive the internet—in some cases by more than 30 percent per year.
 This continues a long-term and accelerating decline in the cost of computing. William Nordhaus, in 2007, estimated that since the era of manual computing in the mid-19th century, the cost of a computation has dropped by a factor of between 1.7 trillion and 73 trillion.2 The result has been a far lower cost of acquiring and using information, which in turn has lowered transaction costs—and often as a consequence, production costs. By lowering the cost of these transactions, the internet affects economic development in three major, interrelated ways. One is that the internet can help overcome information problems.
 In some instances, a mutually benefi cial transaction might not take place because the two parties simply had no way to fi nd each other or acquire enough information to confi dently proceed with the transaction; in such cases, the transaction costs are essentially infi nitely high. The emergence of e-commerce platforms has made it much easier for small producers to fi nd customers, and even for individuals who cannot use ENABLING DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT How the internet promotes development S P O TL IG H T 1 S P O TL IG H T 1 43HOW THE INTERNET PROMOTES DEVELOPMENT S P O TL IG H T 1 43 traditional marketing tools like advertising or trade shows. Rural artisans in Morocco, some of whom are illiterate, have set up Anou, a web shop for their products that has attracted customers from all over the world.3 The internet, by vastly lowering search and information costs, creates these markets. This has many benefi ts, but the most important, arguably, is that it fosters inclusion—in new and existing markets, in social interaction, or in government service delivery systems. Inclusion for the individual usually means expansion of a market by those on the other side of the transaction, such as a fi rm or a government that now serves more citizens.
 Even when search costs are low, transactions often do not take place when one party to a transaction has much more information than the other. Take the example of extending credit to poor farmers. The high cost of gathering information about poor borrowers is a major deterrent to lending by banks.4 The poor therefore need to rely on informal moneylenders who charge exorbitant interest rates. But many of the poor possess mobile phones. Companies such as Cignifi have developed methods to judge the creditworthiness of a potential borrower based on their mobile phone records.
 In Ghana, Cignifi worked with the World Savings and Retail Banking Institute to correlate savings behavior with mobile phone records.5 The goal is to promote fi nancial inclusion among the unbanked, by assessing the savings potential and creditworthiness of low-income households that own mobile phones but have no access to fi nancial products. There is a large literature on information problems and asymmetries by economists such as George Akerlof, Michael Spence, and Joseph Stiglitz, who jointly received the Nobel Prize in 2001. Akerlof was motivated to write his most famous paper, “The Market for Lemons,” published in 1970, by the fact that when buying a used car, the seller usually has much more information about the car’s quality than the buyer.6 Today, internet sites such as Carfax in the United States let buyers research the history of a car online, including whether it has been in an accident, how many owners it has had, and whether it has complete service records. The second mechanism is closest to the original Coasian concepts of transaction and coordination costs.
 Most transactions were already taking place before the digital revolution, but the internet has made them faster, cheaper, or more convenient. In other words, lower transaction costs raise the productivity of existing factors of production. The internet has brought numerous effi ciency improvements to businesses that, while individually often not spectacular, add up to enormous aggregate benefi ts. Better communication and information processing improves supply chain management and enterprise resource planning. Retailers now share point-of-sale data with vendors globally in real time, essentially shifting inventory management to their suppliers. Tracking, navigation, and scheduling software improve capacity utilization for logistics and transport companies.
 The delivery company UPS famously saves about 1 million gallons of gas each year by using routing technology that minimizes left turns, where vehicles are often held up by oncoming traffi c. Estonia’s X-Road is an e-government system that offers nearly 3,000 services from 900 government and private sector agencies to the citizens online. The number of queries made through X-Road increased from half a million in 2003 to 340 million by 2014. As a result, each citizen saves about fi ve working days per year, adding up to 7 million workdays overall. For many internet-based businesses or services, fi xed up-front costs can be high, but once the online platform is in place, each additional customer, user, or transaction incurs very little extra cost. The marginal transaction cost essentially drops to zero because what previously involved routine human labor can now be fully automated.
 This has led to enormous innovation—the third mechanism—that is typically associated with the “new economy.” These dynamics have important implications related to the nature of the scale economies that make this innovation possible, the new business models (and competition problems) this has spawned, and the unprecedented scope for customization of services. The cost structure of many internet businesses gives rise to various types of scale economies.7 Supply-side scale economies, where costs drop with an increasing number of transactions, favor the emergence of natural monopolies. Water or electric utilities operate in similar environments. Because entry costs are also high, such sectors tend to be regulated.
 Many internet-based markets—such as web searches, mobile payments, or online bookstores—are also dominated by a few fi rms. At least initially, entry costs are low and such websites can scale up extremely quickly, even with relatively few resources. Facebook reached half a billion users with just 500 engineers.8 Walmart had to build 276 stores before reaching US$1 billion in sales; Amazon needed just six warehouses to reach US$3 billion in 2003.9 For many of these fi rms, the product they sell is also purely digital, such as digital music (Spotify in Sweden), e-books (Amazon in the United States), or online news and data.10 Others sell highly automated brokerage or matchmaking services for travel, jobs, S P O TL IG H T 1 44 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 merchandise, or ride sharing.
 Many of these business models have been replicated by fi rms in developing countries. But even there, in many of these markets, a high degree of concentration has occurred in the last 10 years. While in the early 2000s internet traffi c was distributed across thousands of companies, today just 30 companies account for over half of peak internet traffi c in the United States—much of this is due to the explosion of video content.11 Scale economies also exist on the demand side. For many services, the more people use it, the more valuable it becomes to its users and the more new users it attracts. Social media sites or digital payment systems like M-Pesa in Kenya are examples.
 With supply-side scale economies, average cost drops with scale. With demand-side scale economies, average revenue or utility rises with scale. These network externalities benefi t users, but can also create lock-in effects; to switch to a different social media platform imposes very little actual cost on the user, but would require collective action by a large number of interconnected users to maintain the same level of utility.12 Ultralow marginal transaction costs have powered new business models. Many of these are web services operating platform markets or two-sided markets. The platform owner has two different customers, typically the user of the service and an advertiser who wants to reach the user.
 Rather than charging both, it makes sense to provide the service for free and increase the user base (at very little cost), which makes the other side of the market more lucrative. A classic 2003 paper by Jean-Charles Rochet and Jean Tirole shows that two-sided markets exist in many industries. 13 But the economics of the internet have led to a particularly effective grand bargain between platform owners, users, and advertisers (fi gure S1.1). This model raises diffi cult questions about competition policy. Because platforms often do not charge for a service, they do not actually exert monopoly power over users.
 But they could do so over vendors buying advertising space. Just four companies—Google, Facebook, Baidu, and Alibaba—now account for half of all digital advertising revenue. And, dominant platforms could exert monopsony power (because there is a single or are just a few buyers). For instance, book publishers depend on Amazon for a crucial share of their total sales. Because most processes can be automated, there is tremendous scope for customization of services. Most online behavior is automatically monitored— sometimes anonymously, sometimes not.
 The massive data volumes collected by internet platforms have created a whole new branch of economics— nano-economics—which studies individual, computermediated transactions.14 The main benefi t to the user is that services can be tailored to individual needs and preferences—although at the cost of giving up privacy. For the seller, it allows more targeted advertising and even price discrimination, when automated systems can analyze user behavior to determine willingness to pay and offer different prices to different users. There is ample evidence that e-commerce sites vary prices based on users’ estimated location, browsing history, and even the type of device they use for access.15 Information can fl ow both ways, since many commercial websites provide feedback mechanisms that help the provider improve the product, but also allow the customer to assess the quality of a product or service. Businesses use such tools extensively, but the public sector has been slow to adapt them for better service delivery.
 Finally, in many, if not most, transactions, more than one of the three mechanisms may be at work. For example, transactions on internet platforms typically involve all three. While the platform running a fully automated service is the main innovation, one side of the transaction often involves a provider of a service, such as an informal driver working through a ride sharing platform or a freelance worker in a remote location. For them, it will often be a case of inclusion in an otherwise inaccessible market transaction. The customer at the other end of the transaction experiences increased effi ciency. A service that was typically available through another channel is now more convenient, faster, or cheaper.

1.1 provides a simple graphic representation of the eff ect of falling transaction costs. Imagine all transactions in an economy arranged by the transaction costs they impose, from most costly on the left to least costly on the right. The upper curve shows these costs before the introduction of the internet. With the internet, many such costs drop, and three things can happen. On the left, there were some transactions for which the cost was so high in the pre-internet era, that there was essentially no market—the transactions did not take place.
 Making these transactions possible promotes inclusion as well as market expansion. For example, women with small children or persons with disabilities have sometimes been unable to engage in work outside the home, but can now engage in telework.a Many poor or disadvantaged populations will now receive public services because governments can use digital IDs to verify their eligibility.b And skilled workers and small fi rms in poor countries can trade their services in global markets, where they can earn higher returns. These are all examples where the internet, by overcoming information problems, contributes to greater inclusion. In the middle of the fi gure, the internet lowers the cost of existing transactions—that is, those occurring even before the advent of the internet.
 This raises the effi ciency of a vast range of activities. Purchasing goods, executing bank transactions, searching for a home or a job, paying taxes, or renewing a driver’s license generally used to require a trip to a shop or offi ce, but can now be done with a click or a tap. Similarly, the internet has reduced costs for businesses when connecting and negotiating with buyers or suppliers, fi nding workers through job-matching services, and monitoring contract fulfi llment or employee performance. Many of the same benefi ts extend to governments, as well. These individually unspectacular effi ciency gains may, in the aggregate, represent the lion’s share of benefi ts from the internet. The most dramatic impact of the internet is on the right-hand side of the fi gure.
 For many internet-based businesses or services, fi xed up-front costs can be high, but once the online platform is in place, each additional customer, user, or transaction incurs very little extra cost. In many cases, the marginal transaction cost is essentially zero because what previously involved routine human labor can now be fully automated. For purely digital products, such as e-books, the marginal production cost is also close to zero. This cost structure gives rise to various types of scale economies, often reinforced by network eff ects, where the more users a system has, the more useful it becomes.c Most of the so-called “new economy” fi rms are in this space.

It promotes the inclusion of fi rms in the world economy by enabling more fi rms to trade new products to new destinations.
 For instance, fi rms selling their goods online through Alibaba, China’s leading e-commerce company, are smaller and younger and export more products to different destinations than fi rms selling offl ine. It raises effi ciency by allowing fi rms to make better use of their capital and labor. For instance, realtime data help equipment manufacturers in China turn over their inventory stocks fi ve times faster than suppliers not connected to the internet. It enhances innovation by enabling fi rms to exploit scale effects through online platforms and services that compete with conventional business models in retail, transport, lodging, and banking, to name a few. These three mechanisms thus boost growth by expanding trade, increasing capital and labor utilization, and intensifying competition (fi gure 1.1).
1 But the benefi ts are neither automatic nor assured. Despite great opportunities, fi rms’ use of digital technologies differs substantially across countries due to variations in skills and infrastructure and in barriers to competition and market entry. Competition from China induced fi rms in member-countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to adopt new technologies to escape the competition from low-cost producers, accounting for 15 percent of their investment from 2000–07. Manufacturing fi rms in Mexico responded to higher competition from low-cost Chinese producers in the domestic and the U.S. (export) market by using digital technologies more intensively and productively.
 Manufacturing fi rms in Brazil facing an increase in competition are more likely to invest in e-commerce systems. Firms in Africa facing an increase in competition are more likely to use the internet to market their products or to manage their inventories. Firms’ use of digital technology also Digital technology creates opportunities to accelerate growth, but these are often missed because fi rms in sectors where technology’s impact is greatest are frequently protected from innovative competitors. Firms that face more competition use digital technology more intensively and effectively—it enables them to reduce their costs to outperform their competitors. But fi rms in developing countries do not necessarily have the incentive to adopt new technologies to increase their cost effectiveness because they are often protected from domestic or foreign competition. And it is precisely in protected sectors such as retail and wholesale trade, fi nance, transport, or public utilities where digital technology can increase productivity the most.
 Harnessing those opportunities thus requires policies that lower the barriers to competition and market entry, in addition to investments in infrastructure and skills. Only then will fi rms use new digital technologies more intensively and effectively—and only then will countries avoid falling behind. Firms across the world are becoming more connected. For instance, the share of fi rms with at least fi ve employees using broadband internet in lower- middle-income countries rose from 39 percent to 68 percent from 2006–09 to 2010–14. And the growth rates and valuations of internet fi rms across the world are surging. Less visibly, but more importantly, digital technologies have transformed traditional production structures, facilitating new, more cost-effective processes.
 Indeed, the vast majority of effi ciency gains emerge outside the information and communication technology (ICT) sector, where fi rms use the internet to sell and market their products online or share real-time information with suppliers to minimize their inventory and with customers to optimize their services. The impact of digital technology on economic growth is mediated through three mechanisms— CHAPTER 1 Accelerating growth 51ACCELERATING GROWTH More than 90 percent of fi rms in high-income countries, and 46 percent in low-income countries, used electronic mail (e-mail) to communicate with clients between 2010 and 2014 (fi gure 1.2, panel b). The differences are greater when the internet is used for more demanding business activities. For instance, 42 percent of fi rms in upper-middle-income countries had a website, and 30 percent purchased goods or services online. Only 14 percent of fi rms in low-income countries purchased goods or services online, and only 11 percent delivered them online.
 Developing countries such as Vietnam have invested heavily in the rollout of (broadband) internet infrastructure in recent years. As a result, the share of manufacturing and service fi rms in Vietnam using the internet for business activities rose to 71 percent in 2007 and 86 percent in 2011. Internet access was up almost uniformly across all provinces (map 1.1).2 But many advanced digital technologies have not yet diffused widely, even in high-income countries. Almost all European fi rms with at least 10 employees use a personal computer (PC) and broadband internet.
 About 80 percent have a website, and 60 percent use supply chain management software that is integrated with the ICT systems of customers or suppliers outside of the fi rm (fi gure 1.3). But less than 20 percent varies with barriers to competition across sectors in the same country. Business process outsourcing in the Philippines has few entry barriers, and fi rms use digital technology intensively—the retail sector on the other hand faces substantial restrictions to entry and is dominated by incumbent fi rms, with few of them offering e-commerce. Harnessing the full growth potential of digital technology is thus predicated not just on investments in skills (chapter 2) and infrastructure (chapter 4) but also on reforming regulatory barriers by overcoming vested interests to encourage all fi rms to compete by investing in these new technologies (chapter 5). This also involves overhauling regulatory regimes in the digital economy, especially in sectors where online and offl ine fi rms increasingly compete, such as retail, transportation, printing and publishing, lodging, and fi nance.
 The initial entry of internet fi rms into these sectors promotes competition and can disrupt traditional monopolies. But internet fi rms can be prone to anticompetitive behaviors by exploiting scale and network effects. So the regulators need to level the regulatory regime to guarantee free market entry and prevent market shares from becoming too concentrated. The greater digital adoption therefore needs to be accompanied by unifi ed standards, full interoperability, and competition across platforms and contracts. The goal is to have fi rms’ use of the internet promote competition, which encourages more fi rms to use the internet. But that will not happen if vested interest groups are strong enough to capture regulators and create new barriers to competition and technology adoption.
 A level playing fi eld for business was always important—digital technologies have made it an imperative. Connected businesses The adoption of broadband internet has increased for fi rms in all country income groups. Almost all fi rms in high-income OECD countries (with at least fi ve employees) used a broadband internet connection between 2010 and 2014, with usage rising from 79 percent in 2006–09 to 92 percent in 2010–14 (fi gure 1.2, panel a). The increase between the two periods was even stronger for lower-income countries. The share of fi rms in lower-middle-income countries using broadband internet rose from 39 percent in 2006–09 to 68 percent in 2010–14.
 The share in low-income countries in 2010–14 is still fairly low (38 percent), but with some notable exceptions. Figure 1.1 A framework for the internet and economic growth Source: WDR 2016 team. RISK: DIVERGENCE AND MONOPOLY POWER International trade Capital utilization Competition Overcome information barriers DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES Augment existing factors Generate economies of scale EFFICIENCY INNOVATIONINCLUSION 52 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 of European fi rms purchase or sell goods or services online and use any cloud computing services. Only 8 percent use cloud computing services to acquire management software and computing power. And only 3 percent use radio frequency identifi cation devices, which are wireless microchips used to connect machines with one another (the “internet of things”).
 The use of digital technologies is still basic in most developing countries. In Vietnam, only 2.2 percent of all fi rms sold their goods or services online in 2011 (up from 0.6 percent in 2007). In Turkey, 92 percent of all fi rms with at least 10 employees had internet access in 2012, but only 71 percent used it for banking; 55 percent had a website; and 10 percent made orders or reservations online. In Mexico, 84 percent of fi rms with at least 10 employees used the internet in 2012, but only 26 percent of employees had internet access; and only 13 percent of fi rms used e-commerce for purchases, and 9 percent for sales.
 In Brazil, 63 percent of all manufacturing fi rms with at least 10 employees bought or sold products online, but only 28 percent provide an online catalogue or feature online orders on their website; and only 6 percent allow online payments. And less than half the manufacturing fi rms in Brazil have an information technology (IT) department or use software supporting management, either for resource planning or customer relations.3 Source: Hussain (2015) based on World Bank Enterprise Surveys, various years.

 Share of firms using broadband internet, 2006–14 More productive fi rms are early adopters of the internet More productive fi rms are more likely to adopt the internet and use it more intensively. The percentage of fi rms having a website and selling or buying goods or services online tends to increase with fi rm productivity in all country income groups (fi gure 1.4).4 Firms in the most productive quintile are most likely to have a website or use broadband internet.5 The correlation between fi rm productivity and e-commerce is stronger in upper-middle-income countries. In lower-middle-income countries, less than 13 percent of the most productive fi rms sold or bought goods or services online.
 The results suggest that only the more productive fi rms in developing countries overcome (unobservable) barriers to using the internet more effectively. African fi rms using the internet have on average 3.7 times higher labor productivity than nonusers and 35 percent higher total factor productivity (TFP) (fi gure 1.5). But the most productive fi rms that do not use the internet have TFPs comparable to highproductivity internet users. The differences are also found to be larger for labor productivity than for TFP, implying that African fi rms using the internet are not only more productive but also more capital intensive.

 Data at . Note: The fi gure shows the relative distribution of productivity for fi rms that use the internet and fi rms that do not. Productivity is measured by sales per worker, estimated at the sector level. Results are similar using value added instead of sales. Observations on the 45-degree line indicate that fi rms in both groups have the same productivity. Firms not using the internet are less productive (above the 45-degree line) throughout the distribution of labor productivity.
 For instance, the median productivity fi rm among nonusers has about the same productivity as the 20th percentile fi rm of the productivity distribution among internet users. The surveys are representative of all fi rms with at least fi ve employees in six African countries: the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. Figure 1.5 African fi rms using the internet are more productive, 2014 Distribution of sales per worker 55ACCELERATING GROWTH (5.4 percent) in developing countries, consistent with their less intensive use of ICTs. Firms in developing countries have considerable room to adopt digital solutions that have led to growth in high-income countries, such as using the internet for e-commerce or inventory management.
 The true contribution to growth can be larger if ICT complements other production factors, but also smaller if it substitutes for them. Productivity externalities beyond measured production factors are ascribed to the residual TFP growth. A necessary (but not suffi cient) condition to accurately measure productivity externalities is analysis at the fi rm level. Assessing the growth opportunities of the internet warrants more detailed analysis of the mechanisms for it to affect growth. Against this background, it is instructive to draw insights from the economics of the internet as well as from the past industrial revolutions (see box 1.2).
 The internet reduces transaction costs, allowing fi rms to enter new markets, enhance their effi ciency, and exploit economies of scale, leading to innovation. It does this by reducing information frictions, search costs, and the costs to communicate. The decline can be dramatic if fi rms adapt their business models to automate data-intensive transactions, generating economies of scale. More trade, higher productivity, and greater competition Digital technologies raise growth, but quantifying their aggregate impact is diffi cult The accumulation of ICT capital accounted for almost 20 percent of global growth between 1995 and 2014, growth accounting approaches suggest. However, the results need to be regarded with some caution, as the approach involves some severe measurement problems (box 1.1).
 The impact was largest between 2005 and 2009, when it raised aggregate annual growth by 1.3 percentage points a year in developing countries, out of a total of 6.6 percent among these countries, or 19 percent (fi gure 1.7). And among high-income countries, it contributed 0.4 percentage points out of 1.
2 percent, or 38 percent.10 Digital technologies accounted for a higher share of aggregate growth in high-income countries, pointing to greater digital use. The accumulation of ICT capital accounted on average for 27 percent of aggregate growth (2.1 percent) from 1995 to 2014 in highincome countries and 14 percent of aggregate growth Source: Hussain (2015) based on World Bank Enterprise Surveys, various years.

The statistics are based on about 100 countries (some countries being surveyed twice) and 27,035 fi rms selling online, 94,083 with a website, and 43,628 using broadband.

Box 1.
1 Tracing back growth to a single, new technology suff ers from severe measurement problems My view is that pinpointing precisely which (explanatory) variables matter for growth is impossible. —Robert Barro, 2015 The limited number of observations relative to the seemingly open-ended list of other potential growth correlates at the country level makes it almost impossible to reject alternative interpretations of the same macroeconomic correlation. Faster-growing countries, for instance, have more resources and economic opportunities available to invest in information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure; thus, the direction of causality may run from growth to ICT rather than the other way around. Moreover, there are severe endogeneity issues, since diff erences in the provision of ICT infrastructure across countries are likely to be positively correlated with (time-varying) unobservable, country-specifi c GDP correlates such as government accountability and other institutional factors, leading to an upward bias in ICT-growth elasticity estimates. Cross-country growth regressions are not an appropriate tool to draw inference on the impact of ICT on growth. Numerous studies fi nd a positive correlation between GDP growth and (lagged) values of diff erent forms of ICT capital stocks based on cross-country growth regressions.
a It is tempting to take the estimated ICT-growth elasticities at face value to quantify the impact of digital technologies on growth. But this approach has serious shortcomings. Most important, compared to the seemingly open-ended list of potential growth correlates, the sample sizes in cross-country growth regressions are fairly small due to the fi nite number of countries and the typically limited lowfrequency time-series variation in the data.b Growth accounting provides a less ambitious approach; it decomposes aggregate growth into the contribution of each production factor without getting to the issue of causality. But its precision also hinges on the ability to compute ICT capital stocks, which requires measuring depreciation rates and price indexes for digital technologies that appropriately refl ect quality changes.c The approach also assumes that the contribution of each factor of production to output is proportional to the corresponding share in total input costs.
 So, the true contribution to growth can be larger or smaller. Firm-level studies comprise large sample sizes and allow comparisons of the performance among fi rms operating in similar institutional environments. ICT investment is a fi rm’s decision—still it is not plausible to assume that it is independent of performance. A positive productivity correlation in the data might simply capture that more productive fi rms use digital technology more eff ectively, indicating that other potentially unobservable fi rm-specifi c factors explain the positive correlation between digital technologies and fi rm productivity. In fact, many fi rm-level studies claiming to fi nd productivity externalities still suff er from measurement and reversed causality problems.d,e a.
 See Czernich and others (2009), Koutroumpis (2009), or Niebel (2014) for more recent contributions using cross-country regressions to assess the impact of broadband infrastructure on GDP growth. Qiang, Rossotto, and Kimura (2009); Cardona, Kretschmer, and Strobel (2013); and Minges (2015) provide surveys of the literature using cross-country regressions to assess the correlation between ICT capital and broadband internet on GDP growth, respectively. b. Several researchers use methodologies, such as generalized method of moments (GMM) panel estimators, to address the endogeneity issue in crosscountry growth regressions, but the results are typically not robust to small variations in the included countries, time periods, or control variables due to the large number of necessary country-level control variables, given the open-endedness of potential factors correlated with growth and ICT capital investments (Hauk and Wiczarg 2009). c. But the acceleration in computing power (Moore’s observation) involves a severe measurement problem, as conventional price indexes do not capture changes in quality of hardware or software.
 Jorgenson (2001) addresses this problem for hardware by constructing a constant quality index of computer prices using hedonic techniques. The Conference Board (2015) uses the World KLEMS data following this methodology, harmonizing the most recent techniques across countries. d. See, for example, Gordon (2010, 2014) or Acemoglu and others (2014). e. For instance, Draca, Sadun, and Van Reenen (2007) argue that causality has not yet been convincingly demonstrated.

Predicting labor productivity growth at the technological frontier based on lessons from past industrial revolutions History shows that productivity growth driven by general purpose technologies can arrive in multiple waves; it need not simply arrive, give what it has, and fade away forever thereafter. —Chad Syverson, 2014 It is easy to fi nd echoes of today’s debates about the internet in the history of the industrial revolution. Each technological breakthrough comes with its own idiosyncratic variations, but much can be learned by studying the deliberations and experiences of the past.
 Technological revolutions often take a long time to have signifi cant impacts. The maximum impact of steam power on British productivity growth was not felt until the third quarter of the 19th century, nearly 100 years after James Watt’s patent.a The benefi ts of railroads were fairly small initially, but grew as railroad productivity improved and rail output rose as a share of economic activity.b Similarly, investments in electrical capital equipment did not have important spillovers until the 1920s.c Initially, factory owners simply replaced large steam engines with large electric ones. It took nearly 40 years after electricity was widely available in the United States for organizational methods to catch up and develop more effi cient decentralized production lines.
 How do information and communication technologies (ICTs) stack up with past major general-purpose technologies? For instance, electricity led to the invention of air conditioning, elevators, and home appliances half a century later. Arguably, the internet can be regarded as a major follow-up invention from the computer (or microchip), just as the internal combustion engine led to the interstate highway system in the United States 60 years later. The internet boosts the productivity of computers and mobile phones in the same way that highways boosted the productivity of cars and trucks. U.S.
 data show that labor productivity increased on average by 2.4 percent annually after the inventions of the internal combustion engine, electricity, and running water between 1891 and 1972. Then it slowed, averaging only 1.4 percent annually between 1973 and 1996. Between 1996 and 2004, it surged again, growing 2.5 percent annually, which scholars ascribe to the fast spread of the internet.

Online marketplaces also include rating systems, allowing the buyer and seller to assess each other’s performance. The ratings and individual comments, visible to anyone, build trust for future transactions and encourage more responsible behavior. Many online marketplaces also provide payment and delivery services to reduce the cost of e-commerce. Digital technologies also lower communication costs facilitating the unbundling of tasks, allowing fi rms to offshore production processes and services to developing countries at lower costs. trade (box 1.
3). To purchase any product, the buyer must fi nd a seller, make a payment before receiving the goods, and trust that the seller will deliver the correct amount and quality on time. As a result of these information asymmetries, only the most productive fi rms export—typically the larger and older fi rms.11 Online marketplaces help solve all three problems. They provide an organized marketplace for fi rms to advertise their products and fi nd buyers in overseas markets.12 They thus reduce the costs of trade by enabling fi rms to avoid intermediaries to establish trade connections or participate in costly trade fairs to market their products.
 Online marketSince 2004 aggregate productivity growth has returned to its pre-1996 level, averaging 1.3 percent annually. Does the 2004–13 productivity slowdown in the United States refl ect a petering out of the ICT revolution? Gordon interprets this as a sign that the IT (or internet) revolution does not have the same lasting impact as previous industrial revolutions triggered by the internal combustion engine or electricity.e But the diffi culty of tracing a country’s growth performance to a single new technology, given severe measurement and endogeneity problems, allows alternative interpretations of the same recent historical trend. Syverson overlays U.
S. labor productivity in the electrifi cation era and the ICT era to show that productivity growth in both eras has exhibited remarkably common patterns so far (fi gure B1.2.1).f During the electrifi cation era, labor productivity growth over the fi rst 25 years was relatively slow, just as it was in the ICT era from 1970 to 1995. Then both eras saw decade-long accelerations in productivity growth, spanning 1915–24 for electrifi cation and 1995–2004 for IT.
 Analogous to the 2004–12 slowdown, labor productivity growth slowed again in the electrifi cation era in 1924–32. Then labor productivity growth in the electrifi cation era sped up again, averaging 2.7 percent annually in 1932–40. This does not necessarily suggest that labor productivity in the United States will pick up again in coming years. Box 1.2 Is this time diff erent?

A 10-percent increase in internet use in an exporting country increases the number of products traded between two countries by 1.
5 percent; this increase in the extensive margin can account for as much as 78 percent of the total effect of the internet More internet use in a country is positively related to the growth of bilateral exports of goods and services.13, 14 The relationship tends to depend on country income. Higher internet use in a developing country is related to higher exports to high-income countries, but not necessarily to other developing countries. Higher internet use in developed countries, in turn, has no effect on their exports. The similarities in internet use between trading partners can also affect how the internet affects trade. The trade between two countries is 25 percent higher if both countries have high internet use and 31 percent higher if the exporter has high Box 1.
3 Is the internet reshaping economic geography? Not yet. Fifteen years ago, a widely read study pronounced the death of distance and concluded that, with better and cheaper communication technology, geography will no longer infl uence individuals and fi rms. It argued that the internet is making it easier and cheaper to communicate over long distances. Goods and services, increasingly virtual and weightless, can be delivered over the internet. That makes location irrelevant to what an individual consumes, to where an individual works, or to where the fi rm establishes its business.
a Even though the internet has reduced the economic distance between countries, geography still determines fl ows of goods and services. Bilateral trade between countries is still negatively related to the distance between them after controlling for the eff ects of the internet.b And online transactions are still negatively related to distance: transaction values on online market platforms like eBay in the United States and MercadoLibre in Latin America decline when the distance between buyers and sellers increases.c Internet websites hosted in countries closer to the United States receive more visits by U.S. consumers.
d More generally, the number of online transactions globally declines when the bilateral distance between buyers and sellers increases.e Even so, the relationship between trade fl ows and geography is weaker for online transactions than for offl ine transactions. The impact of distance on digital goods may at fi rst seem counterintuitive, given that they are weightless and delivered over the internet. But distance might be capturing taste preferences that can infl uence online activities. The eff ects of distance are not uniform across all website visits. Instead, websites selling digital goods that are differentiated and dependent on taste (music and games) are aff ected by distance, but more standard digital goods (software and fi nancial information) are not.
f The eff ect of distance on online transactions also diff ers across product categories, where goods that appeal to a local market (tickets and sports memorabilia) are most aff ected by distance.g The impact of the internet on the location decisions of fi rms and the geography of jobs is less clear. The internet facilitates the dispersion of fi rms by allowing better communication between workers performing complex tasks and greater disintermediation of production processes. And it enables the dispersion of jobs, as individuals fi nd work regardless of their location through online labor exchanges (chapter 2). But it also opens locations previously considered economically unfeasible and allows fi rms to cluster in locations to take advantage of comparative advantage, further enabled by better communication technology.h Jobs are clustered in these locations because the fi rms want to access the dense labor market and specialized inputs suppliers.
 The equilibrium eff ect of the internet on the location of fi rms and jobs is diffi cult to determine, but the fi nal global pattern of fi rm location could be many clusters connected by the internet.i a. Cairncross 2001. b. Freund and Weinhold 2004. c.

 Venables 2001. 60 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 Looking forward, the rise of online marketplaces can accelerate the integration of developing countries into world markets, opening substantial opportunities for trade and future growth. In China, Alibaba already enables smaller and younger fi rms to sell more products and reach more new consumers or businesses in foreign countries. Online marketplaces also emerged in other developing regions, but so far only on a (much) smaller scale or for market niches. The Moroccan online platform Anou enables artisans in rural areas to directly export their products online, cutting out traditional middlemen.22 The Kenyan online platform iProcure prescreens its vendors to provide reliable local procurement services connecting agricultural businesses and institutional buyers.
23 So, e-commerce platforms should have substantial growth effects if they achieve suffi cient scale in developing regions (see box 1.4). Increasing the volumes of exported products The intensive margin of trade—defi ned as the average trade per fi rm or product—increases with the internet penetration of countries. A 10-percent increase in the internet use of a country pair increases the average bilateral trade value per product by 0.6 percent. More specifi cally, the average export value per fi rm increases by 1 percent if internet use increases by 10 percent in the exporting country; it increases by 0.
5 percent if internet use increases by 10 percent in the importing country.24 The rollout of broadband infrastructure boosted exports and labor productivity in China even in the era before Alibaba, from 1999 to 2007. The number of internet users increased across all provinces between 1997 and 2007, though it was stronger in coastal areas in the earlier years and in several inland provinces in later years.25 The value of real exports seems to have followed a similar pattern.26 The increase in internet domains and users per capita had a positive impact on fi rms’ manufacturing exports in ICT-intensive sectors.27 It raised the number of fi rms that export, the fi rms’ share of export in total sales, and the real value of fi rms’ exports.
 The higher share of internet domains and users also increased fi rms’ real output and labor productivity. Facilitating the unbundling of tasks Better communication technologies have facilitated the unbundling of tasks, the “second unbundling” of international trade.28 Businesses can locate different stages of their production in different host on trade (fi gure 1.8). The impact of the internet is largest if both countries have high internet use.16 Online platforms allow smaller fi rms to become exporters.
 The fi rms selling on eBay in Chile, Jordan, Peru, and South Africa are younger and have smaller market shares than fi rms in the offl ine markets.17 The Alibaba platform has a larger fraction of small fi rms than the offl ine market.18 Firms exporting through Alibaba also sell more products per fi rm.19 Online platforms enable fi rms to reach new export destinations, changing trade patterns. Marketing goods globally on the internet is cheaper, and customizing the marketing information to suit the local context and language is easier. So, fi rms trading through online platforms can reach more destinations than their offl ine peers.
 Chinese companies selling on Alibaba reach an average of 3 and a maximum of 98 export destinations,20 up from an average of one and a maximum of 50 export destinations for the offl ine fi rms.21 The set of export destinations also differs for fi rms exporting online or offl ine in China. And a larger share of the online exports reach emerging markets such as Brazil, Colombia, India, Nigeria, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine, compared with exporting offl ine, which is more intensive in low-income countries or traditional high-income markets such as Germany, Japan, and the United States (map 1.2).

The entry of eBay into China illustrates this. Both eBay and Taobao, Alibaba’s consumer-to-consumer (C2C) platform, entered the Chinese market in 2003.
 eBay immediately established its dominant market share of 85 percent by acquiring the Chinese market leader, EachNet.a Taobao, however, quickly assumed a dominant position. By 2014, it accounted for over 80 percent of the Chinese C2C market (eBay exited the Chinese market in 2006). Alibaba’s success can be explained (at least in part) by its ability to adapt to local market conditions and culture to remove the information asymmetries unique to the Chinese C2C market. The Taobao website, for instance, indicates whether sellers are online and allows buyers to communicate instantly with the sellers through an online messaging system.b Alibaba further guarantees foreign buyers in-time delivery of their money and implemented a system to verify sellers on its website for business-to-business (B2B) transactions.
 Firms can buy a gold supplier status to have a thirdparty verifi cation company conduct on-site quality control. a. Wulf 2010. b. Ou and Davidson (2009) note that Chinese consumers want to be able to communicate with their sellers and solve any problems relating to the transaction immediately. 62 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 cal services can be supplied internationally over the internet.
 Online platforms like Upwork (formerly Elance-oDesk) create marketplaces for freelancers to provide these services (see chapter 2). Effi ciency—raising fi rms’ utilization of capital and labor Digital technologies help fi rms save costs by automating data-intensive production processes and reorganizing their business models, increasing their productive use of capital and labor.34 Computers and software allow fi rms to routinize processes, increasing management effi ciency and replacing personnel with, for instance, human resource or supply chain management software. The internet further increases the opportunities for cost saving by connecting machines, suppliers, and clients, so that fi rms can manage their supply chains and inventory more effectively in real time. The extent to which digital technologies raise labor productivity depends on fi rms’ activities, but examples abound across countries and economic sectors. The vast majority of effi ciency gains emerge outside the ICT sector, where fi rms use the internet to sell and market their products online or share real-time information with suppliers to minimize their inventory and with customers to optimize their services.
 The digital economy accounts for about 6 percent of GDP in OECD countries (box 1.5). Less visible but more important for growth, incumbent fi rms in traditional sectors invest in digital technologies to save costs by optimizing their production and management processes. Retail companies such as Walmart, for instance, have integrated (global) supply chains to minimize their inventory holdings by linking electronic cash registers at retail outlets and business-to-business ordering systems with order dispatch and transportation scheduling at remote factories. So far, the largest effi ciency gains from fi rms using digital technologies have been found in wholesale and retail trade, business services, insurance, fi nance, and selected manufacturing sectors. The following section highlights selected illustrations of how digital applications boost fi rms’ effi ciency.
 Increasing management effi ciency Crowdsourcing information through mobile phone applications is helping farmers in Tanzania to prevent the outbreak of diseases. In Tanzania’s Lake Zone, 60 groups of farmers from 10 districts belonging to the Digital Early Warning Network prevent the outbreak of the cassava disease by crowdsourcing countries to achieve greater effi ciency in each stage. This unbundling of tasks allows fi rms to outsource production processes and services to developing countries at lower cost, which in turn increases trade in intermediate goods and places more importance on global supply chains. This trend has, for example, enabled the strong growth in business process outsourcing in Eastern Europe, India, and the Philippines. The foreign value added content of exports increased substantially along all major trade routes over the past 20 years, particularly among Asian economies. Digital technologies reduce the costs of offshoring, especially when the host country has signifi cant human capital.
 So, production structures become more globalized, and more fi rms choose to offshore different stages of their production. Higher use of ICTs by fi rms allows headquarters to manage increasingly complex functions, enabling them to confi dently send these functions overseas.29 As communication costs decline, exports of headquarter services to foreign affi liates, such as professional and technical services, increase.30 These functions are, however, complex, implying that fi rms select host countries based on their human capital.31 Better use of digital technology in a country encourages multinational fi rms to locate their subsidiaries there. Many foreign subsidiaries are in countries with high business use of the internet, and the entry of a multinational into a foreign market is positively correlated with business use.
32 And the provision of digital technology in the host country has a stronger effect on the entry of multinational fi rms when the fi rm is in an industry that uses communication technology more intensively and has fewer routine tasks. The unbundling of tasks has driven the tripling of service trade over the past 15 years, particularly for business, professional, and technical services such as legal, advertising, consulting, and accounting. The internet makes it easier for headquarters to transmit information, supervise their factories, and coordinate the supply chain across borders, encouraging fi rms to outsource not only manufacturing but also service tasks. Trade in education and professional services has also increased.33 Trade in education services prior to the internet was conducted through correspondence courses, with textbooks and course materials mailed between instructors and students. Now websites provide massive open online courses, known as MOOCs, with video and other materials over the internet.
 They also connect health service providers enabling the spatial unbundling of health services, such as radiology. Similarly, professional and techni 63ACCELERATING GROWTH Box 1.5 The growth impact is largest when fi rms in traditional sectors use digital technologies to modernize their business The digital economy accounts for about 6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries (fi gure B1.5.1).a In the United States, which hosts some of the biggest tech companies, the value added of information and communication technology sectors in GDP is 7 percent, compared with 13 percent in real estate, renting, and leasing; 12 percent in wholesale and retail trade; and 8 percent in fi nance and insurance or health and social services.
b The value added of information and communication technology (ICT) sectors in GDP is the highest in Ireland (12 percent), thanks to large infl ows of foreign direct investment. In Kenya, which hosts one of the largest ICT sectors among African countries, the value added share of ICT services in GDP was 3.4 percent in 2013; that includes telecommunications (and thus mobile money).c Despite the strong growth and high market valuations of internet fi rms off ering conventional services, their market shares in these traditional sectors to date have been relatively small. Consider Amazon. In the United States, its home market, Amazon accounted for only 1.
7 percent of the retail market in 2014; e-commerce accounted for about 7 percent of the U.S. retail market in 2015. By contrast, offl ine sales accounted for more than 99 percent of all sales of food and beverages; 84 percent of clothing and furniture; and 59 percent of books, magazines, and music.d Less visible but more important for growth, incumbent fi rms in traditional sectors invest in digital technologies to save costs by optimizing their production and management processes. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that 75 percent of the economic impact of the internet in 12 large developing and developed countries originates in fi rms in traditional sectors—fi rms that would exist without the internet but that use it to increase their cost-eff ectiveness.
e The fi ndings are consistent with studies showing that the bulk of U.S. productivity growth over the past 15 years originated in ICT-using, not-producing sectors.f Source: OECD 2015. Data at . Note: ICT value added is the diff erence between the ICT sector’s gross output and intermediate consumption.
 The data are from 2011. The aggregate of information industries here includes ISIC rev. 4 division 26 (manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products) and section J (information and communication), which in turn comprises divisions 58–60 (publishing and broadcasting industries), 61 (telecommunications), and 62–63 (computer programming, and information service activities). ICT industries are broadly defi ned, as they include publishing and broadcasting, trade and repair activities, and media and content industries (Division 63.9). a.
 The McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika and others 2011) used a diff erent approach to compute the contribution of the internet to GDP. It computes the total value of three main activities based on the internet: activities using the internet as support (e-commerce, online content, or advertising); internet service providers; and software and internet service activities such as IT consulting, hardware manufacturers (computers, smartphones, or hardware equipment). They fi nd that these activities account on average for 3.4 percent of GDP among the G-8 countries, Brazil, China, India, the Republic of Korea, and Sweden in 2009. The impact is largest among the developed countries. The shares include publishing and broadcasting activities and media and content industries.
 b. The classifi cation includes internet fi rms such as search engines, but not online retailers. The market share of online retailers is, however, still relatively small: Amazon accounted for only 1.7 percent of the retail market in the United States in 2014; see . c. World Bank 2015.

Each truck has a global positioning system (GPS), so RW can track shipments in real time and be notifi ed once the shipment is delivered.
 The technology shortens the supply chain gap between shipment and delivery in the domestic market, allowing RW to provide superior transport services at more competitive rates. Connected water metering systems help municipalities identify leaks or changes in water use, reducing water losses by up to 10 percent. At its research center in France, U.S. manufacturer Itron developed water metering systems with wireless devices allowing remote reading over large distances, so that municipalities can reorganize maintenance and respond immediately to water waste or losses in the distribution network. The data also improve water consumption analysis to optimize client service and tariff structures.
 Itron’s production of communication devices has increased fi fteenfold since 2000, and its production of water meters threefold. Such connected metering systems have great potential to save drinking water—more than 30 percent of the drinking water produced worldwide never reaches the customer (often due to leaks).37 Looking forward, the internet of things should further increase the labor productivity of fi rms, implying substantial opportunities for more effi cient business models and thus future growth (see spotlight 6). For instance, the German truck body and trailer manufacturer Schmitz Cargobull uses telematics (the integrated application of telecommunications and data) in its trailers for real-time sharing of data with drivers, freight agents, and customers on maintenance, loaded weights, cargo temperatures, and truck locations. The company adjusted its organizational structure and management practices to maximize effi ciency gains and escape competition from low-wage countries. As a result, the fi rm’s production pace necessary to meet customer demand fell by 90 percent, internal failures decreased by 92 percent, and yearly accidents declined by 95 percent between 2000 and 2013, as its market share for refrigerated trailers in Europe rose to 50 percent.
38 Enabling online marketing and distribution Firms are fi nding new and more effi cient ways to market and distribute their products online. Carmakers represented on the internet in China can attend to about 10 million searches each day on Baidu, reducing their marketing and sales costs relative to nonconnected manufacturers. Volkswagen, for instance, information.35 Each farmer has a topped-up phone card and has been trained to recognize early symptoms of cassava mosaic disease and brown streak disease. The farmers use the mobile phones to send monthly text messages to researchers about disease incidence. In return, they receive advice on disease control, and disease experts visit the area when more than 10 percent of the members of a group report the disease.
 The network, part of the Great Lakes Cassava Initiative, supports more than 1 million farmers in six countries. Digital technologies help farmers in Botswana meet quality and traceability requirements for beef exports to the European Union. The farmers use the Livestock Identifi cation Trace-Back System, based on transponders inserted into each animal, transmitting information automatically to databases in 46 district offi ces. The centrally stored data allow exporters to trace beef to the individual cattle and their owners, necessary to meet traceability requirements for imports into the European Union. The technology also helps improve veterinary services and save costs by optimizing feeding schedules. Digital interventions in agriculture seem to work best when the information provided to farmers is simple, such as real-time prices or weather forecasts.
 Based on simple mobile phone applications or internet kiosks, real-time data improve farmers’ access to prices, local weather forecasts, and more detailed advice on agricultural practices and input use (see sector focus 1). Real-time data help equipment manufacturers in China turn over their inventory stocks fi ve times faster than suppliers not connected to the internet. Supply chains and logistics operations account for 10–20 percent of Chinese equipment manufacturers’ costs, so companies using real-time data to optimize inventories and transportation routes can achieve substantial effi ciency gains. Anji Logistics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, connects its IT systems with dozens of Chinese equipment manufacturers to manage logistics. General Motors China has cut costs and improved customer satisfaction by building internet connectivity into cars, so that dealers can check faults remotely and send maintenance alerts to owners. With only 20–25 percent of small manufacturing fi rms in China estimated to have used the internet in 2013, there clearly is more scope to improve manufacturing effi ciency.

Vietnamese fi rms using the internet for e-commerce had 3.6 percentage point higher productivity growth in subsequent years. The rollout of broadband internet infrastructure in Vietnam (see map 1.
1) is positively correlated with fi rm productivity growth. Using the internet increased TFP growth by 1.9 percentage point; fi rms also doing e-commerce increased TFP growth by an additional 1.7 percentage point (fi gure 1.9). The effect of e-commerce is larger in sectors that use ICT more intensively, consistent with a causal impact on productivity growth (see box 1.

Lower fi xed and marginal costs enable new startups to exploit scale economies from the beginning, supporting their rapid growth.

6 Do digital technologies embed productivity externalities? Firms’ total factor productivity (TFP) growth in highincome countries is often positively associated with information and communication technology (ICT) capital accumulation.a The relation has been stronger in the United States relative to the European Union, particularly in ICT-using sectors, such as retail and wholesale trade, fi nance, and other business services.b The few studies for developing countries show that the correlations between fi rms’ ICT capital stock and TFP growth in Brazil and India are comparable to those estimated for high-income countries.c A few recent studies focus on the impact of rolling out broadband infrastructure on fi rm productivity growth, but the results are ambiguous.d Knowledge spillovers?
 Some recent studies suggest a causal impact of fi rms’ use of digital technologies on their TFP growth.e Identifying a causal impact requires that the spatial sequencing of ICT infrastructure rollout must be independent from productivity growth in the diff erent locations. Such a case is arguably provided by the limited funding of a public program rolling out broadband internet access points in Norway in the early 2000s; the expansion of broadband increased fi rms’ productivity.f Another study shows that establishments owned by U.S. multinational companies in the United Kingdom use their ICT capital stock more productively (after takeovers) relative to domestic fi rms and establishments owned by multi nationals from other countries.
 This productivity differential is highest in exactly the same sectors that were responsible for the U.S. productivity surge from ICT investments in the 2000s, pointing to a causal impact of ICT on fi rm productivity among U.S. fi rms in these sectors.g Foreign direct investment spillovers?
 Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Jordan’s ICT sector did not lead to growth spillovers among domestic fi rms (Box continues next page) 66 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 and fi nance. Innovations include mobile money, digital marketplaces, price comparator websites, online media, and the sharing economy. The substantial scale effects for some activities have also led to digital enabling scale effects and increasing the profi ts from innovation. Such scale effects inspire new business models based on the internet in services ranging from retail trade, transport, and logistics to tourism interacting with the foreign tech companies. Neither domestic fi rms supplying goods or services to foreign tech companies (backward linkages) nor domestic fi rms consuming their services (forward linkages) grew as results of such linkages. The lack of measurable growth spillovers could be due to the relatively small number of foreign multinationals in the ICT sector (8 in ICT-producing sectors, and 160 in ICT-using sectors).
 And there are still relatively few domestic ICT companies in Jordan, such as software programmers, which are expected to benefi t most from linkages with foreign tech companies. Furthermore, foreign fi rms like Microsoft or Oracle might use Jordan primarily as a hub to support regional activities involving few linkages to the domestic economy. The lack of spillovers to ICT-using sectors in Jordan suggests that Jordanian fi rms import ICT services rather than depend on the presence of foreign tech companies in the country.h Producing new products and processes? Broadband internet increases innovation. A study of German fi rms shows that broadband (DSL) infrastructure rollout between 2001 and 2003 increased fi rms’ process and product innovation once broadband internet was available within their districts (measured by the postal code).
i A study of six African countries fi nds that more intensive use of computers or the internet enabled more product and process innovation in 2014.j Production technologies diff er in whether they are more or less widely applicable across products or industries. That is, some knowledge can be more readily adapted for use in related production processes while other knowledge is limited in its application. So, products or industries embodying more applicable technologies also have more scope for technology externalities. A recent study uses patent citation data from the U.S.
 Patent and Trademark Offi ce to trace the bilateral direction and intensity of knowledge fl ows between technologies. It fi nds that digital technologies typically are more widely applicable in driving the discovery of new technologies.k Increasing international technology diff usion? The internet reduces geographic distances, which are the main predictor of international technology diff usion. Technology spillovers provide an indirect channel for digital technologies to boost effi ciency and thus fi rm productivity growth beyond fi rms’ measured ICT capital stocks. For instance, the internet might facilitate the (international) diff usion of technologies by providing access to relevant information or inducing knowledge spillovers between users.
 The literature suggests that geographic distances are barriers to international technology diff usion.l Likewise, several studies fi nd that bilateral trade fl ows embed learning externalities, spurring the diff usion of technologies. This Report provides evidence that the internet enhances trade and reduces distance, suggesting that the internet facilitates the international diff usion of technologies, even though the growth contribution of this channel is diffi cult to verify empirically.

By contrast, Grimes, Ren, and Stevens (2012) and Akerman, Gaarder, and Mogstad (2015) fi nd a positive impact in New Zealand and Norway, respectively. The results might suggest that moving from basic internet access to broadband leads to only marginal productivity improvements. However, it might also be too early to measure the eff ect of high-speed internet in fi rm-level data, since fi rms’ use of the internet is often still relatively basic. e. Most studies attempt to address the endogeneity problem by using lagged ICT or human capital variables as instruments.
 However, unobserved transitory shocks (or unobservable fi rm-specifi c factors) lead to serial correlation in ICT and productivity measures that make these types of instrumental variables invalid. f. Akerman, Gaarder, and Mogstad 2015. g. Bloom, Sadun, and Van Reenen 2012. h.

 Safaricom, the leading telecom fi rm in Kenya, launched the mobile money service M-Pesa in 2007, allowing users to transfer money through a simple text-based menu goods trading exclusively online, as for e-books, online search, and streaming music and videos— making transport, storage, and distribution obsolete. Intensifying competition Price comparator websites enhance transparency in prices and result in lower and less dispersed prices for consumers. Consider term-life insurance, where average prices have fallen up to 15 percent in the United States after the introduction of comparator sites.41 These websites emerged in 1996 and eliminated the previously high markups. The potential customer fi lls out a medical questionnaire online, and the sites report quotes from companies that offer a suitable policy. In almost all cases, the individual does not buy the product directly online but gets connected instead to the offl ine seller.
 Comparator sites essentially provide an information platform between the consumer and the life insurance company that formerly was available only to brokers. In contrast, the prices of whole-life insurance, which were not covered by these sites, were not affected—whole-life insurance is a more complex product including built-in saving components, leaving more room for asymmetric information across buyers and sellers; a decline in search costs is thus less relevant. Online registration systems can lower the cost of entry for new players, increasing competitive pressure for incumbents. The number of newly registered limited liability fi rms has increased, on average, 56 percent after the introduction of online registration systems (from 2.7 per 1,000 working-age population in years before the reform to 4.2 in the years after).
42 But this positive average impact masks heterogeneity across countries (fi gure 1.10). Thirty-three countries introduced online registration systems for fi rms between 2006 and 2012. The entry density declined somewhat in 8 of the 33 countries. Two out of three fi rms experience moderate or severe competition from digital innovations. The share of fi rms reporting competitive pressure from traditional competitors is somewhat higher than the share of fi rms reporting competitive pressure from digital technology startups (fi gure 1.
11). Firms in traditional sectors using digital technologies to modernize their business are thus an important source of competition (see also box 1.5).43 Bringing competition to incumbent fi rms The internet has created new types of startups that base their business model entirely on the web but offer traditional services such as retail trade, fi nance, transport, logistics, tourism, media, publishing, and advertising. These new business models dissolve the Figure 1.11 Two out of three fi rms report competitive pressure from digital innovations, 2014 Source: Economist 2015a.

In contrast, internet platforms for businesses are often loosely regulated, allowing them to offer fi nancial services that bypass regulations in the fi nancial sector.45 Yu’E Bao, Tencent’s online bank, and WeBank, for instance, offer online banking services in China. They collect deposits from households and lend money using big data analytics to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers.
 Yu’E Bao had 150 million subscribers by the end of 2014. These internet fi rms threaten the profi tability of traditional banks, increasing competitive pressure. Similar startups have emerged in other countries. ZestFinance, LendUp, and Wonga currently target unbanked subprime customers in Canada, Europe, South Africa, and the United States. German startup Kreditech and Hong Kong SAR, China, startup Lenddo use information from social media profi les and networks to determine the creditworthiness of potential customers. Lenddo targets the thriving middle class in developing countries, which often lacks access to local fi nancial services.
 Ghanaian startup Cignifi uses borrowers’ mobile phone records to judge their creditworthiness. Online marketplaces exert competitive pressure on brick-and-mortar retailers to innovate. The most prominent are online retailers and wholesalers such as Amazon and eBay in the United States, Alibaba in China, Flipkart and Snapdeal in India, Ozon in Russia, Jumia and Konga in Nigeria, and Takealot and Kalahari in South Africa. In the United States, online sales accounted for 25 percent of all retail sales for computers, electronics, and appliances in 2013. The competition from online retailers has led many large traditional retailers in the United States to combine digital and physical consumer experiences by offering online orders and in-store pickup services to improve their effi ciency. And some online retailers such as Amazon started to open brick-and-mortar stores to enjoy potential (marketing) advantages of traditional retailers.
 Ride sharing services enhance competition and the effi ciency of transport services. Many cities around the world require drivers to hold a license to operate a taxi; entering the market is often associated with high fi xed costs since licenses are issued rarely and must be bought from current owners. The licensing system, together with growing urban populations, has led prices for taxi medallions to skyrocket in large cities worldwide; in New York City, the cost of a single-taxi medallion increased from about US$400,000 in 2004 to more than US$1,100,000 in the beginning of 2013 (fi gure 1.12, panel a). But the new available on the most basic mobile phone. By the end of 2013, 17 million Kenyans, or more than two-thirds of the adult population, were using the service to pay for taxi rides, electricity bills, or daily supermarket purchases.
 M-Pesa also created new opportunities for innovation. Kopo Kopo partnered with Safaricom to offer mobile money services to businesses. One of the key factors underpinning M-Pesa’s success in Kenya was the regulator’s decision to permit the scheme to proceed as an experiment without formal approval: similar schemes in other countries have typically been held up by opposition from banks and regulators. Firm-level data show that M-Pesa reduces the prices of competing services in the fi nancial sector.44 Internet startups offering fi nancing based on “big data” analysis to target unbanked customers increase the competitive pressure for traditional banking services. For example, in China, regulations in the fi nanSources: Wei and Mozur 2014; Metropolitan Transportation Agency (New York), ; Golovin 2014.

Airbnb operated in more than 40 countries in 2014, enabling owners to let their homes for short-term rents. This puts competitive pressure on the hotel and tourism industry, which has frequently enjoyed high rents due to local market segmentation or exclusive contracts in developing countries. The Estonian startup TransferWise and the U.S.
 startup Xoom match requests for international currency transfers online, saving direct and indirect transaction fees by clearing reciprocal currency transfer requests. The startups reduce regulatory rents by reducing the prices of international currency transfers by up to 90 percent. Postmates and Parcel provide local logistics services in U.S. urban centers and are starting to compete with traditional service providers such as Federal Express, but also with existing e-commerce platforms by matching customers demanding any type of locally available goods with a pool of couriers. And Kenyan startup Sendy provides a platform accessible by simple mobile phones connecting customers with motorcycle couriers to offer delivery services payable with mobile money.
47 Upwork (formerly Elance-oDesk) matches fi rms in high-income countries with freelancers offering professional service tasks in developing countries. The Ugandan internet platform eKeebo connects competition from ride sharing services reversed the trend. In San Francisco, the home city of these companies, taxi use fell 65 percent (fi gure 1.12, panel b). After decades of steady increases, single-taxi medallion prices in New York City started to slump, falling to about US$800,000 by the end of 2014 (the trend is similar in other cities).46 The new competition also forces taxi companies around the world to reduce their prices or improve their services.
 Taxi companies in various cities have begun to develop joint smartphone applications enabling online payment, rating, and vehicle tracking in real time to compete with the ride sharing services. The trend is not confi ned to high-income countries. While Uber operates in more than 57 countries and 300 cities, regional competitors have emerged, such as Lyft and Sidecar in the United States, Hailo and BlaBlaCar in Europe, Kuaidi-Didi Taxi in China, Olacabs in India, and Easy Taxi in Nigeria. Digital innovations increase welfare in many ways that are not necessarily captured by GDP statistics. These welfare gains are even more diffi cult to quantify, but a growing literature is shedding more light to these “unmeasured benefi ts” of the internet (box 1.7).
 Internet platforms also reduce the entry costs in other service sectors contesting conventional Box 1.7 Much of the benefi t from the internet is unmeasured The internet off ers many benefi ts to individuals that are not captured in the gross domestic product (GDP) statistics. Countries compute GDP based on activities measured in monetary terms and exclude activities that do not generate monetary transactions. But many online activities generate substantial benefi ts for the individual, such as time saved, consumer convenience, expanded choice, better quality leisure time, and access to more knowledge. These benefi ts can be understood as the consumer surplus: the diff erence between the price individuals are willing to pay and the actual price for the product or service, which is often free on the internet. Economists are developing new techniques and collecting new data to present a more accurate estimate of the consumer surplus from the internet.
 One method is to analyze the price and quality outcomes of using the internet in a sector. A recent study compares the online and offl ine prices of used books, fi nding that online prices are lower than the prices in brick-and-mortar bookstores. It infers that the buyers and sellers are better matched online.a This stylized fact is an example of the “Long Tail” argument, which notes that online stores provide a larger variety of products and can sell niche products to more consumers.b The same study also estimates that the consumer surplus is higher when consumers shift to purchasing used books online.c A study of the music industry fi nds that variety and diversity have improved since 2000, mostly because independent labels and musicians can operate online and release their music digitally.
d Another way to calculate the consumer surplus from the internet is to directly measure individuals’ willingness to pay for the internet (online products and services are often free and funded through advertisements). A McKinsey survey of consumers in France, Germany, the Russian Federation, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States in 2010 found that an average household would be willing to pay approximately €38 a month for internet services that it (Box continues next page) 70 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 Digital technologies can lead fi rms and countries to diverge Divergence—with benefi ts short of expectations Despite the opportunities, fi rms’ use of digital technologies differs substantially across sectors and countries; the differences prevail when comparing the ICT intensities of the same sectors across countries with a similar GDP per capita. The share of fi rms that used the internet for banking in 2012, for example, was below 20 percent in several middle-income countries, but more than 80 percent in others (fi gure 1.13). This divergence in the intensity of internet use for fi rms in the same sector is confi rmed by more detailed survey data from six African countries in 2014. The share of manufacturing and service fi rms with at least fi ve employees using the internet ranged from 22 percent in Tanzania to 73 percent in Kenya.
 Of manufacturing fi rms in Kenya, 41 percent used individuals who want an authentic home-cooked meal with independent or amateur chefs, circumventing restaurant licensing, which can be a source of rentseeking in developing countries. Cloud computing can reduce the costs of entry in developing countries, implying substantial opportunities for innovation and competition and thus future growth.48 It provides computing infrastructure (processing, memory, and storage of data), platform applications, and software services for fi rms with access to the internet. Firms can use these services, for a fee, without investing in the underlying hardware or software infrastructure. Cloud computing has signifi cantly reduced the fi xed costs of starting a business in the last decade. Startups can use the latest computing infrastructure, video conferencing services, or online payment systems at much lower cost.
 The reduction in entry costs has so far materialized mainly in high-income countries. Although local providers have emerged in developing regions, such as Angani in Kenya and Data Park in Oman, these have not yet achieved suffi cient scale. currently receives for free.e Similarly, an examination of time-use data estimates that the median individual gains more than US$3,000 annually from the internet.f A study comparing the outcomes of online searches to offl ine searches in a library fi nds that the average online search tends to be faster by 15 minutes, the results are more accurate and relevant, and the experience is more enjoyable than the offl ine search.g Also attempting to measure consumer surplus, another study fi nds that users of Google obtain a surplus of US$500 a year, on average, or a total of US$150 billion for a 300-million user base.
h The increase in time saved and in quality—and thus the productivity of work from using the internet—can indirectly increase GDP statistics. Conversely, the internet has also reduced productivity by providing an easy way to procrastinate and distract oneself with social networking sites and cute animal videos. The aggregate eff ects of the internet use of individuals are diffi cult to determine—an interesting avenue for further research. But all this is not new. The initial gains from past technological change were also undercounted in GDP. For example, the cost savings from railroads made up about threefourths of the total gains in GDP in the mid-19th century; by the early 20th century, this had fallen to about one-fourth.
 Time saving became by far the more important benefi t as commute times shortened and the leisure time of working- class customers increased. Similarly, U.S. national accounts did not refl ect the output from automobiles for nearly 15 years after the Ford Model T, the fi rst mass-produced car, was available.

Why are the differences so large? In most countries, the physical infrastructure barriers to internet use are fairly small for most fi rms in urban areas. Differences in the affordability of the internet across countries have been an important factor (see chapter 4). But equally important are other structural barriers that limit fi rms’ ability or incentives to use the internet more intensively.
 That three-fourths of all retail fi rms in Panama do not conduct e-commerce, for instance, might be related to a regulatory barrier protecting domestic retailers: foreign-owned fi rms are not allowed to operate in Panama’s retail sector, reducing competitive pressure among domestic fi rms to increase their effi ciency (see fi gure 1.15). By contrast, there are no restrictions to foreign entry into the retail sectors in Argentina, Mexico, and Uruguay—where retailers use e-commerce more extensively. Market power—scale and network eff ects can lead to anticompetitive behavior The digital economy can be highly concentrated. Facebook is the leading social network. Amazon sold 40 percent of all e-books in 2014.
 Google is the dominant search engine in most countries: it accounted for about 25 percent of the display-ad market, while Yahoo and Facebook accounted for about 10 percent each.51 And while the sharing economy is increasing the number of market players in various services, Airbnb and Uber are its major platforms so far. compared to only 32 percent in Norway, 20 percent in Poland, 18 percent in Estonia, and 12 percent in Croatia. In Finland, 25 percent of professional service fi rms sourced CRM software from the cloud in 2014, but only 5 percent did in France or Lithuania.

Safeguarding a level playing fi eld for business can thus also involve overhauling the regulatory regimes in the digital economy, including sectors in which technology is dissolving the boundaries between online and offl ine fi rms. The initial entry of internet fi rms into these sectors can disrupt monopolies, but regulators need to level the regulatory regime and prevent market shares from becoming excessively concentrated. The nexus of technology and regulation The potential impact of the internet on fi rm productivity is highest for activities where the internet can achieve large-scale effects and where contracts are easier to enforce—and thus can be automated.
 Economic activities can be classifi ed by the degree of their amenability to the internet, based on: • Contract complexity. Some goods and services are contract-intensive, because they embody a higher share of intermediate inputs that require relationship-specifi c investments that are more diffi cult to enforce by written contracts.54 The less complex that goods or services are, the easier it is to enforce contracts and use internet platforms to Domestic mobile money markets are often controlled by one or two operators. Safaricom, creator of the mobile money service M-Pesa, controls more than two-thirds of the mobile money market in Kenya (fi gure 1.17). The mobile money market in the Philippines is a duopoly, with the largest operator controlling 77 percent of the market.
 What matters for antitrust regulators, however, is not the concentration of a sector per se, but the entry costs for new entrants or switching costs for consumers.52 The concentration of various markets in the digital economy—often two-sided markets in which platforms match service providers or sellers with users or buyers53—is not surprising. When the transaction costs to serve additional customers are close to zero, the most innovative fi rm—say, the one with the best search algorithm or online platform— will be frequented by the most customers. As long as the fi xed entry costs are low, the industry remains dynamic, in the sense that entrepreneurs programming more effi cient search engines or applying superior business models will be able to enter and disrupt the existing incumbent (through creative destruction). AltaVista, for instance, was once the most popular search engine, but it lost ground in 2001 to new market entrant Google, which provided more effi cient services. Network effects or anticompetitive behavior can, however, create barriers for startups.
 For instance, the more people who use Facebook, the higher the value for users to create content on its website. Similar network effects (or switching costs) might exist for other online services. Google has been accused of using its dominant position in the market for online display advertising to curb competition and push companies toward its other services. Several Google competitors, including Microsoft and Yelp, had argued that Google unfairly demoted rivals in its search engine results to direct users toward its services. Similarly, Amazon has been accused of abusing its market power by delaying the shipping times of products from publishers that did not agree with its pricing mechanism. The room for anticompetitive behavior varies among digital products and services.
 Network effects and switching costs appear to be large for search engines, allowing them to create barriers to scale for new fi rms offering this service. By contrast, programming ride sharing platforms can be imitated fairly easily, and drivers can use more than one platform at the same time in the absence of exclusivity contracts. Indeed, multiple ride sharing platforms competing with each other have emerged. And traditional taxi companies have also started to use the technology. Source: Evans 2015. Data at .

Two such barriers for fi rms are the skills of the workforce and the ability to reorganize management processes to make better use of the effi ciency gains that digital technologies can provide. There is even evidence that investing in ICTs without business process reorganization can reduce fi rms’ productivity growth.
57 The correlation between fi rm productivity and ICT capital stocks among fi rms in India and Brazil increases signifi cantly after fi rms have reorganized their production structures or hired more skilled labor. Firms in Vietnam with a more educated workforce or a higher share of managers relative to total staff had a stronger correlation between fi rms’ use of the internet (such as selling products online) and TFP growth in subsequent years.58 The majority of fi rms in Eastern Europe and Central Asia that use broadband internet have not reorganized their businesses, pointing to potential ineffi ciencies in the way it is deployed. Only one-fourth of fi rms using ICTs have adjusted their organizational structures or management practices (table 1.2). The differences in these complementary investments help explain the heterogeneity in the use and impact of digital technologies.
 For instance, fi rms’ investments in computerized information (digital technologies) are comparable among fi rms in the United States and Brazil (fi gure 1.18). But U.S. fi rms market these products and match buyers and sellers (table 1.1).
55 • Scale eff ects. The impact of the internet is larger if the internet can help achieve scale effects. For instance, longer value chains require more intensive realtime communication or sharing of large amounts of data between different stages of production or with suppliers and clients. The internet reduces these transaction costs, enabling scale effects and increasing management effi ciency.56 Firms using digital technologies need to invest in skills and reorganization As for any new technology, integrating digital solutions into fi rms’ business models can be risky and lead to costly failures. Digital technologies have often been called on to help meet supply chain needs, but not all have brought the expected widespread benefi ts.
 Five or ten years ago, radio frequency identifi cation tags for tracking individual goods were considered the major source for effi ciency gains. U.S. retailer Walmart required its biggest suppliers to use the tags, but their use has not taken off in the extended supply chain. The successful use of digital technologies depends on fi rms’ complementary investments in skills and organizational restructuring. That more productive fi rms use digital technologies (more intensively) suggests that there are barriers to fi rms using them Table 1.

S. fi rms. Similarly, fi rms in Japan and China had the highest investments in digital technologies, but they invested less in skills than France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Complementary skills and reorganizations are more important for more advanced digital technologies, potentially explaining the slow diffusion of some of these technologies across fi rms (see fi gure 1.4). Implementing customer relationship or supply chain management software and integrating it with ICT systems of customers and suppliers requires a well-trained workforce and the adoption of new organizational processes incorporating real-time information fl ows.
 Countries need to invest in skills and logistics to enable fi rms to use ICT more eff ectively Since a shortage of skills can lower aggregate productivity growth despite investments in broadband infrastructure, countries need to invest in education to complement investments in new digital technologies (chapter 2). They also need to invest in infrastructure such as electricity, trade logistics, and payment systems. Online marketplaces for nondigital goods enable scale effects if trade infrastructure is adequate. After an online transaction has been completed, the timely delivery of (physical) goods requires offl ine trade infrastructure.59 Countries thus need ports with enough capacity to connect domestic fi rms to international markets and effi cient domestic logistics infrastructure to complete the “last mile” delivery. Online retailers in some countries still struggle to deliver their parcels to domestic customers.
 In 38 countries in 2012—27 of them in Africa—less than 50 percent of the population had access to home postal delivery (fi gure 1.19). Faced with such diffi culties, many e-commerce companies have come up with their own solutions. Alibaba has partnered with logistics fi rms in China to create a network for delivering parcels to Chinese cities within a day. Flipkart has partnered with the Dabbawalas, the deliverymen famous for their reliable delivery of hot lunches, to deliver parcels in India. Russian online retailer Ozon created its own logistics service company to increase the speed of deliveries.
 Online payment services are available to fi rms in many countries but not in most African and Central Sources: Corrado and others 2013; Hulten and Hao 2011; Hao, Hulten, and Jaeger 2013; Dutz and others 2012.

Consumers and fi rms need a way to pay for online transactions. e-commerce relies on the ability of fi rms and consumers to pay for their products online. Credit cards are accepted on most online platforms, but many individuals do not have credit cards: less than 10 percent of the population in developing countries had a credit card in 2012.60 Online payment systems providing business accounts, such as PayPal, MercadoPago, and PayU, are alternatives.
 For instance, MercadoPago provides online payment services to small businesses that do not have bank accounts. The low share of fi rms using e-commerce in some developing countries can also originate from network effects in internet use. Network effects are present because the value of the internet to a fi rm depends on the number of internet users (creating online content). Thus low rates of domestic internet use by individuals, fi rms, and government reduce the benefi ts of e-commerce. But the argument is only relevant for fi rms that target the domestic market in developing countries with few internet users; exporting fi rms targeting world markets face over 3.5 billion potential online customers.

The allocation and selection mechanism in more contested markets drives fi rms to invest in new digital technologies.
65 Competition from China has induced the adoption of new technologies and ICTs in OECD countries, accounting for 15 percent of their technology investment between 2000 and 2007 and contributing to their productivity growth.66 Arguably, the entry and innovations of Taobao, Alibaba’s consumer-to-consumer (C2C) platform, were at least in part encouraged by foreign competition from eBay. Similarly, fi rms in more contested sectors in Vietnam, which have higher entry and exit rates, are more likely to invest in broadband internet. And younger fi rms in Mexico use e-commerce more intensively: the share of online sales in total sales is almost twice as high in young fi rms (less than fi ve years old) than in older fi rms.67 In France, automobile dealers enhanced their investments in ICT, such as human resource software and other innovations, when facing more intense product market competition after the liberalization of the automobile distribution system in the European Union in 2002.68 In high-income countries, the youngest fi rms use the internet more intensively, while in low-income countries, the oldest fi rms do (fi gure 1.
20). In lowincome countries, however, startups seem to face barriers to more intensive internet use, which the oldest fi rms (typically also larger) tend to overcome. In middle-income countries, the results are mixed. Domestic fi rms in developing countries use the internet more intensively when they face pressure from foreign competition. The probability that domestic fi rms (with at least fi ve employees) facing foreign competition use broadband internet increases by 41 percent; that they sell their products online, by 29 percent; and that they purchase inputs online, by 36 percent (fi gure 1.21).
 The increase in internet use due to foreign competition is independent of fi rms’ initial productivity. Among six African countries in 2014, for instance, increased competition incentivized fi rms to use the internet more intensively, leading to more product and process innovation. Firms that had experienced more competitive pressure, leading to a decline in their market shares over the past three years, invested in more intensive uses of the internet. For example, a 10-percent reduction in the market share increased the probability that these fi rms used the internet to market their products, on average, by 11 percent, and the probability that they used the internet to manage their inventory by 8 percent.69 Domestic fi rms in together with the lower transaction costs in online marketplaces should, in turn, encourage more fi rms (in developing countries) to use the internet to export to foreign markets in coming years. Countries need policies to encourage competition Domestic or foreign barriers to entry and competition reduce fi rms’ incentives to invest in digital technologies or complementary skills and reorganization.
 Without competitive pressure, private fi rms lack incentives to invest in costly or risky new technologies. The complementary factors at the fi rm level correspond to competition policies at the country level. Firms are more likely to invest in skills or organizational restructuring if they are subject to product market competition.61 European manufacturers are investing in machines that communicate with one another (internet of things) to escape the increasing competition from low-cost Asian producers. For instance, BuS Elektronik invested in information technology to specialize in custom-designed electronics components produced in lot sizes that are too small to spur the entry of Asian electronics fi rms. The Daimler Group’s Smart automobile plant uses modern information technology to integrate assembly and production lines among a network of seven large suppliers.
 The interlinked production system allows Daimler to optimize its value chain and to customize its products, with 10,000 variations of its vehicle cockpits. Low-cost factories in emerging countries cannot easily copy this strategy, which requires proprietary data.62 The mechanism is illustrated in Schumpeterian growth models predicting that each fi rm will invest in technologies new to the fi rm to reduce its costs and escape competition—albeit only temporarily. But these incentives are attenuated when leading fi rms in the sector have cost advantages that trailing fi rms cannot overcome. The market leaders have little incentive to invest in technologies new to the fi rm since they do not face competitive pressures to reduce their costs; the laggard fi rms are too far away from the frontier to bridge the cost gap and instead use vintage production technologies, focusing on local market niches to survive.63 Thus fast-growing sectors with a high share of fi rms using new technologies exhibit specifi c fi rm dynamics, echoing high fi rm churning and neck-and-neck competition market structures, forcing fi rms to enhance their effi ciency by investing in more productive technologies.
 The positive links among competition, technology adoption, and productivity growth are well documented.64 78 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 Kenya and Uganda used the internet more intensively in sectors with increasing competition from foreign direct investment (FDI). The (more intensive) internet use due to higher competition had led to more product and process innovation among fi rms in these six African countries. Manufacturing fi rms in Mexico are more likely to invest in digital technologies and use them more productively when they sell products that are directly competing with imports from China. Firms that faced this external shock of higher foreign competition between 2000 and 2008, either in the domestic or the U.S.
 (export) market, increased their number of computers per employee, their share of labor using the internet, and their share of online purchases in total purchases in the subsequent four years, 2008–12 (see fi gure 1.22). As a result, the share of labor using the internet in 2012 was 11 percent higher for fi rms that faced more Chinese competition—and the share of online purchases was 114 percent higher. The more intensive use of digital technologies due to Chinese competition translated into productivity growth among fi rms in Mexico. By contrast, ICT use had no impact on labor productivity growth among Mexican fi rms that did not face import competition from China.70 Manufacturing fi rms confronted with an increase in competition in Brazil are more likely to implement Source: Hussain (2015) based on World Bank Enterprise Surveys data, 2010–14.

71 Consistent with these fi ndings, aggregate sector and country data suggest a negative correlation between regulatory barriers to product market competition and fi rms’ investments in digital technologies. More restrictive product market regulations on fi rm entry in service sectors are associated with lower ICT use (fi gure 1.23, panel a). The negative relation prevails when comparing restrictions to domestic or foreign entry in individual service sectors with fi rms’ internet use in these sectors across countries. Professional service fi rms in Europe—for architecture, design, consulting, legal, and accounting—are less likely to sell their services online in countries that have higher barriers to entry in these sectors. Transport service fi rms are less likely to purchase cloud computing services, such as CRM software, over the internet in European countries that have higher regulatory barriers for foreign fi rms to enter.
 Domestic retail fi rms are less likely to use the internet for online sales if they operate in countries with higher entry barriers for foreign retailers. The same is true for manufacturing fi rms: higher nontariff barriers to trade are associated with lower ICT use in manufacturing (fi gure 1.23, panel b).72 Firms’ internet use varies with barriers to competition across sectors in the same country. The Philippine retail sector has substantial restrictions to domestic and foreign entry and is dominated by a few incumbent fi rms, while few fi rms use ICTs. Foreign retailers that aim to establish a commercial presence need to pass prequalifi cation procedures, meet minimum capital requirements, meet limitations to foreign equity participation, and have the majority of the board of directors be Filipinos.
 Only about 20 percent of retail fi rms (with at least fi ve employees) sell online in the Philippines.73 By contrast, the Philippine business process outsourcing sector is characterized by high entry rates and few regulatory barriers to competition. It is intensive in ICT-related services such as software development, animation, contact centers, and transcription. These ICT-specifi c services experienced high productivity growth in recent years and provided about 1.2 million jobs in 2015. Similarly, Nigeria’s retail sector, Indonesia’s banking sector, and India’s and Bulgaria’s ICT sectors are more internet intensive and have fewer regulatory barriers to competition in otherwise diffi cult business environments.
 80 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 higher fees, despite having competitive rates for customers. So greater digital use needs to be accompanied by unifi ed standards, full interoperability, and competition across platforms and contracts. Overall, countries that pursue procompetitive regulations in most sectors grow faster, as fi rms in these countries invest in digital technologies and use them more effectively. Given the substantial variations in barriers to domestic or foreign competition and entry across countries, the divergence in fi rms’ use of the digital technologies across sectors and countries is not surprising. The future of markets Uber, the world’s largest taxi company, owns no vehicles. Facebook, the world’s most popular media owner, creates no content.
 Alibaba, the most valuable retailer, has no inventory. And Airbnb, the world’s largest accommodation provider, owns no real estate. Something interesting is happening. —Tom Goodwin, Havas Media The internet promotes competition, which encourages more fi rms to use the internet—a potential virtuous cycle. So, competition is not only a complementary factor but also a mechanism for the internet to increase growth. Internet fi rms can circumvent Regulation to foster competition in the digital economy needs to consider network effects and switching costs, which can lead to new entry barriers in parts of the digital economy.
 To address these changes in market structures, regulations must prevent anticompetitive behavior and ensure that potential entrepreneurs have fair market access. Regulatory authorities in many countries play a similar role for other network industries, such as electricity or telecommunications. Regulators in several countries have made phone numbers portable across carriers—so that users can keep the same phone number while switching to a new provider—minimizing switching costs and ensuring a level playing fi eld for new entrants. Similar regulatory innovations might be required for social media, digital marketplaces, digital payment systems, and the sharing economy, where users need to be able to change internet platforms with ease and at zero cost. But regulating the digital economy is far from straightforward. It requires deep understanding of technical characteristics of the corresponding technology.
 Most internet fi rms, operating in two-sided markets, can blur price signals in either of the two markets. For instance, sharing economy platforms typically set the rates they charge customers as well as suppliers (drivers or homeowners). Once the platform has a large set of users, it can charge suppliers Sources: Panel a: Product Market Regulation Index (OECD, various years); Digital Access Index (DAI) (Internet Coaching Library, various years).

Economic activities with a high potential growth impact from digital technologies are often protected from foreign or domestic competition in developing countries.
 The potential impact of the internet on fi rm productivity is often highest for economic activities that typically have higher barriers to competition (table 1.3). These sectors include utilities that are often natural monopolies, which are more diffi cult to regulate. But they also include banking, insurance, transport, retail trade, and some professional services, which are often protected by regulations from more foreign or domestic competition in developing countries (see fi gure 1.23). In sum, developing countries with an institutional environment that safeguards competition and easy market entry will more likely harness the full growth opportunities of digital technologies and catch up faster with high-income countries.
 But countries will more likely remain poor if the institutional environment allows fi rms to obtain profi ts by lobbying for protection rather than investing in new digital technologies.77 regulatory barriers to competition and entry in traditional sectors such as retail, transport, or fi nance. But this will not happen if vested interests are strong enough to capture regulators and create new barriers to competition and technology adoption. For instance, some taxi companies try to protect their lucrative businesses by pushing for new regulations that block ride sharing companies. Prices of the ride sharing companies, estimated before the ride takes place, can easily be compared, introducing greater transparency—something that taxi regulators attempted for years by requiring taxis to publish their price lists. Cities with tighter market controls like Barcelona, Berlin, and Paris recently saw widespread protests by the taxi industry, as opposed to Dublin, which deregulated its taxi market and lifted restrictions on the number of taxis practically overnight in 2000 (fares remain regulated).
74 In India, taxi associations wrote to the Reserve Bank of India complaining that Uber’s credit card transactions violate the country’s foreign exchange regulations. Uber collects the fare from a passenger’s credit card, transmits it abroad in a foreign currency, and then sends 80 percent of the transaction value back to the driver. The taxi association argues that this violates Indian laws that permit Uber to collect the commission but not the fare in a foreign currency. In Morocco, the market power of fi rms owned by infl uential politically connected businessmen stifl es competition, ICT adoption, and innovation among manufacturing fi rms. Firms that are directly or indirectly owned by the political rulers are larger, have higher market shares, and have higher profi ts.75 The larger scale seems to help these fi rms adopt digital technologies and innovate (fi gure 1.
24). While politically connected fi rms individually invest more in ICT, their presence seems to discourage other fi rms from doing so. Politically connected fi rms appear to dominate their markets: only 30 percent of them report more than fi ve competitors, compared with 65 percent of all other fi rms; only 11 percent of politically connected fi rms report price competition in domestic markets, compared with 37 percent of all other fi rms. There is no difference between politically connected and unconnected fi rms for price competition in foreign (export) markets. The dominance of politically connected fi rms and the resulting lack of competition seem to discourage all other fi rms in their industry from adopting digital technologies or innovating, leading to inferior aggregate technology adoption: only 32 percent of all fi rms in industries with at least one politically connected fi rm have a website, compared with 40 percent in industries without Source: Saadi 2015.

The results here are somewhat higher than the ones in Jorgenson (2011), who fi nds that the accumulation of ICT capital raised aggregate growth by 13 percent a year on average for more than 100 countries from 1995 to 2008. Moreover, Manyika and others (2011) estimate that the average contribution of the internet (alone) to economic growth was 0.
3 percentage points among seven high-income countries between 2004 and 2009, and 0.4 percentage points for fi ve large developing countries (Brazil, China, India, the Republic of Korea, and the Russian Federation). These results should be regarded with caution, however, since the growth contribution of the internet is effectively equated with the contribution of TFP. 11. Melitz 2003. 12.
 The internet reduces information frictions by providing a tool for fi rms to easily fi nd information about new markets and advertise their products to multiple buyers. In addition, the internet can reinforce business and social networks and reduce communication costs with potential customers (Rauch 1999; Rauch and Trindade 2002; Fink, Mattoo, and Neagu 2005). 13. Freund and Weinhold (2004) examine the growth of bilateral merchandise exports of 56 countries and (2002) consider the growth of U.S. imports and exports of services.
 Both studies use data from 1995 to 1999. 14. There are two common measurements of internet usage in these studies. Freund and Weinhold (2002, 2004) and Clarke and Wallsten (2006) measure internet usage by the number of web hosts, while Osnago and Tan (2015) use the percentage of individuals using the internet in a country. 15. Osnago and Tan (2015) estimate a panel gravity equation using aggregate bilateral trade fl ows from 2001 to 2012 for all countries with country-pair and year Notes 1.
 These channels can affect growth through more than one mechanism. For instance, the internet increases trade not only by allowing more and smaller fi rms to export (inclusion) but also by allowing existing exporters to trade more intensively, exploiting economies of scale (effi ciency). 2. Nguyen and Schiffbauer 2015. 3. The results are based on ICT surveys linked to census data of fi rms in manufacturing and service sectors.

Table 1.3 Economic activities with high potential for fi rms to use digital technologies more intensively are often protected from foreign or domestic competition in developing countries, reducing productivity growth Sectors or activities with barriers to competition Potential impact Lowest Medium Highest High — Banking, insurance, retail and wholesale trade Transport Medium Manufacturing Agriculture, hotels and restaurants, mining, technical services Education, health care, real estate, utilities Low — Legal services Construction Source: WDR 2016 team. Note: The approximate grouping of sectors for the potential impact of digital technology is determined by scalability and contract complexity of most products in the sector, as defi ned in table 1.
1. Digital technologies have a high potential in sectors that are more scalable and less complex (upper left cell in table 1.1), a medium impact for sectors that are more scalable but more complex or less scalable but less complex, and a low impact for sectors that are less scalable and more complex (lower right cell in table 1.1). The approximate grouping of sectors for the degree of competition is based on sectors’ tradability, their average barriers to foreign or domestic entry across countries (for example, the Product Market Regulation Index [OECD, various years] and the Services Trade Restrictions Index), and their fi xed costs (natural monopolies or land intensiveness). — = not available.
 83ACCELERATING GROWTH fi xed effects controlling for time-invariant differences across fi rms and changes in any other export determinants across provinces over time. 28. Baldwin (2011) describes the reduction of transportation costs from the late 1800s as the fi rst unbundling, where consumption and production can be geographically separated. 29. This relationship has been confi rmed in Canada (Baldwin and Gu 2008), Germany (Rasel 2012), Ireland (Murphy and Siedschlag 2013), Italy (Benfratello, Razzolini, and Sembenelli 2009), the United Kingdom (Abramovsky and Griffi th 2006), and globally based on a large dataset of multinational fi rms and their subsidiaries (Alfaro and Chen 2015). 30.
 Cristea (2014) also fi nds that the negative relationship between the headquarter services exports and communication costs weakens with the education of the foreign workers. 31. Fort 2014. 32. Alfaro and Chen (2015) examine the patterns of entry of multinational fi rms into 70 countries from 2005 to 2007. The data are from the Harvard Business School’s Orbis Database ( /go/orbis.
html) and cover 1.2 million manufacturing companies. 33. Computer and information services exports include computer services such as hardware- and software- related services, news agency services, and database services. 34. Cardona, Kretschmer, and Strobel (2013) provide a survey of the recent microeconomic studies estimating the relationship between the use of digital technologies and fi rm productivity growth.

 38. Chick, Huchzermeier, and Netessine 2014. 39. McKinsey Global Institute 2014. 40. The analysis is based on an annual panel of fi rm census data from 2007 to 2012 with more than 300,000 observations each year.
 TFP is estimated following the methodology of Olley and Pakes (1996). Each regression controls for two-digit sector dummies, year dummies, and fi rm characteristics (fi rm size, age, and ownership as well as export status). See Nguyen and Schiffbauer (2015) for details. 41. Brown and Goolsbee 2002. Their availability raised price dispersion initially and then reduced it as internet use became more widespread, which is consistent with the theory of search costs by Stigler (1961) and Stahl (1989).
 42. The results are based on a regression of the average entry density on a dummy that is one in the years of or after the reform, controlling for year-specifi c effects. 43. The positive link between the use of new technology and competition is well documented. For instance, fi xed effects. They determine whether a country has high internet usage when it has an internet usage above the median for all countries, which changes yearly.
 16. The results are based on Osnago and Tan (2015). 17. eBay 2013. 18. Chen and Xu (2015) compare transaction-level data from AliExpress (a branch of Alibaba) and Chinese customs data across seven months.
 The online trade data are transaction-level data based on AliExpress from January to July 2014, and the offl ine trade data are Chinese customs data from January to July 2006. 19. Chen and Xu 2015. 20. The average number of export destinations is relatively low since the study focuses on only nine products that are narrowly defi ned at the 10-digit level (harmonized classifi cation system). Thus, the average fi rm is only exporting about two different specialized products, for instance, silk and pure cotton T-shirts.
 21. As a comparison, large fi rms selling on eBay reach an average of 30 export destinations (eBay 2013); large fi rms are defi ned as having an annual export of more than US$10,000 in 2012. 22. See . 23. Andjelkovic 2015.
 24. Tan 2015; Osnago and Tan 2015. Tan (2015) uses the World Bank Exporter Dynamics Database (World Bank, various years) and estimates a panel regression to examine the effect of the internet usage of 4.5 million fi rms in 47 developing countries between 2002 and 2012. A product is defi ned as a harmonized system (HS) six-digit category. 25.
 This measure of physical infrastructure predicts fi rms’ internet use; it is strongly positively correlated with the number of internet users by province over time (correlation coeffi cient of 0.55). Therefore, the length of the fi ber-optic cables per population is also a good proxy for the number of “last mile” connections to fi rms or households in a province. 26. The number of exporting fi rms and fi rms’ export share follow a similar pattern across provinces over time. 27.
 Fernandes and others (2015) use changes in the number of internet users per capita, Chinese internet domains per capita, and the length of fi ber-optic cables per population to measure the rollout of broadband infrastructure across Chinese provinces between 1999 and 2007. The analysis is based on census data for manufacturing fi rms. The ICT intensity per industry is measured by the ICT capital services share in total capital services based on World KLEMS two-digit sector-level data for the United States, two-digit sector-level data on telecommunication expenses in China, and four-digit sector-level data from a Vietnamese fi rm census. All empirical specifi cations include fi rm fi xed effects and year x province 84 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 and the probability is higher for countries with better logistics. 60. UNCTAD 2015.
 61. Bloom, Sadun, and Van Reenen 2012; Inklaar, Timmer, and van Ark 2008. 62. Chick, Huchzermeier, and Netessine 2014. 63. See Aghion and others 2001.
 The theoretical framework is also closely related to Parente and Prescott (1999). Aghion and others (2001) also discuss whether perfect competition can reduce the incentives for any innovation by reducing the discounted present value of associated rents, leading to an inverted U-shaped relation between competition and growth. They provide evidence, however, that the negative part in the competition-growth nexus is less empirically relevant (see also Aghion and others 2006, 2008, 2009). 64. For instance, Aghion and others (2006, 2008, 2009) fi nd that more product market competition and entry deregulation lead to higher productivity growth. Buccirossi and others (2013) show that improvements in competition policy, measuring restrictions to domestic and foreign entry and restrictions to antitrust, led to higher TFP growth among 22 industries in 12 OECD countries.
 The effect was strongest for antitrust activities. 65. Bartelsman, Hagsten, and Polder 2013. 66. Bloom, Draca, and Van Reenen 2011. 67.
 The fi ndings are consistent for the other available measures of ICT, such as the share of fi rms that have a website or use e-commerce in Vietnam (Nguyen and Schiffbauer 2015), and the average share of a fi rm’s workforce using the internet or the share of fi rms’ e-commerce purchasing over total purchases in Mexico (Iacovone, Pereira-Lopez, and Schiffbauer 2015). 68. Kretschmer, Miravete, and Pernías 2002. 69. Cirera, Lage, and Sabetti 2015. The results are based on more than 2,300 fi rms in these six African countries in 2014.
 70. The effect is based on a regression of (log) labor productivity from 2008 to 2012 on the ICT variables, the product-level degree of import competition from China from 2000 to 2008 (in the Mexican or U.S. markets), and the interaction term between these two variables. Each regression controls for fi rm fi xed effects and changes from 2008 to 2012 in other fi rm characteristics (fi rm size, age, location, exports, foreign or state ownership, and share of skilled labor). See Iacovone, Pereira-Lopez, and Schiffbauer 2015.
 The results are robust when using the interaction term between household internet use at the province level and sectors’ ICT intensity based on U.S. data as an instrumental variable controlling for the endogeneity of the ICT variables. Collard-Wexler and De Loecker (2015) show that two-thirds of the higher productivity in the U.S. steel sector after the introduction of a major new technology, the minimill, originated primarily from an increased competition effect and only one-third from a technology replacement effect.
 In particular, the minimill expansion drove a productivity resurgence at the surviving vertically integrated producers and thus for industry as a whole. 44. Mbiti and Weil (2011) fi nd this effect based on fi rmlevel data comparing competing money transfer services. 45. Wei and Mozur 2014. 46.

A two-sided market is one in which (1) two sets of agents interact through an intermediary platform and (2) the decisions of each set of agents affect the outcomes of the other set of agents, typically through an externality (Rysman 2009). For instance, in an e-commerce platform like Amazon, the two agents are the consumers and the online sellers whereby consumers benefi t from more online sellers using the platform and vice versa. 54. Nunn (2007) constructed a measure of contract intensity for tradable goods.
 Contract-intensive goods include packaging machinery, musical instruments, and alcoholic beverages. Goods with low contract intensity include wearing apparel, frozen food, plastics and rubber, base metals, or fertilizers. 55. The correlation coeffi cient between the contractintensity four-digit sectors in Vietnam from 2007 to 2011 and the share of fi rms that use the internet (have a website) in these sectors is 0.44 (0.28); see Nguyen and Schiffbauer 2015.
 56. Bloom, Sadun, and Van Reenen (2012) argue that digital technologies enhance managers’ information set, improving their ability to monitor staff and allowing them to delegate decisions to subordinate management layers. They show that the impact of good management practices on fi rm productivity is larger in ICT-intensive sectors. 57.

An increase in competition is measured by a change in fi rms’ market share in previous years. The results are based on a multinomial logit regression from 2009 to 2012 where the dependent variable indicates different stages of the e-commerce system; the most advanced e-commerce system also allows for online payments. The regressions control for fi rm characteristics such as fi rm size, age, export status, and ownership and sector-specifi c effects.
 72. Countries with available data that are not members of the World Trade Organization (Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, and Liberia) are excluded because they do not face restrictions on using tariff rates as an alternative mode to restrict import competition. 73. See World Bank Enterprise Surveys (http://www .enterprisesurveys.org/); the World Bank’s Services Trade Restrictions Index (Borchert, Gootiiz, and Mattoo 2013).
 74. See Golovin 2014. To deal with the problem at the time, Ireland set up a “hardship fund” with payments of up to €15,000 to alleviate the fi nancial hardships suffered by license holders due to the devaluation of their assets, although the general consensus was that the government was under no obligation to compensate the taxi industry. 75. The analysis is based on 48 politically connected and 620 nonconnected manufacturing fi rms with at least fi ve employees in the World Bank Enterprise Surveys data in 2004 and 2007. The 48 politically connected fi rms operate in almost all of the 22 two-digit manufacturing industries.
 But within these, they operate in fewer than half of the more than 100 four-digit subsectors in total. See Saadi (2015) for more details. 76. Almost all fi rms in connected and nonconnected industries use e-mail. 77. See, among others, Parente and Prescott (1999) or Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2005).

 2015. Information Economy Report 2015: Unlocking the Potential of E-Commerce for Developing Countries. Geneva: United Nations. /PublicationsLibrary/ier2015_en.pdf. WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 Across the developing world, agriculture sustains the majority of rural livelihoods.
 Ever since people have grown crops, raised livestock, and caught fi sh, they have sought information from one another. What is the most effective planting strategy on steep slopes? Where can we buy improved seeds? Who is paying the highest price at the market? Over time, weather patterns and soil conditions change. Epidemics of pests and diseases come and go.
 Updated information allows farmers to cope with and benefi t from these changes. Providing such knowledge can be challenging. Agriculture is location-specifi c, and farmers need accurate local weather forecasts, advice on agricultural practices and input use, and real-time information about prices and market logistics. Harnessing the rapid growth of the internet and associated digital technologies such as mobile phones is critical to helping farmers obtain the information they need and to promoting transformative agricultural development. Interest is especially keen in increasing access to extension services, improving marketing of outputs, and arranging logistics. The body of rigorous, quantitative evidence on the ways in which digital innovations can help improve the lives of rural people is growing steadily.
 Enhancing on-farm productivity Agricultural productivity varies dramatically around the world. While credit constraints, missing insurance markets, and poor infrastructure account for some of this disparity, suboptimal agricultural practices and poor management are also to blame. New production technologies such as improved seed varieties, nutrient management, and pest control methods are not necessarily reaching farmers. Public extension agents can overcome information barriers related to new agricultural practices and technologies, but such extension programs have been burdened by limited scale, sustainability, and impact. Digital technologies help overcome these constraints. They are reviving agricultural extension and advisory services around the world.
 In cooperation with agricultural research and extension services, organizations such as Digital Green, the Grameen Foundation, and TechnoServe deliver timely, relevant, and actionable information and advice to farmers in South Asia, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, respectively, at a dramatically lower cost than traditional services can. Rather than always visiting a farmer, extension agents use a combination of phone calls, text, videos, and internet to reduce transaction costs and increase the frequency of interaction with farmers. Governments, in partnership with mobile operators, use phones to coordinate distribution of seeds and subsidized fertilizers in remote areas through e-vouchers, as in Nigeria’s large-scale e-wallet initiative (spotlight 2, “Digital fi nance”). Technology fi rms such as Climate Corp, based in Silicon Valley, are pioneering the provision of agrometeorological services for early warning of weather and climate risks. A number of innovations aim for real-time and accurate weather monitoring using remote sensing and technologies enabled with geographic information systems (GIS) for climateresilient agriculture.

 91AGRICULTURE 91 Facilitating market transparency Agricultural product markets in many developing countries are poorly integrated. High search costs have tended to lower competition and create an ineffi cient allocation of goods across markets. When the internet took off in the mid-1990s, it was often claimed that it would improve price transparency, cut out middlemen, and make markets more effi cient. Indeed, rapid adoption of digital technologies has dramatically reduced the search costs incurred by farmers and traders, and hence overcome an important constraint in the context of limited infrastructure. As Robert Jensen’s classic 2007 study of sardine fi shermen and wholesalers in Kerala, India, found, the introduction of mobile phone service dramatically reduced price dispersion and waste in the sardine catch, increasing welfare for producers and consumers (fi gure F1.1).
 Similar effects have been shown for communication platforms such as Esoko in Ghana, e-Choupal in India, and telecenters in Peru, as well as studies on grain traders in Niger and farmers in the Philippines.1 14 Phones added a.

With globalized food systems, ensuring food safety has become more complex. These trends have catalyzed innovations to trace the food supply from producer to consumer—which is important for developing countries that want to reach new export markets. Smallholder farms can turn to cooperatives and aggregators, who use digital tools to improve collection, transportation, and quality control.
 By opening up new specialized market opportunities, the internet has improved consumer protection and farmers’ livelihoods. Lessons for adapting digital technologies for agriculture Why do many of these innovations fail to scale up and achieve wider acceptance? One reason is market fragmentation—even though market consolidation will, over time, enhance growth prospects. Another reason is the lack of fi nancially sustainable business models that will attract private sector investments in innovative solutions for small-scale agriculture. There is great potential for the internet and related technologies to improve rural economies, but several lessons need to be kept in mind. First, agriculture is becoming increasingly knowledge-intensive and high-tech.
 Some of the world’s newest industries have started to put money and tech talent into farming—the world’s oldest industry. Digital soil maps, remote sensing, and global positioning system (GPS) guidance are critical tools for modern farmers. “Big data” for precision agriculture increases yields and effi ciency. These high-tech tools mostly benefi t big farms that can make large investments in technology. But there are also many innovative ways in which illiterate and otherwise disadvantaged people use digital technologies, such as basic mobile phones. Greater efforts to close the digital divide in rural areas can have great payoffs.
 Second, basic price and market information systems can improve effi ciency and welfare. The evidence, although strong, is still limited to certain countries and certain contexts. A number of recent studies have cast doubt on the overall novelty of information provided to the farmer and the degree of competition in many markets. One explanation of weak effects is low take-up of fee-based price information services. But even when farmers are seemingly better informed, they may not necessarily be able to act on that information because of the inaccessibility of alternative markets and the complex interlinked relationships between buyers and sellers in low-income developing economies. Rather than assuming that an information and communication technology (ICT) approach will always be cost-effective and yield a better outcome, a more nuanced understanding of the underlying institutional environment and constraints is warranted.
 Third, technology-enabled interventions are no panacea in themselves, and need to be backed by complementary investments in physical infrastructure, including electricity and literacy. The versatility and near-constant innovation that characterize digital technologies can sometimes be a distraction that can cause interventions to focus more on the technology than on the demands and priorities of the intended benefi ciaries and the trade-offs imposed by resourceconstrained environments. Finally, information technology (IT) policy and the broader regulatory environment in a country should be discussed jointly. Whereas the expansion of mobile phone access has been rapid and commercially selfsustaining even among many of the poor, the same is not true of the internet. In the long run, the internet can have an even greater impact on rural growth; much depends on fi nding sustainable business models to encourage its spread in the poorest parts of the world. Note 1.

 doi: 10.1146/annurev-resource-100913-012714. 94 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 Until a few years ago, agricultural productivity in Nigeria was declining, even though government spending had increased.1 Since then, agriculture has become a driver of economic growth. One reason has been an innovative mobile wallet system initiated jointly by the public and private sectors and run by Cellulant, a mobile services company. Nigeria’s smallholder farmers depend on subsidized fertilizer, but this crucial resource too often did not reach benefi ciaries.
 The 2012 Growth Enhancement Support Scheme introduced mobile technology to transfer fertilizer subsidies directly to farmers, taking the government out of the business of procuring and distributing fertilizer. The support scheme now helps up to twice as many farmers, at one-sixth the cost. The transfer system relies on a database of more than 10.5 million farmers, who, as registered recipients of the subsidies, now have a better chance of gaining access to formal or regulated fi nancial services. Based on this initial success, the system is expanding, aided by a digital identifi cation system and biometric signatures, taking fi nancial services far into Nigeria’s rural hinterland. This example and many similar experiences covered throughout this Report illustrate the large impact of the internet and related digital technologies on the fi nancial sector.
2 Digital fi nance has promoted fi nancial inclusion, providing access to fi nancial services to many of the 80 percent of poor adults estimated to be excluded from the regulated fi nancial sector.3 It has boosted effi ciency, as the cost of fi nancial transactions has dropped and speed and convenience have increased. And it has led to major innovations in the fi nancial sector, many of which have emerged in developing countries (box S2.1). The benefi ts pervade almost all areas discussed in this Report. Digital fi nance makes businesses more productive, allows individuals to take advantage of opportunities in the digital world, and helps streamline public sector service delivery.
 Like all great opportunities, digital fi nance also comes with risks. What makes online fi nancial systems easy to use for customers also makes them susceptible to cybercrime. The entry of nontraditional players poses new challenges for policy, regulation, and supervision. And the ease of transferring funds across the globe—often anonymously, using means such as cryptocurrencies—might increase illicit fi nancial fl ows. Benefi ts of digital fi nance Digital fi nance promotes fi nancial inclusion More than 2 billion people have no access to any fi nancial services. Overall, only about 59 percent of men and 50 percent of women in developing countries have an account at a regulated fi nancial institution.
 Women, the poor, and small businesses often rely on informal fi nancial services, even when they receive public transfers or remittances. Digital payment systems help overcome barriers to accessing fi nancial services. Mobile money schemes, in particular, allow people who own a phone but do not have a bank account to make and receive payments. In the right environment, these systems can take off and reach massive size rapidly (fi gure S2.1). Digital payments can reduce costs to recipients.

S P O TL IG H T 2 S P O TL IG H T 2 95DIGITAL FINANCE 95 Box S2.1 Innovations in digital payments There are four major innovations in digital payments. Wrappers create a digital interface with traditional payment systems such as credit cards or bank accounts. Many are off ered by nontraditional providers, including internet intermediaries such as Google Wallet and Apple Pay. Mobile money systems store money in the national currency as credit on smart cards or a system provider’s books, and enable payments online or through mobile phones.
 A well-known example is M-Pesa, run by Safaricom. These systems can off er lower fees and easier use than traditional payment systems, even for those without a bank account. Credits and local digital currencies are alternative units of account (not in national currency) designed to promote spending in a local economy or as a means of exchange in computer games. Digital currencies are both a new decentralized payment scheme and a new currency. Such schemes record transactions in a publicly visible ledger. Most digital currencies, including Bitcoin, are cryptocurrencies because they use cryptographic techniques to ensure secure validation of transactions.
 To get a sense of the magnitude of digital payment fl ows, consider this: In 2014, the volume of Bitcoin transactions worldwide was about US$23 billion; for mobile payments on M-Pesa in Kenya, it was about US$24 billion; for the online payment platform PayPal, it was US$228 billion; and for the credit card issuer Visa, it was US$4.7 trillion.

Digital payments increase control, since senders of remittances can have a greater infl uence on how recipients use the money, including for savings. Digital fi nance can increase the incentive to save, through automatic deposits, text reminders, or default options.
 Texted reminders increased savings in Bolivia, Peru, and the Philippines by up to 16 percent.5 Digital payments improve risk management by making it easier to receive support from social networks that can act as safety nets. M-Pesa users were better able to absorb income shocks compared to nonusers.6 Digital payments speed up delivery, which is especially important in case of emergencies such as natural disasters. And they increase security compared to traveling with large amounts of cash, as is commonly necessary in low- and middle-income countries. Digital fi nance can increase women’s economic participation.
 In part, this is because digital payments can more easily be concealed by the recipient than cash, at least temporarily, which helps shift economic decision making in favor of women. Access to savings instruments also increases female empowerment and the consumption and productive investment of female entrepreneurs. There is a signifi cantly positive relationship between female labor force participation and female bank account ownership.7 Information asymmetries—when one party to a transaction knows much more than the other—are pervasive in the fi nancial sector. In credit markets, especially those for informal enterprises and lowincome borrowers, the lender usually has limited information about a potential borrower’s ability to repay a loan, thus impeding lending. Digital technologies help estimate credit scores from digital footprints.
 Alifi nance, a subsidiary of the Chinese e-commerce fi rm Alibaba that is now part of Ant Financial, provides loans to vendors on its e-commerce platform. Many vendors have small operations and face diffi culties obtaining loans in the traditional fi nancial system. Alifi nance’s credit scoring model is based on at least three months of a vendor’s online activity and makes loan decisions automatically and almost instantly. Loans are Y 20,000 to Y 30,000 (US$3,500 to US$5,000), on average, with fl exible repayment terms. Micro lending elsewhere that serves small farmers or small businesses functions similarly, often using mobile phone payment records to assess credit risk. M-Shwari, operated by the Commercial Bank of Africa and Safaricom, is a bank account linked to Kenya’s M-Pesa payment system.
 It pays interest on deposits and provides short-term loans with approval often in a matter of seconds based on M-Pesa usage history. Between November 2012 and early 2015, the system issued 21 million loans to 2.8 million unique borrowers, with an average loan amount of US$15. Digital fi nance can increase effi ciency The internet reduces the cost of many fi nancial transactions by allowing their unbundling into separate components that can be automated or provided by specialized entities. A retail payment consists of pre-transaction, authorization, clearing, settlement, and post-transaction, each one again involving several steps. Specialized providers can execute individual steps, yielding economies of scale that translate into savings.
 Such service providers are becoming more widespread in developing and emerging markets. Governments can also lower the cost of fi nancial transactions. Electronic payment cards reduced costs of social transfers in Brazil’s conditional cash transfer program, Bolsa Familia, from almost 15 percent to under 3 percent of total payments.8 McKinsey estimated in 2010 that digital payments could save the government of India US$22 billion per year.9 A large part of these savings comes from lower leakages and reduced fraud. Electronic payments create a clear digital record and can be traced, so the likelihood of funds not reaching the benefi ciary or of duplicate payments or payments to “ghost” recipients who do not exist will be lower.
 Evidence from India also shows that using smart cards rather than cash for social security payments halved the incidence of demands for bribes. Digital fi nance spurs fi nancial innovation The fi nancial sector is transaction-intensive and has always been at the forefront of adopting new technology. Automation has led to a signifi cant reduction in fi nancial transaction costs. This has spawned innovations, such as automated credit scoring using advanced analytics and massive amounts of data. Automating processes allows new, so-called fi n-tech fi rms to offer services often at lower costs than traditional providers, including money transfer across borders (Xoom, TransferWise) or short-term loans (Wonga, ZestFinance). Part of the Alibaba Group in China, Yu’E Bao—or “leftover treasure” in Mandarin— is a fi xed-income investment fund into which customers can easily transfer balances from their Alipay digital payment accounts.
 Established in 2013, by the end of 2014, the fund had 185 million users and about US$93 billion in assets. Peer-to-peer lending platforms operate without traditional fi nancial intermediaries, 97DIGITAL FINANCE S P O TL IG H T 2 instead matching potential lenders and borrowers directly. The emergence of digital currencies has been another innovation made possible by the internet. Bitcoin, the most well-known, was created in 2009. Its value in terms of national currencies has fl uctuated widely, its acceptance as a means of exchange has been limited, and there have been widely publicized instances of fraud. But a recent analysis by the Bank of England suggests that the key innovation of such currencies is the distributed ledger that removes the need for accounting and settlement by intermediaries such as banks.
10 This model could also work for other fi nancial assets such as loans, stocks, or bonds, although it is unlikely to spread widely anytime soon. Managing risks The rapid development of whole new segments of fi nance has raised policy questions. How should these new areas of fi nance be regulated and supervised, for instance to ensure consumer protection? Do they pose signifi cant risks to fi nancial stability? And do they make it easier to commit fi nancial fraud or illicit fl ows of funds? One characteristic of digital fi nance has been the rise of nontraditional providers of fi nancial services such as money transfers, savings, and lending.
 Some of these are new companies such as peer-to-peer lending fi rms like Kickstarter or LendingTree. Others are nonfi nancial institutions setting up a fi nance arm (or “nonbank”), such as e-commerce sites like eBay (owner of PayPal) and Alibaba; internet intermediaries like Google; electronics and software developers like Apple; and telecom operators like Safaricom. This raises several concerns. One concern is that traditional fi nancial regulation does not always cover these companies or they are held to a different standard, such as reduced oversight, even though they can scale up quickly. These problems are somewhat similar to the “shadow banking problem” that preceded the global fi nancial crisis, and regulators are exploring ways to shift from regulating entities to regulating activities. Traditional fi nancial institutions, in contrast, use regulatory arguments to keep out innovative providers of digital fi nancial services that could greatly benefi t consumers and fi rms.
 This has obstructed the growth of online payment systems in Central America, for example. Light regulation fosters innovation. M-Pesa could not have grown as quickly had Kenya’s central bank erected strict regulatory hurdles. Second, digital fi nance is bringing large numbers of people into the fi nancial system for the fi rst time. This requires strong consumer education and consumer protection, including promoting fi nancial literacy and fraud prevention, dispute resolution mechanisms, and data privacy. A third concern is that fi nancial innovations could pose a systemic risk to a country’s banking sector, including credit, liquidity, operational, and consumer risk.
 Prudential regulation of digital fi nance reduces this risk, but may involve high compliance costs that raise barriers to entry, and thus to competition. Concerns about risks to the banking system were raised about Bitcoin, but analysis by the Bank of England, for instance, suggests that digital currencies play too small a role to threaten fi nancial stability. A greater concern may be that fi nancial innovations create distortions in fi nancial markets that could have larger implications. For example, if automation and “big data” approaches make it much easier to issue consumer credit but not commercial credit, fi nancial institutions might overallocate to the former, potentially creating a credit bubble and reducing credit availability for investments that increase productivity. Finally, there are concerns about increased fraud in the fi nancial system.11 With the rise of electronic banking, cyberattacks on fi nancial institutions and on other sectors processing electronic fi nancial transactions have also increased.
 Massive theft of credit card information from retailers has highlighted the stakes involved. Larger fi nancial institutions have the resources and know-how to continuously upgrade online and mobile security through tools such as encryption or strong authentication. In fact, banks have been at the forefront of developing secure transaction processes. But smaller and nonfi nancial institutions may be more at risk. Apart from monetary losses, a large risk is also a loss of trust in digital fi nancial systems that may hinder further innovation in the sector. Besides fraud and theft, digital fi nance could facilitate fi nancial fl ows for illegal or illicit purposes.
12 Such transfers could be money laundering (“cyberlaundering”), when illegally obtained funds are turned into seemingly legal assets through a process of deposit, layering, and integration with legitimate funds. They could represent payments for illegal goods or services such as drugs. Or they could be illicit fi nancial fl ows— often from developing countries to capital markets in industrialized countries—that represent the proceeds from tax evasion, corruption, or bypassing of capital controls. Some fl ows may be to circumvent arbitrary regulations by unaccountable governments, but often they are the result of illegal activity that deprives a 98 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 S P O TL IG H T 2 country of fi nancial resources that, in aggregate, are thought to exceed the value of development aid.13 The anonymity, speed, ease of transaction, and global reach of digital fi nance make illegal and illicit transfers easier, including through the ability to split large transactions into small tranches. Internet sites such as online casinos and digital currencies that offer a high degree of anonymity aid such activity.
 One study found that online casinos offered customers a choice of 235 payment options.14 And Bitcoin has been used to circumvent capital controls. Because these fl ows as well as cybercrime generally cross borders, it is not always clear which jurisdiction is responsible. Although the internet might make illegal money transfers easier, it can also help address the problem. In contrast to cash, electronic transfers leave a trail that can aid law enforcement. Digital technologies could also help establish registries of benefi cial ownership of fi nancial and commercial holdings and transaction monitoring systems, a current priority of the G-20.
 This could reduce tax evasion and cyberlaundering— although the barriers to developing such directories tend to be due more to resistance by tax havens than to technical reasons, and reforms have mostly been prompted by high-profi le disclosures (box S2.2). More generally, technology as a tool for tackling the problem of illicit fi nancial fl ows can complement, but not substitute for, proper legal frameworks, international cooperation, and public-private collaboration. As with international reporting obligations aimed at preventing fi nancing of illegal activities or terrorism, a greater regulatory burden and reporting requirements can tax the resources of smaller countries, which may require assistance to comply. Digital fi nance is developing rapidly, and constant changes will challenge the ability of regulators to catch up. Both too much and too little intervention by policy makers entails risks.
 Even in light of new types of fi nancial crime online, however, the opportunities of digital fi nance for inclusion, effi ciency, and innovation will likely outweigh the risks. Notes 1. Case study from Grossman and Tarazi 2014. 2. See Bossone 2015. 3.

2 Technology can help unveil illicit money fl ows Global communication networks have made it easier to move illicit money around the world and to shelter assets from domestic tax authorities. But recent high-profi le cases also show how a combination of human intervention and technology increases the chances of detection. In each case, large datasets were leaked by insiders to tax offi cials or watchdog groups such as the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). One case in 2014, Off shore Leaks, yielded 260 gigabytes of accounts data in off shore tax havens, including the British Virgin Islands and Cook Islands. Collaborating with media outlets, experts from Costa Rica, Germany, Malta, and the United Kingdom developed automated software tools for organizing and searching this massive dataset. The largest number of addresses tied to these off shore accounts were from a number of large emerging economies.
 Besides Off shore Leaks, Swiss Leaks yielded data about secret bank accounts in Switzerland, and Lux Leaks documented strategies that international corporations use to avoid taxes in countries where they make profi ts, notably by channeling them through Luxembourg. While many clients are from developing countries, they get help from western accountants, and much of the money ends up in industrialized countries or their off shore territories. Increased transparency, thanks to technology’s ability to sift through large leaked datasets, is encouraging reforms that will make it harder to hide assets in foreign jurisdictions.

But not everyone stands to benefi t automatically. Only by improving internet access and basic literacy and updating skill and training systems will the benefi ts be realized and broadly shared.
 For the world’s poor, the key is to leverage digital technologies to improve the productivity of household enterprises, subsistence family farmers, and the informal sector. Yet for every person connected to the internet in developing countries, almost three are not; among the poor, more than six are not; and many also lack access to such complementary infrastructure as electricity or roads. Even if connected, many cannot read or use the information the internet provides. For workers in more organized labor markets, conditions are changing rapidly. New jobs require different skills from old jobs, and many new jobs are informal or nonwage, without benefi ts or worker protections. Greater computer power and internet connectivity make some skills obsolete by substituting for work that is codifi able and routine, and thus can be automated.
 The remaining tasks require complex skills that complement technology, such as creativity, critical thinking, and problem solving. These skills remain hard for technology to emulate, but also for education and training systems to provide, leaving many workers unprepared for the modern world of work. Thus while digital technologies can raise productivity and enhance overall welfare, associated labor market disruptions can be painful and can result in higher inequality. High-skilled workers are the biggest winners when paired with digital technologies. Globally, returns to education remain high, at 10 percent per year, and are even higher for those using technology at work. The poor, with no access to technology and lacking skills, see few of the direct downsides from technological adoption but also only partial benefi ts.
 Digital technologies can improve overall welfare and reduce poverty, but without complementary investments, they can also worsen inequality. In Africa alone, 11 million youth are expected to enter the labor market every year for the next decade.1 Born in the internet era, they live in a world full of new and exciting opportunities.2 Farmers use mobile phones to get price information and technical advice. Women facing barriers to work outside their homes can work online and better balance work and family. And many have found earning opportunities through online work and the on-demand economy.
 But these new opportunities come hand in hand with fundamental and rapid changes in the world of work, as digital technologies increase the demand for advanced skills, and many skills quickly become obsolete. From a technological standpoint, fewer than half of today’s schoolchildren in China, Croatia, or Thailand can expect to fi nd a job in an occupation that exists today.3 But more than jobs disappearing, they will be transformed. The challenge for policy makers is to ensure that all current and future workers can seize the growing economic opportunities that accompany the spread of digital technologies. The risk is that rapid technological change will end up increasing inequality and leaving many behind—blunting the digital dividends. The potential gains from technological progress for workers and consumers in developing countries are indeed large.
 Digital technologies can create jobs and increase earnings in the small information and communication technology (ICT) sector—and much more in the sectors that use ICT. They also increase worker productivity by augmenting human capital and—especially critical for the poor—connecting people to work and markets. And they can benefi t consumers by lowering prices and expanding the variety of goods and services available, thus producing consumer surplus. Most of these consumer gains come from lower marginal production and distribution CHAPTER 2 Expanding opportunities 101EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES (fi gure 2.2). A technology diffuses rapidly when it is low in cost, easy to use, has high potential benefi ts, and fi ts well with the local context.
 Low-cost mobile phones—which can be shared, prepaid, billed in prices per second, and do not require much literacy or numeracy for basic use—fi t this description, and are the technology of choice among the poor.8 In Cameroon, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, more than four in fi ve mobile phone owners have simple phones, not capable of browsing the internet.9 Personal computers and the internet, by contrast, require literacy and often foreign language (especially English) skills. Computers with internet capabilities in the Warana subdistrict in Maharashtra, India, for instance, went largely unused except for transmitting market information to farmers—a function later substituted by mobile phones, which were cheaper and easier to use.10 Communications, entertainment, and searching for information are the most common uses for mobile phones and the internet. In African countries, social networking, sending and receiving e-mails, instant messaging, and checking facts and defi nitions are the most common uses of the internet (fi gure 2.
3). This is similar in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay, and the European Union countries, especially with social networking (between 50 and 80 percent of all internet users).11 The use of digital technologies But it is the middle class that can be hollowed out as jobs held by this segment—often medium skilled—are transformed, partly driven by technological change. Machine operators and clerical support workers, for example, perform many “routine” tasks that are easily automated. Since 1995, the share of routine employment in total employment has fallen by 8 and 12 percentage points in developing and developed countries, respectively.4 Such medium-skilled jobs, critical to the growth of the middle class and held disproportionately by the bottom 40 percent of the welfare distribution, give way either to high-skilled jobs that only a small share of workers qualify for, or to low-skilled jobs that face increasing competition and most likely declining wages.
 So the race is on between skills and technology, and the outcome will determine whether the dividends from digital technologies are realized and the benefi ts widely shared. It is important to bridge the digital divides both in access and in capabilities. This second divide separates the digitally savvy, who can make productive use of digital technologies and have skills that complement them—and the digitally poor, who remain unconnected and unskilled. Providing current and future workers with the cognitive, technical, and socioemotional skills that are augmented by technology—and not replaced by it—is a priority. Given the fast pace of technological change—with more intense job creation, destruction, and reallocation to be expected—labor regulations, taxation, and social protection systems will have to support labor mobility and adapt to the changing nature of work. This is the analog foundation for workers to succeed in a digital world.
 Connected people The world is more connected than ever. On average, 8 in 10 people in the developing world own a mobile phone (map 2.1). Digital technologies, often low-end phones, connect the more than 60 percent of the world’s people who did not have a landline phone as late as 2000. More people have access to a mobile phone than to secondary schooling, clean water, or sanitation.5 Internet adoption lags behind mobile phone access, but has tripled since 2005.
 In developing countries today, 28 percent of the population reports access to the internet at home, and in advanced economies, 80 percent.6, 7 Mobile phones are driving this interconnectedness, especially among the poor. All regions are converging in mobile phone use, but South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa lag far behind in internet access Figure 2.1 A framework for the internet and economic opportunities Source: WDR 2016 team.

Internet 104 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 gender (fi gure 2.4). In African countries, the bottom 40 percent is only one-third as likely to have access to the internet as the upper 60 percent;17 18 percent of men report using the internet versus 12 percent of women, and 20 percent of youth versus 8 percent of those more than 45 years old.
 Such demographic gaps persist also in Latin America, and even in high- and middle-income European countries.18 The digital divide refl ects inequalities in access and barriers to productive use. Many areas simply remain unconnected (chapter 4). Even when a region is connected to the internet, access is not easy. In Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda, more than three in four users still access the internet in commercial internet cafes, where high costs and slow connections limit use.19 A survey of 25 developing countries found that although commercial cafes were more expensive than telecenters, they had more skilled staff and more reliable infrastructure and service.
20 But this is not the whole story. Illiteracy and lack of skills are important barriers. In a subsidized internet and mobile telephony program in rural Peru, mobile phone ownership increased, on average, by 12 percentage points, but internet use increased by only 2 percentage points.21 Explaining this gap is the lower internet use among adults than among youth, and the lack of use among the uneducated. Even among the literate, internet use may be limited by a lack of content in local languages.22 Creating jobs, boosting labor productivity, and benefi ting consumers The overall impacts of digital technologies on employment and earnings are positive, if highly heterogeneous (table 2.
1). As discussed throughout this chapter, rigorous evidence remains limited, but it suggests that most gains accrue disproportionally to the better educated, with technology complementing the skills and assets of users. But there are exceptions. In Peru, between 2007 and 2009, new internet users had higher income growth than those who remained nonusers, with larger gains in rural areas.23 And in the United States the diffusion of broadband increased employment rates more in rural areas than in urban.24 What explains the aggregate differences?
 The fi rst factor is the type of technology. Mobile phones can be particularly benefi cial to people in more disadvantaged groups—who often lack skills for using the internet, or work in agriculture, where mobile phones alone can pay off. Thus the benefi ts from mobile phones tend to be widespread. In Peru, for for work, education, and health is more limited but increasing. Across the European Union, around 60 percent of internet users search for health information, and 13 percent make appointments with health practitioners online.12 In Brazil, 60 percent of internet users use it for educational purposes, and in Mexico, 35 percent.
13 One in four individuals who use the internet in African countries reports doing so to get health and education information.14 Uses vary across population groups. In Brazil and Mexico, women, rural, and poorer populations are less likely to use the internet for fi nancial transactions or dealing with public authorities, but in both countries these same groups are equally or more likely to use it for educational purposes than men, urban, and richer populations.15 Across countries, children and youth are most likely to use the internet for education. The digital divide persists Despite the rapid spread of digital technologies, more than 800 million people lack mobile access worldwide (63 percent of them in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution), and 4.3 billion lack internet access (49 percent in the bottom 40).
16 For every person connected to the internet in developing countries, almost three are not, and in some countries, 20 are not. Big gaps remain by income, age, location, and Figure 2.4 The digital divide within countries remains wide, especially in internet use Internet use in Africa, by demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, 2011–12 Source: WDR 2016 team, based on Research ICT Africa surveys (various years).

 Digital technologies can also connect people to work and markets and facilitate the accumulation of productive assets. This increases effi ciency in the labor market and the overall economy by allowing workers and fi rms to better leverage existing assets. • Benefi ting consumers. When digital technologies automate processes and generate economies of scale, they can lower prices and create new goods and services, thus increasing consumer surplus. While quantifying these benefi ts is diffi cult, the evidence discussed in the rest of the chapter suggests that they accrue most to those already better off (table 2.2).
 Employment in the ICT sector and in ICT occupations is limited and mostly for high-skilled workers. In industries that use ICT, the potential is greater, especially for those who have skills that better complement the technology. But the largest payoff from digital technologies is increased labor productivity. Better and cheaper information that helps connect people to inputs, outputs, and work is particularly promising for the poor, since it addresses a key barrier to raising incomes for people previously disconnected from markets. The lower communication costs associated with mobile phones, the most common technology for the poor today, can increase the effi ciency of agriculture and labor markets, raising household incomes and reducing poverty. As governments and the private sector get better at tailoring digital services to the poor, those gains should increase.
 both mobile and internet use, the better educated benefi ted most, but while very few of the less educated adopted the internet, they benefi ted greatly from their new mobile phones.25 Second is the labor market context. Technology makes a difference when it helps overcome obstacles to employment or higher productivity. In Peru, mobile phones were more benefi cial in agriculture, where lack of access to relevant and timely information kept people from accessing better opportunities, whereas internet access made more of a difference outside agriculture, where employers seemed to demand ICT skills and internet use. If the constraints are elsewhere, technology will not make a difference. In rural South Africa, the rollout of mobile phone networks increased employment among women, but only for those who did not have signifi cant family responsibilities.
26 These aggregate effects of digital technologies on opportunities are mediated through three mechanisms (see fi gure 2.1): • Creating jobs. Digital technologies promote inclusion by boosting employment and earnings in the ICT sector or in ICT occupations across the economy. But most important, they support jobs and earnings in sectors that use ICT when fi rms and the self-employed adopt new technologies and grow, as well as through ICT-enabled outsourcing and entrepreneurship. • Increasing worker productivity. By taking on some tasks previously performed by workers, digital technologies augment workers’ skills, increasing Table 2.

There was no effect on the probability of fi nding employment. Klonner and Nolen (2010) South Africa (rural) Mobile phones Mobile phone coverage increased (wage) employment by 15 percentage points, mostly due to increased employment among women, especially those without signifi cant child care responsibilities. Among men, it induced a shift from agricultural employment to other sectors. Kolko (2012) United States Internet Broadband expansion was associated with local population and employment growth, but average wages and overall employment rates were unaffected. Localities with broadband became more attractive, and the supply of workers responded to job opportunities.
 Marandino and Wunnava (2014) Uruguay Laptops and internet In two years, the One Laptop per Child program had no impact on average households’ labor earnings but led to a 33-percent increase in hourly labor income among households below the median income. Richer households already had access to technology before the program. Ritter and Guerrero (2014) Peru (rural) Internet and mobile phones Access to internet and mobile phones increased wage employment, the production of processed goods, and the prices farmers received for their products.

5 times higher than in urban non-ICT sectors or non-ICT occupations in developing countries.31 The high pay refl ects a workforce that is better educated than average. It likely also refl ects the relative scarcity of ICT workers in some countries, driving up the skill premium. These high-paying jobs create more demand and new jobs outside ICT. In the United States and Turkey, one job in the high-tech industry generates an average of 3 to 5 additional jobs elsewhere in the local economy.32 Many of these additional jobs are low-skilled or medium-skilled in such local services as retail, cleaning, and food preparation.
 Kenya’s mobile money service M-Pesa uses more than 80,000 agents or service locations that make an average profi t of US$70 a month.33 Hormuud Telecom—the largest operator in Somalia—employs 5,000 staff but supports 25,000 agents. Given the high skill requirements of the ICT industry, these employment spillovers are more likely to benefi t the poor. Expanding businesses that use ICT The greatest employment potential of digital technologies lies outside the ICT sector. By improving productivity and boosting fi rms’ growth throughout the economy (chapter 1), digital technologies can increase aggregate employment and earnings. In China, between 1997 and 2007, the increase in internet domains and users per capita had a positive impact on fi rms’ employment in ICT-intensive industries.
34 Creating jobs In ICT sectors and occupations In terms of employment, the ICT sector is small, has high entry barriers, and remains male dominated. The ICT sector employs, on average, 1 percent of the workers in developing countries (fi gure 2.5). ICT occupations—such as network administrator and electrical and electronic engineer—are also 1 percent of employment in developing countries, and 2–5 percent in member-countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).27 Even in the United States, since 2000, new technology-related industries—such as e-commerce and social networking—have accounted for only 0.5 percent of employment.
28 Nor is the sector labor intensive. Instagram, a photo sharing app, had just 13 employees in 2012, when it was bought by Facebook for US$1 billion. Facebook, in turn, had 5,000 employees at the time—compared with 145,000 at Kodak at its peak in photographic fi lm in the 1990s. Yet Facebook’s market value is several times what Kodak’s was back then.29 And most of these jobs are high-skilled. In developing countries, on average, half of all workers in the ICT sector have a tertiary education, compared with one-quarter elsewhere.
 The gender gap is also large, with men 2.7 times more likely than women to work in the sector and 7.6 times more likely to be in ICT occupations.30 While not numerous, ICT jobs pay well and can generate additional jobs through consumption and L L L L MM L M M M L H H H H H H H 107EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES future.38 These jobs are often in business processing, including call centers and bookkeeping. Such jobs include those that can be broken down into routine tasks but also those requiring high skills and judgment if they can be reliably performed and monitored remotely.
 Almost half of business process outsourcing (BPO) is in banking and fi nancial services, and another 20 percent is in high-tech and telecommunications. Some tasks of radiologists and other medical services are increasingly also offshored. India, China, the Philippines, and South Africa are the leading BPO hosts.39 The BPO industry in India employs more than 3.1 million workers, 30 percent of them women.40 In the Philippines, it employs 2.
3 percent of all workers (box 2.1). In rural India, a three-year awareness program on opportunities in the BPO industry increased women’s enrollment in relevant training programs, as well as school enrollment among young girls, by 3–5 percentage points.41 New technologies are now also challenging the status quo of the outsourcing industry. Many of the characteristics that make jobs “offshorable” also make them more vulnerable to automation. So, as technology improves and wages rise, some of the jobs typically offshored, such as call center jobs, could be automated.
 Indeed, a local health care company in In Brazil, between 2009 and 2013, fi rms in industries intensive in the use of ICTs had higher wage increases across skill levels than the rest of the economy (fi gure 2.6), although they did not experience faster employment growth. Wage growth was especially high for workers moving across fi rms.35 Recent studies, despite measurement diffi culties, fi nd a positive causal effect of fi rms’ technology adoption on employment and earnings, especially in fi rms with skilled workers who can make the best use of digital technologies. Thanks to a tax allowance program for ICT investments in small fi rms in the United Kingdom, digital technologies raised labor productivity within fi rms and increased the demand for workers performing high-skilled tasks.36 In Norway, a 10-percentage-point increase in broadband availability in a municipality raised wages of skilled workers by about 0.
2 percent, while lowering wages for low-skilled workers.37 Internet-enabled off shoring and outsourcing, including online work Internet-enabled offshoring is an important source of jobs in developing countries and for women. An estimated one in four jobs in the United States has already been offshored or could be offshored in the Figure 2.5 Employment in the ICT sector and in ICT occupations remains small Source: WDR 2016 team, based on the Skills Towards Employability and Productivity (STEP) household surveys (World Bank, various years); Central Asia World Bank Skills surveys (World Bank, various years); Survey-based Harmonized Indicators Program (SHIP) (World Bank, various years); Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean (SEDLAC) (CEDLAS and World Bank); and South Asia Region MicroDatabase (SARMD) (World Bank, various years).

46 Online work can prove particularly benefi cial for women, youth, older workers, and the disabled, who may prefer the fl exibility of working from home or working fl exible hours. On freelancer.com—an online outsourcing platform with more than 10,000 microworkers globally—57 percent of workers are between 16 and 25 years of age.47 In Elance (part of Upwork), 44 percent of workers are women, compared with just 25 percent in the nonagricultural economy (fi gure 2.7). In a survey on microworkers .
com carried out for this Report, 27 percent of workers see being able to work at home and fl exible hours as the main advantages of working online. These are the reasons most cited, even more often than earning extra income, especially among women (fi gure 2.8).

 People can work for any employer anywhere, with parties buying and selling services that can be delivered online. Upwork (formerly Elance–oDesk), the largest online outsourcing service, had 2.8 million job postings worldwide in 2014.43 Online jobs range from the very simple that can be completed in a few minutes—such as signups, forum participation, review writing, and website testing—to the more complex, such as software development, translation services, data entry, and administrative support. The online work market, though still a tiny fraction of overall employment, is worth around US$1 billion annually, up from US$700 million in 2009.44 Impact-outsourcing brings online work to vulnerable communities.
 Still in its infancy—employing around 150,000 workers, or 3 percent of the total BPO industry—it is taking hold in India, Kenya, and South Africa.

Alibaba in China, the world’s largest e-commerce platform by sales volume, supports an estimated 10 million jobs, or 1.3 percent of China’s workforce. Online shop owners using Alibaba in China, on average, employ 2.6 additional workers.
 Four in ten shop owners are women, 19 percent were previously unemployed, 7 percent were farmers, and about 1 percent are persons with disabilities. Alibaba is estimated to support an additional 2 million jobs, most in logistics.48 In Morocco, home-based female weavers sell rugs and other textiles over the internet to keep a larger share of their profi ts.49 Etsy, a peer-to-peer e-commerce platform focused on handmade or vintage items, and similar services, can take this to scale. Etsy has 20 million active buyers and 1.5 million active sellers worldwide, with 31 percent of its sales outside the United States.
50 As online commerce, the on-demand or sharing economy—in which people rent assets or command services directly from one another, coordinated through the internet—is growing rapidly, if still small overall and just emerging in developing countries. More than two-thirds of internet users globally are willing to be part of the sharing economy.51 In Uganda, food delivery services online are used by the diaspora to send in-kind remittances to family members. In Kenya, Sendy connects customers with motorcycle couriers for delivery services, which can then be paid with mobile money.

1 Business process outsourcing and jobs in the Philippines: Opportunities and challenges from technological change The information technology (IT) and business process outsourcing (BPO) industry in the Philippines has been a driver of economic growth and job creation in the last decade. It has grown at an average of 24 percent annually, and its share of the global off shore services market went from 5 percent in 2006 to 11 percent in 2013. Direct employment reached 1 million full-time employees in August 2014 from virtually zero in 1999, accounting for around 2.3 percent of the country’s total employment. The industry has a robust voice sector (primarily call centers), accounting for 64 percent of the industry’s revenue. Health care information management employment grew by 47 percent from 2012 to 2013.
 IT outsourcing revenues also grew by 52 percent from 2012 to 2013, while knowledge process outsourcing grew by 18 percent. Earnings and skill requirements vary across these sectors. Industry-specifi c jobs tend to be higher skilled than those that cut across industries (such as human resources business processing), as they require more technical knowledge. In 2012, average annual compensation per employee in the industry was around US$8,849, with the highest average compensation in software development (US$17,383). It was US$8,301 for contact centers and US$7,687 for other BPOs. High-skilled, high-paid occupations—as are most research and development–related jobs in knowledge process outsourcing (such as market research and medical transcription), IT outsourcing (such as software and application maintenance), engineering services (such as engineering design and digital mapping), and creative processes (such as art production and game testing and support)—are intensive in nonroutine cognitive and interpersonal tasks.
 Middle-skilled occupations are intensive in routine cognitive tasks, mostly in nonvoice BPO (such as back-offi ce fi nance and accounting or human resources), but can also include many of the jobs in voice business processing (such as customer service and technical support). Progress in digital technologies and international competition increases the need to move to more high-valueadded, nonroutine jobs. In the Philippine IT-BPO industry, 85 percent of the revenues are generated in jobs intensive in routine cognitive tasks, with workers increasingly susceptible to automation. Low wages will delay this process but are unlikely to halt it. As the global market for complex services grows, providing a larger volume of high-value nonvoice services can promote the industry’s sustainability. This transition requires a concerted eff ort among business, academia, and government to make systemic improvements across the IT-BPO ecosystem, such as enhancing telecommunications infrastructure and directing industry-government partnerships toward more nonvoice training and skills development.

They can reduce contracting costs and the time it takes to match employers and employees. Through Upwork, the largest of these platforms, the time it takes to hire a worker can fall from 43 to 3 days.a On the workers’ side, around 45 percent of freelancers on Upwork earn most or all of their income through online work.
 In oDesk—with Elance, one of the two original platforms behind Upwork—hourly earnings are on average 14 times higher than minimum wages in developing countries (fi gure B2.2.1, panel a). This is partly explained by the fact that online workers are better educated than those in the general economy. High-paying work is concentrated in information and communication technology (ICT) areas such as software development, which can pay twice as much as online work in writing and translation, and even three to four times more than that in customer support and sales.b Thanks to the internet and innovations in monitoring and feedback systems, online labor markets are becoming global.
 Online job platforms increase the pool of talent for fi rms, especially for smaller enterprises, and provide an opportunity to monetize skills that may not be in suffi cient demand in the local economy. An individual in Mongolia with expertise in web development and a programming language such as Python can make close to US$40 an hour online. On Upwork, 90 percent of the work is off shored. On the largest platforms, most employers are located in developed countries and most workers in developing countries. Australia, Canada, and the United States are the largest employers. On oDesk, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, and the United States have the largest number of contractors in relation to their populations (fi gure B2.
2.1, panel b). Yet the internet only partly overcomes labor market segmentation, and some barriers to inclusion and to further expansion of online labor markets remain. On Upwork, a given worker is 1.3 times more likely to fi nd work in her domestic market, and domestic contractors get paid more than international contractors for the same type of work.c Online outsourcing is most likely to function like a truly global market when tasks are less complex and involve fewer local institutions and less communications.
 Additional constraints that could be addressed by policy are related to language (mainly English), regulations, payment platforms, and trust.d a. , accessed March 26, 2015. b. Agrawal and others 2013. c.

Expanding the principles of the on-demand economy to the urban self-employed in developing countries could be particularly promising. These workers often lack references and documented work histories when seeking jobs and depend on word of mouth to expand their customer base. In this setting, the sharing economy’s decentralized, crowd-based rating systems can help control quality, build trust, and maintain a live “resume.” Plumbers and handymen can expand their client pool by building strong reputations online.
 These new jobs in the sharing economy have advantages for workers, but they also come with tradeoffs. The main advantages for workers are supplemental income and fl exibility. In the United States, 61 percent of sharing economy participants say earning extra money is their main motive.53 Workers appear to sort into a working arrangement that suits their preferences and family circumstances. Two-thirds of Uber drivers in the United States vary their hours Figure 2.8 Flexibility in hours worked and the ability to work from home are the main advantages of online work, but relatively poor pay and lack of career prospects are concerns Microworkers.

Returns to education have fallen only in Latin America. Everywhere, average private returns remain high—at 10 percent per year—despite large increases in the supply of educated workers in the last few decades. Returns to tertiary education are the highest, at 14.
6 percent; tertiary education is the only educational level for which returns have not fallen since the early to mid-1990s.55 That refl ects strong demand for advanced skills, especially among women (fi gure 2.9). Returns to education are higher and have been rising more rapidly in ICT-intensive occupations compared to the rest of the economy (fi gure 2.10). Connecting people to work and markets Digital technologies help overcome barriers to productive employment and connect workers and entrepreneurs to (global) markets, clients, and suppliers.
 This is particularly important for the disadvantaged or often-excluded groups such as the poor, women, minorities, the disabled, and people in remote regions (box 2.4). For all of them, high search costs, long distances, and a lack of information are key obstacles. worked by more than 25 percent from week to week. This fl exibility is likely to be valuable for women and youth and for people between jobs. But these benefi ts come at a possible cost since these jobs do not provide much work security or protection to workers.
54 Increasing worker productivity Increasing returns to human capital Digital technologies can complement human capital, allowing workers to focus their efforts on activities with higher value and making them more productive. Farmers can use precision agriculture or track livestock. Teachers can use massive open online courses (known as MOOCs) or online teaching tools like Khan Academy, better using study time inside and outside the classroom to increase practice and discussion, and dedicating more time to children who fall behind. Researchers can dedicate more time to thinking and innovating rather than spending time searching for information or duplicating other people’s work. Managers can work more easily with teams across borders. In fact, there has never been a better time to be a well-educated worker.
 Chapter 1 shows how digital technologies increase labor productivity within fi rms. Box 2.3 Expanding opportunities through online music Usman Riaz began piano lessons at age six in his native Pakistan. He later wanted to explore new instruments and musical styles, but he could not fi nd the right teachers in his own country. Instead, watching videos online, he taught himself percussive guitar, a style that uses the strings and the instrument’s body for percussive eff ects. Riaz also used the internet to showcase his music.
 His song “Fire Fly” went viral in 2011. A year later, he shared a stage in Edinburgh with Preston Reed, one of his online idols. The internet has exposed people around the world to new cultural infl uences—not just global pop culture hits, but also in the tiniest niches. Whether it has also helped many more artists in developing countries gain access to arts and entertainment markets is diffi cult to say, given the lack of suitable data. Globally in 2014, revenues for recorded music were about US$15 billion and falling, compared with US$25 billion for live performances, whose revenues are rising.a Pirating, YouTube, and music streaming have led to an overall decline of music sales in developed and developing markets.
 Most of the revenue goes to the biggest stars: the top 1 percent of artists earn about 80 percent of recorded music revenue.b At the same time, fi le sharing has raised the demand for concerts,c which has always been the biggest source of income for most musicians.d As the cost of recording and distributing music has gone down, online music sharing could become an eff ective advertising vehicle for musicians in developing countries—although limited internet access and slow speeds make this harder. Even if only a small minority break into national or even international entertainment markets, the welfare benefi ts of being able to learn from others and share talents on the internet can still be signifi cant.

 Similar services exist for local markets, such as aldaba.com in the Dominican Republic and kariyer.net in Turkey. Social and professional networking sites also provide information on potential workers, often on behavioral aspects and social ties not refl ected in traditional resumes. LinkedIn, the largest online professional network, has more than 310 million registered members, 67 percent outside the United States. In Brazil, LinkedIn’s penetration rate is already at 8 percent.
57 In most countries, online job search remains concentrated among youth and the best educated and grows with income: online job search among the employed and unemployed is above 20 percent in urban Armenia and Georgia, but below 5 percent in urban Bolivia, Ghana, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam.58 Online job boards, social media, and matching platforms can improve labor market effi ciency, especially in developing countries and in the informal sector, where information failures are large. Online job matching is cheaper and faster than traditional methods.59 In Peru, integrating mobile phones into traditional public intermediation services increased employment among job seekers by 8 percentage points in the short term.60 In Germany, online job seekers are better matched to jobs, are happier with work, and have higher chances of promotion and job security.61 But other studies fi nd no effect of online tools on the speed of matching or on the length of unemployment.
62 The large number of applications per vacancy and stale resumes and job posts makes it costly for employers to select workers and for workers to fi nd available jobs. As online tools become more advanced, however, matching is becoming more effective. In the United States, the average unemployment duration for internet searchers was 25 percent shorter than for noninternet searchers, reversing earlier results.63 Online tools can address many labor market frictions, but much of this potential remains unrealized. A fi rst challenge is reaching lower-skilled workers. Some services, such as Souktel, are solving this via mobile phone (box 2.

In the European Union, telework doubled to reach 9 percent in the fi rst half of the 2000s, and around 23 percent of enterprises in the EU-15 employed teleworkers in 2006, up from 16 percent in 2003 and 18 percent in 2004. In the United States, in 2009, one-quarter of workers used telework regularly.66 The rise in telework has been particularly rapid among female workers in Europe.67 Budget airlines, such as JetBlue, manage their customer support centers largely with home workers, mostly women.
68 Telework can also make it easier for youth to combine school and work and for older workers to work longer. These new work arrangements can address skill gaps and increase productivity. Facilitated by the internet, home-based work in a 16,000-employee travel agency in China improved worker productivity by 13 percent.69 And where there is a shortage of doctors, telemedicine and examinations of digital X-rays can be very helpful. In Uruguay, through teleconferencing, providing supporting services. There is high demand for supporting services in online work, especially from women.
 In Souktel, 40 percent of women and 30 percent of men report a need for career coaching.64 A third challenge is receiving up-to-date vacancy information, since many postings are stale. Employers also report a fairly high rate of no-shows for interviews. A two-side rating system—quality control on vacancies’ expiration dates, and short message service (SMS) reminders to candidates selected for interviews—can address some of these shortcomings. Making work more fl exible Digital technologies can bring women and new entrants into the labor market, especially in white- collar occupations, by allowing people to work on different schedules or from different locations. In Georgia, Romania, and Ukraine, more than 10 percent of employment is part-time, up from less than 5 percent a decade earlier.

For people with disabilities, it makes things possible. —Mary Pat Radabaugh, formerly with the IBM National Support Center for Persons with Disabilities Prakash lost his sight at birth. Today he is a successful entrepreneur and programmer running his own information technology (IT) company in a mid-size city in India. Screen- reading and voice-recognition software enable him to use a computer and write computing programs, and the internet helps him fi nd and connect with clients.
 Technology augments his business and his life. Around the world, more than 1 billion people have disabilities, 80 percent of them in developing countries. They face infrastructure and environmental barriers to social, fi nancial, and civic participation, which digital technologies can help overcome. Technology enables multiple means of communication—voice, text, and gestures—to access information and engage with others. Magnifi cation, voice recognition, and text-to-speech benefi t persons with visual, cognitive, learning, and mobility disabilities. Short message service (SMS), instant messaging, telephone relay, and video captions reduce communication barriers for those with hearing and speech disabilities.
 Hands-free navigation and gesture-controlled interfaces help those with severe mobility impairments. But if not designed to be accessible, digital technologies can widen the disparities between persons with and without disabilities. Free and low-cost mobile apps off er increased functionality for persons across the disability spectrum. Assistive software is available for feature phones. Accessibility enhancements for web browsers promote greater internet use by persons with disabilities. Governments should focus on building the capacity of public bureaucracies, teachers, vocational trainers, employers, and information and communication technology (ICT) professionals to design accessible content and support ICTs for persons with disabilities; developing the legal, policy, and regulatory foundation for accessible ICT; supporting, through public-private partnerships, the development of accessible ICT, such as local language text-to-speech and voice-recognition software; and mainstreaming accessibility in all public services off ered through ICT, such as disaster warnings and communications, public services, and fi nancial services.

There are more than 15,000 registered job seekers. The service registers job seekers through short message service (SMS) and online, provides information on vacancies, advises on resume preparation, and does active job matching by screening potential candidates for vacancies.
 Notifi cations on relevant job vacancies are sent through voice calls and SMS once or twice a week. Job seekers in the platform are young (80 percent are age 15–25) and well educated (all have completed secondary and half have completed tertiary education). Among Souktel’s core users, 4 of 10 do not have jobs. Women are 30 percent of all online job seekers in Souktel, a share that is 15 percentage points higher than at the national level (fi gure B2.5.1, panel a).
 There are 200 registered employers, 80 percent of which are medium in size. The main benefi t that job seekers see in Souktel’s service is saving time and money. Most workers look for jobs that match their skills and experiences, but more than onethird look for jobs in new occupations or industries. Souktel connects users to better-paying jobs. The share of workers earning less than the overall average monthly earnings (around US$500 per month) drops both for men and women after fi nding a job through Souktel (fi gure B2.5.

76 In the United States, internet users have a larger extended network activated when looking for a job.77 Digital technologies can also increase agency and modify aspirations, affecting social norms that can be barriers to participation, employment, and productivity, especially for women,78 much the same as with soap operas in Brazil and cable television in India.79 In Africa, the internet appears to broaden social interactions with groups with different political views or religious beliefs.80 The internet and an individual’s long-term productive capacity. They can help build human capital throughout the life cycle, managing risks and increasing access to fi nancial capital and remittances (sector focus 2; spotlight 2; box 2.6).
 Since the poor are often most constrained by these factors, they stand to benefi t the most. Mobile money accounts can drive fi nancial inclusion. In Sub-Saharan Africa, 12 percent of adults have mobile money accounts, compared with just 2 percent worldwide, and 45 percent of them have only a mobile money account.73 In Kenya, access to mobile money has helped in managing risk. Statistically comparable households that were not connected to M-Pesa, the mobile money service, experienced on average a 6–10 percent reduction in consumption in response to similar shocks.74 And biometric tools that reduce the costs Box 2.
6 The impact of digital technologies on remittances Online and mobile money transfer systems off er new cost-eff ective means of sending money. In Kenya, among the 53 percent of adults who reported having sent remittances in the past year, 90 percent did so using a mobile phone.a Today, the average cost of sending money is 8 percent of the remitted value. Mobile technology can lower this cost by removing the need for the physical presence of staff and customers, while ensuring timely and secure transactions. Digital technologies make domestic and international remittances cheaper. In Kenya, in 2008 shortly after M-Pesa entered the market, the cost of sending US$100 domestically was US$12 by MoneyGram, US$20 by bank wire, US$6 by postal money order, and US$3 by bus, compared to US$2.
50 by M-Pesa. In Cameroon, costs have declined by 20 percent since mobile money entered the market. Prices have also fallen for international remittances. In the United Kingdom-Bangladesh corridor, the cost of sending US$200 through Western Union fell from 12 percent in 2008 to 7 percent in 2014 after the entry of digital competition. Between the United States and Mexico, Xoom charges 4.4 percent for online money transfers, down from Western Union’s 6.
2 percent. But the costs are still high for the poor, since they make many small transactions, which tend to be more expensive— more than 5 percent for amounts less than US$5. Across the board, traditional remittance service providers are building their own mobile and online capabilities, but international digital remittance services have yet to take off in a substantial way. As of early 2012, only 20 percent of 130 mobile banking operators worldwide off ered such services. The value of international remittances through mobile phones accounted for less than 2 percent of global remittances in 2013. Policy action is called for on several fronts.
 First is fostering innovative cross-border mobile money transfer technologies. That requires harmonizing banking and telecommunications regulations to enable banks to participate in mobile money transfers, mobile companies to off er mobile money services without exclusivity agreements, and telecommunications fi rms to off er micro-deposit and savings accounts. It also requires simplifying regulations aimed at stopping money laundering and the fi nancing of terrorism for small-value transfers. And it requires ensuring that mobile distribution networks are open to multiple international remittance service providers. Second is increasing competition by eliminating telecom monopolies and exclusivity contracts. The experience in the United States-Mexico corridor shows how eliminating an exclusivity agreement between Western Union and Elektra can reduce prices.
 The interoperability of money transfer operators in remittance markets, as in Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania, can reduce prices further.

We can learn about any subject.
 It also helped me earn some income online by using freelancer sites. It helps me to fi nd health and beauty tips, to know current events and news. Through internet, I am able to stay connected with my friends and relatives. —Young woman, microworker in Amazon Mechanical Turk, September 201495 Beyond earning opportunities, the internet offers many benefi ts to individuals as consumers, such as consumer convenience, expanded choice, better quality leisure time, and access to more knowledge. These benefi ts are consumer surplus, often not captured in GDP statistics (chapter 1). Digital technologies have thus enhanced welfare.
 Across 12 countries in Africa, 62 percent of people believe that their family is better off because of mobile phones, whereas only 21 percent disagree (17 percent are not sure). And 76 percent of people say mobile phones help save on travel time and costs. A majority (62 percent) also believe that mobile phones make them more secure (fi gure 2.11). The annual consumer surplus from Google search has been estimated at mobile phones also increase ties between migrants and those remaining in the home country.81 Improving access to information For the poor—who rely on mobile phones and often did not have access to a fi xed line—the biggest gains from digital technologies are likely to come from lower information and search costs.
 When making agriculture and labor market decisions, individuals often rely on informal sources, such as family and neighbors, or are left with no information: six in ten farmers in Boyaca, Colombia, do not know the prices in the capital city.82 Information technologies can inform workers about prices, inputs, or new technologies more quickly and cheaply, reducing friction and uncertainty, eliminating costly journeys, and reducing the risks of accidents and crime.83 In rural Niger, mobile phones reduced search costs by 50 percent.84 In turn, these benefi ts can reduce poverty. In rural Peru, mobile phones increased household real consumption by 11 percent between 2004 and 2009 and reduced poverty by 8 percentage points.85 Mobile phones have also been found to reduce poverty in East Africa.
86 Using technology for getting information on prices, weather, soil quality, and new technologies, and for coordinating with traders is becoming more common in agriculture (sector focus 1). Among fi shermen in the Indian state of Kerala, price information on mobile phones increased their profi ts 8 percent.87 In Honduras, farmers who got market price information via SMS reported an increase of 12.5 percent in prices received.88 In Argentina, the TRAZ.AR program to track animals increased profi ts per kilo of meat by 8 percent.
89 In Pakistan, thanks to mobile phones, farmers shifted to more perishable but higher return cash crops, reducing postharvest losses from the most perishable crops by 21–35 percent.90 Digital technologies make the largest difference when learning about information in distant markets or among disadvantaged farmers who face more information constraints.91 An adult education program on using simple mobile phones in Niger increased internal labor migration and communication with migrants on labor market conditions in faraway regions.92 Gains and uses are more common when the information transmitted is simple (as with prices or weather) rather than nuanced or diffi cult to convey (as in agricultural extension).93 Similarly, when information provided through technology is not relevant to local needs or when there are other constraints to economic activity—such as physical infrastructure or market structure—there are fewer or no gains, as in cases in Ethiopia and Nigeria.94 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 I use it to access free educational content I use it to mobilize the community or for political events It helps me to find work It lets me get more done during the day It makes me feel more secure or safe My family is better off because I have a mobile phone Saves on travel time and cost I use it to check on safety of loved ones Women Men Percent Figure 2.

Data at /WDR2016-Fig2_11. 118 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 especially the case when the skill needs of new jobs are different from those of the old jobs. Beyond skill-upgrading, the challenge is to ensure that labor regulations facilitate and do not impede these transitions, and that social protection systems support workers when they are between jobs or not working regularly. A second risk relates to the changing nature of work and the quality of internet-enabled jobs, such as microwork or jobs in the on-demand economy. These new forms of work provide workers and fi rms with fl exibility and improve effi ciency in the use of resources, but also come with a possible erosion of workers’ bargaining power and a lack of benefi ts, such as unemployment and health insurance or severance pay.
 In most cases, workers are considered independent contractors rather than employees. In a world where a job in a fi rm has been a pathway out of poverty because fi rms help share risks and provide capital, training, and technology,104 higher nonwage employment and this “new informality” may not be desirable. In developing countries, most work does not have these benefi ts, but especially in advanced countries, a balance is needed between effi ciency and protection to avoid a “race to the bottom” in terms of workers’ protections. Already, some microwork platforms and companies in the sharing economy provide insurance to workers and collect taxes, but these new developments in the labor market raise questions about traditional approaches for protecting workers. As discussed in chapter 5, this will probably require reforms not only in the new industries but also in the traditional ones to ensure that all workers—irrespective of their type of work contract—have basic protections. Perhaps the biggest risk from technological change, however, is that of widening income inequality.
 Although technologies are becoming widespread, the economic payoffs are not. The poor almost exclusively use only mobile phones not connected to the internet. And even if they had access to the internet, they lack the skills to use it productively, with many still unable to read in the fi rst place. Positive impacts from using digital technologies—as with other technologies in the past century—are most likely to be captured by those already better off. In the United States, the adoption of advanced internet applications by fi rms led to substantial wage growth in the 6 percent of counties that were the wealthiest, the most educated, and had an IT-intensive industry, with no effect elsewhere. Technology explains more than half the difference in wage growth between already welloff counties and others.
105 US$500 per user, or US$150 billion for the 300 million users.96 In Estonia, digital signatures saved 20 minutes per signature.97 In Europe and the United States, consumers are willing to pay an average of US$50 a month for services that they now get for free on the internet.98 Large consumer surpluses have also been estimated for Brazil, China, and Mexico.99 The rapid adoption of digital technologies, despite the costs, speaks for itself. In developing countries, 5 percent of consumption goes into ICT, ranging from 2.
8 percent in the poorest households to 6.6 percent in the richest. In Africa, in addition to covering the cost of the hardware, the median phone owner spends more than 6 percent of his or her monthly income on mobile phones for calls and SMSs. The share is over 13 percent when accounting for people who own a mobile phone but do not work (mostly youth and spouses).100 Benefi ts to consumers, while signifi cant, also come with risks. There are concerns about loss of privacy (chapter 4); information overload, as more and more information—some relevant and some not—is at our fi ngertips; and “overconnectivity,” since people are constantly online and reachable.
 The line between leisure and work is blurring. Digital technologies make leisure time more enjoyable and less costly, but also make workers more productive and allow them to work away from the offi ce. More than one-third of internet users in the United States report working longer hours because of technology, despite also feeling more productive.101 Labor market polarization can lead to greater inequality For workers, digital technologies generate new opportunities for employment and earnings, but also risks. One major risk is related to the speed of labor market changes and the destruction of jobs. Nonstandard forms of work and shorter job tenures are likely to become more common, especially among youth.
 Internet access has been associated with more job-to-job fl ows, within the same fi rm and across employers.102 Large-scale automation can also accelerate job destruction, especially in developed countries. In addition to factory automation, there is automation of logistics and processing, digitization (data entry, publishing/printing), and self-service (document creation and management versus clerical support, or retail self-checkout).103 These changes are good for aggregate productivity, as discussed in chapter 1, but can create challenges for individuals in the transition to new jobs. This is 119EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES The risk of rising inequality is evident in the declining shares of (routine) labor in national income, and the “polarization” of the labor market—that is, the declining employment in middle-skilled occupations relative to those in low- and high-skilled ones, and the heightened competition for low-skilled jobs. The concern is that the ladder to the middle class is pulled away as middle-skilled jobs disappear or are fundamentally transformed by digital technologies.
 Declining shares of labor in national income Various factors, including technology, are shifting the distribution of income within countries away from routine labor and toward nonroutine labor and capital.106 In the past few decades, and especially after 2000, the share of national income going to workers has fallen steadily in developed and many developing countries, driven by a falling share of income going to workers performing mostly routine tasks that follow exact, well-defi ned procedures that can be easily automated (fi gures 2.12 and 2.13). In the United States, at the technological frontier, the share of income going to routine labor has fallen from 38 to 23 percent since the late 1960s, with a simultaneous rise in the nonroutine labor share from 24 to 34 percent. In Honduras and Romania, in the 2000s, the income share of nonroutine labor increased from 28 to 32 and from 21 to 25 percent, respectively, with declines in the share of routine labor.
107 Where the labor share has fallen most, inequality has risen most (fi gure 2.14). A growing literature also links recent technological change to widening inequality.108 Figure 2.12 United States: Labor share in national income is falling, driven by routine labor Share of routine and nonroutine labor in total income Source: Eden and Gaggl 2014, for the WDR 2016.

 Ukraine Brazil Change in labor shares 120 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 Yet declining labor shares in income and job polarization are only symptoms. At their heart is the fact that digital technologies complement and augment some skills (and thus some workers) while replacing others. Since not everybody has the skills that go well with digital technologies, many can end up falling behind. Education and skills thus determine whether the promise of digital dividends is achieved, or whether technological advances translate into more inequality in a race between skills and technology.113 Understanding this dynamic is critical: inequality will increase if more workers do not acquire the modern skills most in demand. But if education and training systems increase the supply of workers who meet the changes in skill demands, more workers would benefi t from technological change and inequality could decrease.
 The race between skills and technology With rising computing power, combined with the connectivity and informational value of the internet, digital technologies are taking on more tasks. They are particularly good at performing tasks that follow explicit, codifi able procedures—that is, routine tasks. Some of these tasks are cognitive, such as processing payrolls, keeping books, or doing arithmetic. Others are manual or physical, requiring simple motions and muscle power, such as driving a train or assembling goods. These tasks can be easily automated. Nonroutine tasks, by contrast, are less amenable to automation.
 Doing research, maintaining personal relationships, and designing new products have proven hard to automate; so have manual tasks that involve signifi cant dexterity, such as cleaning and providing security services or personal care. Technology is even moving into areas once thought to be the exclusive domain of humans, such as driving or writing news articles. So, the impact of digital technologies on jobs depends on the type of tasks and how technology either complements or substitutes workers in those tasks. A job comprises many tasks, each characterized by the skills most used to perform it (cognitive, socioemotional, or manual) and by how amenable it is to automation or codifi cation (table 2.3). In some cases, technology augments labor by complementing workers.
 Both the researcher and the hairdresser do tasks that are nonroutine and not easily programmed into a computer, but technology makes the researcher (who uses more advanced skills at work) much more productive, while barely affecting the hairdresser. This means that technology is skill-biased.

Middle- skilled, middle-paying occupations (clerks, plant and machine operators) are being squeezed (fi gure 2.15). In high-income countries, on average, the share of routine labor in employment has fallen by about 0.59 percentage points a year since 1995, or almost 12 percentage points for the period.
 In the United States, local labor markets susceptible to automation due to specialization in routine task-intensive occupations have no net decline in employment, but they experience polarization in manufacturing and services.110 There are signs that employment is also polarizing in a number of low- and middle-income countries. The average decline in the share of routine employment has been 0.39 percentage points a year, or 7.8 percentage points for the period. China is an exception, since the mechanization of agriculture increased the share of routine employment.
111 Labor markets in lowincome countries such as Ethiopia, with a large share of employment in manual occupations, are also not polarizing; neither is employment in Mongolia or Latin American countries where other factors—such as a commodity-driven boom benefi ting low-skilled workers—could play a larger role in shaping labor markets.112 121EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES cases, technology is labor-saving. The fundamental questions then become: To what extent are different occupations and countries’ labor markets affected by skill-biased and labor-saving digital technologies? In other cases, workers are in jobs that are routine, whether mostly manual or mostly cognitive, and are susceptible to automation and to seeing their jobs profoundly transformed or vanishing. In these Figure 2.15 The labor market is becoming polarized in both developed and developing countries Annual average change in employment share, circa 1995–circa 2012 Sources: WDR 2016 team, based on ILO Laborsta (various years); I2D2 (World Bank, various years); National Bureau of Statistics of China (various years).

The classifi cation follows Autor 2014. High-skilled occupations include legislators, senior offi cials and managers, professionals, and technicians and associate professionals. Middle-skilled occupations comprise clerks, craft and related trades workers, plant and machine operators and assemblers. Low-skilled occupations refer to service and sales workers and elementary occupations.
 For the United States, comparable data could be accessed only for a short period (2003–08); consistent with Autor (2014), the observed polarization is limited in this period, with most of it having taken place in earlier years.

Not only is overall employment moving toward occupations intensive in these more advanced skills, but even within a given job, skill demands are similarly shifting.
 Because of this, two sets of skills are increasingly important in today’s labor markets: ICT skills and And what are the typical characteristics of workers in occupations that, in the absence of effective policies, stand to gain or lose from technological change? Skill-biased technological change and the new digital divide As Brynjolfsson and McAfee write in The Second Machine Age, “There’s never been a better time to be a worker with special skills or the right education, because these people can use technology to create and capture value. But there’s never been a worse time Table 2.4 Recent evidence on skill-biased technological change Authors Country Findings Akerman, Gaarder, and Mogstad (2015) Norway Broadband adoption in fi rms complements skilled workers performing nonroutine tasks and substitutes for workers performing routine tasks. Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2008) United States Patterns of wage inequality are best explained by a modifi ed version of the skill-biased technical change hypothesis, which emphasizes information technology in complementing abstract (high-education) tasks and substituting for routine (middle-education) tasks. Autor, Katz, and Krueger (1998) United States Digital technologies widen wage differentials.
 Skill upgrading within industries accounts for most of the growth in the relative demand for college workers, especially in more computerintensive industries. Berman, Somanathan, and Tan (2005) India Trade openness and reform promote technology adoption and diffusion and increase the nonproduction worker shares of employment and total wages in manufacturing, even within industries. Gaggl and Wright (2014) United Kingdom A tax allowance on ICT investments among small fi rms leads, in the short run, to an increase in demand for nonroutine cognitive-intensive work, some substitution of routine cognitive work, and no effect on manual work. Marouani and Nilsson (2014) Malaysia Without skill-biased technological change, skilled wage earners should expect lower wages and higher unemployment, and unskilled labor should expect higher wages and lower unemployment. Srour, Taymaz, and Vivarelli (2013) Turkey Domestic and imported technologies increase the demand for skilled labor fi ve to six times more than the corresponding demand for unskilled labor.

Note: Workers in occupations in quadrant 4 can benefi t greatly because the majority of their tasks are diffi cult to automate, and the core of their work is in tasks in which digital technologies make them more productive. Occupations in quadrants 1 and 2 are composed of many tasks that can be easily automated. Productivity in occupations in quadrant 3 is by and large not directly aff ected by digital technologies.
 Ea se o f a ut om at io n (te ch no lo gy is la bo rsa vi ng ) 1 2 4 3 123EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES what will enable them to participate productively in life, as in Albania, Indonesia, Jordan, Malaysia, or Peru.117 About three-quarters of third-graders in Mali and Uganda cannot read.118 Beyond basic literacy, ICT skills are defi cient. In Africa, 7 in 10 people who do not use the internet say they just don’t know how to use it, and almost 4 in 10 say they do not know what the internet is.119 In high-income Poland and the Slovak Republic, one-fi fth of adults cannot use a computer.120 The use of ICT skills at work is unequal, but their importance is growing.
 On average, one-third of urban workers (and 20 percent of the bottom 40 in urban areas) in developing countries use a computer at work, for example (fi gure 2.18). This number is likely to raise quickly, with ICT use increasing as countries become richer and as work becomes more complex (fi gures 2.16 and 2.19). Employers are looking for ICT skills, but cannot fi nd them.
 In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 43 percent of fi rms say ICT skills are very important for workers, but more than 20 percent say that workers lack them.121 Although the same workers lacking ICT skills often also lack other skills or face other barriers to employment, digital literacy limits their employment opportunities (fi gure 2.20). The use of digital technologies at work is associated with higher-order cognitive and socioemotional skills (box 2.7). Since 2000, the ICT intensity of employment has increased by almost 10 percent in low- and middleincome countries, almost twice as fast, on average, as in high-income economies (fi gure 2.
16). The share of employment in occupations intensive in nonroutine cognitive and socioemotional skills has also increased in low- and middle-income countries, from 19 to 23 percent. However, the decline in occupations intensive in routine skills was even larger, from 50 to 44 percent (fi gure 2.17).115 This is the driving force behind the polarization of labor markets. The new economy offers, therefore, a premium for ICT skills, strong foundational cognitive and socioemotional skills, and for more advanced nonroutine 21st-century skills such as critical thinking, complex problem-solving, creativity, and expert communication.
 In fact, workers using these “new economy” skills and technology are better remunerated—by 25–40 percent—than their peers with the same level of education but performing traditional tasks and jobs.116 Poor digital literacy limits the productive use of digital technologies It is hard to use the internet when, even among youth, more than half have a level of functional literacy below Box 2.7 Skills wanted: Key concepts Beyond foundational cognitive skills, such as basic literacy and math, a well-educated worker in a modern economy needs to develop the following skills: Nonroutine, higher-order cognitive skills. These refer to the ability to understand complex ideas, deal with complex information processing, adapt eff ectively to the work environment, learn from experience, engage in various forms of reasoning, to overcome obstacles by critical thought.a More specifi cally, these include skills such as unstructured problem solving, and critical thinking, learning, and reasoning. Technical skills, including information and communication technology (ICT) skills.
 Technical skills are those abilities needed to carry out one’s job, such as the ability to repair a water leakage for a plumber, the knowledge to operate a machine for a worker at a factory, or the knowledge to work with a software for a person at a bank.b They also include ICT skills. ICT skills refer to the eff ective application of ICT systems and devices, and range from ICT specialists who have the ability to develop, operate, and maintain ICT systems, to basic ICT users, who are competent users of the mainstream tools needed in their working life (e-mail, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Word).c Nonroutine interpersonal, socioemotional skills. Socioemotional skills (also called soft or noncognitive skills) encompass a broad range of malleable skills, behaviors, attitudes, and personality traits that enable individuals to navigate interpersonal and social situations eff ectively.d These include grit or the perseverance to fi nish a job or achieve a long-term goal, working in teams, punctuality, organization, commitment, creativity, and honesty.

 125EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES the weight of China in manufacturing supply chains, the decline in routine labor in the rest of the world could simply be the result of a shift of routine labor to China’s manufacturing sector. Between 2000 and 2010, the share of employment in routine occupations enterprise mobile developers. Others have long existed but have been transformed. Consider, for example, the job description of an accountant in the 1970s and today. Specialized softwares have automated many of the accountant’s original tasks, shifting her job toward more advisory services and critical thinking. Employers now demand more “new economy” skills: that is, highorder cognitive and socio emotional skills, as evidenced in countries as diverse as Brazil, Malaysia, and FYR Macedonia (fi gure 2.
21). At the aggregate level and within fi rms, new technologies substitute for workers performing routine tasks, while making skilled workers who execute nonroutine abstract tasks more productive.124 Across 28 studies, more than half of the top fi ve skills demanded by employers are socioemotional, another 30 percent are higher-order cognitive, and 16 percent are technical.125 High-order cognitive skills include reasoning, problem solving, and critical thinking, while socioemotional skills refer to behavior, personality traits, and attitudes, such as grit, teamwork, selfdiscipline, dependability, and leadership. These are things that are still hard for technology to replicate. These new economy skills pay off.
 Workers with strong cognitive and socioemotional skills in Armenia, Georgia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Vietnam are more likely to be employed and have better-quality jobs.126 In Vietnam, within a given industry, performing nonroutine analytical tasks carries a 23-percent earnings premium, and interactive (that is, interpersonal) tasks a 13-percent premium, whether combined with routine or nonroutine tasks (fi gure 2.22). In Armenia and Georgia, the premium for problem solving and learning new things is close to 20 percent.127 More generally, in 12 of 16 mostly developing countries, wages in nonroutine occupations increased signifi cantly more than wages in routine occupations between 2005 and 2011.128 In addition to technological change, other factors help explain these global labor market trends.
 Trade, urbanization, structural transformation, and globalization fundamentally shape labor markets and in a number of cases are likely to be even more important than technology. In some Latin American countries, for example, commodity-driven economic booms have boosted low-wage earnings and show no polarization at the aggregate level. Moreover, distinguishing among factors is more diffi cult because they are related to one another.129 Yet technological change seems to be an important part of the explanation. First, occupations most intensive in the use of digital technologies are also most intensive in nonroutine cognitive and interpersonal skills (fi gure 2.23).
 Second, globalization and trade do not fully explain the observed polarization.130 Given Figure 2.18 In developing countries, one-third of urban workers use digital technology at work Urban workers who use a computer at work, conditional on working Source: WDR 2016 team, based on STEP household surveys (World Bank, various years).

In the Indonesian Treasury, electronic budget planning and execution is linked to job redefi nitions and reassignments for around 5,000 workers (of 8,000) who previously processed payments, disbursements, and cash management.137 In Pakistan, the automation of systems in the central bank made 3,000 of 12,000 employees redundant (mostly low-skilled staff). The savings boosted the salaries of remaining employees.138 Two-thirds of all jobs could be susceptible to automation in developing countries in coming decades, from a pure technological standpoint (fi gure 2.
24). Estimates for the United States and Europe range between 50 and 60 percent of jobs.139 Given expected advances in artifi cial intelligence, falling ICT prices, and increased coverage of the internet, the potential for automation is clear. Rapid automation of a large number of jobs would be problematic: It may take time for new jobs to be created, and even if they are, retraining takes time and may be diffi cult. Yet, even if technologically feasible, large-scale net job destruction due to automation should not be a concern for most developing countries in the short term. Even in the United States, on average, there were no net employment declines in local labor markets most susceptible to automation (that is, those specialized in routine, task-intensive occupations).
140 New jobs and new tasks in existing occupations are created. Machines and digital technology are not perfect or even good substitutes for many tasks (at least not yet), especially those requiring adaptability, common sense, and creativity.141 The expansion of automated teller machines (ATMs) in banks went hand-in-hand with an expansion of bank transactions, branches, and employment. Cashiers continue to do some of the things that ATMs do, but they also do other things, such as client support, where human interaction remains important.142 Full automation of jobs takes time, even in the developed world. In the United Kingdom, an exogenous increase in ICT investment between 2000 and 2004 led to a short-term increase in the demand for nonroutine skills, but only to the limited substitution of routine workers during that period.
143 Why? Because it takes time to make the necessary organizational changes (chapter 1), and because labor reorganizations tend to happen in periods of recession rather than in booms.144 Not all disruptive technologies are adopted quickly, implemented fully, or yield immediate benefi ts.145 Barriers to technology adoption, lower wages, and a higher prevalence of jobs based on manual dexterity in developing countries mean that automation is likely to be slower and less widespread there (see fi gure 2.24). But as wages rise, and in countries with in China rose from 19 to 27 percent (see fi gure 2.
15, panel b). Yet manufacturing employment in China is also polarizing, for the increase in routine labor is explained by the mechanization of agriculture. Moreover, across most countries with relevant data, employment is polarizing even within services, suggesting an additional effect in skill demand over and above what can be explained by trade or the structural transformation of developing economies.131 This evidence is also consistent with the evidence for OECD countries linking changes in skills requirements to technological changes, even within occupations.132 Labor-saving technologies: Automation and job displacement There is concern, especially in advanced countries, that technology is killing jobs and depressing wages.133 Manufacturers are using machines that substitute for workers in warehouses or auto plants.
 More than 200,000 industrial robots come into use each year, and that number is rising.134 Increasingly, automation is taking place in services.135 In call centers, technology can answer routine customer service requests. In retail, technology and “big data” suggest what to buy. Software is handling accounting, translations, and paralegal services. Travel agents have all but disappeared, with three-quarters of all travel in the United States now booked online.

For Malaysia (panels c and d), data for 2008 were unavailable. 128 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 fostering entrepreneurship and improving productivity and the allocation of resources, have led in due time to more jobs elsewhere. Will this time be different?
 Large factories and electrifi cation did lead, as now, to a polarization of employment by hollowing out the middle of the skill distribution. The share of employment of blue-collar workers in manufacturing fell from 39 percent in 1850 to 23 percent in 1910, as new capital goods allowed factory owners to unbundle and simplify tasks that could now be performed by unskilled workers. Electrifi cation increased the relative demand for workers intensive in clerical and managerial skills compared with manual and dexterity skills among white-collar workers. Among blue-collar workers, it increased the demand for manual workers relative to the demand for workers performing tasks intensive in dexterity needed to operate machines before electrifi cation.147 Despite these similarities, the biggest difference from past waves of technological progress is that the polarization of the labor market today is affecting both blue-collar and white-collar workers.148 It is probably easier for white-collar workers to transition to other white-collar jobs, but in the aggregate, there may be fewer well-paying jobs for a large and diverse pool of potentially dislocated workers.
 Even if all those jobs do not fully disappear—unlikely in a short period—they will be signifi cantly transformed. And here is where a second lesson from history is relevant. Individuals and governments adapted to technological change, but this process took time and required deep institutional changes in education, Technology, Automation, and Economic Progress, there were also concerns about automation in this wave of technological change. Unemployment fears have gone unrealized because new technologies, by Figure 2.22 New economy skills, beyond levels of education, pay off Urban Vietnam: Average return to diff erent task combinations, controlling for education and demographics, 2012 Source: Bodewig and others 2014.

 Box 2.8 Concerns about technological unemployment are not new We are being affl icted with a new disease of which some readers may not yet have heard the name, but of which they will hear a great deal in the years to come—namely, technological unemployment. This means unemployment due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can fi nd new uses for labour. —John Maynard Keynes “Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,” 1931 The situation will have been made the more serious by the advances of automation.

 Even so, mankind will suff er badly from the disease of boredom . . .

With electrifi cation, displaced workers typically moved to lower-skilled jobs at lower wages, such as truck drivers, but large increases in new middle-skill employment outweighed the decline in blue-collar employment.
154 While the steam engine in the 18th century led to the disappearance of coachmen for horse-drawn carriages155 and to the substitution of workers in mining, in due time it also was at the center of steam-powered boats, locomotives, and automobiles. Mechanics, road building and maintenance, and dealerships have created many jobs of diverse skill profi les ever since. Yet as a result of this process of job creation and destruction, technological change disrupts labor markets and can hurt individuals whose skills are substituted by technology, because they often do not have the skills required in many of the new jobs. Even for those who stay within the same occupations, jobs will be transformed, requiring modern skills. The speed of these changes appears to be accelerating, intensifying creative destruction and the pace of labor market changes. Since digital technologies have different applicability to different kinds of work, the extent of disruption across countries will refl ect differences in economic and occupational structures.
 Numerical clerks or secretaries, often users of digital technologies, also perform many tasks that can be easily automated. Managers or software developers, by contrast, while intensively using digital technologies, also complement them well, so they are not easily substituted by machines. And for occupations that use little technology, some are hard to automate, such as hairdressers, while others could be automated, such as assemblers (fi gure 2.25). More advanced economies can expect larger disruptions in the near future since they use more technology at work and are experiencing faster changes in skill requirements (fi gure 2.26).
156 And while they have smaller shares of employment in routine occupations susceptible to automation, their higher wages make it easier for automation to be economically viable. Low- and middle-income countries can also expect substantial disruptions, albeit with a time lag, given their rapid technological adoption and large number of workers in routine occupations. Their low skill base suggests important challenges ahead, however. In poorer countries, where wages are lower and technological adoption is slower (chapter 1), the disruptions are likely to arrive more slowly, giving more time for policies and institutions to adapt. All this has implications for The future of jobs Be an expensive complement (stats knowhow) to something that’s getting cheaper (data). —Hal Varian, Chief Economist, Google, 2014 Technological progress makes the jobs challenge more complex.
 Digital and mechanical technologies, and deindustrialization, mean that the manufacturing sector is likely to generate fewer jobs than in the past, especially for unskilled workers.150 ICT manufacturing can be expected to create jobs, although mostly high-skilled and likely concentrated in specifi c countries, as now. Since manufacturing jobs have been an important source of better-paying jobs as workers move out of agriculture, this is an important development. The service sector is also increasingly being automated. Of particular concern are jobs that have so far actually grown thanks to digital technologies, such as low- and middle-skilled call center jobs. Employment in the ICT service industry, even more than its manufacturing counterpart, is expected to grow, but also among higher-skilled workers in leading countries.
 Future employment growth is likely to come from jobs that cannot be fully or partially automated, largely outside the ICT industry. New jobs are also likely to emerge in the digital economy—in the analysis of data such as data scientists, in the development and maintenance of apps and other software, and in support services. New opportunities will also arise in ICT-enabled services, such as the on-demand economy. But the signifi cance for employment generation, especially in most developing countries, is likely to be small. The potential for employment creation lies in the rest of the economy, as digital technologies allow businesses to expand. Among the low-skilled, some services that must be delivered face-to-face or require awareness and situational adaptability (housekeepers, hairdressers) are likely to grow.
 Among the high-skilled, occupations will rely on modern skills involving creativity and social interactions. Some observers call this the polarization in “the high-tech, high-touch” economy.151 Although impossible to predict in advance, jobs are likely to arise in new industries and occupations. New industries arising from digital technologies since 2000 account for only 0.5 percent of employment in the United States,152 and there is evidence of (young) skilled workers having to take on less-skilled jobs.153 But historically, economies have been able to create enough jobs through technological change.
 The initial labor market polarization caused by factories in the 131EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES changes in labor demand have in turn implications for earnings. But employment polarization does not necessarily mean wage polarization. Three interrelated factors mediate the impact of digital technologies on earnings: • Complementarity with technology. Workers in jobs that use and complement technology are likely to see both an increase in employment and an increase in earnings because of higher productivity. This is the case for workers who use nonroutine cognitive skills and ICT skills. Workers in routine occupations, however, will see less demand for their skills, bringing down both their employment and their wages.
 • Product demand. If workers produce goods or services that consumers keep buying as they get richer or as the price declines, increases in productivity can translate into increases in wages. This is often the case for workers with nonroutine skills producing, say, knowledge, management expertise, or medical services. If not, increases in productivity can lead to lower employment and earnings in that sector because fewer workers can satisfy demand, as for many agricultural goods. whether countries need not just to develop modern skills among children and youth, but also to come up with a strategy for the retraining and lifelong learning of the current stock of (older) workers. The challenge is to start reforms today to maximize the digital dividends and to prepare for any disruptions.
 Even if expected labor market changes are similar in Malaysia and South Africa, Poland and Turkey, or Finland and Italy, skill systems vary widely and not all are prepared to equip workers with skills that complement technology. This process needs to start very early in life, and education and training systems are notoriously diffi cult to change. So, any reform takes many years to have effects, which is why there is a race between skills and technology. Some skill systems are well-positioned, but for many others, skills—and hence, people—are losing the race. Making the internet work for everyone To design policy responses to technological change, it is important to understand who the changes are likely to affect the most, and how the process plays out both in terms of employment and earnings. As discussed, employment is likely to polarize, with routine occupations losing ground to nonroutine occupations.

 The former group is more likely to have more advanced skills—especially cognitive and ICT skills—regardless of their occupation or work status.158 In addition, these groups are disproportionally likely to be in, or to move into, occupations that pay well and are likely to grow in the future—those intensive in nonroutine skills (fi gure 2.27).159 Recent evidence from the United States shows that there has been a marked decline in the rate at which workers transition into routine employment (particularly among the young) but that women and those with higher education levels have found it easier to adjust to these changes by moving into the high-paying, nonroutine cognitive jobs.160 A big challenge for policy makers, especially in rapidly aging societies, is managing skill obsolescence. Recall that the surge in the demand for new economy skills has been concentrated among young workers (see fi gure 2.
21). Digital technologies accelerate the depreciation of skills and work experience, affecting especially older workers (box 2.9). But obsolescence is not destiny or the same for all types of skills. Most literature argues that younger workers have a comparative advantage in tasks where problem solving, learning, and speed are important (“fl uid” abilities), and older workers have an advantage when experience and verbal abilities matter more (“crystallized” abilities).161 But evidence from Germany shows that workers in their 50s experienced a more rapid growth in tasks intense in fl uid cognitive skills than those in their 30s.

A policy agenda Digital technologies improve overall welfare and can reduce poverty, but without complementary policies, many benefi ts can go unrealized and inequality can increase. To capitalize on the benefi ts—and to do • Labor supply. The higher the skill requirements for a job, the more diffi cult it is for new workers to enter that market. So, higher demand for workers would translate into higher wages.
 If, however, it is easy to retrain for a new job or skill requirements are low, there can be downward pressure on wages because of increased competition. Workers in nonroutine cognitive occupations are likely to see their higher productivity rewarded as higher earnings because entry barriers are high. But low-skilled workers in nonroutine manual occupations are likely to see their earnings fall over time as middle-skilled workers in routine occupations are displaced and start competing for the available jobs in low-paying occupations (table 2.5).157 Therefore, the main winners from technological change will have and use new economy skills and gain employment in nonroutine cognitive occupations.

 The quality-adjusted years of education are constructed by adjusting average years of education for each country with the World Economic Forum’s quality-of-education indicator. For example, if a country has, on average, 10 years of education and scores 3.5 on the indicator (which ranges from 0 to 7), its quality-adjusted years of education are 5.

 In Mexico, as in other Latin American countries, wage inequality has declined since 2000. A declining skill premium has been one of the drivers of this trend because the wages of the low-skilled rose and those of the high-skilled fell. The average hourly wage for college-educated workers fell 2 percent a year between 2001 and 2014. Why have high-skilled wages declined in Mexico, when in most countries, especially outside of Latin America, returns to tertiary education continue to rise (despite increasing educational attainment everywhere)? It could simply be that the supply of educated workers has outpaced demand for them. But there are three alternative explanations for the decline in relative wages of skilled workers: low-quality tertiary educated graduates, a skills mismatch among young workers, or skills obsolescence among older workers.
 New research fi nds that the fall in the skills premium is driven at least partly by skills obsolescence among older workers. First, the earnings of the oldest cohort, above age 50, declined fastest (40 percent during the period). But for the youngest cohort—aged between 23 and 30—earnings increased. Second, earnings start to decline at a younger age over time. If age is a proxy for work experience, this means that, among older workers, the return to education and the return to experience are falling. This could be evidence of an accelerated skills obsolescence.

Because social norms and time and mobility constraints are often more severe for women than for men, women could benefi t greatly from technology.a Digital technologies can reduce gender gaps in labor force participation by making work arrangements more fl exible, connecting women to work, and generating new opportunities in online work, e-commerce, and the sharing economy. In Elance, a platform for online work now part of Upwork, 44 percent of workers are women, compared to an average of 25 percent in the nonagricultural economy globally.
 Business process outsourcing in India employs more than 3.1 million workers, 30 percent of them women. Four in ten online shop owners on Alibaba are women. Moreover, technology can help improve women’s access and accumulation of productive assets. The digitization of land registries, for example, can be particularly benefi cial for women.b These improved opportunities, in turn, can increase investments in young girls’ human capital.
c Technology-driven shifts in skills demand can reduce wage gaps, especially among the better educated. Women are well positioned to gain from a shift in employment toward nonroutine occupations, and away from physical work.d In Germany and the United States, the use of digital technologies at work explains a signifi cant share of the increase in female labor force participation and employment in the past few decades.e Similar changes have taken place in Brazil, Mexico, and Thailand, and also explain a large part of the reduction in gender wage gaps.f New technologies level the playing fi eld, particularly among the better educated, who take on jobs that use their comparative advantage in nonphysical work.g Recent evidence from the United States shows that it is the better educated and women who are able to get the high-paying jobs intensive in nonroutine skills as middle-skilled jobs shrink.
h Digital technologies also impact women’s voice and agency. Increased access to information can aff ect gender norms and aff ect aspirations, often faster than expected.i Social media is an additional outlet for women to participate in public discussions and voice their opinions (spotlight 3). “My Dress, My Choice” in Kenya, a social media movement against female violence that mobilized thousands of Kenyans, including through street protests, eventually led to changes in relevant laws.j Some of the new innovations of the digital economy, such as digital payments, mobile money, and taxi sharing rides, can also increase women’s agency and control over economic resources, and their safety. For example, in Niger, greater privacy and control of mobile transfers, compared to manual cash transfers, shifted intrahousehold decision making in favor of women, the recipients of the transfer.
k But in many countries, gender gaps in technology use, and in working in the ICT sector, remain vast. Over 1.7 billion women in low- and middle-income countries do not own mobile phones. Women in those countries are 14 percent less likely to own a mobile phone than men, on average. Women in South Asia are 38 percent less likely to own a phone than men.l Barriers to access can be particularly salient in the case of the internet, especially in poor and remote localities where access is predominantly outside the home, and where social norms for socializing or safety concerns can become a barrier.
m In Africa, for example, women are 50 percent less likely to use the internet than men.n In addition to ownership and access, lack of control over the use of the technology can be an additional barrier for women. In the Arab Republic of Egypt and in India, for example, 12 percent of women stated that they did not access the internet more often because they did not think it was appropriate, and more than 8 percent did not access it more often because family or friends would disapprove.o In the labor market, women are also much less likely to work in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector or in ICT occupations, which are well paid. These latter gaps partly refl ect women’s low participation in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education, itself a product of early gender-based biases in formal and informal education (chapter 5). Even with gender parity in ownership, access, and control over digital technologies, gains are not automatic.
 They need to be complemented with analog changes that address the underlying barriers to women’s employment, voice, and agency. In rural South Africa, for example, mobile phones increased employment mostly among women, as long as they did not have large child care responsibilities.p In addition, technologies can have gender-diff erentiated eff ects, as shown throughout this chapter. This suggests that interventions around digital technologies would become more eff ective if they were more gender-informed, including by having women participate early on in the design of interventions and of the technologies themselves. Moreover, by circumventing, rather than eliminating, some of the barriers to employability faced by women, (Box continues next page) 135EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES taking a wide perspective, it is also used to include gains to consumers. 3.

Current and future workers need to develop the lifelong cognitive, technical, and socioemotional skills required of a well-educated worker in the 21st century. Workers also need to be capable of processing the everincreasing information available on the internet. Building these skills requires actions affecting all relevant environments for learning: families, schools, universities, training systems, and fi rms.
 Given the speed of technological changes, these skills will also require constant updating throughout the life cycle as workers prepare for careers that last more than one job. Digital technologies themselves can help (sector focus 2 and chapter 5). Complementary reforms are also needed in tax policy, social protection, and labor market institutions to facilitate the transition of workers from old economy jobs to new economy jobs, and address the distributional consequences of the digital revolution.

 For example, home-based work could help connect women to work in environments where social norms or child care responsibilities are a barrier to women working outside the home. But if working outside the home continues to be seen as unacceptable for women or if there is no availability of aff ordable child care, technology could end up delaying fundamental reforms. Addressing these underlying constraints remains key to the gender and overall economic agenda.

Eden and Gaggl (2015, for the WDR 2016) suggest that while the fall in the routine share of labor is linked to technological change, the shift in the labor share compared with that of capital may be a more complex story. In the United States, housing prices have been identifi ed as a key driver in the rise of capital shares (Bonnet and others 2014). This chapter focuses on the fall of routine labor within the labor share, as this is more clearly linked to technological change. 107.

By contrast, these occupations do fewer routine and manual activities, such as operating machines and doing physical activities. 116.

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 Educational policy makers and planners face a persistent challenge related to the potential use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in remote, low-income communities around the world: most products, services, usage models, expertise, and research related to ICT use in education come from high-income contexts and environments. One consequence is that “solutions” enabled by technology are imported and “made to fi t” in environments that are often much more challenging. Sometimes this works; sometimes it doesn’t. The One Laptop per Child project in Peru provided hundreds of thousands of pieces of low-cost computing equipment to students in rural schools.
 But early research found no evidence of increased learning in math or language.1 This is one high-profi le example of the diffi culties faced in introducing hardware-centric educational technology projects conceived in highly developed environments into less developed places without suffi cient attention to local contexts. An alternate approach would consider how to innovate using existing technology that is already available in a local environment. In addition to exploring the uses of new technologies, it might also be useful to ask, How can we innovate using what is already available? In many low-resource communities, the best technology is the one that people already have, know how to use, and can afford. In most circumstances, this is the mobile phone.
 The SMS Story project in rural Papua New Guinea is one example of an innovative approach to using a “new” technology in ways that meet local needs and that the original designers of the technologies may not have dreamed of. Few educational environments are more challenging than those found in remote locales in the Pacifi c island nation of Papua New Guinea. These areas are characterized by poverty, low levels of literacy, geographic remoteness, linguistic diversity (over 800 languages are spoken across the island nation), low teacher quality, and a lack of teaching and learning materials. Many rural classrooms have few books— and some none at all. Few students read at grade level, and teachers often do not know what materials they are meant to cover in a given week—or how to teach them effectively. Most of them do, however, have mobile phones.
 The SMS Story project demonstrates that it is possible to orient and motivate teachers in useful ways using technologies already at hand. It sent daily text message stories and teaching tips to teachers as an aid to help improve student reading. The result? Teachers were reminded and motivated to teach reading every single day. While reading comprehension did not noticeably improve, the intervention halved the number of children who could not read anything. While this was hardly a “silver bullet” solution, SMS Story offers one model for using connected technologies in simple ways to help address some long-standing, seemingly intractable challenges facing educators in rural schools in Papua New Guinea.
 While no one would suggest that these results imply that these schools do not need books, such simple interventions can be modestly transformative in ways that are inclusive, effi cient, and scalable.2 The evidence base for investments in educational technologies in middle- and low-income countries is weak—but growing. Until recently, there were few rigorous randomized studies on the impact of investments in educational technologies that could inform related policy decisions; now there are almost two dozen. In addition, a signifi cant body of practical evidence has also been collected based on experiences Education 146 SECTOR FOCUS 2 This sector focus was contributed by Michael Trucano. 147EDUCATION 147 in middle- and low-income countries. Characteristics of many successful technology-enabled educational projects in such places include: • A focus on the “guided use” of technology, and not just providing tools for general use; • Providing relevant curricular materials; • The shared use of devices in school settings; • Attention to pedagogy, teacher support, and development; • Using technologies in ways that are supplemental and practical; and • Using evaluation mechanisms that go beyond outputs.
3 A number of key challenges remain that inhibit the potential positive impact of new technologies on teaching and learning. Foremost among these are a pernicious focus on providing technology alone, and a related belief that educational challenges can be overcome simply by providing more and better devices and connectivity. The so-called Matthew Effect of educational technology holds that those most likely to benefi t from the use of new technologies in educational settings are those who already enjoy many privileges related to wealth, existing levels of education, and prior exposure to technology in other contexts. Policies that neglect to consider this phenomenon may result in projects that exacerbate existing divides within an education system, and indeed within larger society. Education challenges cannot be overcome simply by providing more and better ICT devices and connectivity. There is sometimes talk that technology will replace teachers.
 In reality, experience from around the world demonstrates that, over time, the role of teachers becomes more central—and not peripheral—as a result of the introduction of new technologies.4 That said, while technology will not replace teachers, teachers who use technology will replace those who do not. These teachers, in addition to having a suite of basic technology-related skills, will be asked to take on new, often more sophisticated duties and responsibilities in ways that will challenge the existing capacity of many educational systems to prepare and support teachers over time. Understanding the local education challenge and context before proposing a technology-driven solution is a critical fi rst step. A number of recent articles in the popular press have proclaimed many high-profi le efforts to use new technologies within educational systems, including variations of the One Laptop per Child initiative in countries around the world, as “failed experiments.” The speed of technological change almost always outpaces the ability of educational planners to keep up.
 When it comes to the use of technology in education, educational systems may therefore be fated to exist effectively in a state of permanent experimentation. That said, experiments should, by defi nition, teach something. A sad fact of too many experiments in educational technology use around the world remains that they have implemented technological “solutions” to problems that have not been well understood. If you are pointed in the wrong direction, technology may help you get there more quickly. At a fundamental level, many of these efforts are not really failures of technology, but rather a result of poor planning and an inability to learn from failure and adapt. As such, they are not a result of technology failures, but rather human ones.

1 The average of 3.7 intermediary links between randomly selected people in the global Facebook population contrasts with the 5.7 links between Nebraska residents and Bostonians documented in Milgram’s famous “six degrees of separation” study from 1967.2 From 2011 to early 2015, the network’s user base had doubled, with each user having an average of 338 “friends.” This is more than twice Dunbar’s number, which asserts that 150 is the maximum number of stable relationships that humans can retain.3 These statistics show some of the ways in which social networks are expanding and changing with the advent of social media on the internet.
 Social networks are fundamental to human society. They constitute the fabric of relationships that support trust, reputation, and social cohesion. For instance, a debtor may be less likely to default on a loan if both she and her lender share a dense network of mutual friends. Social networks exert peer pressure on behavior and shape aspirations for work, marriage, and consumption. By defi ning social boundaries, they can be instruments both of social inclusion and exclusion. They also are a conduit of gossip, slander, harassment, bullying, and infectious disease, as well as job opportunities and innovative ideas.
 One of the clearest channels by which networks affect economic development is the diffusion of innovations. Networks provide the medium through which people learn of an innovation. Adoption by a trusted person then initiates a chain reaction of adoptions through the network, accelerating as peer pressure bears on laggards. The impacts can be large. An experimental study on the adoption of weather insurance (an unfamiliar innovation) by Chinese farmers found that, while attending an intensive information session on the product boosted take-up rates by 43 percent, merely having a friend who attended such a session had almost half that effect, and was equivalent in impact to a 15-percent subsidy.4 Impacts were larger when those initially informed were more central to the network.
 Social networks are also important channels for transmission of health behavior, and there is a tendency for people with poor health behavior to clump in networks isolated from those with healthier behaviors.5 Enter the internet, in the form of Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter based in the United States; Sina Weibo and WeChat in China; VK in the Russian Federation; and many other social media platforms designed to encourage the formation of social links. There are many types of social media, but social networking sites and micro blogs are most relevant in the context of social and economic development. A simple typology is based on whether communication is directed at specifi c recipients, and whether ties are explicit (prompted by invitation, acceptance, or reference within a social network) or not (table S3.1). Social scientists distinguish between weak ties and strong ties in social networks.
 Weak ties exist between ENABLING DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT Social media WDR 2016 team, incorporating contributions from Robert Ackland and Kyosuke Tanaka. S P O TL IG H T 3 S P O TL IG H T 3 149SOCIAL MEDIA 149 people who could be considered acquaintances rather than friends. Such ties can be useful to transmit novel information about technologies or other useful and new knowledge, since information comes from people with whom interaction is more sporadic. Strong ties, between people who have more in common (family, friends, or close colleagues), are a source of emotional support but may be less important as a source of novel information, since members of a close group are likely to have the same information. Strong ties within “closed” groups with relatively weak ties to outsiders can be important, as this may increase trust and facilitate coordination, in part because of the high reputational cost of bad or unproductive behavior within the group. Social capital is likely higher in groups linked by strong ties.
 Social networking sites are considered more important for developing strong ties, while microblogs foster weak ties. One observer compared Facebook to a cocktail party where you are surrounded by people you know and like, while Twitter is like someone standing at a street corner with a megaphone shouting “Check this out!” Social media platforms change the dynamics of social networks in at least three ways. First, they encourage expansion of the scope and density of networks, since links are very easy to form, regardless of physical distance. Second, they speed the diffusion of information between links. Third, they increase the visibility of opinions and some behaviors across the network.
 Research on the development impacts of social media is still at an early stage, but there is some evidence on how they affect economic development, how they prompt changes in behavior, how they help in emergency situations, and how they can increase people’s voice.6 Social media and economic development Social media act as a channel for communication and information exchange, thus reducing transaction costs for economically benefi cial, as well as potentially harmful, interactions. Research in Nigeria showed that social media supported microfi nance by facilitating information fl ow to the poor and small business owners. A study of a group of women in Jakarta showed that their use of social media encouraged their entrepreneurial activities and helped them fi nd customers for their products, although the specifi c context of this study—they were middle-class urban residents—may not be transferable to every other place. Social media sites can also be a source for economically useful data, including about consumer preferences and complaints. Social media and behavioral change Commercial ventures take advantage of the features of social media—often for marketing purposes—as they exploit the huge amounts of information about personal preferences, buying habits, and relationships.
 But online behavior can also be channeled in ways that are consistent with development. For instance, individuals can be encouraged to share their progress in meeting exercise or learning goals with their social network, thus using peer pressure and competition to maintain motivation. Experiments show that, in principle, networks can be manipulated to encourage desired outcomes. For instance, an online experiment showed that when participants were networked in tight clusters, a promoted health practice diffused more quickly than in a loosely structured network.7 Social media and emergencies Before, during, and after natural disasters or other urgent crises, social media platforms are useful for disseminating information and as a management tool, such as to channel requests for assistance. The key contribution is that information does not just fl ow one way from offi cials to citizens as through radio or television, but in all directions between offi cials, citizens, and the private sector.

S P O TL IG H T 3 150 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 S P O TL IG H T 3 Social media and community voice Recent events such as the Occupy Wall Street movement or the Arab Spring have raised questions about the role of social media in facilitating social change. Some analysts think social media played a central role, including by spreading democratic ideals across borders. They also make movements less dependent on charismatic leaders or ideologues. Others are more skeptical, arguing that revolutions occurred long before social media, and the apparent inability to form strong leadership through such tools can reduce the chances for lasting change.
 An additional issue is the role of social media in spreading false information or to correct misinformation. The intensity of a crisis changes the quality of infor mation shared on Twitter. And, interestingly, fact-checking conversations on Twitter are more likely to occur between strangers than between friends. Whether social media can encourage collective fact-checking will infl uence its role in social learning in the context of social and economic development. There is still much to learn about the role that social media can play in development. One important lesson is that their impact is country-specifi c and context-specifi c.
 Variations in access to technology and education obviously matter. But there are also large variations in how people use social media and how they share information. People will more likely share information broadly if they think they can infl uence events or policy. There is evidence that people in more authoritarian countries are less likely to forward (re-tweet) information. Finally, general-purpose social media platforms may have less of an impact in poor communities compared with more targeted social media interventions. Examples in other parts of the Report show that purpose-built platforms set up by public institutions or development agencies as part of program delivery may be more effective.
 They could, for instance, deliver extension services to farmers or connect participants with leaders to foster aspirational change. Notes 1. By March 2015, Facebook had 1.4 billion active monthly users worldwide. 2. Milgram 1967.

But the impact of these mechanisms on capability and empowerment depends on the strength of government institutions. Institutions are the formal and informal rules that shape the incentives and behaviors of politicians, government offi cials, and citizens.
 Strong institutions create incentives for politicians to work toward the public good and for bureaucrats to be accountable to those politicians. Digital technologies, aligned with the incentives of politicians, government offi cials, and service providers, can thus be highly effective in improving outcomes. By contrast, politicians in clientelist political institutions are largely accountable to a small set of elites and reject digitally enabled reforms that hurt vested interests; instead, they use these technologies for greater control. And patronage-based bureaucracies resist e-government advances that would reduce discretion and rent-seeking. This misalignment between digital technologies and weak or unaccountable institutions creates the twin risks of increasing elite control and wasting scarce public resources on ineffective e-government projects. Why do these institutional constraints persist?
 Digital technologies, particularly social media, have uncovered egregious abuses of public authority and triggered both virtual and physical citizen protests around scandals. But they haven’t sustained collective action around failures of service delivery. Service delivery problems are more diffi cult to monitor and attribute to specifi c government offi cials, and only rarely become salient in fl ashpoint events that trigger protests—like the excessive use of force by police. And they cannot be improved by one-off actions that change a bad policy or pass a new law. Addressing service delivery failures requires sustained citizen voice through effective offl ine mobilization by civil society Have digital technologies made governments more willing and able to deliver services to their citizens? Not yet.
 Governments have invested heavily in digital technology over the past two decades, and these efforts have made it easier in many countries for businesses to fi le taxes, and for the poor to get an offi cial identity allowing them to receive welfare payments and vote in elections. Digital technologies have also enabled governments to receive regular feedback from service users, improving service quality. But all too often the successes are isolated—limited to a few activities, sectors, or locales. Many investments in e-government fail to have any impact other than wasting scarce fi scal resources. Digital channels for mobilizing citizens to pressure policy makers to become more responsive have had little effect. And the new technologies have enhanced the capacity of unaccountable governments for surveillance and control.
 In sum, digital technologies have helped willing and able governments better serve their citizens, but they have not yet empowered citizens to make unwilling governments more accountable. Effi cient service delivery requires a capable government that can implement policies and spend public resources effectively. It also requires an empowered citizenry able to hold politicians and policy makers to account so that governments serve citizens and not themselves or a narrow set of elites.1 Digital technologies can strengthen government capability and empower citizens through three mechanisms (fi gure 3.1). They overcome information barriers and promote participation by citizens in services and in elections.
 They enable governments to replace some factors used for producing services through the automation of routine activities, particularly discretionary tasks vulnerable to rent-seeking, and to augment other factors through better monitoring, both by citizens through regular feedback on service quality and within government through better management of government workers. And by dramatically lowerCHAPTER 3 Delivering services 153DELIVERING SERVICES than in transactional government-to-citizen and government-to-business services like e-fi ling of taxes and portals that enable citizens to access a variety of services from one website (fi gure 3.2). Policy priorities are also evident in cross-national patterns of the detailed indexes of different e-government systems constructed for this report.3 The level of e-government unsurprisingly increases with per capita income, but the gap between high-income and low-income organizations. But in the absence of willing and able governments to partner with, civil society initiatives often remain small, with limited citizen interest or impact.
 The dependence of digital technology on initial institutional conditions, though, varies by service and activity. For services and activities based on more routine tasks that are easy to monitor, digital technologies can improve outcomes rapidly and signifi cantly—even when institutions are relatively weak. In effect, the technology substitutes for the institutions, as with cash transfers, licensing and registration services, and monitoring elections, all much improved by digital technologies in many low-income countries. But for services and activities that require more discretion from workers and are hard to monitor, the quality of institutions is much more important, and digital technologies have an incremental effect. The technology only complements or augments the initial institutions, as with teaching, health care, and organizational management, where digital technologies have an impact only if institutions are strong. Given the importance of institutions for service delivery, the policy agenda is to use digital technologies to strengthen institutions.
 The variation in interaction of institutions and digital technologies by service and activity, and the considerable heterogeneity of institutions even within countries, can guide policy and open many possibilities for service improvements in even the most challenging contexts—in short, for digital dividends. Connected governments The advent of the internet in the mid-1990s triggered the rapid diffusion of e-government systems to automate core administrative tasks, improve the delivery of public services, and promote transparency and accountability. By 2014, all 193 member-states of the United Nations had national websites: 101 enabled citizens to create personal online accounts, 73 to fi le income taxes online, and 60 to register a business.2 In all, 190 countries had automated government fi nancial management, 179 had automated customs, and 159 had automated tax systems. And 148 countries had digital identifi cation schemes, although only 20 had multipurpose digital identifi cation for such services as voting, fi nance, health care, transportation, and social security. Developing countries have invested more in core government administration systems like fi nancial management, customs, and tax management Figure 3.

But the gap persists in 22 of the countries when the public sector is compared only with large private sector fi rms (those with more than 50 employees).
 Governments are also more intensive users of technology in high-income countries like Germany, Japan, and the United States. Whether this substantial investment in e-government has strengthened state capability and improved outcomes will be explored at length in the next section. One indication of the limited return on these investments is citizen use of e-government services, which has lagged behind supply (fi gure 3.5, panel a). Even in countries where internet access is not a constraint, as in Europe, citizens use e-government mostly to get information (on average 44 percent of individuals in the European countries for which data are available visited a government website at least once in the past year to get information) and not for transcountries is lowest for administrative systems and highest for online services for citizens and businesses, with digital identifi cation systems in the middle (fi gure 3.3).
 Fifteen middle-income countries score in the top quartile of administrative e-government systems, with Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru in the top 10 worldwide, and Nepal, Rwanda, and Uganda scoring highly among low-income countries. India and Pakistan have more advanced digital identifi cation systems than high-income North American countries, pointing to the potential for “leapfrogging” that these technologies offer. Governments are more intensive users of information technology than fi rms. Survey data on the use of digital technologies (computers, mobile phones, and the internet) in nonagricultural jobs from 30 countries show that in all but one country, a higher share of public sector workers are in jobs that require frequent use of the technology in their daily work as compared to private sector workers (fi gure 3.4). This gap is not surprising for developing countries, where most fi rms are small and in the informal sector.

In low-income countries, limited internet access means that mobile phones, not the internet, drive interconnectedness, as chapter 2 discussed. Surveys of the use of digital technologies in 12 African countries reveal that only 5 percent of individuals had used the internet to obtain information from, or interact with, the government, compared to 63 percent of respondents who had used their mobile phones to contact health workers (fi gure 3.6). Internet-based e-services will therefore be biased against the poor in developing countries.
 Mobile e-government portals have become more common, nearly doubling from 25 countries in 2012 to 48 in 2014, but still are not on par with internet services.5 More than three-quarters of countries archive information on their websites for education, health, and fi nance services, but fewer than half send e-mail or Rich Site Summary (RSS) updates, and only a handful send short message service (SMS) updates. Greater state capability and citizen participation What impact have these signifi cant investments in e-government had on strengthening government capability to deliver services and expanding citizen participation? If politicians and policy makers want to improve services, they need a capable government to convert policies and spending into better outcomes. Resources must be collected and spent without leakage. Teachers and health workers must be present in classrooms and clinics, and then must be motivated to work.
 Benefi ciaries of government programs must be properly identifi ed and reached. And governments often must help citizens make better decisions, overcoming bad habits or a lack of information. But as underlined in the 2004 World Development Report, Making Services Work for Poor People, and subsequent research, weaknesses in each of these links in the service delivery chain make services fail in developing countries. Improving government capability or implementation capacity is key for effective service delivery. acting with government (only 29 percent returned a form online in the past year). These patterns are also refl ected in surveys of citizens in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand—countries that rank 8, 10, and 15, respectively, in the provision of online services.
 The majority of respondents use government websites for information and prefer to use traditional channels like voice calls to undertake transactions such as registering their children for day care.4 Both between and within European countries, the use of e-services depends on income.

The most popular and promising innovations in poor countries entail the use of mobile phones to implement a variety of health interventions—so-called “m-health” (mobile health) initiatives. These can focus on either health providers, such as point-of-service data collection, disease surveillance, health-promotion campaigns, and telemedicine; or on citizens, such as SMS reminders to parents to get children vaccinated or to patients to undertake therapy (sector focus 3).
 While hundreds of pilot m-health initiatives are underway, robust evidence in developing country contexts is limited largely to the positive effects of reminding patients to adhere to their antiretroviral therapy schedules.6 Initial results from pilots in Bangladesh, India, South Africa, and Tanzania suggest that regular SMS communication can induce similar behavior changes in expectant mothers by providing information on neonatal health.7 The initial results are also promising from m-health initiatives that assist health providers in recording patient information, monitoring pregnancies, and reporting drug stock-outs.8 communication—citizens’ lack of knowledge about issues that affect their welfare, their inability to communicate with one another and with government, and government’s inability to be informed about citizens. For example, the provision of information to citizens, particularly to poor citizens in remote locations through mobile phones, has helped people make better decisions on a variety of issues. And digital identifi cation, by giving poor citizens a verifi able identity, has enabled them to participate in public and private services previously denied to them.
 Digital technologies have been less effective in solving government failures associated with rent- seeking and in strengthening the incentives of government bureaucrats and service providers to perform due to principal-agent problems associated with information asymmetries. Automating government functions and services has been at best partially successful; these are often complex and costly systems to implement. The failure rate is high, and so is the risk of wasting public funds. Citizen feedback has been effective when citizens have an incentive to provide feedback and the services are fairly easy to monitor, and when governments have the capacity to respond to this feedback. It is not effective when these conditions are absent. Aside from a few isolated examples of reducing absenteeism, digital technologies have not signifi cantly improved service provider management in government bureaucracies.

4 billion people in the world do not have birth certifi cates and other offi cial documents to prove who they are, preventing many from opening bank accounts, registering property, or receiving public transfers.13 Digital identifi cation (ID) programs that use biometrics to register and authenticate individuals, although complex and thus risky to implement, provide a robust solution to this problem. They enable poor countries to leapfrog the decades-long processes that developed countries went through to build their traditional, paper-based civil registration systems (see spotlight 4). These schemes are expanding; 148 of 197 countries have some form of electronic ID. But only 20 countries have a multipurpose ID with digital signature capability that can be used for multiple online and offl ine services; 100 have digital identifi cation systems limited to a few functions (services like voting or public sector payroll that cover only subsets of the general population); and 49 have no digital ID of any kind.14 Evidence on the impact of these schemes, while largely anecdotal, points to signifi cant potential benefi ts of reducing leakages in government welfare This use of digital technologies to overcome geographic, infrastructure, and administrative bottlenecks to information and communication is particularly powerful in emergencies like disease outbreaks, natural disasters, and confl ict (box 3.
1). Digital technologies can also strengthen social norms and promote civic behavior like voluntary tax compliance or energy conservation through “peer comparisons”—making an individual’s actions more observable to others and making others’ actions more observable to the individual.9 For instance, tax evasion is pervasive in developing countries. Some governments collect less than half the taxes due to them.10 Simple behavioral nudges, such as naming and shaming tax delinquents by publishing their names on websites, can be a cost-effective intervention even in low government capacity contexts. Such peer comparisons have improved tax compliance in Norway and the United States, although the developing country evidence is more mixed.
11 Comparisons of a household’s power consumption with that of neighbors, as done by companies like Opower, can also help conserve energy through peer pressure.12 Box 3.1 Digital technology and crisis management Digital technologies have helped monitor and manage human and natural disasters, such as wars, fl oods, earthquakes, and epidemics. The internet can help in coordinating data fl ows and improving the timeliness of decision making, while mobile phones can disseminate vital information. Social media can also help survivors communicate their status and mobilize volunteer resources and donations outside the disaster zone. A few examples of responses to recent crises show the range of possibilities: • The Ebola epidemic in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone created logistical challenges for the organizations that responded, not least how to pay fi eldworkers in remote and rural locations, many of them not local.
 The United Nations Development Programme set up a scheme to use mobile phones to make direct payments to the Ebola response workers in Sierra Leone and Liberia, who numbered some 60,000 at the height of the crisis.a • The earthquakes that struck Nepal in April and May 2015 left at least 8,500 people dead, more than 17,000 injured, and many thousands homeless. Although donations came in from all over the world, ensuring that aid reached the areas most aff ected proved a challenge. One response, coordinated by Kathmandu Living Labs,b was to develop a dynamic map (quakemap.org) as a centralized platform for displaying incident reports and off ers of assistance. The map is built around the OpenStreetMap and uses the Ushahidi platform for incident reports—both based on open-source software and crowdsourced information.
c • Recovering from confl ict and civil war requires longterm nation building, and more than 40 countries have adopted Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRCs) to assist in this process.d The Liberia TRC received some 20,000 statements from Liberians, at home and in the diaspora. Many depositions were audio and video recordings, now stored as a permanent memorial at the TRC website (http://trcofl iberia.org/). Interestingly, the videos have been viewed four times more often than the TRC’s fi nal report, indicating the reach of multimedia for storytelling at the human scale.e a.

Biometric registration, authentication, and payments in India’s National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, the world’s largest workfare program, reduced the time for paying benefi ciaries by 29 percent and leakages by 35 percent (see spotlight 4).
15 But these schemes are complex and have all the risks of wastage associated with large government information technology projects. They also raise concerns about government surveillance, violation of privacy, and data integrity. A more recent initiative around digital informational services is the open data movement, publishing government data in machine-readable format as a platform for the private sector to develop applications to deliver new e-services to citizens. Countries continue to join the Open Government Partnership, but initiatives are in their infancy. According to the Global Open Data Index, only 13 percent of the datasets in 110 countries were “open”—public, machine-readable, and nonproprietary.16 Many governments have no desire to open their data or lack the capability to do so.
 Making meaningful, good-quality data publicly available depends on sound core administrative systems—countries with more advanced core systems have greater budget transparency (fi gure 3.7)—and on effective interministerial Figure 3.7 e-government systems increase the transparency of government budgets, 2014 Sources: WDR 2016 team, based on Open Budget Index 2014 data (International Budget Partnership 2014) and the World Bank (2015b) Global e-Government Systems database.

 Budget transparency is measured by the Open Budget Index. Box 3.2 Empowering women through digitally enabled social programs Safety net programs are becoming more eff ective through digital systems for registering, authenticating, and paying benefi ciaries, promoting inclusion and empowering women. Consider the Absa Sekulula (“It’s easier”) welfare payment card in South Africa, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) in Pakistan, and a pilot mobile money cash transfer experiment in rural Niger. The programs in Pakistan and South Africa rely on a debit card payment mechanism linked to an effi cient management information system and biometric identity database. When benefi ciaries register, their personal data and biometrics are captured and authenticated in minutes, a biometric debit card is issued in a few days, and the system automatically credits cardholder accounts monthly with the appropriate grant amount.
 In Pakistan, 4.5 million BISP benefi ciary households receive their payments through debit cards within 72 hours of disbursement from the government. So, the elderly, parents, and people with disabilities no longer have to wait in line for cash or worry about keeping their payments safe. The Niger pilot led to improved nutrition for children, in part because of the time savings for mothers. Female empowerment is one major benefi t of the BISP and the Niger programs. Women in BISP mostly receive the payments on behalf of their households, increasing their authority to make decisions on how the cash is spent, their mobility, and their engagement with formal institutions.
 The Niger mobile transfer, by reducing the observability of the amount and timing of the cash transfer, increased women’s bargaining power in the household, changing household agricultural activities and expenditures in ways that benefi t women. To quote Amina Bibi, a BISP benefi ciary, “Women are being encouraged and empowered. Because of this program people who did not let their women leave the house earlier are allowing them to do so. Women now have confi dence that they, too, can do something for the betterment of their family.” Sources: WDR 2016 team, based on ; ; Oxford Policy Management 2015; Aker and others 2014.

Digital registration and payment systems have, for example, signifi cantly reduced leakages in transport subsidies for the poor in Colombia (box 3.3). Given the importance of mobilizing and managing resources, almost all countries have tried to automate budget preparation, execution, and accounting and some aspects of tax and customs administration.
 Management information systems are also extensively used in education, health, land management, and social protection services. In the past decade, one-stop shops or service centers that provide citizen and business services—such as registration, licensing, records, bill payments—in a single physical space or web portal have become popular, with initiatives in many countries, including Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, India, Kenya, Moldova, Mozambique, Oman, Peru, and Uganda (box 3.4). Given the methodological diffi culties in measuring government productivity, the impact of e-government must be assessed indirectly through, for instance, changes in fi rms’ perceptions of tax compliance costs, the competitiveness of government procurement, and corruption in taxation and government contracting after the introduction of e-government systems in a country. These indirect measures, from regular surveys of fi rms in select European and Central Asian cooperation and coordination. The necessary supportive ecosystem of a vibrant private sector and civil society to use open data is also often missing.
 The impact after governments open up is also unclear. In the United States and the United Kingdom, the take-up of open data has been limited to a few sectors where there is consumer demand, like real estate, transport, energy, and health care, so the private sector has an incentive to develop applications on the open data platform.17 In Kenya, Moldova, and the Philippines, which have opened hundreds of government datasets, the motive has been more to increase transparency than to spur business opportunities for the private sector. In locales in Kenya and the Philippines, fewer than 15 percent of survey respondents with internet access had heard of the Open Data Initiative.18 Some media and civil society organizations use open data in their advocacy campaigns, but such initiatives generally are few and fragmented.

As in many major cities, housing is often distant from work, especially for low-income residents.
 But using public transit can be costly for the poor, who spend about 25 percent of their income on transportation, compared to 3.5 percent for high-income residents. To help overcome this spatial mismatch, the city built an integrated public transport system (SITP) anchored by the Transmilenio bus rapid transit and collective bus transport. To increase aff ordability for low-income users, the city introduced a subsidy—in 2014; it gave a 50-percent discount for 40 trips per month. Eligibility is tied to a database of benefi ciaries of social programs (SISBEN), and by February 2015 it reached about 26 percent of the target population. The subsidy is transferred on smart fare cards activated and replenished at charging stations.
 This technology makes it easier and more fl exible to provide targeted demand-side subsidies with lower scope for leakage and abuse. Most public transit systems, in contrast, rely on undiff erentiated supply-side subsidies. Linking the transit user and SISBEN databases makes targeting effi cient. Introduction of the smart card system has not been without startup problems. The smart cards do not work on the entire system yet. Someone traveling on diff erent portions (“Phases”) of Transmilenio and on the collective system will need two smart cards and possibly cash as well.
 These parallel systems need to be integrated into the SITP. Technically, this is straightforward (for example, by using turnstiles that receive the smart cards in all the buses and stations). The challenge is to achieve consensus between the bus operators, the collection fi rm in charge of the smart cards, and the city’s government.

E-fi ling also lowered fi rms’ perceptions of paying bribes to tax offi cials only marginally, with medium-size fi rms and fi rms that export less likely to pay bribes to tax offi cials after the introduction of e-fi ling.
 E-fi ling and e-payment help on average to reduce the time it takes businesses to prepare and pay taxes, as measured by the assessments of experts in the Doing Business data for 75 countries that introduced these systems between 2005 and 2014 (fi gure 3.9). Overall the time taken declined by roughly 25 percent in the fi ve years after the system was introduced across the sample, with the time dropping by more countries, show that the impact of e-government is mixed and varies considerably across countries.19 Filing of taxes electronically (e-fi ling) is meant to reduce the administrative burden to businesses and citizens by minimizing interactions with tax offi cials and reducing opportunities for rent-seeking—and by lowering the time it takes businesses to fi le tax returns, make payments, and receive refunds. Indeed, advanced e-fi ling systems in a country (e-fi ling of tax forms and e-payment of taxes) lowered the likelihood of being inspected by tax offi cials by an average 13 percent in select countries in Europe and Central Asia.20 But shifting only to the simpler e-fi ling system that did not enable online payment of taxes had no effect (fi gure 3.
8, panel a). Nor did e-fi ling on average reduce the number of visits by tax offi cials (fi gure 3.8, panel b). These effects vary considerably across countries, Box 3.4 Streamlining services through one-stop service centers With committed political leadership, one-stop computerized service centers can provide citizens with access to a broad range of public services from multiple government departments at one location quickly and easily—expanding options, saving time, speeding delivery, and reducing opportunities for corruption. In rural Karnataka, India, for instance, the more than 800 Nemmadi Centers operating since 2006 provide birth and death certifi cates, caste certifi cates, income certifi cates, ration cards, land records, and pensions, among other services.
 Compared with typical government offi ces, citizens get these services in the centers with 3.4 fewer visits, 58 fewer minutes spent in the visits, 23 days faster processing, and 50 percent less chance of being asked for a bribe.a But this experience of Karnataka is not replicated in many other states of India. One study found that the scope and impact of service centers vary considerably across states. The greater the prevalence of petty corruption, the fewer services off ered, particularly services for which bribes can be extracted. The integrated citizen assistance units (unidades de atendimento integrado, or UAI) in Minas Gerais, Brazil, provide another model.
 With 30 shops and 1,800 employees, the UAI off er access to services from 15 government agencies. In 2012, they handled more than 6.2 million citizen transactions, up sevenfold in three years. Employment and ID services are most popular, with the majority of users from lower-income groups. The UAI were designed to overcome institutional constraints that plagued the state’s prior attempt at service integration. The earlier generation of service centers was staff ed by low-performing civil servants seconded by participating agencies and lacked standard operating procedures.
 Long wait times could be abused by citizens willing to pay to advance in the queue. The new system strengthened oversight from the Secretariat for Planning and Management, which reports directly to the governor. It introduced a fi rst-come, fi rstserved ticketing system. And citizen complaints submitted online must be resolved within two days. Coordinators at the UAI “situation room” monitor the average wait time, the number of citizens served, and the number of attendants on duty at each service center to reallocate resources to manage demand in real time. A private contractor staff s the service centers, thus bypassing restrictions for civil servants and allowing the centers to off er extended hours to citizens.
 Each participating agency provides an on-site supervisor to oversee its programs. Confl icts occasionally arise between UAI coordinators and the agency-employed supervisors. As one government offi cial noted, “When you tell a police offi cer he is no longer the authority in that place, it doesn’t go down very well.”b Sources: Bussell 2012; Majeed 2014. a. Bussell 2012.

The importance of complementary reforms is illustrated by the contrasts of South Africa and Belarus with Tajikistan and Uganda. South Africa’s tax modernization reforms, which began in 2007, coupled the technology initiatives with simplifying the tax code and reforming business processes in the tax authority. For example, revenue targets became a compulsory feature of the performance scorecards of managers.
 Online tax fi ling increased from 40,000 individual tax returns in 2006 to more than 2 million in 2009, with signifi cant reductions in tax compliance costs.22 In Belarus, e-fi ling was similarly part of a broader reform to lower compliance costs for citizens, including simplifying the tax code, setting up taxpayer facilitation services, and reaching out to the business community. But in Tajikistan, e-fi ling was not mandatory, use was low, and most businesses continued to submit paper returns, in part because they did not trust that online submissions would be secure but also because tax inspectors continued to pester fi rms.23 And in Uganda, the electronic forms were more complicated than the manual ones, and taxpayers had to fi le paper returns in addition to the e-fi ling.24 As a result, the time to prepare and pay taxes increased in Uganda, and tax inspections increased in Tajikistan. Effective service delivery requires effi cient and transparent government procurement of goods and services.
 Procurement is particularly vulnerable to collusion and corruption; e-procurement, through greater transparency and less discretion, can result in signifi cant budgetary savings and better-quality infrastructure. In India and Indonesia, e-procurement increased competition by making information on government contracts widely available and by encouraging more fi rms, particularly those outside the region where the project was located, to bid. It also improved the quality of the infrastructure projects through shorter delays and better construction.25 Firms’ perceptions of the impact of e-procurement in Europe and Central Asia, however, are quite mixed. Systems that provide only information on government contracts online or that also enable fi rms to bid for these contracts online had no effect on average on fi rm perceptions of the competitiveness of public procurement (fi gure 3.10, panel a).
 In Belarus, Georgia, and the Slovak Republic, fi rms were more likely to bid for government contracts after an e-procurement system was introduced, but in Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Tajikistan they were less likely. Transactional e-procurement systems increased the competitiveness of procurement only in the higher- income countries in the sample, suggesting that nontechnological factors correlated with a country’s than half in Belarus (from 987 hours to 183 hours), Costa Rica (from 402 hours to 163 hours), and Kenya (from 432 hours to 202 hours).21 To have impact, e-government systems need to be accompanied by regulatory and administrative reforms—changing laws and management practices, simplifying tax procedures, and increasing the ability e-filing e-filing and e-payment –20 –10 0 10 20 30 Percent change Belarus Average (3 countries) Georgia Kazakhstan Tajikistan Bosnia and Herzegovina Montenegro Serbia Average (8 countries) Kosovo Kyrgyz Republic Uzbekistan Armenia a.

Surprisingly, e-procurement was not associated with any reduction on average in fi rm perceptions of corruption in government contracting, but again with considerable variation (fi gure 3.
10, panel b). Nor were there signifi cant average differences across types of fi rms or in the functionality of the systems. This negative fi nding is striking because one of the main reasons for investing in these systems is reducing corruption in contracting and increasing the valuefor-money of government capital spending. E-procurement is also conditional on regulatory, institutional, and human resource factors for impact. In one of India’s leading reformers in e-procurement, Karnataka state, reform was underpinned by an amended procurement law that made it mandatory to use the government e-procurement portal for all state departments and agencies. Run from the chief minister’s offi ce to give it authority, the system was implemented under a public-private partnership to bring in skills from the market.

Governments are more likely to respond if the information provided by citizens on the service failure is specifi c and actionable, if it is clear who in government needs to resolve the complaint, and if the complaint also integrates with document management systems within the agency so that both the complaint and the response can be prioritized and tracked. Government responsiveness can further incentivize citizens to complain, creating a virtuous circle of feedback and responsiveness. For example, users of FixMyStreet—the platform in the United Kingdom that citizens use to report local road problems, which are then routed to the relevant local authorities—are 54 percent more likely to submit a second report if their fi rst complaint was resolved.
28 Household water supply and electricity are examples of private goods that citizens use daily and have an incentive to monitor. The responsibility for delivering these services lies clearly with a particular utility, and it is easy for citizens to know when the service is failing. MajiVoice is a complaint mechanism in the water and sewerage company in Nairobi, and there is a similar one in use in EDE Este, the electricity supply company for the eastern Dominican Republic. Given the limited internet use in the country, consumers initiate complaints mostly in person at the service desk in the utility or through phone calls, generating a ticket number as a tracking tool for both the customer and the utility. The customer receives an SMS message from the utility when the complaint is entered and another when the complaint is resolved. This tracking is possible because each complaint is registered on a dashboard that enables management to categorize the complaint, delegate the issue to a specifi c staff member on duty, and track resolution.
 The dashboard enables the utility regulator to track performance, and customers of EDE Este are also randomly contacted after the complaint is resolved to gauge their satisfaction with the service. Initial results are impressive. Before MajiVoice was initiated, the Nairobi water company received on average 400 complaints a month. Since 2013, when MajiVoice was launched, the utility has been getting about 3,000 complaints a month, resolution rates climbed from 46 percent to 94 percent, and time to resolution dropped by 90 percent (fi gure 3.11).29 Since its implementation in 2011, the feedback channel in EDE Este has also recorded rising resolution rates for The varied impact of e-fi ling, e-procurement, and one-stop centers reveals a broader, sobering trend: Many government digital technology projects are unsuccessful.
 They are either abandoned before completion or underused, wasting substantial public funds (box 3.5). A widely accepted explanation for this poor record is the big gap between the technological capability and the institutional capacity of the government, as measured by processes, objectives, values, staffi ng numbers, skills, and management systems and structures.27 Receiving user feedback One potential catalyst for service improvements is user feedback on service quality. More than a decade ago, the private sector discovered customer relationship management—the use of digital technologies to integrate all aspects of a fi rm’s interaction with a customer to improve personalized communication and provide real-time information so that customers can track the status of their service requests. Governments have only recently discovered this management approach, with most innovation in cities in the developed countries.
 Mobile phone apps like SeeClickFix and FixMyStreet, active in many municipalities in the United States and the United Kingdom, and internet call centers allow users to report service issues and enable governments to report back to citizens on fi x requests through integrated back-end systems. They are now standard in Barcelona, Boston, Chicago, London, New York, Seoul, and Singapore. Developing countries are following suit. Given the considerable ineffi ciencies in public sector delivery systems, the gains from embedding digitally enabled citizen feedback in management are potentially greater than in developed countries. These feedback channels come in many varieties. They can be for a limited set of services tied to particular agencies or for multiple services and issues, usually housed in a center-of-government entity, either local or national.
 They can be complaint portals that invite citizens to report service issues, or government-initiated (“proactive”) feedback mechanisms through which government offi cials contact citizens to inquire about their service experience. Complaint portals and call centers for citizen feedback are spreading rapidly across developing countries, particularly in cities— Buenos Aires, Muscat, Rio de Janeiro, and Ulaanbaatar, to name a few. Proactive feedback mechanisms are more recent and thus limited in number—those in Albania and Pakistan are examples. Two conditions are required for user feedback to have impact: Citizens must have an incentive to 165DELIVERING SERVICES Box 3.5 The high failure rate of e-government projects Despite spending more than $600 billion on IT over the past decade, the federal government has achieved little of the productivity improvements that private industry has realized from IT. Too often, federal IT projects run over budget, run behind schedule, or fail to deliver promised functionality.
 —U.S. Offi ce of Management and Budget 2010 Many public sector digital technology projects fail. Although the evidence is limited, various estimates from surveys of government offi cials, audit reports, and country cases suggest that about 30 percent of these projects are total failures, with the project abandoned before completion. Another 50 to 60 percent are partial failures, with signifi cant budget and time overruns and only a limited number of the project objectives achieved. Fewer than 20 percent are successes.
a In some cases, even if e-government projects are successfully implemented they may actually worsen outcomes as, without proper regulatory safeguards in place, automation makes it easier to perpetrate fraud and corrupt practices, and to erase records or avoid capturing them altogether, thereby eroding transparency mechanisms.b Risky for the private sector, these projects do worse in governments. One survey of U.S. information technology projects found success rates of 59 percent in retail, 27 percent in manufacturing, and 18 percent in government.c Larger projects are more likely to fail than smaller ones, with success rates of only 13 percent on average (fi gure B3.
5.1) and a skewed distribution, with a small proportion of projects accounting for a major chunk of budget and time overruns. One comprehensive review of more than 1,400 public sector information and communication technology (ICT) projects found that a sixth went over budget by 200 percent, posing “systemic” fi scal risks.d World Bank–funded projects have not fared much better: 27 percent of the roughly 530 information technology projects from 1995 to 2015 were self-evaluated by the World Bank as moderately unsatisfactory or worse, in line with all projects (fi gure B3.5.2).
 But far fewer were rated “satisfactory” or above, with 35 percent for ICT projects and 56 percent for all projects. e-government scholars provide numerous explanations for these stark numbers. A widely quoted study blames a large gap between the regulatory, political, management, process, and skill realities in government and the ambitions Figure B3.5.2 Performance of World Bank–funded ICT projects Sources: WDR 2016 team, based on Standish Group 2014 and World Bank (2015a) Digital Governance Projects Database.

In the Nairobi utility, data from monthly management reports are also used as a basis for performance incentives for staff. Property registrations, welfare payments, and licensing services are also private goods that are easy to monitor, and citizens have an incentive to give feedback on them.
 With multiple agencies usually delivering these services, citizen-initiated feedback is more likely to have impact if the services are consolidated in one-stop service centers that make it easier for citizens to provide feedback and for governments to integrate the feedback in administrative systems and to monitor the responsiveness of agencies. Onestop centers in Azerbaijan, in Brazil’s Minas Gerais state, and in Moldova show how automating the service delivery chain with citizen feedback can drive service improvements.31 By contrast, it is much more diffi cult for citizens to determine the quality of education or curative health care and to attribute poor outcomes to the precise cause—whether, for example, their child’s poor learning (to the extent that it is assessed through standardized tests) or their poor health is due to poor service providers, their own negligence, or environmental factors. Beyond issues like provider absenteeism, complaints are less likely to be actionable. And citizens have fewer incentives to complain about the weak provision of public goods like roads and municipal services because of free-riding. reported problems, improvements in customer satisfaction, and a reduction in reported corruption.
30 This improved tracking is also triggering improvements in human resource management. In EDE Este, the feedback is systematically used to inform sanctions (such as administrative procedures) and rewards (such as of e-government projects.e Another points to the “dangerous enthusiasms” of technological infatuation and faddism in large IT projects.f Many studies also point to the rigidities in government procurement rules, IT vendors’ lack of understanding of government processes, and a failure to understand the country context.g In the private sector, executives can choose vendors based on personal experience and jointly determined guidelines that are deliberately kept vague to allow fl exibility during implementation. Ministers and senior offi cials, by contrast, are explicitly forbidden by government rules to exercise this level of discretion and instead must purchase on the basis of detailed specifi cations.
 Surveys of technology professionals and executives in both the public and private sectors underline user involvement, leadership support, and a clear statement of project requirements as critical factors for success.h Box 3.5 The high failure rate of e-government projects (continued) a.

In Pakistan, under the Punjab Citizen Feedback Model, service providers record citizens’ mobile numbers.
 A government call center sends SMS messages and voice calls to public service users to make targeted inquiries about satisfaction with 16 services, ranging from property registration to primary health care and potential incidents of corruption. The data are logged and tracked on dashboards.35 This system has been deployed at a very large scale, with more than 7 million citizens contacted since 2012—250,000 a month on average—and about 1 million having provided feedback from across the province.36 But the impact of the feedback on service delivery is unclear. Many offi cials have tried to subvert the initiative, as refl ected in the high and steady proportion of invalid phone numbers recorded by service providers—40 percent for citizens registering property, a service particularly prone to petty corruption. The government has taken more than 6,000 administrative actions against offi cials based on the feedback.
 But given the protections afforded staff under civil service rules, the actions have been mostly warnings and formal apologies from the concerned offi cial to the citizen, and only a handful have been suspensions or dismissals. Governments in high-income countries are moving beyond user feedback to engage citizens in collaborative policy making. The northern European countries are on the vanguard in these moves to more direct democracy, as exemplifi ed by Iceland’s crowdsourced constitution, Estonia’s e-legislation portal, These problems are evident in general citizen feedback portals recently introduced in Botswana, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The government of Indonesia’s complaint-handling system (LAPOR) allows citizens to submit reports on many issues, ranging from delays in welfare payments to damaged roads. It has received about 800 complaints a day on average from all over Indonesia since the portal’s launch in 2012. Of these complaints, only 10 percent are specifi c and actionable (fi gure 3.
12, panel a) and are forwarded to the relevant agency for resolution. Of these actionable complaints, 28 percent and 18 percent, respectively, are for private benefi ts like welfare payments or fuel subsidies; less than 5 percent are for public goods like roads and public works (fi gure 3.12, panel b).32 The complaint portals of the governments of Botswana and the Philippines have similarly provided limited actionable information to the government, particularly on public goods.33 Citizen feedback portals are also likely to be disproportionately used by better-off, more educated, and more digitally savvy individuals, potentially biasing government responses. For example, most users of FixMyStreet in the United Kingdom are male, older, more educated, and less likely to be from an ethnic minority than the general population.
34 Similarly, the users of LAPOR are disproportionately from Jakarta, the largest city and the capital, than from the poorer and more remote regions in eastern Indonesia. Government-initiated feedback can overcome these biases in citizen reporting and be more focused Source: WDR 2016 team, based on 2015 LAPOR data. Data at .

In India, the monitoring of health workers did improve attendance, but many local governments did not use the data to sanction absent workers because of cumbersome civil service rules or for political reasons. In Uganda, absenteeism was reduced only by combining teacher incentive pay with monitoring technology. In Pakistan, smartphone-based monitoring of district health supervisors in rural clinics doubled inspections of health facilities and reduced medical worker absenteeism, but the results were highly contingent on the severity of patronage politics in a locality. In Haiti, the experiment failed because government teachers had not been paid for months and resented the additional unfairness imposed on them by digital monitoring.
 In Niger, by contrast, the experiment was conducted with contract teachers hired by a nongovernmental organization, and mobile phone–based monitoring by itself was suffi cient to improve teacher effort and motivation as well as student learning outcomes. Reducing absenteeism, while necessary, is not suffi cient to ensure that doctors, teachers, and managers, once they show up to work, actually are motivated to perform well and to serve the public. Recent innovations in the private sector have extended these teacher monitoring technologies to the actual practice of teaching, through standard lesson plans and systematic monitoring of teacher activities by management. The initial results are promising, again conditional on the strong relationships of accountability that can exist in private schools (box 3.6). But applying these lessons to a government bureaucracy will be challenging.
 The typical developing country government bureaucracy is unable to recruit the best and brightest workers because of low pay and excessive infl uence by politicians. It promotes staff on the basis of seniority and not performance—in part because measuring performance is diffi cult and seniority is the only credible standard—and is unable to motivate workers to work hard and serve the public. For many providers, the reason for joining the public sector is job security, not promoting student learning or public health. These weaknesses are evident from perception surveys of government workers in Indonesia and the Philippines. Many staff believe that the best university graduates prefer working in the private sector, that their coworkers are often not productive, that promotions are based on politics rather than merit, and that their coworkers in other government agencies cannot be trusted (fi gure 3.13).
 Anecdotal evidence and Reykjavik’s digital participatory budgeting.37 But even in these digitally and socioeconomically advanced countries, e-participatory policy making has engaged only a small, nonrepresentative subset of the population, has elicited limited government responsiveness, and is diffi cult to sustain. In Estonia, a global leader in e-services and e-voting, with high citizen use across all socioeconomic groups, only 8 percent of people polled had heard of http://www .osale.ee, the government’s e-legislation and policy making portal. Improving service provider management Technology can improve systems that are already working .
 . . but it doesn’t fi x systems that are broken. There is no knowledge management without management. —Kentaro Toyama, University of Michigan School of Information User feedback is effective when providers and managers have the incentive and the ability to respond to citizens, which depends on strong relationships of accountability between policy makers and providers. By better monitoring of workers and facilities and through better organization and performance management in bureaucracies, digital technologies can strengthen accountability within the government by reducing information asymmetries between policy makers and service providers.
 The absenteeism of teachers, doctors, nurses, and agricultural extension workers is pervasive in Africa and South Asia.38 Estimates suggest that in India roughly one-quarter of government teachers and over one-third of government doctors in primary health centers are absent without a legitimate reason on any given day, with similarly alarming numbers in several African countries.39 Physical monitoring of providers is costly, particularly in rural areas, and the monitors are just as likely to shirk as the providers or to collude with providers. Using mobile phones to record attendance—either with the photographs or thumbprints of the providers as evidence—and transmit data to a central database to generate monitoring reports can be a cost-effective solution to this seemingly intractable problem. Evidence from impact evaluations in Haiti, India, Niger, Pakistan, and Uganda shows that digital monitoring can reduce absenteeism in general, but that technology on its own is not suffi cient for curbing 169DELIVERING SERVICES ers reported that they had never had a meeting with the head teacher to discuss their performance, and two-thirds of the head teachers had themselves been absent from school at least once in the last fi ve days.42 The low productivity of some government bureaucracies refl ects fundamental structural constraints that cannot easily be substituted for by technology.
 Where digital technologies can help is in monitoring goals and performance targets for organizational units and workers. For the private sector, fi rms that adopt suggests that these problems are even more severe in low-income countries. Studies of teacher and health worker management in South Asia and Africa reveal a fundamentally broken system, with pervasive problems of politicization, weak school management, low provider motivation, and shirking.41 A recent survey of public schools in Tanzania revealed that 67 percent of the teachers who were present in the school did not show up in classrooms to teach. Nor did school principals hold them accountable: Three-quarters of teachBox 3.6 Digitally enabled teacher management in private schools Private schools targeted to the world’s poorest have become a new model for education in developing countries with low-quality public education.
 Bridge International Academies (BIA) is an innovative for-profi t private model operating in underserved communities in Kenya and Uganda that leverages standardization and technology to educate more than 118,000 children. The BIA business and educational model is driven by a standardized set of curricular and managerial materials to keep classes consistent, students on task, and schools running smoothly. The core of these materials is an internet-enabled tablet computer, which downloads more than 3,400 lesson plans and teacher scripts at the beginning of each term. These plans include step-by-step instructions on how to prepare and present each lesson, homework assignments, and tests. BIA management tracks classroom progress—such as the speed of lessons and teacher attendance—with the tablet through automatic syncing. If a teacher falls behind in lessons, BIA managers in Nairobi and BIA’s U.
S. headquarters know immediately and can follow up with the teacher hundreds or thousands of miles away. In addition to teacher monitoring, student progress is tracked by teacher-inputted student test scores and progress measures. This automation gives BIA headquarters instant access to school data and helps BIA manage their academies. In addition to classroom management, standardization and technology are leveraged to improve school administration. Each “academy manager”—akin to a head teacher or principal—receives a smartphone to use for communication and monitoring, and as a modem for the tablets.
 Academy managers follow standardized instructions on managing fi nances, personnel, and student and parent relationships, as well as on how to use a central payroll system, expense-processing system, standardized assessments, and evaluation tools. Even paying school fees is standardized and technology-enabled; tuition payments are made electronically with M-Pesa or through Equity Bank Kenya. The standardized instruction, school management, and assessment ensure that each student in a Bridge Academy receives the same education, regardless of location or instructor. Initial evaluations show that this educational style may be eff ective. In 2013, a self-evaluation found that BIA students scored 0.32 standard deviations higher than peer students in public schools in reading fl uency and comprehension, translating into an additional 16 words per minute and 252 additional learning days.
 In math skills, BIA students scored 0.51 standard deviations higher, equivalent to an additional 288 learning days. These fi ndings need to be viewed cautiously, however, as the diff erences in outcomes may be entirely explained by diff erences in students between BIA and public schools. This type of private education is not unequivocally embraced. The scripted lesson plans are particularly controversial, with questions about the eff ectiveness of a script to create a dynamic learning environment for children to develop higher-order thinking skills. In addition, Bridge Academies rely on large class sizes and teachers with only a secondary education to keep costs low.
 Low-cost private education is also criticized because of the potential to undermine public education systems. Countries that rely on private education may not invest as heavily in their public systems, and private schools often attract the best students, further diminishing the public education system. Even so, in contexts where public schools are failing, a standardized private sector model may be a viable option for improving learning outcomes.

There is little evidence, even in the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries, that digital technologies have made any fundamental differences in the way government bureaucracies are managed, particularly for the better integration of policy making and service delivery across government.
 Even in New Zealand, known for its highly competent and innovative public administration, two-thirds of public offi cials surveyed were skeptical that digital technologies would induce greater collaboration and integration across government departments because the notion of a “joined-up government” confl icted with the annual agency-based budget appropriation process.45 In sum, these digitally enabled management improvements are isolated examples. Either they are pilots and experiments limited to a subset of activities, such as addressing absenteeism, that form the basic minimum required to improve teaching or health care, or they are limited to a few locales, sectors, or agencies and not taken to scale in the government as a whole. Developing country government bureaucracies now have a digital veneer over a largely unchanged structure, culture, and performance orientation. more structured performance management practices are more profi table, and digital technologies complement performance monitoring and performance incentives.43 Goal-setting and performance incentives are diffi cult—but not impossible—in government bureaucracies.
 The multiple demands on a public organization, and the multiple interests it needs to serve, make it diffi cult to defi ne goals, and performance incentives can trigger a host of perverse incentives. The key variable is the extent to which the tasks and outputs of agencies can be routinized and monitored.44 As MajiVoice and the EDE Este feedback systems show, eliciting citizen feedback on service quality, tracking complaint resolution, producing audit trails of worker effort, and offering performance incentives for staff can be a powerful combination for transforming government bureaucracies. This combination is also being used in one-stop service centers in many countries. Digitally enabled performance monitoring is much more diffi cult for services that are highly discretionary and hard to monitor, such as teaching and curative health care, and for policy and regulatory functions. Assessing performance is necessarily more subjective and therefore conditional on the quality of manageSources: World Bank surveys of government offi cials, 2011 and 2013.

 These technologies have also helped citizens vote out corrupt politicians, if the information comes from a credible source. But signifi cant barriers to more informed voting remain, and digital technologies, by giving elites new ways of manipulating information to their advantage in election campaigns, can also disempower the poor. These disparities can be countered if traditional media bridge the digital divide, but such a role may be limited to providing information that is more salient and newsworthy, such as corruption scandals, rather than service delivery failures. Digital technologies, particularly social media, have galvanized citizen protests, but except where governments are willing and able, they have not sustained collective action and citizen voice to improve service delivery (table 3.2). Freer and fairer elections Is the growth of digital technologies spreading democratic ideals around the world, as many believe?
46 Democracy has indeed spread across the world, but so have election irregularities.47 As the number of developing country democracies more than doubled from 1990 to 2012, the proportion of elections that were “free and fair” halved from almost 80 percent to under 40 percent over the same period (fi gure 3.14, panel a). In a free election, the electoral rules and their implementation leading up to an election enable all adult citizens to be registered, to exercise their right to vote, and to join political parties and to campaign Digital technologies too often fail to empower citizens As discussed, digital technologies can be effective even in weak government bureaucracies in some areas— notably through digital identifi cation, streamlining routine tasks, and citizen feedback for certain services that citizens have the incentive and capacity to monitor. But in general, to have an impact, e-government requires effective leadership by politicians and policy makers—to make the necessary changes to government rules and management practices, to overcome resistance from vested interests, and to respond to citizen feedback on service quality. Strengthening government capability requires a willing government.
 The question, then, is whether digital technologies can encourage good leadership by empowering citizens to hold policy makers and providers accountable. Mechanisms for empowering citizens include • Free and fair elections in government systems in which leaders are chosen in elections—ensuring that all legitimate votes can be cast and counted so that the poor in particular are not excluded from participating • More informed voting—informing voters to increase electoral participation and reducing information asymmetries so that votes can be more accurately based on the performance of politicians • Citizen voice and collective action—empowering citizens to individually and collectively mobilize to pressure policy makers and providers to improve services.

Note: Channels are arranged by degree of technology impact.
 L = low; M = medium; H = high. 172 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 More informed voting Improving the mechanical aspects of voting is a minimum requirement for electoral accountability. The more fundamental problem is that citizens are often uninterested and unengaged in politics, face signifi cant informational barriers in assessing politician performance, or base their votes on tribal, ethnic, or clientelist factors and not the ability and performance of politicians.53 This lack of engagement is understandable. Acquiring political information is costly, the sources of the information, like political parties, are often not credible, and the impact of an individual citizen’s more informed vote is negligible to the outcome of an election. The question, then, is whether digital technologies change this calculus to result in a more engaged and informed citizenry—and more effective elections.
 There is no shortage of popular opinion that the internet—by exponentially increasing transparency and forging connections among voters, particularly through social media—will strengthen accountability through greater voter engagement and participation.54 These sentiments echo those of earlier generations about television, which was also viewed as nothing short of revolutionary for enhancing accountability. But television’s impact has turned out to be much more mixed. In Sweden, the rollout of commercial television indeed improved citizen knowledge of freely. In a fair election, all voters and all votes are treated equally on the day of the election.48 Electoral irregularities can affect poor voters disproportionately.
 They may not be able to cast their votes because they lack proper identifying documents, or their votes may not be counted because of error or manipulation. Digital technologies are helping make elections freer and fairer. Across nations, perceptions of the integrity of elections in developing countries are positively correlated with internet use (fi gure 3.14, panel b). Rigorous studies reinforce this cross-national correlation and demonstrate the powerful impact of digital technology in increasing electoral participation, particularly for the poor. In Brazil, pre-internet electronic voting machines signifi cantly reduced voting errors in the 1990s, leading to the de facto enfranchisement of poor and less educated citizens, which in turn led to more pro-poor spending.
49 In Afghanistan, the monitoring of votes cast through cellphone photographs of vote totals in polling stations reduced electoral fraud in the vote aggregation process.50 In Mozambique, SMS messages allowing citizens to report electoral irregularities increased voter turnout by 5 percentage points.51 And although not evaluated, the use of crowdsourcing by Ushahidi and its successor Uchaguzi, combined with civil society monitoring, advocacy, and partnerships with government, has helped curtail election violence in Kenya (box 3.7).52 Figure 3.14 Democracy has spread, but so have election irregularities—digital technologies can help make elections freer and fairer Sources: WDR 2016 team, based on Polity IV 2015; Bishop and Hoeffl er 2014; Perceptions of Electoral Integrity 2015.

 A growing number of advocacy organizations in developing countries partner with media to provide voters with easy-tounderstand information about politicians. For example, Mumbai Votes tracks legislators from Mumbai at all levels of government in India, reporting on their legislative activity and any court cases fi led against them. The Fair Play Alliance of the Slovak Republic tracks campaign fi nance and procurement contracts to uncover corrupt relationships between businesses and politicians.63 politics and government policy and increased voter turnout.55 In the United States, however, it reduced voter turnout and knowledge of policy issues by crowding out local radio and newspapers, previously the main source of political information.56 Digital technologies can certainly provide a variety of tools to improve the informational content of voting.
 For example, Voting Advice Applications are websites that enable citizens in several European countries to compare the platforms of competing political parties with their own preferences on salient issues; these increased voter turnout among youth in the Netherlands.57 But the internet also offers a variety of other entertainment options that compete for people’s time and can disengage them from politics. In Germany and Italy, the internet reduced voter turnout by crowding out television, a greater source of political information.58 The internet also provides political parties, bloggers, and opinion leaders with resources to shape public opinion. For example, a simple “I Voted” message on individuals’ Facebook pages increased voter turnout by more than 300,000 in the 2010 U.S.
 midterm elections.59 The “winner take all” feature of the internet economy is also replicated in the online Box 3.7 Improving the integrity of elections through crowdsourcing and collaboration Improving electoral integrity requires eff ective media, nongovernmental organizations, and partnerships between technologists, advocacy groups, and government watchdogs to gather, analyze, disseminate, and act upon relevant information. Consider the contrasting experiences of Ushahidi and Uchaguzi, two digital election-monitoring initiatives in Kenya. Ushahidi, one of the best-known digital platforms in the world, was launched in the aftermath of Kenya’s tumultuous 2007 election and used “citizen reporters” to crowdsource and map incidents of violence after the election. While the platform galvanized considerable interest initially—with more 45,000 users in its fi rst few months—many of the reports were not actionable, and there was limited response from the authorities.
 Learning from this experience, Ushahidi and a group of journalists and civil society organizations launched its successor, Uchaguzi, to monitor Kenya’s 2010 constitutional referendum. But this time, the eff ort combined citizen crowdsourcing with analysis by specialized civil society organizations with experience monitoring elections to provide actionable information to local and national government offi cials, in particular the Interim Independent Electoral Commission. This partnership was a success, with the government responding to a majority of the reports. Ushahidi’s implicit belief was that the platform would by itself be the agent of change. Uchaguzi—or “Ushahidi 2.0”—recognizes that the platform can work only if it amplifi es existing institutions.
 The main lesson is that governments may be dysfunctional, but can only rarely be bypassed. As one of the founders of the initiative commented after the local police—infamous in Kenya for their venality and brutality—successfully responded to an online citizen report of a machete-armed mob gathering outside a local polling station, “We can’t compel organizations to act. We can support institutions, but we can’t replace them.” Sources: WDR 2016 team, based on interviews with Ushahidi management; Fung, Russon Gilman, and Shkabatur 2013; Wrong 2013. 174 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 countries by lowering the cost of voting, since votes can be cast from the convenience of one’s home. In Estonia, where about one-third of voting is online, the share of internet voters has increased by more than 4 percentage points in almost every election since 2005, contributing to an overall increase in voter turnout (fi gure 3.
15, panel a). Studies show no differences in the demographic characteristics of internet versus offl ine voters.71 In Brazil, by contrast, internet voting on municipal budget proposals in the state of Rio Grande do Sul increased voter turnout by 8 percent (and these were new voters), but the online voters were more likely to be male, university educated, and higher-income (fi gure 3.15, panel b).72 These changes in the demographic profi le of voters have not yet changed policy preferences, perhaps because the offl ine participatory mechanisms to determine the budget proposals that are then voted on limit the range of options subject to the vote. But they show how the internet can be biased against certain groups.
 Overall, then, the evidence suggests that digital technologies have helped curtail blatant abuses of political offi ce, conditional on supportive institutions of accountability (such as independent audit or anticorruption bodies) and free media (to generate and help disseminate the relevant information to voters). Service delivery failures have not been salient enough to command the attention of even digitally enabled media to infl uence voting decisions by the poor. Citizen voice and collective action “Home run” cases in which a technological intervention almost by itself produces dramatic increases in accountability . . . are exceedingly rare .
 . . The greatest opportunities [for technology are in] amplifying NGO and governmental strategies of accountability. —Archon Fung, Kennedy School of Government, and colleagues One of the more widely held beliefs about the transformative power of digital technologies, particularly social media, is its ability to catalyze citizen voice and collective action to hold governments accountable. The internet promotes transparency by increasing the richness and customizability of the information for citizens. Less obvious—and unique to these technologies—is that they also enable citizens to generate their own information (user-generated content), which can be aggregated at low cost to provide colFor this digitally enabled political information to have impact, it must be easy to understand, be clearly attributable to a particular politician, and be credible.
 A good example is the uncovering of corruption by public offi cials if the information comes from a trusted source, such as an independent anticorruption commission or reliable media outlet. In 2003, the federal government of Brazil launched a national anticorruption program based on random audits of municipal governments by the national audit authority (the municipalities to be audited in a given month were chosen by lottery), with results publicly disseminated over radio, television, and print media. Voters punished incumbents who were found to be corrupt by not reelecting them. The effects were stronger in municipalities with local radio stations, pointing to the role of local media in informing voters.64 These fi ndings have been replicated in studies of municipal audits in Mexico, again pointing to the importance of a credible source for information on corruption (a national audit by an independent and competent institution) and local television and radio to disseminate that information for electoral accountability.65 By contrast, provision of information about failures in service delivery such as poor education or health care, or weak performance of legislatures— which is more complex and diffi cult to attribute to particular politicians—has been less effective.
66 Information campaigns over local radio on public health and primary education in rural Benin had no effect on the incentives of politicians to provide better health and education services or on provider responsiveness.67 Informing Indian voters about the performance of their legislators in legislative activity had no effect on voting behavior; but informing them on spending by parliamentarians on physical infrastructure from funds allotted to them to spend on their constituencies did affect voting behavior, since this information was more salient to voters.68 Similarly, providing information on legislator performance to voters in Uganda had no effect on parliamentarians’ reelection rates.69 The experience of Open Data Initiatives is also quite sobering. The mainstream media in Kenya, the Philippines, and Uganda have not been deeply engaged with the Open Data Initiatives, either in using data as a source of evidence in their reporting or in reporting on efforts surrounding open data. Journalists interviewed said there was no “scoop” in the open data story.
70 Digital technologies can also reinforce socioeconomic disparities in voter participation and knowledge, particularly in developing countries. Internet voting has increased participation in some European 175DELIVERING SERVICES technology-enabled effects hold for collective action around the more mundane service delivery failures. Identifying the precise government failure is much more diffi cult for services—these after all are hidden from the public eye in classrooms, rural health centers, and in the substandard materials used to construct roads—just as is clearly attributing the failure itself to the actions of a particular individual or group of individuals. These failures only rarely become salient in fl ashpoint events like scandals or egregious abuses of public authority, such as the excessive use of force by the police or a patient dying because of poor care. And they cannot be addressed by the simple “stroke of the pen” actions that protests tend to mobilize around, such as jailing a corrupt politician. Instead, they require sustained reforms to improve government capability, which in turn requires sustained citizen voice and collective action.
 Given these diffi culties in monitoring service failures, it is not surprising that the large academic empirical literature on nondigital instruments of collective action—citizen and community report cards, complaint mechanisms, community monitoring of service providers—presents frustratingly mixed evidence of impact.79 The main lesson is that the success of citizen collective action around service delivery failures depends on contextual factors, and each of lective voice through crowdsourcing or community mapping. Social media can facilitate collective action by generating peer pressure as individuals observe the behavior and actions of others, improving within- group monitoring, reducing free-riding, and enabling groups to better coordinate their actions around specifi c events such as protests.73 These technologies also provide new platforms for citizens to engage with the government, lowering the costs to citizens of providing information, and enabling policy makers and service providers to seek information and track the feedback loop. As a growing empirical literature shows, cell- phones and the use of Twitter and Facebook aided protests during the Arab Spring in the Arab Republic of Egypt,74 widespread demonstrations on social issues in Chile in 2011,75 antiwar demonstrations in the United States,76 and citizen mobilization across Africa, with the effect more pronounced in nondemocratic political systems where traditional channels for articulating interest were limited.77 The same mechanisms also imply that digital technologies can trigger harmful collective action, like ethnic confl ict.
78 Social media have the unique ability to make scandals and highly emotive government abuses of authority “go viral” and trigger parallel physical citizen mobilization.

Profile of online and offline voters in a participatory budgeting vote in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 2011–12 176 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 what is likely to work and under what conditions.82 The focus here is on digital channels that are initiated by civil society organizations (CSOs) and donors to pressure governments, and that publicize the inputs provided by citizens so as to expose the behavior of service providers to public scrutiny. This analysis excludes government-initiated portals, which are more accurately characterized as user feedback mechanisms to improve service quality, and not as citizen empowerment or accountability initiatives, and which were discussed earlier.
 The analysis distinguishes 17 cases in 12 countries by whether the mechanism for expressing citizen preferences and views is individual or collective; whether the CSO or donor that led the initiative also had explicit partnerships with the concerned government; and whether there was also parallel offl ine mobilization accompanying the digital voice channel (table 3.3). Impact is measured in two ways: citizen the links in the causal chain between transparency, citizen action, and state action can break down if these factors are not aligned. How credible, salient, and comprehensible is the information to citizens?80 How willing and able are citizens to act on the information individually or collectively? How effective are intermediary organizations—civil society, media, interest groups—to organize citizens or to lobby governments on their behalf?
 And most important, do state actors have the incentive and capacity for action, thereby “closing the loop”? Action and impact are more likely if the social accountability initiative is embedded in a citizen-state interface and synchronized with topdown government accountability initiatives.81 Digital citizen voice initiatives for improving service delivery have multiplied rapidly, but no rigorous studies have evaluated their impact. An organizing framework is needed to classify these examples and draw the necessarily tentative conclusions about Table 3.3 Classifying the digital citizen engagement cases Por Mi Barrio Uruguay India South Africa Brazil Philippines World Uganda Kenya Tanzania Georgia Philippines Bolivia Nepal India Mexico India Tanzania Case Location Impact I Change My City Lungisa Pressure Pan Rappler Change.org U-report Huduma FixMyStreet Check My School Barrios Digital e-Chautari I Paid a Bribe Mejora Tu Escuela Karnataka BVS Sauti Za Wananchi Citizen uptake Government response H H H H H H H M M M M M L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L Additional offline mobilization CSO partners with government Collective feedback Daraja Maji Matone Source: WDR 2016 team, based on Peixoto and Fox 2015, for the WDR 2016.
 Note: Examples are arranged by degree of government response. CSO = civil society organization; L = low; M = medium; H = high. 177DELIVERING SERVICES result: The Supreme Court declared these funds unconstitutional.85 What stands out, though, is the high proportion of cases that have both low citizen uptake and low government response. Most of the cases that lacked partnerships between CSOs and governments were unsuccessful. Maji Matone (Tanzania), for example, received only 53 SMS messages during its fi rst six months of operation, against an initial target of 3,000, and the mobile platform was abandoned.
 Other disappointments are Huduma (Kenya),86 I Paid a Bribe (India), and Check My School (the Philippines). Despite high expectations, they have not generated much citizen uptake or government resolution of the reported problem—in some cases, despite government collaboration. Uganda’s U-report, perhaps the highest profi le initiative, is an SMS-based platform that runs weekly polls with registered users (U-reporters) on issues ranging from child marriage to access to education, which are then both broadly disseminated and targeted to members of parliament for action. The platform has had considerable citizen uptake, but mostly by the more privileged groups. Of close to 300,000 U-reporters, nearly half have some university education, and one-quarter are government employees, raising questions about whose voices are being projected.87 This high uptake has not led to any noticeable government action.
 Surveys of online political participation in the United States also fi nd that better-off and more-educated citizens are more likely to participate in both online and offl ine political activities.88 In sum, the success of digital citizen voice is conditional on willing and able policy makers, a collaborative approach with government, and signifi cant offl ine activism by strong civil society organizations so that the collective voice of citizens can pressure governments. However, digital platforms can also enhance unaccountable governments’ capacity for surveillance and control (box 3.8). The gap between technology and institutions The internet largely, but not entirely, reinforces rather than replaces preexisting relationships of accountability between governments and citizens, and it complements rather than substitutes for existing government capabilities. The main explanation for the varying impact of digital technologies lies in the mismatch—or gap—between rapidly changing technology and slowly changing political and administrative institutions.
 Political institutions can uptake, given that uptake can be considered a necessary condition for government responsiveness; and government action to resolve the service issue, which is the ultimate objective of the citizen voice initiative. The criterion for selecting the cases is simple availability of information. The examples have received media and donor attention, and some data are available on citizen use of the channel and on government response. Of the 17 cases, 3 had high impact in terms of government responsiveness, 3 had medium impact, and 11 had low impact. All the high-impact examples involve partnerships between CSOs and government, suggesting that platforms that both channel citizen voice and link them to the government’s internal work order systems to effi ciently address the complaints are more likely to succeed. For example, Por Mi Barrio in Uruguay and I Change My City in India, two successful CSO platforms, are connected to existing government complaint systems.
 That enables urban residents to report problems using both the CSO and the government channel, with the complaints and government responses displayed on a map, thus informing and validating the citizen action and naming and shaming the nonperforming government units. But not all initiatives involving government-CSO partnerships led to high responsiveness. For instance, I Paid a Bribe (India) and Check My School (Philippines) both had low impact. Seen together, these fi ndings seem to suggest that while collaboration with government is not a suffi cient condition for success, it may well be a necessary one. Another ingredient for success is effective offl ine mobilization, particularly because citizen uptake of the digital channels was low in most of the cases.83 Online petitions on Change.
org are more likely to be successful when sponsored by an organization, and citizen campaigns through Pressure Pan (Brazil) are three times more likely to succeed when supported by Pressure Pan staff.84 Lungisa, a platform for Cape Town residents to report service delivery problems, involves signifi cant follow-up by the CSO staff to ensure that the responsible government agency acts on the complaints. Rappler, a media and advocacy organization in the Philippines, combines media, technology, and the power of crowdsourcing to identify and amplify governance issues, with traditional citizen mobilization strategies using investigative journalists and social mobilizers. Rappler organizes community protests, the most dramatic one being the Philippines’s fi rst protests organized with social media against a corruption scandal involving congressional discretionary funds. The eventual 178 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 and policy makers need to have the incentives to make these investments. Bureaucracies can have a disincentive to reorganize their work to take full advantage of digital technologies.
 In the private sector, market competition forces fi rms to change and rewards them with higher profi ts for their investments. In contrast, in be distinguished by whether they are clientelist or propoor, and bureaucracies can be classifi ed by whether they are patronage-based or performance-oriented.89 These institutions, and their characteristics, matter because effective adoption of technology in organizations requires signifi cant investments in skills and changes in working arrangements, and politicians Box 3.8 Digital technologies can strengthen control The internet presents a “dictator’s dilemma” for autocracies. Restricting the internet can hurt economic development, but leaving it unfettered can threaten the government by increasing citizens’ access to political information and facilitating collective action. Autocratic governments have responded to this dilemma in sophisticated ways, taking advantage of the tools that the internet itself off ers to improve services while strengthening control.
 Autocracies have invested in e-government, particularly in e-services. The relationship between online services and government type is U-shaped, with both more democratic and more autocratic governments scoring high on the United Nations’ online service index compared to the ones in the middle (fi gure B3.8.1). This pattern suggests that improvements in basic service delivery can be independent of a country’s political system.a Autocracies are, however, becoming more adept at monitoring the internet to censor criticism entirely or circumvent protests, to spread propaganda, or to learn about public grievances to improve government responsiveness while also intervening to prevent specifi c instances of collective action that challenge the government’s power.
b Digital technologies therefore provide opportunities for autocracies to improve service delivery while maintaining control. a. Corrales and Westhoff 2006; Rød and Weidmann 2015. b.

The extent of the institutional dependence of digital technologies in achieving impacts varies by the type of service and activity, based on three factors: the degree to which citizens have an incentive to monitor the service and provide feedback; the extent to which the processes for the production and delivery of the service or activity are based on tasks that can be made routine and standardized; and the measurability and extent to which the outputs and outcomes from the task can be attributed to particular public actors or actions (fi gure 3.17). Services and activities that citizens have an incentive to monitor, and that are measurable and attributable to the efforts of specifi c government offi cials, are compatible with political incentives. Improving them yields immediate political benefi ts, as citizens care about these services, can assess the service improvement, and can attribute this improvement to actions by policy makers and providers.
 If their delivery is based on repeatable, routine tasks, these are more amenable to automation or digitally enabled monitoring. These services are less government, effi ciency improvements can reduce an agency’s budget and staff.90 Adopting new technologies also requires learning new skills and changing processes, which can add to the workload, at least initially, with unclear career rewards in patronage-based civil service systems, particularly given the diffi culties in measuring the productivity of government agencies. Ministries and departments compete against one another for scarce budgetary resources, leading to a silo mentality and resistance to horizontal collaboration. Most important, the automation of business processes and improved monitoring reduce bureaucratic discretion and opportunities for petty corruption in patronage-based systems. In the absence of market competition, overcoming bureaucratic resistance to digital technologies requires strong political leadership.
 But political incentives may also not be aligned with digital technologies. Many e-government projects take a long time to implement and thus elicit little interest from political leaders whose preferences are governed by short election cycles. In clientelist political institutions, politicians are accountable largely to a narrow group of elites. Digital technologies, by promoting transparency and enhanced tracking and monitoring of resources, can curtail avenues for rent-seeking— “grand corruption,” in contrast to the petty corruption of service providers—that underpin these informal political institutions. And citizens continue to face signifi cant barriers to voice and collective action that digital technologies have not signifi cantly ameliorated. Lifting these barriers depends more on the strength of an independent media, supreme audit and anticorruption agencies, and civil CSOs as sources of credible information and as intermediaries between the citizen and the state.
 E-government projects funded by the World Bank are more successful in countries with stronger institutions (fi gure 3.16). While project performance varies considerably within countries, project outcomes across countries, as self-evaluated by the World Bank, are strongly positively linked to the quality of government institutions, as measured by the Worldwide Governance Indicators. There is considerable evidence of the complementarity between technology and the organization of work in attaining productivity improvements in the private sector.91 The few empirical studies that investigate these complementarities for government have similar fi ndings. For example, investments in information technology by police departments in the United States lowered crime rates only when accompanied by signifi cant organizational changes.
92 The mixed record of automation also underlines the Figure 3.16 Digital technology projects funded by the World Bank are more successful in countries with higher-quality institutions Sources: WDR 2016 team, based on World Bank (2015a) Digital Governance Projects Database; Worldwide Governance Index 2014; Denizer, Kaufmann, and Kraay 2013.

The tasks to deliver some of these services, like cash transfers or fi ling taxes, are largely rule-based and clerical, or follow a standardized set of procedures, and ensuring the timely processing of work orders is enough to deliver the service. These features help explain the successful uses of digital technologies for welfare payments, water provision, property and business registration discussed earlier, including through citizen feedback on service quality. It also explains the success of various m-health initiatives. Automating these tasks does require breaking down departmental silos and changing administrative processes, but the quick, easily visible, and easily attributable service improvements to citizens can yield political benefi ts that even clientelist politicians might have an interest in supporting, though the political economy considerations vary by activity.
 The mixed impact of e-fi ling systems for example, refl ects how these reforms can often confl ict with elite interests and are likely more dependent on institutional complements. By contrast, teaching, policing, and management are tasks for which no “user manual” can be written, since providers are confronted daily with unique circumstances and must exercise signifi cant judgment on how to respond.93 As a result, these tasks are particularly susceptible to problems of asymmetric conditional on the strength of the initial institutions and relatively amenable to improvements through digital technology. By contrast, services that citizens do not have an incentive to monitor and that are less measurable and attributable do not yield political benefi ts to politicians. If the delivery of these services is based on tasks that are highly discretionary, policy makers have less infl uence over the providers responsible for these services. These services and activities are much more dependent on the quality of existing institutions; improvements through the application of digital technologies are only incremental.
 This variation helps explain the differential impact of digital technologies across the elements of government capability and citizen empowerment summarized in the table 3.1 and 3.2 scorecards, and why digital technologies can substitute for poor institutions for certain activities and can only complement existing institutions for others. Citizens and businesses have an incentive to monitor private goods or services that they use very frequently. These include the variety of registration and licensing services offered in one-stop centers; fi ling taxes; welfare payments; family-oriented health services and self-care such as neonatal health and patients’ adherence to treatment schedules; and Figure 3.17 Classifying public services and activities as to their amenability to improvement through digital technology Sources: WDR 2016 team, based on Batley and Mcloughlin 2015; Pritchett and Woolcock 2002; Wilson 1989; World Bank 2003.

That has been evident in the example of MajiVoice in Kenya, where automation quickly transformed a patronage-based water utility to a performance-oriented one, and in the examples of institutional transformation triggered by digital identifi cation. Moreover, the considerable heterogeneity of institutions within countries, varying by sector and locale, creates many openings for innovations that are specifi c to a given context.
94 How should this institutional heterogeneity be classifi ed to help guide policies? Under clientelism, policies are more likely to be adopted if they generate immediate and highly visible service improvements to citizens without reducing the rents of vested interests. In patronage-based bureaucracies, reforms are more likely to succeed if they do not require signifi cant changes in administrative processes or much collaboration across agencies, or threaten the bureaucracy with staffi ng and budgetary reductions. Under pro-poor political institutions, there can be greater political ownership in reforming bureaucracies to strengthen government capability, and in transparency and accountability initiatives. Performanceoriented bureaucracies have the incentive to engage with ambitious initiatives, including the longduration and less visible administrative automation that often elicits little enthusiasm from politicians. More generally, the variation in institutional dependency by the nature of the service and activity opens reform possibilities and can be a guide for policies in different country contexts, as discussed in chapter 5.
 Notes 1. The 2004 World Development Report, Making Services Work for Poor People, underlined that service delivery failures are largely about failures of accountability and weak government implementation capacity, not about poor policies or lack of resources. It showed how relationships of accountability— between citizens and policy makers, between policy makers and service providers, and between citizens and providers—determine outcomes. Unaccountable politicians target policies and public spending to a narrow set of elites rather than providing public goods to benefi t the general population. Managers and providers are unresponsive to policy makers and to citizens, often using their positions to extract rents. And poor citizens are unable to organize collectively to pressure policy makers and providers to address service delivery failures.
 See also Pritchett, Woolcock, and Andrews 2010. information. As discussed, it is diffi cult for digital technologies to make a difference beyond addressing basic problems of provider absenteeism. Citizens also often lack the incentive or capacity to monitor these services, either because they are public goods (for example, security), or are less visible (classroom teaching or government administration). These diffi culties in measurability, and therefore “attributability,” also make it hard for citizens to hold providers and politicians accountable for performance through elections—beyond deterring electoral fraud and voting out corrupt politicians. They also make it diffi cult for citizen collective action to be effective in the absence of a strong civil society or willing governments to partner with.
 These are services and activities where institutions matter much more for outcomes. Digital technologies cannot replace weak institutions. Between these two extremes are the mixed cases where digital technologies can improve some aspects of the service or activity. Roads and other public infrastructure, fi nancial management, and government procurement are activities with low incentives for citizens to monitor because the service is a public good, or not visible to citizens; however, the measurability and attributability of outcomes may be high, and the delivery process may have some elements that can be automated (such as construction). E-procurement of complex goods, such as e-government systems, cannot entirely remove discretion in the evaluation of different bids, but it does establish audit trails and performance indicators. Curative and preventive health care are private and public goods, respectively, and so differ in the citizens’ incentive to monitor (although vaccinating children is a preventive measure that parents are likely to have an incentive to monitor).
 But the highly discretionary nature of clinical services and the diffi culties in measuring the outcomes of treatment render curative health care more diffi cult to improve through the application of technology than preventive health campaigns that follow more relatively standardized procedures (such as control of communicable diseases). The future of public services This varying interaction between institutions and digital technology provides entry points for reform in different country contexts to improve public service delivery.
 This institutional perspective does not imply that digitally enabled reforms must wait for a country’s institutions to improve
