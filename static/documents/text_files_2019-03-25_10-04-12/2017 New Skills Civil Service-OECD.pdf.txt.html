It takes a look at the changing skills </p><p>needed in the civil services and presents a framework through which OECD countries can </p><p>begin to assess the skills they presently have or gaps that may exist.   </p><p></p><p>The report also identifies promising trends and innovations in civil service </p><p>management that can help set the right strategy to improve employment policies.  It finds </p><p>that some OECD countries are beginning to invest in innovations to improve workforce </p><p>data, to attract and recruit a more diverse range of skill sets, to develop a learning culture, </p><p>and to engage and motivate employees.  However very little guidance exists on which </p><p>investments countries should make in their civil servants to maximise performance and </p><p>improve policies and services.  This report begins to address the gap.  </p><p></p><p>This report was prepared by the OECD Directorate for Public Governance (GOV), </p><p>under the direction of Rolf Alter and Luiz de Mello.  It is based upon a 2016 survey by </p><p>the OECD Public Employment and Management Working Party (PEM) and its related </p><p>work on skills, competencies and performance. </p><p></p><p>The PEM is a collaborative international forum of senior practitioners seeking to </p><p>address current challenges affecting public services and civil service reform. It undertakes </p><p>comparative analysis on issues related to strategic civil service management and </p><p>compensation, which provides governments with unique data to inform their reform </p><p>agendas. The network is one of the main contributors to key GOV projects such as </p><p>Government at a Glance. </p><p></p><p>Draft versions of this report have been shared and discussed with PEM members, the </p><p>Public Governance Committee (PGC), and the OECD’s Global Network of Schools of </p><p>Government. The report benefits greatly from detailed input from the PEM, which </p><p>responded to the 2016 OECD survey on Strategic HR Management in Central/Federal </p><p>Governments, and provided many rich case studies which are highlighted throughout.  </p><p></p><p>Within the OECD Secretariat, this report was managed and written by Daniel Gerson </p><p>(PEM Project Manager), under the guidance of Edwin Lau (Head of the Reform of the </p><p>Public Sector RPS Divison). We wish to thank Luiz De Mello (Deputy Director of GOV), </p><p>Zsuzsanna Lonti (Senior Project Manager), Stéphane Jacobzone (Deputy Head, RPS </p><p>Divison) and Barbara Ubaldi (Project manager – Digital Government) who have given </p><p>valuable guidance and advice on the report and survey.  Cristina Mendes (OECD </p><p>Secretariat) provided essential data analysis, Guillaume Lafortune (OECD Secretariat) </p><p>and Guillaume Bellinelli (Consultant) supported the data collection and cleaning process. </p><p>Matt Kerlogue prepared the annex on innovation skills under the guidance of Marco </p><p>Daglio (OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation). </p><p></p><p>Editorial and production support given by Kate Lancaster, Catherine Roch, William </p><p>Below, Liz Zachary and Liv Gaunt is gratefully acknowledged. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>TABLE OF CONTENTS – 5 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>Table of contents </p><p></p><p>Executive summary ............................................................................................................................. 9 </p><p>Chapter 1.

At the same time, the systems </p><p>and tools of governance are increasingly digital, open and networked.  Civil servants need </p><p>the right skills to keep pace.  </p><p></p><p>This presents a double challenge: the first is to identify which skills will be needed for </p><p>a civil service which is fit-for-purpose today and into the future; the second is to figure </p><p>out how civil services can invest in these skills – through attraction, recruitment and </p><p>development – to improve policies and services.   </p><p></p><p>This report addresses both sides of this challenge by proposing a framework through </p><p>which OECD countries can begin to assess the skills they presently have or gaps that may </p><p>exist. Then, through the use of OECD data, the report identifies promising trends and </p><p>innovations in civil service management that can help set the right strategy to improve </p><p>employment policies.  </p><p></p><p>To assess changes in the skills needed in today’s civil services, the framework </p><p>identifies four areas, each representing specific tasks and skills required in the </p><p>relationship between the civil service and the society it serves: </p><p></p><p>• Policy advice and analysis: Civil servants work with elected officials to inform </p><p>policy development.  However, new technologies, a growing body of policy-</p><p>relevant research, and a diversity of citizen perspectives, demand new skills for </p><p>effective and timely policy advice. </p><p></p><p>• Service delivery and citizen engagement: Civil servants work directly with </p><p>citizens and users of government services.  New skills are required for civil </p><p>servants to effectively engage citizens, crowdsource ideas and co-create better </p><p>services.  </p><p></p><p>• Commissioning and contracting: Not all public services are delivered directly </p><p>by public servants. Governments throughout the OECD are increasingly engaging </p><p>third parties for the delivery of services. This requires skills in designing, </p><p>overseeing and managing contractual arrangements with other organisations.  </p><p></p><p>• Managing networks: Civil servants and governments are required to work across </p><p>organisational boundaries to address complex challenges. This demands skills to </p><p>convene, collaborate and develop shared understanding through communication, </p><p>trust and mutual commitment.   </p><p></p><p>Professional civil services are as important as ever to respond to complex challenges </p><p>and to deliver public value. However, in addition to its professional qualities, civil </p><p>services must also be strategic and innovative.  The framework evaluates the four skills </p><p>areas mentioned above in light of these three qualities:  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>10 – EXECUTIVE SUMMARY </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>• Civil servants in a professional civil service are qualified, impartial, values-</p><p>driven and ethical.  These are foundational and suggest the need to ensure civil </p><p>servants are certified professionals in their area of expertise.     </p><p></p><p>• A civil service composed of qualified professionals will not automatically address </p><p>today’s challenges. Professional civil servants will also need to be future-oriented </p><p>and evidence-based.  This requires the acquisition of strategic skills, particularly </p><p>at management levels, to encourage collaboration between areas of expertise and </p><p>across the four parts of the framework discussed above. This includes skills </p><p>related to risk management, foresight and resilience.   </p><p></p><p>• Sometimes professional and strategic skills reach their limits due to legacy </p><p>structures and systems of public sector organisations.  In these cases, civil </p><p>servants need to be innovative to redesign the tools of governance and develop </p><p>novel solutions to persistent and emergent policy challenges.  The OECD’s </p><p>Observatory for Public Sector Innovation has defined six skills areas needed in </p><p>public sector organisations to drive more, and better, public sector innovation.  </p><p></p><p>Identifying the skills needed is a first step towards developing a fit-for-purpose civil </p><p>service for the twenty-first century.  Building this civil service requires a new look at the </p><p>way people are managed; one that recognises that public employees are neither </p><p>homogenous nor mutually interchangeable. This suggests the need to develop </p><p>employment policies and frameworks that are not only driven by quantitative factors </p><p>(numbers and cost), but that are ultimately driven by individual qualities (skills and </p><p>expertise).  The second part of this report looks at trends and innovations in public </p><p>employment that address these requirements.  </p><p></p><p>Data and evidence are powerful sources of insight to understand current workforce </p><p>capabilities and to identify gaps.  Some OECD countries are beginning to invest in </p><p>innovative data-driven approaches to assess and benchmark civil service skills. This </p><p>promises significant potential, however, to date few established models exist, in particular </p><p>as a basis for management and HR decisions. </p><p></p><p>Some countries are investing in innovative approaches that aim to attract a greater </p><p>diversity of skills in the civil service by identifying what makes the civil service attractive </p><p>and marketing these qualities through more effective employer branding and employment </p><p>offers.  </p><p></p><p>Supporting a learning culture in the civil service will ensure that skills are up to date </p><p>allowing the workforce to keep up with the fast-changing nature of work. This means </p><p>investing in learning opportunities, developing career paths, and reinforcing managers’ </p><p>responsibility to develop their employees. </p><p></p><p>After attracting and developing skilled civil servants, civil service organisations must </p><p>be ready to put these skills to work. Some countries are building networks, managing </p><p>mobility, and centralising some professional functions.  But ultimately it is a management </p><p>task to engage employees and ensure they are provided the right opportunities to use their </p><p>skills to drive change in their organisations to better serve the public. </p><p></p><p>This report reinforces a known, but often overlooked, fact: that the capacity and </p><p>capability of the civil service workforce is fundamental to the success of all public policy </p><p>and reform.  Given that in today’s public sector change is constant, public investment in </p><p>the skill sets of civil servants is required for government to become more nimble, agile </p><p>and adaptable.  The models, data and examples presented in this report show that OECD </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY – 11 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>countries are beginning to take steps towards updating their employment frameworks, but </p><p>no guidance exists at an international level. Further developing the insights in this report </p><p>towards an OECD recommendation on public employment will help guide countries on </p><p>the investments needed to make their civil service fit-for-purpose in the twenty-first </p><p>century. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>1. PUBLIC SECTOR SKILLS IN THE SEARCH FOR PUBLIC VALUE – 13 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>Chapter 1. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>Public sector skills in the search for public value </p><p></p><p>Today’s civil servants address problems of unprecedented complexity in societies that are </p><p>more pluralistic and demanding than ever.

This chapter looks at how the work of civil servants is changing, and </p><p>presents a framework to identify which skills will be needed to produce a civil service </p><p>which is fit-for-purpose today and into the future. These include skills to develop evidence </p><p>based policy advice, to engage citizens for more effective service design, to commission </p><p>services through third party delivery agents, and to manage in networks that extend </p><p>beyond institutional borders. Each of these four skills areas contribute to a professional, </p><p>strategic and innovative civil service.  </p><p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>14 – 1. PUBLIC SECTOR SKILLS IN THE SEARCH FOR PUBLIC VALUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>Civil servants create, protect and positively impact public value. However, there is a </p><p>growing concern that the context and conditions in which the public sector operates are </p><p>quickly changing, suggesting that public value cannot continue to be created in the same </p><p>way as in the past. This change is happening in multiple ways simultaneously. On the </p><p>demand side, the problems civil services are trying to address are increasingly </p><p>interdependent and multidimensional; and are within societies which are increasingly </p><p>pluralistic in views and expectations. On the supply side, the systems and tools of </p><p>governance are increasingly digital, open and networked. Civil servants are needed who </p><p>have the skills to address increasingly complex problems in increasingly pluralistic </p><p>societies using new tools available to governments. </p><p></p><p>The OECD’s work on skills and skills strategies looks at how countries can align </p><p>education and labour market policies to ensure they are producing citizens with the right </p><p>skills to drive economic growth and address economic inclusion and social mobility in the </p><p>national economy. The OECD skills strategy (2012) addresses three inter-related policy </p><p>levers: developing the right skills (ensuring the skills supply is sufficient in both quantity </p><p>and quality), activating skills supply (improving participation in the labour market of </p><p>under-represented groups), and putting skills to effective use (addressing the match </p><p>between skills needed and those available). Until now, the work on skills has not looked </p><p>specifically at the public sector and what kinds of skills are required to drive performance </p><p>and manage productivity. This report builds on some of the insights in the skills strategy, </p><p>with a focus on the civil services of OECD countries, to raise issues about the nature of </p><p>work, how it is changing, and which policies are needed to ensure the skills of civil </p><p>servants keep pace with changing societies and technologies. </p><p></p><p>Wicked problems in complex societies </p><p></p><p>Many observers, analysts and practitioners are aware the most pressing problems </p><p>existing in the public sector are increasingly complex, interconnected, uncertain and </p><p>values-based - see, for example, (Bao, Wang, Larsen, & Morgan, 2012) (Bryson, Crosby, </p><p>& Bloomberg, 2014) (Head & Alford, 2015) (OECD, 2017a). While many of the big </p><p>challenges of the post-war years were seen as large-scale engineering projects, addressed </p><p>through rational planning and scientific process, this approach may only have a limited </p><p>impact on the multidimensional problems that remain, such as climate change, youth </p><p>unemployment, inclusive growth, and achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals </p><p>committed to by United Nations (UN) member states. Systems analysis (OECD, 2017a) </p><p>shows that social and economic problems cannot be understood and addressed in </p><p>isolation, and the complex challenges related to inclusive growth (OECD, 2016a) require </p><p>interventions that embrace rather than over-simplify complexity.  </p><p></p><p>Many of the difficult social problems left to the scope of the public sector are </p><p>complex issues from a scientific as well as a values perspective. Modern societies are </p><p>characterised by a greater plurality of ideas, perspectives, needs and expectations of what </p><p>society should be, how government should behave, and what kinds of trade-offs between </p><p>the individual and collective are desirable. Such differences can make it difficult to reach </p><p>a consensus across those impacted by problems and policy interventions. In such </p><p>situations there can be no absolute certainty of the best way forward, and resorting to </p><p>more information gathering and scientific analysis will rarely result in a perfect solution. </p><p>Instead, it is often suggested that interventions need to be based on adaptive, open and </p><p>networked approaches that bring diverse stakeholders together (OECD, 2017b).

Going digital: What changes for governments? </p><p></p><p>The considerable pace and breadth of the uptake of digital technologies and data use across </p><p>the public sector is pushing many governments to rethink the management of core processes and </p><p>activities and the governance of ICT use in government. Governments increasingly need people </p><p>with the skills to steer decisions and investments in technology and management of data value </p><p>chains to deliver improved outcomes across policy areas. This requires overcoming </p><p>organisational barriers to integration, sharing and horizontality of decisions, and use of data and </p><p>digital technologies across the public sector. Questions exist around how to design public </p><p>services that draw on distributed knowledge and expertise; how to shift ICT spending from </p><p>operating legacy systems to supporting innovation; how to safeguard citizen trust in the public </p><p>use of technology and data; and what skills are required to answer these questions and meet the </p><p>challenges. </p><p></p><p>• Public service delivery: The digital revolution disrupts public service delivery in </p><p>several ways. Citizens expect the public sector to have a more comprehensive view of </p><p>their needs and to provide them with services that consider their specific needs and </p><p>contexts, making their lives easier and avoiding having to deal with several institutions </p><p>to complete a single procedure. This implies a whole-of-government effort and </p><p>significant inter-institutional co-ordination to ensure that the building blocks for </p><p>integrated digital service delivery are in place (e.g. shared resources, such as a common </p><p>digital identity; enabling public institutions to have comprehensive view of the user’s </p><p>digital interactions with the public sector; and a coherent policy framework for data </p><p>sharing within the public sector). Such a framework should make service delivery </p><p>simpler and more convenient for the user, while protecting the user’s personal data from </p><p>abuse. Countries such as Australia, Portugal, the United States and the United Kingdom </p><p>have looked at ways to transform public service delivery as a whole-of-government </p><p>strategy. </p><p></p><p>• New partnerships and ways of solving problems: The digital age brings about </p><p>opportunities for governments through new forms of partnerships that are re-designing </p><p>the role of government as a whole. Government is no longer necessarily the provider of </p><p>public services, but acts increasingly as a convener that allows for the right solutions to </p><p>a specific user’s problem to emerge, delivered by the best fit provider. As such, many </p><p>governments have embraced the strategy of “Government as a Platform” for public </p><p>value (co)creation. This idea, first put forward by the UK’s Government Digital Service, </p><p>has gained traction as others understand the potential of these trends for government as a </p><p>whole. </p><p></p><p>• Resource-sharing: New digital trends enable a thorough re-engineering of how </p><p>government works. These opportunities are not simply about the marginal efficiency </p><p>gains of digitalising a procedure, or even a whole sector, but about the exponential gains </p><p>associated with the transformation of government processes and their ecosystem. Digital </p><p>technologies enable governments to benefit from the effects of scale and network to </p><p>share infrastructure and resources such as storage, data and processing capability in </p><p>ways that were not possible before. However, these will entail new and more complex </p><p>trade-offs, such as balancing privacy and convenience. For instance, Canada has put in </p><p>place Shared Services Canada to help public agencies share services in new ways. It has </p><p>also, as in Norway and the United Kingdom, developed cloud strategies. </p><p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>1.

(cont.) </p><p></p><p>• Data, policy making and oversight: The growing availability of data enables </p><p>governments to make more informed and evidence-based decisions on public issues. </p><p>However, creating a data-driven public sector requires recognising data as a strategic </p><p>asset and a framework for the whole public administration that helps reap the benefits of </p><p>evidence-based decision making. Awareness of data’s potential is rapidly changing how </p><p>policy, rule-making and public management are conceived and informed. For instance, </p><p>Colorado has leveraged sensors to implement data-driven regulation of the new </p><p>marijuana market, and France is using data mining to identify and fight fraud in family </p><p>allowances and social benefits, leading to a 56% increase in fraud detection in 2014. </p><p></p><p>Source: Adapted from OECD (forthcoming-a), The Digital Transformation of the Public Sector: Helping </p><p>Governments Respond to the Needs of Networked Societies, OECD, Paris. </p><p></p><p>Technology is not the only force generating significant shifts in governance systems </p><p>and the tools and skills required to manage these systems. Recent calls for more open, </p><p>productive and innovative government have been challenging the traditional pyramid-</p><p>shaped bureaucracy for some time. “New public management” challenged governments </p><p>to focus on managerial accountability, efficiency and more technically proficient results-</p><p>based performance management. The limits of this approach, however, often resulted in a </p><p>focus on outputs instead of outcomes; a separation of the policy/delivery functions, which </p><p>resulted in a fragmentation of knowledge and learning; and competition between </p><p>providers, which undermined collaboration (Head & Alford, 2015). </p><p></p><p>Various authors have suggested these limitations have led to a new era, sometimes </p><p>called “new public governance” (Osborne, 2010) or “networked governance” (Goldsmith </p><p>& Eggers, 2004; Kettl, 2009), which recognises that government has no monopoly on </p><p>producing public value. They point out that the division between public and private is </p><p>increasingly blurred and emphasise that public value is rarely created by one public actor, </p><p>but through a web of (public) agencies, organisations, firms, institutions and private </p><p>citizens. In some cases these systems are so complex few people have a complete view </p><p>over the whole. This raises particular challenges, but also opportunities since </p><p>governments alone rarely have all the resources, knowledge and expertise to effectively </p><p>address wicked problems in complex societies. Civil servants today need to rely on a </p><p>range of skills to work effectively through and with others to leverage knowledge and </p><p>expertise beyond their own organisations to advance societies, grow economies, and </p><p>manage diverse and conflicting expectations and values. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>18 – 1.

The future of work in a digital economy </p><p></p><p>The world of work is in flux due to digitalisation, the development of the digital economy </p><p>and broad technological change.

The future of work in a digital economy (cont.) </p><p></p><p>• Digitalisation raises questions on technology’s potential to substitute work. Estimates </p><p>based on the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) show that on average across countries, 9% </p><p>of jobs are at high risk of being automated, while for another 25% of jobs, 50% of the </p><p>tasks will change significantly because of automation. </p><p></p><p>• Digitalisation has opened the ground for new forms of work organisation (e.g. </p><p>outsourcing, shared services). Although the “platform economy” (Uber, AirBnB, etc.) </p><p>may bring efficiency in matching workers to jobs and tasks, it also raises questions </p><p>about wages, labour rights and access to social protection for the workers involved. </p><p></p><p>• ICT is profoundly changing the skill profile of jobs.

Young people, </p><p>however, are much more ICT proficient than older generations. </p><p></p><p>• To thrive in the digital economy, ICT skills will not be enough, and other </p><p>complementary skills will be needed, ranging from good literacy and numeracy skills </p><p>through to the right socio-emotional skills to work collaboratively and flexibly. </p><p></p><p>• Digitalisation will provide new opportunities to many but will raise challenges for </p><p>others, with the risk of growing inequalities in access to jobs and their quality and career </p><p>potential.

Further, the public value chain allows policy makers to visualise possible gaps, </p><p>alignment failures, improved resource sharing (e.g. data, processing) and potential system </p><p>improvements – all of which may imply changes in stakeholder and user interactions, the </p><p>role played by different professions, and the reduction of barriers to entry for new actors, </p><p>which further improves the openness and contestability of public services.  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>20 – 1.

These changes have affected how </p><p>governments are engaging with suppliers, including how new markets are nurtured, by </p><p>outlining the current and future roles in the eco-systems of welfare service delivery. </p><p>Boundary changes include framing and maturing current and future markets, and </p><p>maintaining competitiveness and competition.  </p><p></p><p>Third, the sharpened policy priorities also shed light on roles non-governmental </p><p>actors in general can play to support policy objectives. By building partnerships, </p><p>including with private business, the public sector can increase its capacity to promote </p><p>desired policy outcomes, functioning as an orienting platform. Fourth, the increasing </p><p>engagement and inclusion of users is changing the boundaries of frontline service </p><p>delivery, creating better targeted personal value added through co-production. </p><p></p><p>Each of these shifting areas suggests a different interface and/or channel for investing </p><p>in public value, and therefore an associated set of skills that could be identified. At the </p><p>top, public value is enhanced through senior civil servants’ policy advice to ministers, </p><p>based on evidence-based analysis conducted by their civil servants. Interfacing with </p><p>suppliers through contractual arrangements brings the idea of commissioning into focus, </p><p>along with a set of associated commercial skills required to becoming skilled buyers of </p><p>public value. Working directly with users requires a skill set linked to engagement, </p><p>facilitation and co-production. Working in partnership brings networked governance into </p><p>focus, prioritising a skill set related to coalition building, collaboration, boundary </p><p>spanning,1 and risk management. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>1.

Eight lessons about the future of the public service workforce  </p><p></p><p>As part of their programme of work on the future of the public service workforce, Drs. </p><p>Catherine Needham, Catherine Mangan (University of Birmingham) and Helen Dickinson </p><p>(University of Melbourne), conducted a search of the literature relating to the public service </p><p>workforce. This review explored academic and policy literature on public service change, and </p><p>examined how change is impacting people working in these services. The review outlines eight </p><p>lessons about the future of the public service workforce: </p><p></p><p>1. Future public services will require a different set of workforce roles than in the </p><p>past. Whilst professional skills remain important (also see lesson 3) public servants </p><p>increasingly have a role in negotiating and brokering interests among a broad array of </p><p>different groups. The public service workforce therefore requires a set of relational </p><p>skills which aid in forming shared values among a range of competing interests. Crucial </p><p>in this skill set is the ability to understand services from the citizen or consumer’s </p><p>perspective.  </p><p></p><p>2. Citizens are changing too. Citizens are less deferential than in the past and increasingly </p><p>have higher expectations of what public services should offer. Co-production is a central </p><p>plank of future public services and there are a diverse range of implications for this in </p><p>terms of the workforce. There are presently gaps in this respect not only in the skills </p><p>base of public servants, but also in the development opportunities available to hone </p><p>these skills and the time and space to practice within organisations.  </p><p></p><p>3. Generic skills will be as important as technical skills for future public servants. </p><p>This lesson is potentially controversial and does not argue that technical skills are not </p><p>needed. Technical skills are required and there are gaps often reported in these, </p><p>particularly in relation to contracting and data analysis. However, there are a set of </p><p>softer and less tangible skills that are becoming increasingly important in relation to </p><p>communication, digital literacy and person-oriented skills.  </p><p></p><p>4. Ethics and values are changing as the boundaries of public service shift. The public </p><p>sector ethos has been a common reference point in discussions about public service </p><p>reform for many years. Ethos captures the sense of an intrinsic motivation to service the </p><p>public, distinctive from extrinsic motivations such as material reward or fear of </p><p>sanctions. In a context of increased outsourcing, there is a question of whether public </p><p>sector ethos can survive. Better understanding the bundle of incentives that motivate </p><p>people to serve the public is part of the workforce challenge for 21st century public </p><p>services.  </p><p></p><p>5. Emotional labour will be a key element of future public service work. Many public </p><p>service roles are inherently emotionally demanding, and there is consensus emerging </p><p>over the need for resilient responses to this as a dimension of public service practice. </p><p>Research evidence suggests that emotions are important constituent components, not </p><p>just of the caring professions, but also in any roles that involve the spanning of </p><p>boundaries. If the future of public service roles is to involve greater boundary spanning, </p><p>then this is likely to become even more important to public servants.  </p><p></p><p>6. Permanent austerity is catalysing and inhibiting the emergence of new roles. </p><p>Recent UK literature has much to say about the impact of austerity on public service </p><p>workforces. The evidence suggests that in some places, austerity is severely inhibiting </p><p>the emergence of new roles, whilst in others, organisations are using this opportunity to </p><p>fundamentally transform their services. Understanding the contexts under which </p><p>successful transformation might take place within circumstances of fiscal constraint is </p><p>clearly an important task.  </p><p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>1.

Eight lessons about the future of the public service workforce (cont.) </p><p></p><p>7. Hero-leaders aren’t the answer. When leadership is spoken about in the media and in </p><p>literature it is often focused on individual heroes or heroic models of leadership. </p><p>However, the evidence suggests that there is a need for a new kind of public sector </p><p>leader to respond to the changing context, in which leadership beyond boundaries and </p><p>beyond spans of authority will become important. Rather than focusing on individuals it </p><p>is necessary to think about forms of distributed or dispersed leadership.  </p><p></p><p>8. Many professions are coming to these conclusions, but are tackling the issue </p><p>separately. A striking feature of the policy literature is that many different professions </p><p>are coming to the same conclusions, but there is little dialogue between service sectors </p><p>about how to share lessons and encourage staff to work across boundaries. Whilst these </p><p>individual conversations have immense value, there may be benefit from bringing </p><p>together these contributions and thinking about public service issues in a broader way. </p><p></p><p>Sources: Needham, C., C.

Taken together, these create a complex body </p><p>of principles intended to provide guideposts for effective governments and public </p><p>institutions. Each of these recommendations implies needs for certain groups of skills in </p><p>the civil service, in some more explicitly than others. For example: </p><p></p><p>• The recommendation on regulatory policy and governance presents regulatory </p><p>policy and governance as a whole-of-government activity integrated in the policy </p><p>cycle of regulatory design, enforcement, review and evaluation supported by </p><p>appropriate institutions. It emphasises the importance of co-ordination, </p><p>consultation communication and co-operation throughout the policy cycle. </p><p>Adhering to this recommendation will require civil servants with skill sets related </p><p>to a broad range of impact analysis, risk assessment, and strategic foresight to </p><p>conduct ex ante regulatory impact assessment and ex post evaluation; as well as </p><p>communication and engagement skills to build buy in and clarify policy </p><p>challenges (OECD, 2012a).  </p><p></p><p>• The recommendation on principles for public governance of public-private </p><p>partnerships (PPPs) covers the governance pre-conditions for the successful use </p><p>of PPPs regarding the institutional framework and the skills and competence of </p><p>the relevant authorities; how to assess, select and manage PPPs to boost value for </p><p>money; and the use of the regular budget process to minimise fiscal risks and </p><p>create long-term sustainability. The recommendation makes direct reference to the </p><p>need for in-depth financial, legal, economic and project management skills. Skills </p><p>alluded to include assessment of value for money, risk management, commercial, </p><p>contract management and commissioning skills (OECD, 2012b).  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>24 – 1. PUBLIC SECTOR SKILLS IN THE SEARCH FOR PUBLIC VALUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>• The recommendation on the governance of critical risks promotes a </p><p>comprehensive, all-hazards and transboundary approach to country risk </p><p>governance to serve as the foundation for enhancing national resilience and </p><p>responsiveness. The principles of this recommendation suggest a highly </p><p>responsive networked governance with the foresight needed to minimise the </p><p>negative impacts of risk and hazard. This implies skill sets related to broad </p><p>engagement and network management, top down and collaborative leadership, </p><p>data foresight and evidence analysis (OECD, 2014a). </p><p></p><p>• The recommendation on effective public investment across levels of </p><p>government offers a whole-of-government approach that addresses the roles of </p><p>different levels of government in the design and implementation of public </p><p>investment, contributing to both national and sub-national development and long-</p><p>term growth. Skill sets implied to adhere to this recommendation include </p><p>assessment of risk and uncertainty, negotiation and co-ordination, community </p><p>engagement and network management. Section 7 of the recommendation </p><p>explicitly calls for effective human resource management (HRM), knowledge </p><p>development, relationship management, and a specific focus on capacity at sub-</p><p>national levels where, in some cases, professional skills may be lacking (OECD, </p><p>2014b). </p><p></p><p>• The recommendation on budgetary governance gives countries guidance for </p><p>designing, implementing and improving budget systems to meet the challenges of </p><p>the future. The overall intention is to provide a reference tool for policy makers </p><p>and practitioners involved in the budget process, and help ensure public resources </p><p>are planned, managed and used effectively to make a positive impact on citizens’ </p><p>lives. It explicitly recommends promoting the integrity and quality of budget </p><p>forecasts, fiscal plans and budgetary implementation through various activities, </p><p>including continuous investment in the skills and capacity of staff to perform their </p><p>roles effectively. These include a range of deep financial analyses, such as </p><p>performance assessment, value for money, financial risk, forecasting and foresight </p><p>(OECD, 2014c).  </p><p></p><p>• The recommendation on public procurement reaffirms the role of public </p><p>procurement as a strategic function and provides clear and effective guidance on </p><p>how to implement a public procurement system that employs state-of-the-art tools </p><p>and techniques to apply public funds sustainably and efficiently. It explicitly </p><p>recommends the development of a procurement workforce with the capacity to </p><p>continually deliver value for money efficiently and effectively. This includes </p><p>professional standards, attractive and competitive merit-based career options for </p><p>procurement officials, and promoting collaborative approaches with other </p><p>knowledge centres to improve skills and competencies (OECD, 2015).  </p><p></p><p>• The recommendation on digital government strategies helps governments </p><p>adopt more strategic approaches for a use of technology that spurs more open, </p><p>participatory and innovative governments. It posits that values of transparency </p><p>and citizen engagement need to be explicitly built into how ICT is deployed, </p><p>which requires a basic understanding of digital opportunities and challenges. The </p><p>recommendation underscores the need to rethink the concept of traditional civil </p><p>service skills in light of the digital transformation. It calls for the creation of a </p><p>data driven culture in the public sector and for the reinforcement of institutional </p><p>capacities by investing in digital and project management skills (OECD, 2014d).  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>1. PUBLIC SECTOR SKILLS IN THE SEARCH FOR PUBLIC VALUE – 25 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>• The recommendation on public integrity provides a new strategic approach for </p><p>countries to move away from distinct frameworks and develop a coherent </p><p>integrity system for the public sector that integrates related policies and practices </p><p>in a mutually supportive way. Thirteen principles are organised in three pillars: 1) </p><p>building a coherent and comprehensive public integrity system; 2) cultivating a </p><p>culture of public integrity; and 3) enabling accountability and transparency. This </p><p>recommendation highlights the need for: skills related to values-based ethical </p><p>leadership; skills concerning the exercise of appropriate judgement in matters </p><p>where public integrity issues may be involved; and information, training, </p><p>guidance and timely advice for public officials to apply public integrity standards </p><p>in the workplace (OECD, 2017c). </p><p></p><p>• The draft OECD recommendation on open government recognises that open </p><p>government principles are progressively changing the relationship between public </p><p>officials and citizens in many countries, making it more dynamic, mutually </p><p>beneficial and based on reciprocal trust. The recommendation will aim to provide </p><p>a comprehensive overview of the main tenets of the governance of open </p><p>government strategies and initiatives in order to help countries improve their </p><p>implementation of open government strategies and initiatives and their impact on </p><p>peoples’ lives. This recommendation calls for adequate human, financial, and </p><p>technical resources, together with adequate professional incentives and the </p><p>required skills to design and implement successful open government strategies </p><p>and initiatives, while promoting a supportive organisational culture (OECD, </p><p>forthcoming-c). </p><p></p><p>Taken together, this rich body of normative agreements begins to establish a series of </p><p>common competencies required of civil servants. Cross-cutting themes that emerge </p><p>include financial analysis, forecasting and foresight, cross sectorial co-ordination and </p><p>collaboration, citizen/third sector engagement, commercial skills, and project </p><p>management - all of which are within the context of public service ethos and values.  </p><p></p><p>Not all civil servants will need to be experts in PPPs, regulatory policy, risk </p><p>governance and digital transformation, but it is expected that almost all government </p><p>organisations will need some level of competence in all of these areas, and that most civil </p><p>servants will need some awareness of the concepts and be fluent in the language of their </p><p>guiding principles. This leads to questions regarding the kinds of skills that exist and that </p><p>should be prioritised in civil service workforce development, as well as how these skills </p><p>are organised and managed, whether centrally or dispersed.  </p><p></p><p>Skills, competencies and capability: Some considerations </p><p></p><p>Despite the broad use of the concept of “skill” in OECD, academic and governance </p><p>literature, there is no universally agreed definition. At its most basic, a skill is an ability to </p><p>do something acquired through training and/or experience. Although most people </p><p>probably have a sense of the word, there is a debate about how wide the definition should </p><p>be applied. Should it include only measurable, observable skills, or also qualities related </p><p>to personality and mindset? This can have policy implications related to, for example, the </p><p>ability to teach and develop some skills, versus behavioural traits which may appear to be </p><p>harder to teach.  </p><p></p><p>Another challenge to the concept of skills is to define not only the what, but also the </p><p>how. Moving from simple abilities (typing, reading) to the way these are combined to </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>26 – 1. PUBLIC SECTOR SKILLS IN THE SEARCH FOR PUBLIC VALUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>achieve impact in a job setting means moving from skills into competency. For the </p><p>purposes of this report, the concept of skill includes competency, as the focus is on the </p><p>essential attributes of employees (knowledge, skill, behaviour, mindset, etc.) required to </p><p>achieve outcomes in the public sector/civil service context.  </p><p></p><p>A further discussion around skills regards their contextual nature. Workplace skills </p><p>exist in a workplace and are only useful when they interact with the tools, people and </p><p>culture of that workplace. This is certainly the case when thinking about impact – skills </p><p>alone will not translate into capacity and capability at an organisational level – only when </p><p>they are combined and used effectively (competency) within an organisational context </p><p>(team, resources, tools, etc.) that allow them to be mobilised.  </p><p></p><p>Another related factor is motivation, which also brings values into focus. Values are </p><p>“goals or criteria that we use to determine the desirability of certain actions of motives in </p><p>our lives” (Lyons, Duxbury, & Higgins, 2006, p. 605). The existence of public service </p><p>motivation suggests individuals who choose careers in the public sector do so because </p><p>they value the public interest and are motivated to contribute to social change and shape </p><p>policies that improve society. A recent OECD report shows how values congruence </p><p>(between employee and employer) and values-based leadership and management </p><p>contribute to employee engagement, which in turn contributes to performance, </p><p>productivity and innovation in public organisations (OECD, 2016d).  </p><p></p><p>Wu, Ramesh and Howlette (2015) present a useful model for contextualising policy-</p><p>related skills within broader organisational and systems perspectives. Using the example </p><p>of policy analysis in public agencies, they argue that consideration is required at three </p><p>levels: </p><p></p><p>1. Individual: what governments will be able to do depends first on whether they </p><p>have people with the skills required to analyse problems and consider solutions. </p><p>(This is the focus of this report.)  </p><p></p><p>2. Organisational: in order for people with these skills to accomplish their tasks, they </p><p>need resources provided to them by organisational systems. This could include, </p><p>for example, information and data management systems and the availability of </p><p>other ICT resources and tools.  </p><p></p><p>3. The system level: the organisation itself sits within a wider system. To follow the </p><p>policy analysis example, capacity can depend on how information and knowledge </p><p>is generated, shared and mobilised among public and private organisations.  </p><p></p><p>Much of the work to date on public governance has been done at the second and third </p><p>level of this analysis. Taking the recommendations outlined above as an example, the </p><p>principles focus mainly on the organisational process and system-level preconditions for </p><p>success. While most recognise the need for skilled employees, the human resources </p><p>recruitment and development implications tend to remain vague. This report begins to </p><p>address this gap. </p><p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>1.

Future competencies  </p><p></p><p>The OECD’s 2011 report, “Public Servants as Partners for Growth” discusses how </p><p>employees’ competencies and the integration of human resource (HR) policies and practices </p><p>with business strategies play a central role in sustained competitive advantage and suggests that </p><p>countries are witnessing a shift from “people as workforce to people as competitive force” </p><p>(Prastacos et al., 2002: 67). Strategic thinking, innovation, creativity and business sense are </p><p>absolute requirements for succeeding in almost any kind of job, and that drives the need to </p><p>define and develop new competencies. Any changing policy environment has a significant </p><p>impact on both the public service workforce and the range of skills it needs for the future.  </p><p></p><p>The report highlights the future competencies governments have identified to face the </p><p>challenges of the 21st century. The sources of these competencies are speeches and statements </p><p>from politicians and senior officials, policy notes, reports on the civil service, annual reports, and </p><p>local experts’ perceptions. Based on these lists, eight “key” future competencies clustered into </p><p>four meta-competencies are identified:  </p><p></p><p>• creative thinking (creativity and innovation) </p><p></p><p>• flexibility (flexibility and change management) </p><p></p><p>• co-operation (work collaboratively across boundaries and relationship building) </p><p></p><p>• strategic thinking (vision and future orientation). </p><p>Sources: OECD (2011), Public Servants as Partners for Growth: Towards a Stronger, Leaner and More </p><p>Equitable Workforce, OECD Publishing, Paris, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264166707-en.  </p><p></p><p>Prastacos, G.P., K.E.

A professional civil </p><p>service emphasises transparent, fair and merit-based management to ensure integrity and </p><p>capacity. This is considered to be fundamental and foundational. The strategic view </p><p>emphasises forward-looking planning, data to understand current capacity, and agility to </p><p>ensure human resources can be allocated efficiently to areas of high and emerging need. </p><p>A third layer, innovative HRM, looks at mechanisms to harness the creative potential of </p><p>knowledge workers in the public sector to contribute new ideas and make innovation </p><p>happen.

Civil servants in a professional civil service </p><p>are expected to be qualified, independent of political influence, values-driven and ethical. </p><p>Skills in a professional civil service may be thought of as the basic building blocks of </p><p>each of the various professions that make up a civil service. In most countries, these may </p><p>traditionally include various combinations of professionals, such as economists, lawyers, </p><p>statisticians, political scientists, policy experts, and communications specialists. More </p><p>recently, civil services may also emphasise professional skills, such as ICT, data science, </p><p>design, STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), HRM, project </p><p>management, and acquisitions/procurement. Each of these would have the associated </p><p>training, experience and body of knowledge. These skills can be taught in universities </p><p>and/or acquired in previous positions.  </p><p></p><p>If professional skills are the building blocks of an independent, values-based and </p><p>capable civil service, then strategic skills are those that enable professionals to create </p><p>impact and improve public value for their citizens and clients. Strategic skills emphasise </p><p>future-oriented and evidence-based problem solving, often by collaborating across </p><p>professional skills and competencies. They suggest skills related to risk management, </p><p>foresight and resilience. Strategic civil servants must be networked and able and ready to </p><p>draw on a range of research, insight and experience beyond their own immediate </p><p>workplace to inform policy ideas and service delivery outcomes.  </p><p></p><p>Moving to innovation skills requires looking at how civil servants approach their day-</p><p>to-day work, and their capacities to redesign the tools of governance to develop novel </p><p></p><p>Innovative</p><p>Networks</p><p>Learning culture</p><p>Risk acceptance</p><p>Employee/work engagement</p><p>Workplace quality/wellbeing</p><p></p><p>Strategic</p><p>HR strategy and planning</p><p>Workforce data</p><p>Agile and flexible</p><p>Competency management</p><p></p><p>Professional</p><p>Merit-based</p><p>Open and fair</p><p>Performance orientated</p><p>Diverse and inclusive</p><p></p><p>LAW</p><p>INSTITUTIONS</p><p>LEADERSHIP</p><p></p><p>Does your workforce contribute to </p><p>and drive performance through </p><p>innovation and continuous </p><p>improvement?</p><p></p><p>Are the right people with the right </p><p>skills working in the right place at </p><p>the right time to deliver results as </p><p>efficiently as possible?</p><p></p><p>Is the workforce professional and </p><p>managed through fair, transparent </p><p>and consistent practices?

The OECD’s Observatory for </p><p>Public Sector Innovation has defined six skills areas needed in public sector organisations </p><p>to drive more innovation (Figure 1.5). The first three are of a technical nature. Innovative </p><p>civil servants need skills to approach their work in iterative ways that generate learning </p><p>and adaptation over short periods of time. They need some data skills in order to be aware </p><p>of the potential of data and how to structure projects that can collect and use data to </p><p>inform and drive change. They need skills to be citizen-centred and to use a broad set of </p><p>tools and methods to interact with their stakeholders and direct beneficiaries to </p><p>understand their reality and design a service that meets their needs. The next three skills </p><p>areas are of a cognitive/behavioural nature. Innovative civil servants need to be: curious </p><p>in order to search out opportunities to expand their own knowledge and understanding; </p><p>storytellers, ready to leverage a range of tools to communicate with various stakeholders </p><p>in ways that they can understand and engage with; and insurgents capable of effecting </p><p>change in the systems within which they work, able to know when to push, how to </p><p>negotiate, fight and/or compromise.

PUBLIC SECTOR SKILLS IN THE SEARCH FOR PUBLIC VALUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>Towards a framework for skills in the civil service </p><p></p><p>The axes of change described above: increasingly wicked, multi-dimensional </p><p>problems; increasingly pluralistic and interconnected societies; and the changing/blurred </p><p>boundaries of the public sector (increasingly open and networked governance), leads to </p><p>the question of what skills are required in governments today to maximise public value </p><p>and meet the high expectations presented by the recommendations of the OECD Council.  </p><p></p><p>One way to approach this question is to look at how public value is created and </p><p>consider the skills implied. Following the changing boundaries of the public sector as </p><p>described in Figure 1.1, public value can be created through four main channels: policy </p><p>development in the political sphere, service delivery directly to and with citizens, </p><p>commissioned delivery through contracted suppliers, and delivery through collaborative </p><p>partnerships and networks. Each of these may suggest different, although complementary </p><p>and overlapping, bundles of skills:  </p><p></p><p>• Policy advisory skills: leveraging technology and synthesising a growing range </p><p>of evidence-based scientific insights (e.g. behavioural economics, data science, </p><p>strategic foresight) and a diversity of citizen perspectives for effective and timely </p><p>policy advice to political decision makers. </p><p></p><p>• Engagement skills: working directly with citizens and users of government </p><p>services to improve service experience, legitimacy and impact by leveraging the </p><p>“wisdom of the crowd” to co-create better solutions that take into account service </p><p>users’ needs and limitations. </p><p></p><p>• Commissioning skills: designing and overseeing various contractual </p><p>arrangements (outsourcing, PPPs, service level agreements, etc.) and managing </p><p>projects to achieve impact through organisations (public, private, not-for-profit) </p><p>that are best placed to deliver services due to their expertise and/or local position.  </p><p></p><p>• Network management skills: collaborating with a range of independent partners </p><p>to address complex/wicked policy challenges by developing a shared </p><p>understanding of the problem, collectively identifying potential solutions and co-</p><p>implementation. If money and legal contracts are the currency of supplier </p><p>management, communication trust and mutual commitment is the currency of </p><p>network management.  </p><p></p><p>These four areas are combined into a framework model displayed in Figure 1.6, in </p><p>which skills-driven network interactions deliver public value. Policy making and policy </p><p>skills are at the top of the triangle and represent the moment an issue makes it onto the </p><p>political agenda and some level of decision is taken regarding the best course of action to </p><p>address the issue. This course of action is represented by the continuum along the lower </p><p>bar of the triangle, which may include direct delivery to the citizen (right side), or a </p><p>contractual relationship with a third party delivery organisation (left side). Between the </p><p>two is a zone of networked governance, which represents a variety of multi-organisational </p><p>arrangements in which the government plays a partnership and/or platform role to </p><p>advance a common agenda and build public value. Each of the four skills groups are </p><p>discussed in the next sections. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>1.

Such analysis should, it has always </p><p>been thought, be done with scientific objectivity, with a view to identifying the trade-offs </p><p>among policy tools and options (e.g. regulation, spending programmes) and isolating an </p><p>optimal choice. This requires a multidisciplinary skill set to draw evidence and data from </p><p>a wide range of scientific and technical fields, including economics, sociology, </p><p>environmental sciences, law and engineering.  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>32 – 1. PUBLIC SECTOR SKILLS IN THE SEARCH FOR PUBLIC VALUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>The traditional policy cycle approach would expect time to competently research and </p><p>analyse a policy problem, design a policy through long chains of consultation and </p><p>approval processes, implement the policy, and then wait for years to run an evaluation </p><p>and determine whether the policy has achieved its goals. Each of these functions would </p><p>be carried out by separate people, with specialised skills in each of these areas. This not </p><p>only leads to a process which can, in many cases, no longer keep pace with the changing </p><p>speed of society, but it has also led to significant disconnects that have hindered good </p><p>policy making due to gaps between evidence, policy and implementation. </p><p></p><p>Kingdon (1984) suggests policy making is not a linear cycle, but results from an </p><p>alignment between problems, available solutions and actors that come together at </p><p>particular moments to make policies politically viable. These factors, detailed below, may </p><p>help to provide a structure to map the kinds of skills required of civil servants who advise </p><p>ministers and decision makers in policy matters.  </p><p></p><p>• Problems: (diagnostic skills) detecting and understanding the root causes of </p><p>complex policy problems requires analytical skills that can synthesise multiple </p><p>disciplines and/or perspectives into a single narrative.  </p><p></p><p>• Solutions: (design skills) civil servants need an understanding and awareness of a </p><p>wider range of policy solutions. Traditionally this would include the main policy </p><p>instruments of government: regulation, taxation, and spending. </p><p></p><p>• Political timing: policy advice is inherently political and although civil servants </p><p>in most countries espouse political neutrality as a core value, they cannot be tone </p><p>deaf to the tune of politics. Policy windows open at moments in political cycles, </p><p>or as the result of shifts in public opinion and perception. This requires skills </p><p>related to timing, and designing policy proposals in a way that responds to the </p><p>needs of the moment. </p><p></p><p>New Zealand has recently brought together policy professionals to develop a common </p><p>framework showing the kinds of policy skills required today in its civil service (Box 1.5). </p><p></p><p>Box 1.5. New Zealand policy skills project </p><p></p><p>The Policy Skills Framework (PSF) is a common description of the knowledge, skills and </p><p>behaviours required of the modern policy professional. Rather than focusing on competencies, </p><p>the framework outlines the mix of skills policy that practitioners need. It allows for varying </p><p>levels of experience in each component (from developing to expert/leading), acknowledging that </p><p>individuals have different strengths (skills breadth and depth). </p><p></p><p>On the demand side, the skills framework will help policy managers articulate the skills mix </p><p>they require when recruiting, and help them to map the overall skills profile of their teams and </p><p>any gaps and overlaps.  </p><p></p><p>It also provides the foundation for the senior policy community to agree on levels </p><p>(developing, practicing, expert/leading) for each component in the skills framework and </p><p>expectations for key levels of the policy workforce (analyst, senior analyst, principal analyst and </p><p>beyond). It could enable a more collective approach to training (both formal and on-the-job). </p><p></p><p>The PSF has the potential to support and signal diverse policy career pathways. It provides a </p><p>platform for a future articulation of “policy archetype” – deep analytical expert, engagement </p><p>specialist, policy innovator/entrepreneur – reflecting the growing consensus that the policy </p><p>community requires diversity, not a one-size-fits-all conception of the policy analyst/advisor </p><p>role.  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>1.

Charting all of these changes is not simple, partly due to the fact policy analysis </p><p>draws from so many disciplines, which makes it challenging to define a policy </p><p>“profession” with clearly defined and specialised knowledge and expertise.  </p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the field of policy advice appears to be increasingly diverse and </p><p>competitive. Current OECD research on policy advisory systems (OECD forthcoming-d) </p><p>underlines the broad skill set that is needed to develop policy advice. In this context, </p><p>governments often rely on either permanent or ad hoc policy advisory bodies, which are </p><p>operating at arms’ length from core government departments, to help frame policy </p><p>options. These bodies offer an opportunity for greater inclusiveness and for engaging with </p><p>a range of either political parties or social and economic partners. These publicly-</p><p>mandated advisory bodies operate themselves in a full and open context, where other </p><p>think tanks, academia and various research institutes can also be active.  </p><p></p><p>The civil service often provides the secretariat for such bodies, which can still benefit </p><p>from greater input and a varied membership. This work is often complementary and </p><p>upstream, compared to the more direct and downstream policy advice function of policy </p><p>advisors operating within government departments or in ministers’ cabinets. The fact the </p><p>civil service is operating in a broader, more open and diverse context than in the past may </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>34 – 1. PUBLIC SECTOR SKILLS IN THE SEARCH FOR PUBLIC VALUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>have led to some questioning the central function of the civil service in terms of its </p><p>privileged position as a supplier of policy advice. In a context of open data, diverse and </p><p>inclusive societies, this may imply that developing policy advice can no longer be a </p><p>monologue within the civil service that is behind the doors of government departments. </p><p>While the policy advisory skills of the civil service remain essential, they have to operate </p><p>in a more dynamic and open environment, where civil servants are plugged in to broader </p><p>policy communities and networks in order to understand the most recent research and </p><p>arguments being developed, where they come from, and the political agendas of those </p><p>responsible for their development. The capacity to exert influence will also be connected </p><p>to the capacity to listen and integrate a set of various voices in the context of policy </p><p>design.  </p><p></p><p>Returning to Kingdon’s three streams, technology and openness influence the kinds </p><p>of policy skills required to understand problems, design solutions and be politically </p><p>proficient.   </p><p></p><p>• Problems: (diagnostic skills) Pluralistic societies interpret policy situations </p><p>differently and demand that problem definition no longer be undertaken in a </p><p>closed environment by experts. Opening up policy making means problems are </p><p>often raised to the attention of civil servants by citizens and politicians. However, </p><p>initial problem statements often require refocusing and reframing through, for </p><p>example, an exploration of data, consultations and discussions with multiple </p><p>stakeholders, horizon scanning, scenario development and other tools. One of the </p><p>most important steps in all cases is to identify the right stakeholders and the right </p><p>experts. This requires civil servants who are networked into broader policy </p><p>communities beyond their own civil services. The digital transformation provides </p><p>opportunities to understand the complex interactions of the policy sphere as never </p><p>before through, for example, bigger and more interlinked data sets and </p><p>opportunities to engage the public and crowdsource insights. This suggests skill </p><p>sets related to data science, network analysis, social networking and social media, </p><p>crowdsourcing and foresight techniques, in addition to more traditional methods </p><p>of analysis, forecasting, and community outreach and consultation. </p><p></p><p>• Solutions: (design skills) Traditional cost benefit analysis quickly finds its limits </p><p>in an open society which contests many of its basic assumptions (e.g. the financial </p><p>value of life, the environment, forecasting accuracy). Today’s policy advisers </p><p>need an understanding of what has worked well in the recent past and how these </p><p>successes can be adapted and scaled to current problems, while responding to the </p><p>local context. They need skills to design solutions informed by advances in </p><p>behavioural economics, social finance, sociology and ethnography, and the range </p><p>of services delivered through networks of actors. Civil servants need foresight </p><p>skills to understand potential future scenarios to find solutions that are future </p><p>proof, i.e. resilient to future uncertainties and sustainable over time. They need </p><p>systems and design thinking to understand the interactions among the various </p><p>actors (third party service delivery organisations, other levels of government etc.) </p><p>and tools to influence their roles in solution creation and implementation when </p><p>governments don’t manage an entire service production system. This includes an </p><p>understanding of the range of online methods available for delivery solutions, and </p><p>the skills needed to measure success and adjust along the way. They also need to </p><p>move from being sector experts to being able to confront and blend different </p><p>sector expertise. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>1. PUBLIC SECTOR SKILLS IN THE SEARCH FOR PUBLIC VALUE – 35 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>• Political: Balancing the often short-term and urgent needs of politicians for policy </p><p>solutions with the democratic and evidence-based values and capacity of the civil </p><p>service is a long-standing challenge that is becoming more difficult given the </p><p>speed at which politics progresses. Civil servants need skills to understand the </p><p>timing of how to deliver analysis in a quick and agile way that responds to the </p><p>needs of the moment. It also means recognising and managing risk and </p><p>uncertainty. Similarly, the tools for communicating policy ideas to elected </p><p>officials have significantly advanced to enable more compelling visual </p><p>presentations and storytelling.  </p><p></p><p>The United Kingdom is working on a project to professionalise its policy function, </p><p>and has developed three clusters of skills and capabilities it wishes to reinforce through </p><p>learning in order to define career paths for policy professionals. The three groups reflect </p><p>roughly those mentioned above: analysis and use of evidence, politics and democracy, </p><p>and policy delivery (Box 1.6). </p><p></p><p>Box 1.6.

While not an exhaustive list, some ideas are found in Table 1.1 </p><p>below. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>36 – 1. PUBLIC SECTOR SKILLS IN THE SEARCH FOR PUBLIC VALUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>Table 1.1.

Policy </p><p></p><p>advisory systems extend far beyond the public ministry charged with overseeing the </p><p>policy field to include a range of actors specialising in specific fields with their own sets </p><p>of values and agendas. In some cases, the public sector may appear to play a diminished </p><p>role in policy advice, and may be in competition with these other actors. The case for </p><p>investing in policy-making capacity in civil services depends on the kinds of challenges a </p><p>country faces, the extent to which it has invested previously in the analytical capacity of </p><p>its civil service, and the system of governance. Some of the advantages offered by civil </p><p>servants are as follows: </p><p></p><p>• Focus on the public good and the public sector ethos: many in the policy </p><p>profession outside government have a particular ideological perspective on policy </p><p>development, or exist to promote the advancement of certain groups. As much as </p><p>possible, independent and professional civil services provide evidence-based </p><p>advice in the interests of the public good, finding the balance between different </p><p>interests and voices. This serves to build public trust in government and in </p><p>government policies.  </p><p></p><p>• Accountability and integrity: public sector organisations are generally held to a </p><p>higher standard of transparency, accountability and integrity than private sector or </p><p>not for profit organisations, with a clear statement of values and commitment to </p><p>defensible policy analysis.  </p><p></p><p>• Longer-term horizon: while many policy players will be motivated to propose </p><p>policies that fit the government of the day, it is the civil service’s responsibility to </p><p>implement the policies on a sustainable basis, and it should therefore have an </p><p>intrinsic motivation to ensure long-term implications and sustainability are </p><p>properly considered. Similarly, a civil service represents a wealth of institutional </p><p>memory that can be leveraged to design policies that take into account lessons </p><p>from earlier administrations. </p><p></p><p>• Understanding of delivery and implementation: many policy advisors see their </p><p>job as ending the moment a law is passed or a policy announced. The </p><p>implementation experience developed within the civil service represents an added </p><p>value that can be used to design policies that can be implemented on time and on </p><p>budget. </p><p></p><p>• Ownership of data: governments and the public sector have the potential to </p><p>collect a huge amount of data that can be mobilised to inform policy and service </p><p>design. With the movement towards open data, this is increasingly being made </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>1. PUBLIC SECTOR SKILLS IN THE SEARCH FOR PUBLIC VALUE – 37 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>accessible to others, but the ability to choose which data is collected in the first </p><p>place remains a core civil service function.  </p><p></p><p>• Presence and size: governments have extensive reach into communities across a </p><p>country, and can therefore be “on the ground” and connected to the realities faced </p><p>by citizens. This means the potential for a broader range of research methods, and </p><p>the ability to understand variation across geographic regions. This implies a need </p><p>to network across levels of government. </p><p></p><p>Skills for citizen engagement and service delivery  </p><p></p><p>What are the skills? </p><p>Engaging with citizens has long been undertaken by governments in one form or </p><p></p><p>another at various stages of policy and service development. It is also a common </p><p>component of almost every recommendation the OECD Council has developed related to </p><p>public governance. Input from citizens can help to design better and more cost-effective </p><p>policies, as well as build the community ownership for policy and service solutions </p><p>required to ensure sustainable impact over a long term.   </p><p></p><p>The quality of interaction with citizens varies, depending on the purpose. Government </p><p>employees who interact regularly with citizens to provide services require service skills. </p><p>These employees are physical ambassadors of the state and their service competency can </p><p>have a direct impact on the perception that citizens have of their government, including </p><p>their trust in public institutions and services (Heintzman & Mason, 2005).  </p><p></p><p>Employees involved in service management, design and/or policy making require </p><p>skill sets that enable input from citizens into these processes. This is often represented as </p><p>a spectrum, from informing at one end, to collaborating (making decisions together) at the </p><p>other, for example (OECD, 2016c). Each of these may imply a different set of tools and </p><p>skills that emphasise different combinations of communication, consultation, outreach </p><p>and facilitation. Part of the challenge includes knowing which tools to apply to which </p><p>situations, and an awareness of which voices to engage in the process and how to avoid </p><p>such processes being captured by organised interest and pressure groups. </p><p></p><p>How are these skills changing? </p><p>While service delivery, communication, consultation and engagement have long been </p><p></p><p>part of the government toolkit, three trends are changing the skills required. The first is an </p><p>increasingly complex service delivery landscape in many countries. The second is </p><p>technological change which results in new channels and tools for engagement. The third </p><p>is the push for more open and innovative government, which means civil services are </p><p>expected to incorporate meaningful input and participation at a greater number of stages </p><p>of the policy/service design process. </p><p></p><p>The complexity of public service delivery has grown in most countries as the </p><p>channels for service delivery increase and services are increasingly delivered by networks </p><p>of agents who may or may not be directly employed by the government. In many ways, </p><p>client-facing employees are required not only to provide services, but also to help citizens </p><p>to find their way through these complex service systems to get the help and service they </p><p>need. This means client-facing public employees need to be more than transactional, and </p><p>also need to act as guides or pathfinders to help citizens navigate complex webs of </p><p>services, entitlements, benefits and eligibility requirements.  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>38 – 1. PUBLIC SECTOR SKILLS IN THE SEARCH FOR PUBLIC VALUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>Client-facing employees have a direct impact on the quality of the service experience </p><p>and, by extension, overall trust in government services. However, to serve well requires a </p><p>detailed knowledge and awareness of the community and the government – skill sets </p><p>which are not always easy to find or to develop. This implies a need for high-level </p><p>communication skills, empathy and reflection, as well as a level of discretion and </p><p>empowerment to resolve issues. In some governments, frontline positions are considered </p><p>entry-level or even outsourced to private service providers. The risk is that citizens will </p><p>quickly discover the limits of the information and knowledge possessed by these </p><p>employees, resulting in an inadequate service experience. </p><p></p><p>When Service Canada was established as a cross-governmental portal for government </p><p>services, it recognised that effective HRM and the development of a service excellence </p><p>culture was essential for achieving its ambitious goal of transforming service orientation </p><p>towards a citizen-centred rather than programme-centred service. This was achieved </p><p>through training initiatives and a career development programme in service excellence </p><p>co-ordinated through the Service Canada College, the inclusion of service excellence as a </p><p>competency for employees, and awards to recognise service excellence among </p><p>employees. (Flumian, Kernaghan, & Coe, 2007) </p><p></p><p>The digital transformation in governments is resulting in an ever increasing number </p><p>of ways in which civil servants can interact with citizens to identify problems and design </p><p>better policy and service solutions. Social media can allow governments to crowdsource </p><p>ideas from citizens and can provide platforms for policy discussions and debates to </p><p>overcome geographical and time-related barriers. Managing social media is a particular </p><p>skill set that is not usually combined with policy expertise, and that requires a new and </p><p>constantly updated skill set to maximise potential. However, most OECD countries have </p><p>not developed strategies or plans to develop social media skills (Mickoleit, 2014).  </p><p></p><p>User centricity is also a recognised ingredient of public sector innovation, as </p><p>highlighted in the innovation skills annexed to this report. At its most basic, this means </p><p>designing policies and services with a specific end user in mind and actively working to </p><p>understand how the intervention will positively impact their lives. Human-centred design </p><p>principles emphasise how people interact with systems and processes, while behavioural </p><p>science can help to analyse the way people think and respond to different situations. The </p><p>OECD has compiled 112 case studies of the use of behavioural insights from around the </p><p>world, and conducted a survey which shows only 45% of institutions involved in </p><p>behavioural insights employ behavioural scientists and/or experts (OECD, 2017d).  </p><p></p><p>To develop effective user-centred services and policies, officials must adopt </p><p>participative approaches that involve users throughout the life of the project. This may be </p><p>as simple as undertaking user research at different stages (to identify needs and test </p><p>prototypes, alpha, beta, and live versions) through to deep participatory exercises such as </p><p>the co-production of a policy or service which aims to foster a sense of joint ownership </p><p>between officials and users. Specific skills in this regard involve facilitation and design </p><p>skills, ethnographic research skills, and online consultation and engagement skills.  </p><p></p><p>Applying the professional, strategic and innovation lenses described above, </p><p>professional skills provide a foundation for service and engagement, strategic skills are </p><p>mobilised to ensure these skills are used to achieve results, and skill sets related to </p><p>innovation in the public sector help to rethink the tools and processes of interactions with </p><p>citizens. While not an exhaustive list, some ideas are found in Table 1.2 below. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>1. PUBLIC SECTOR SKILLS IN THE SEARCH FOR PUBLIC VALUE – 39 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>Table 1.2. Skills for citizen engagement and service delivery </p><p></p><p>Professional  Traditional building blocks of service and engagement skills include professionals with expertise in public </p><p>relations, communications, marketing, consultation, facilitation, service delivery, conflict resolution, </p><p>community development, outreach etc.  </p><p></p><p>Strategic  Using engagement skills to achieve specific outcomes to inform, for example, better targeted interventions, </p><p>or nudging public behaviour towards desirable outcomes, such as healthier eating habits or smoking </p><p>reduction. </p><p></p><p>Innovative Innovation skills applied to engagement to expand and redesign the tools themselves through, for example, </p><p>co-creation, prototyping, social media, crowdsourcing, challenge prizes, ethnography, opinion research and </p><p>data, branding, behavioural insights/nudging, digital service environments and user data analytics. </p><p></p><p>Why should governments invest in these skills? </p><p>Bringing insights from the public into the design of better policies and services is one </p><p></p><p>of the main challenges facing public servants in today’s modern governance environment. </p><p>In 2010, the OECD conducted a study on the co-production of public services and found </p><p>that developing the knowledge and skills of government in this work is a key success </p><p>factor. Conversely, a lack of knowledge and skills in this area was among the most </p><p>commonly identified barriers. Similar findings re-emerged in 2016 from the survey </p><p>conducted on open government (OECD, 2016c): the skills knowledge and abilities of </p><p>civil servants were consistently rated among the highest barriers countries faced in </p><p>meeting their open government objectives. The digital government agenda has provided a </p><p>renewed focus on the potential for putting citizens at the centre of service design. </p><p></p><p>Engaging with citizens is not something that can be easily outsourced, as meaningful </p><p>insights generally come from the quality of the interaction between designers, decision </p><p>makers and service users. As governments find themselves under increasing pressure to </p><p>be open to new ideas and innovation, public employees who may have previously worked </p><p>primarily behind closed doors will find themselves increasingly interacting with an </p><p>informed and demanding public. Handing over the engagement work to private </p><p>consultants may reduce the impact of the engagement activities by reducing the </p><p>interaction between citizens and government, while also opening up more potential for </p><p>capture by particularly well-organised interest groups. </p><p></p><p>Skills for commissioning and contracting services </p><p></p><p>What are the skills? </p><p>Increasingly, civil services establish contractual relationships with third party service </p><p></p><p>providers to deliver services to citizens on their behalf. This can take many forms, from </p><p>service contracts, grants to non-profits, social impact bonds, and PPPs. The OECD </p><p>recognises the importance of providing guidelines for managing these relationships in the </p><p>form of the recommendation on public procurement and PPPs. Expectations are that civil </p><p>servants will be able to conduct complex impact assessments, cost benefit analysis, risk </p><p>management, forecasting and foresight, and assess value for money.  </p><p></p><p>This implies a range of commercial, legal and regulatory skills that go far beyond </p><p>most countries’ expectations of traditional procurement agents. They include knowledge </p><p>of markets and the ways firms operate, how to design and manage contractual </p><p>relationships in a way that provides value to all parties (and especially the public) and </p><p>how to regulate markets. This implies not only commercial skills to set up and manage </p><p>contracts, but also the ability to set market-based policy frameworks and design systems </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>40 – 1. PUBLIC SECTOR SKILLS IN THE SEARCH FOR PUBLIC VALUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>for providing feedback on how the various actors (regulators, commissioners, providers) </p><p>are achieving policy objectives (Blatchford & Gash, 2012). Finally, public employees </p><p>setting up and managing contracts need to have skills related to integrity and managing </p><p>conflicts of interest.  </p><p></p><p>Box 1.7. What competencies do contract managers need? </p><p></p><p>Don Kettle charts the growth of government “contracting out” in the United States and </p><p>suggests that today, much of the government’s substantive work is done by contractors. This </p><p>requires public employees to manage a range of contracts, for which Dr. Kettle believe many are </p><p>poorly prepared. He suggests that in order to manage such contracts effectively, public </p><p>employees require the following competencies:  </p><p></p><p>• They must have strong substantive backgrounds so that they can understand the issues </p><p>that bubble up from the contractors. </p><p></p><p>• They must be quick students in complex areas, so that they can steer contracts in the </p><p>direction that governmental policy requires.  </p><p></p><p>• They must be adept negotiators.  </p><p></p><p>• They must be good financial managers, for control of the money flow is typically the </p><p>strongest control of programmatic results.  </p><p></p><p>• They must be good auditors to ensure that money ends up going where they intend.  </p><p></p><p>• They must be able to evaluate the outcomes of these complex relationships among </p><p>government, contractors and subcontractors, so that they can assess whether government </p><p>is getting its money’s worth.  </p><p></p><p>• They must, in short, be experts in steering complex processes. </p><p>Source: Kettl, D.F. (2010), “Governance, Contract Management and Public Managemnet”, in S. P. </p><p>Osbourne, The New Public Governance?

Furthermore, the shift towards increased transparency </p><p>and accountability for government spending has led many to question how the </p><p>government is able to account for the impact of such spending. This means a need not </p><p>only to design a contract and oversee its management, but also to conceive of </p><p>performance indicators that are able to track value for money, and investment instruments </p><p>that are flexible enough to adjust when indicators suggest a need for change. </p><p>Technological change provides new opportunities for contracting, but also increases the </p><p>complexity of the project and technical risks involved. There is a sense that in many cases </p><p>an information asymmetry challenges government to be a smart buyer and manage the </p><p>associated risks. </p><p></p><p>One challenge that has been outlined by the Office of Management and Budget </p><p>(OMB) in the United States is to increase both the capacity of the “acquisition” workforce </p><p>in terms of skills and numbers and to strengthen the linkages between contracting </p><p>officials and the programmes they contract for. This implies the need for some level of </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>1.

The challenge is that most programme </p><p>and policy specialists are not contracting or commercial specialists.  </p><p></p><p>This is similar to the UK’s broad interest in improving commercial skills across its </p><p>civil service workforce. According to the 2013 capabilities plan, obtaining better value </p><p>from the GBP 45 billion spent each year on goods and services requires commercial skills </p><p>across the whole civil service, not just in the procurement profession.

This will allow for meaningful, planned and competitive engagement with </p><p>the whole market.  </p><p></p><p>• Procurement: Understand the underlying economics and contracting aspects of </p><p>suppliers’ tenders, including pricing techniques, margins and open book arrangements, </p><p>as well as basic contracting terms, such as contract changes, intellectual property rights </p><p>and termination. Knowing how to negotiate a good deal and applying commercial </p><p>judgment is as important as understanding the procurement process. </p><p></p><p>• Post-contract: Understand and apply commercial techniques to ensure that suppliers </p><p>deliver to meet (contractual) expectations in order to maintain best value, and be able to </p><p>negotiate with suppliers when they do not deliver, including competently and </p><p>confidently handling disputes. </p><p></p><p>Source: UK Cabinet Office (2013), Meeting the Challenge: A Capabilities Plan for the Civil Service, </p><p>Cabinet Office, London. </p><p></p><p>Applying the professional, strategic and innovation lenses described above, </p><p>professional skills provide a foundation for commissioning based on value for money, </p><p>strategic skills use markets to achieve policy objectives, and skill sets related to </p><p>innovation in the public sector help to rethink the tools and processes of commissioning </p><p>and interaction with delivery organisations.

The money spent on goods </p><p>and services used and financed by OECD governments (intermediate consumption) is, on </p><p>average, almost equal to that spent on public employment (Figure 1.7). In the United </p><p>States, government contracting has almost tripled since 2000, and the Government </p><p>Accountability Office’s concerns about the lack of capacity to manage complex contracts </p><p>places the issue on its high-risk list (US Government Accountability Office, 2015a). In </p><p>some government areas, commissioning is the primary delivery vehicle for government </p><p>services. This represents a significant shift in the roles of civil services and civil servants, </p><p>from delivering impact to buying the impact they seek to achieve. However, the skill set </p><p>involved in managing contracts, PPPs, and service level agreements is rarely prioritised in </p><p>the civil services of OECD countries. </p><p></p><p>Figure 1.7.

In this sense, the skill </p><p>set implied may be the most core of all, but is often sidelined in government agencies. In </p><p>many countries, commissioning is not considered to be a highly skilled and well-paid </p><p>function, despite the significant amount of money spent. Slow and ineffective </p><p>commissioning threatens the quality of the services the government pays for, and </p><p>ultimately the impact these services will have on the ground. Contract managers need to </p><p>understand much more than the rules of the procurement and contracting system. They </p><p>need keen management, policy and business sensibilities, which are skills that are </p><p>particularly difficult to come by in many civil services. Therefore, many observers agree </p><p>that contract oversight skills are a significant, high-risk gap. Some point to the lack of </p><p>attractiveness, stature and career paths for this type of work in government agencies, for </p><p>example, (Kettl, 2010); (Durant, Girth, & Johnston, 2009); (US Government </p><p>Accountability Office, 2015b); (UK Cabinet Office, 2013). </p><p></p><p>Skills for managing in and through networks  </p><p></p><p>What are the skills? </p><p>Somewhere between working directly with citizens and working through contractual </p><p></p><p>relationships there exists a modality that is receiving increased attention: collaboration </p><p>and adaptive management through networks. There are many examples of collaborative </p><p>partnerships and networks that combine multiple government agencies and various </p><p>private and not-for-profit organisations to collectively address common problems. Some </p><p>suggest this is the primary governance model of the future as collaborative networks can </p><p>tap into a wider body of knowledge, perspective and technology than any one </p><p>organisation, and can help to generate consensus around problems, definitions, potential </p><p>solutions and collective implementation (see, for example, (Williams, 2012); (Osborne, </p><p>2010); (Agranoff, 2007); (Goldsmith & Eggers, 2004)).  </p><p></p><p>Managing networks requires a mix of information and relational skills, and ultimately </p><p>depends on trust within the network participants. Key skills in the literature on networked </p><p>governance include trust building, systems thinking, high-level interpersonal skills </p><p>(coaching, mediation, negotiation, facilitation, diplomacy), building consensus and joint </p><p>problem solving, brokerage and political entrepreneurship, risk analysis, project </p><p>management, flexibility and adaptability, bridge-building, feedback loops, </p><p>communication skills, and creative problem solving. This is the realm of boundary </p><p>spanners and implies a very different approach to leadership and solutions development. </p><p>Williams (2012) studied boundary spanners functioning in public networks, and identifies </p><p>four roles, each with their own competencies (Table 1.4).  </p><p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>44 – 1.

Collaborating in networks </p><p>was not emphasised in Weberian hierarchical bureaucracy. New public management </p><p>emphasised contractual, market-oriented relationships which align with the </p><p>commissioning skill set described above. Managing in networks may best align with the </p><p>emerging model of governance – be it new public governance, new public service, or </p><p>other labels which analyse the role of government regarding civil society (the difference </p><p>between government and governance) and emphasise a broad array of alternative delivery </p><p>mechanisms, cross-sector collaboration and citizen engagement. “[The role of] public </p><p>managers goes well beyond that in traditional public administration or new public </p><p>management; they are presumed able to help create and guide networks of deliberation </p><p>and delivery and help maintain and enhance the overall effectiveness, capacity, and </p><p>accountability of the system” (Bryson, Crosby, & Bloomberg, 2014, p. 448). “The </p><p>neutral, competent servants of the political executive must now master the skills for </p><p>managing the complex, non-routine issues, policies and relationships in networks; that is, </p><p>meta-governing, boundary spanning, and collaborative leadership. The task is to manage </p><p>the mix of bureaucracy, markets and networks” (Rhodes, 2016, pp. 640-641). </p><p></p><p>Box 1.9. Systems thinking in the public sector </p><p></p><p>Systems thinking is an emerging approach in both innovative service delivery and public </p><p>sector reform. The OECD has analysed the methodology in a recent report: “Working with </p><p>change: Systems approaches to public sector challenges”. The term “systems approaches” is </p><p>used to describe a set of processes, methods and practices that aim to affect systemic change. </p><p>These include systems engineering, systems innovation, systems thinking and design thinking. </p><p>While systems approaches are not new, their use in the public sector is recent and still largely </p><p>unexplored. Nevertheless, system thinking has great potential to affect transformative change </p><p>within the public sector in areas where institutions are outmoded by 21st century problems </p><p>stemming from interconnectivity, cyber threats, climate change, changing demographics and </p><p>countless other factors. Rather than just looking at policy problems and accepting the immediate </p><p>issue, systems thinking encourages looking at where that problem is situated, and seeks to </p><p>explore where the actual cause of the problem might be. Thus, systems thinking does not only </p><p>address the resilience or robustness of public sector systems, but helps to redefine the functions </p><p>and purpose of systems to respond to new realities. As such, systems approaches help </p><p>government confront, in a holistic way, problems that span current administrative and territorial </p><p>boundaries. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>1.

Systems thinking in the public sector (cont.) </p><p></p><p>While systems approaches can be very complex, not all public servants have to become </p><p>systems thinking specialists. Using these approaches to initiate wide-scale systems change in the </p><p>public sector usually necessitates expert help. However, as systems thinking implies </p><p>transformative change in the face of complexity, it requires new types of skills, (adaptive) </p><p>capacities and ways of working for public servants to be effective in the public sector. </p><p>Consequently, using systems approaches in the public sector implies “reflection-in-action” and </p><p>“learning by doing”, because in areas where systems thinking is most effective, uncertainty is </p><p>high and there may not be an evidence base to fall back on. Thus, in addition to being aware of </p><p>systems approaches, public managers should start to monitor (develop feedback systems from </p><p>implementation) and evaluate complex processes continuously to be able to identify and work on </p><p>problems. Policy experts within specific fields should have more precise knowledge of how their </p><p>policy systems work, who the stakeholders are, and the possible causal relationships within the </p><p>system or types of uncertainty the system faces. </p><p></p><p>Source: OECD (2017a), Working with Change: Systems approaches to public sector challenges, OECD </p><p>Publishing, Paris, www.oecd.org/governance/observatory-public-sector-innovation/library/28.02%20syste </p><p>ms%20thinking%20schedule%20FINAL.PDF. </p><p></p><p>While this has implications for skills throughout the civil service, leadership is </p><p>particularly implicated. Collaborative leadership is a growing field and provides a </p><p>counterbalance to the top-down transactional and transformational leadership styles </p><p>emphasised in bureaucracies and new public management. Collaborative leadership </p><p>emphasises leadership as a trait projected horizontally. Leaders catalyse and facilitate </p><p>collective action, and leadership roles are generally dispersed among different levels of an </p><p>organisation and multiple stakeholders (for a good discussion, see Head and Alford, </p><p>2015; or Sorensen and Torfing, 2015). Nevertheless, leaders at the top remain of key </p><p>importance as they establish the culture of trust and frameworks for delegation and </p><p>accountability.  </p><p></p><p>Applying the professional, strategic and innovation lenses described above, </p><p>professional skills provide a foundation for network management, strategic skills are </p><p>mobilised to ensure these professions are used to achieve policy objectives, and skill sets </p><p>related to innovation in the public sector help to rethink the tools and processes of </p><p>networking and partnering with others. While not an exhaustive list, some ideas are found </p><p>in Table 1.5 below. </p><p></p><p>Table 1.5.

PUBLIC SECTOR SKILLS IN THE SEARCH FOR PUBLIC VALUE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>Why invest in these skills? </p><p>Answering the call for open, innovative and agile government will require more than </p><p></p><p>adequate citizen consultation, good contract management, and effective policy design. </p><p>The blurring of the lines between public, private and third sectors is increasingly </p><p>profound, and governments must respond. The idea of collaboration and co-operation is </p><p>more and more common in public sector leadership frameworks in recognition of the fact </p><p>public policy dilemmas are too complex for governments to solve on their own.  </p><p></p><p>Recognising the benefits of working in networks, and the fact this is happening, does </p><p>not lead to a de-skilling of the civil service, but the recognition that there needs to be </p><p>investment in this skill set. Kettle (2009) looks at a range of case studies and concludes, </p><p>“policy problems define processes, goals drive interactions, and leaders co-ordinate </p><p>across multiple boundaries” (p.13). The network is an empirical reality, but because they </p><p>tend to be policy driven and context specific, this skill set is particularly hard to define. </p><p>What is clear is it requires a different approach to leadership – one which reduces the </p><p>reliance on the heroic model and instead emphasises collaboration (Wilson, 2013). </p><p>Rhodes (2016) suggests it may be more of a craft than a science “to accept the importance </p><p>of experiential knowledge as well as formal knowledge” (p.642). </p><p></p><p>However, skills alone won’t be enough </p><p>Moving from professional to strategic and innovative level skills needs to be matched </p><p></p><p>by a change in the way they are organised, managed and led. For example, the traditional </p><p>policy cycle view has often led to organisational separations in the policy and delivery </p><p>functions, which many have reduced the intended impact of policies and services. These </p><p>kinds of silos are often reinforced by traditional heroic and transactional command and </p><p>control leadership styles. Innovative skills will need to be matched by a more innovation-</p><p>oriented and dispersed approach to leadership that values collaboration, bottom-up </p><p>expertise and horizontal sharing of knowledge and insight. This implies moving from a </p><p>compliance view of management to a values-based model, where common values and </p><p>trust enable autonomy and debate. These ideas are further developed in the OECD’s </p><p>report, “Engaging public employees for a high performing civil service (OECD, 2016d) </p><p>(see Box 1.10). </p><p></p><p>Box 1.10. Leadership in a professional, strategic and innovative civil service </p><p></p><p>According to Bass (1997, 1985) the transactional-transformational leadership paradigm is a </p><p>proven universal phenomenon in all cultures. At its most basic, leaders and followers enter into </p><p>an exchange through a process of negotiation. Leaders then reward or punish followers </p><p>depending on the level and quality of their achievements. This is transactional leadership. This </p><p>may be emphasised in a professional civil service.  </p><p></p><p>Moving towards a strategic civil service may require transformational leadership, which </p><p>recognises the role of motivation and human emotion in the leader-follower relationship. </p><p>“Authentic transformational leaders motivate followers to work for transcendental goals that go </p><p>beyond immediate self-interests” (Bass, 1997). Bass identifies the following components of </p><p>transformational leadership: </p><p></p><p>• Idealised influence (charisma): leaders display conviction; emphasise trust; take stands </p><p>on difficult issues; present their most important values; and emphasise the importance of </p><p>purpose, commitment, and the ethical consequences of decisions.  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>1.

Leadership in a professional, strategic and innovative civil service (cont.) </p><p></p><p>• Inspirational motivation: leaders articulate an appealing vision of the future, challenge </p><p>followers with high standards, talk optimistically with enthusiasm, and provide </p><p>encouragement and meaning for what needs to be done.  </p><p></p><p>• Intellectual stimulation: leaders question old assumptions, traditions, and beliefs; </p><p>stimulate in others new perspectives and ways of doing things; and encourage the </p><p>expression of ideas and reasons.  </p><p></p><p>• Individualised consideration: leaders deal with others as individuals; consider their </p><p>individual needs, abilities, and aspirations; listen attentively; further their development; </p><p>advise; teach; and coach. </p><p></p><p>While the transactional–transformation paradigm appears to have dominated leadership </p><p>discussions in recent years, researchers and observers are beginning to ask whether even </p><p>transformational leadership is appropriate for the challenges facing the public sector today and in </p><p>the future. Sorensen and Torfing (2015) suggest that collaborative innovation in the public sector </p><p>requires a different kind of leadership and management. They argue that, “Transactional and </p><p>transformational leadership continue to be important to ensure an efficient implementation of </p><p>predefined goals through well-described bureaucratic practices, but they have limited value </p><p>when it comes to rethinking goals and practices and changing the way that problems and </p><p>challenges are reframed and new practices are designed, tested and adjusted.” They point instead </p><p>to the discussions and debates around “adaptive” and “pragmatic” leadership: </p><p></p><p>• Adaptive leadership aims to determine which public activities to maintain and which to </p><p>adapt and transform. It then seeks to develop new practices by crafting and testing </p><p>prototypes and by aligning people across an organisation in order to ensure effective </p><p>execution and to facilitate the integration of new with old activities.  </p><p></p><p>• Pragmatic leadership aims to transform the culture of public organisations in ways that </p><p>enhance double loop learning and use existing tools to solve problems by changing </p><p>established practices – including transformative learning that develops new metaphors </p><p>and narratives that help frame what is difficult to comprehend, expand knowledge and </p><p>toolboxes, and change identities and roles. </p><p></p><p>Sources: Adapted from OECD (2016d), Engaging Public Employees for a High-Performing Civil Service, </p><p>OECD Publishing, Paris, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264267190-en.  </p><p></p><p>Bass, B.

Moving from skills definition to skills </p><p>management requires a new look at public employment and management policies and </p><p>frameworks, and at how people are managed in civil service. This part of the report is </p><p>organised around four themes (Figure 2.1). The first step is to determine what tools and </p><p>methods are available to understand and identify skills gaps in the civil service. Once </p><p>gaps are identified, they can be filled through either bringing people with these skills into </p><p>the organisation (focus on recruitment) or developing these skills within the existing </p><p>workforce. A highly skilled public sector workforce will only produce results if people </p><p>with the required skill sets find a home in organisations ready to put those skills to use. </p><p></p><p>Figure 2.1.

These data have been in high demand </p><p>and have been used by both national governments and international organisations for </p><p>comparative purposes. These data are unique at the international level, and fundamental in </p><p>creating a solid basis for comparative analysis across OECD member countries in the field of </p><p>government HRM and civil service reform strategies. The survey constitutes a strategic input to </p><p>all OECD work on public employment and management. The data also constitute a significant </p><p>part of Government at a Glance and are seen as increasingly strategic by OECD countries.  </p><p></p><p>A new version of the survey was run in 2016 in order to address new demands from member </p><p>governments. The main focus was HRM practice and institutions in central public administration </p><p>at the federal/national government level. It was complemented by two additional surveys: one on </p><p>civil service composition and one on compensation of civil servants. All of these surveys will </p><p>contribute to the 2017 version of Government at a Glance. </p><p></p><p>In 2016, the SHRM questionnaire was completed by senior officials from </p><p>ministries/agencies with responsibilities for public employment and management of the civil </p><p>service in all OECD countries, and three accession countries (Colombia, Costa Rica and </p><p>Lithuania). Following data collection, the secretariat undertook a process of data cleaning to </p><p>ensure that data were valid. </p><p></p><p>Determining skills needs and gaps: Competency management and workforce </p><p>planning </p><p></p><p>Determining the skills needed to meet current and future priorities, and assessing the </p><p>gaps in the current workforce, are fundamental steps for strategic workforce planning. </p><p>However, there are many challenges. A good analysis of current workforce capability is </p><p>necessary to identify strengths and weaknesses, and while most OECD countries have </p><p>defined a common skills and competency profile for their civil servants, it is not apparent </p><p>if they are able to clearly map which of these skills are abundant, where they are </p><p>distributed, and where gaps exist. This suggests a need to map and track skills availability </p><p>through, for example, skills audits and capability reviews, employee databases, and the </p><p>definition of professions.  </p><p></p><p>Bringing a future-oriented view of skills into human resource (HR) planning raises a </p><p>second set of challenges. As discussed above, the digital transformation, calls for open </p><p>and innovative government, and the speed at which citizens expect results today require </p><p>different skill sets from those needed in the past. As activities such as tax collection are </p><p>transferred to online systems, associated skill sets become increasingly digital. The </p><p>balance of work may move from lower skilled claims processing to jobs higher on the </p><p>value chain, such as complex case resolution and fraud detection, in addition to the skills </p><p>needed to design and run the IT systems. Simply doing succession planning means </p><p>organisations replicate the skills they needed in the past without preparing for the future.  </p><p></p><p>This section will look at how OECD countries are identifying current and future skills </p><p>needs and assessing their current workforce’s capabilities against these needs. It makes </p><p>the following key points: </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>56 – 2. TOWARDS A HIGHLY SKILLED CIVIL SERVICE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>• Most OECD countries have articulated a strategic and forward-looking vision for </p><p>their public sectors that recognises the need for highly skilled civil servants to </p><p>drive public sector performance.  </p><p></p><p>• The use of competency frameworks is a clear trend in OECD countries, with a </p><p>primary focus on leadership, behavioural and cognitive competencies. These are </p><p>important cross-cutting competencies that should be complemented by </p><p>professional expertise in specific subject matter areas. </p><p></p><p>• Bringing these themes together in future-oriented workforce planning remains a </p><p>core challenge for public sector HRM. Workforce planning driven by skills and </p><p>competencies, instead of numbers and costs, is essential to ensure both capacity </p><p>and capability considerations are factored into HR decision making. This suggests </p><p>the need to develop better data on workforce skills, which are rarely available in </p><p>civil services of OECD countries, as well as foresight capacity in order to ensure </p><p>that the workforce keeps pace with the fast pace of technological and social </p><p>change. </p><p></p><p>Civil service strategic vision </p><p>In 2016, a significant majority (27) of OECD countries reported articulating a </p><p></p><p>strategic medium to long-term vision for the civil service. The most common element </p><p>mentioned in these visions was the need for a skilled and high capacity civil service </p><p>(Figure 2.2). While these statements and strategies do not go into much detail, they often </p><p>include references to ethics and probity, performance orientation, openness in terms of </p><p>accountability and mindset, and common culture and values. This is often framed within </p><p>the context of digital transformation, and the role of the civil service in developing a more </p><p>open, innovative state (see Box 2.2 below). </p><p></p><p>Figure 2.2.

The </p><p>strategy recognises the digital transformation as a key driver that requires skills orientation to </p><p>people management, alongside mobility and innovation. The strategy is likely to be updated in </p><p>the near future.  </p><p></p><p>Ireland’s Civil Service Renewal Plan strives to achieve a civil service that is:  </p><p></p><p>• Unified: implies cross-cutting skills and collaborative skills to achieve joined up </p><p>solutions.  </p><p></p><p>• Professional: looks at the skills needed and their balance, particularly through diversity </p><p>and inclusion, and a reinvestment in the development of skills for civil servants.  </p><p></p><p>• Responsive: looks at strengthening professional expertise in corporate functions, </p><p>expanding career and mobility opportunities, investing in project management capacity </p><p>and expanding ICT capacity to be more agile and flexible.  </p><p></p><p>• Open and accountable: suggests a civil service that learns from others, communicates, </p><p>and accounts for its actions. </p><p></p><p>Lithuania’s 2030 progress strategy calls for performance-driven civil servants who have the </p><p>skills to develop and implement strategies, continuously monitor global trends, and creatively </p><p>apply best practices.

Developing the civil service vision in the Netherlands  </p><p></p><p>In the Netherlands, the HR Strategy 2020 for Central Public Administration was developed </p><p>in an interactive process between October 2011 and March 2013. The highlights were included </p><p>in the reform agenda of the new Minister of Housing and Central Public Administration in May </p><p>2013. </p><p></p><p>The process of development started with an in-depth analysis of internal trends and forecasts </p><p>of personnel development, and external economic, social and technological trends. These </p><p>included labour market, labour relations and labour conditions, as well as trends that would </p><p>influence the policy areas and operational management of central public administration. </p><p></p><p>The Directors of HR and Organisational Development of all ministries, chaired by the </p><p>director of the central department for civil service of the Ministry of Interior, were responsible </p><p>for the development of the Strategy 2020. This group met monthly during the first half of 2012 </p><p>to discuss various areas related to the strategy. Each meeting was prepared by the programme </p><p>leader from the Ministry of Interior, together with members of this group and external experts. </p><p>One of the meetings was with the strategic advisors on policy areas of the ministries. The </p><p>secretaries-general of the ministries and their directors for operational management were asked </p><p>in individual interviews for their image of the future, and were involved in steering boards for </p><p>their agreement during several phases of the process. </p><p></p><p>The strategy began to take shape as a PowerPoint presentation with a lot of background </p><p>analyses and information, and focused on the main challenges and basic assumptions for future </p><p>HR-policy development for specific areas. In summer 2012, groups of experts from the </p><p>ministries and agencies further developed each area to come up with shared ideas and to identify </p><p>the policies in each area and the inter-connections across areas that needed to be successful. </p><p></p><p>The evolving presentation was adjusted and expanded in order to be used internally by each </p><p>ministry. In September 2012, a group of young people from outside the public administration </p><p>was asked to critically reflect on the draft HR-strategy 2020.

This is a core task of </p><p>strategic workforce planning, and while OECD countries continue to use these tools, </p><p>there is little evidence that competencies and skills are being incorporated into workforce </p><p>planning in a systematic and co-ordinated fashion. For example, it seems few countries </p><p>have the means to understand the composition of their workforce in terms of skills. Many </p><p>OECD countries do not have access to aggregated data on the education levels or </p><p>specialisation of their workforce, let alone skills acquired through experience or less </p><p>formal learning. While some countries have expressed a desire to build a “skills </p><p>inventory” of their civil service workforce, it is not clear what criteria would be used to </p><p>develop this tool. The French government has developed a common dictionary of </p><p>competencies that aims to break down all government jobs with a view to eventually </p><p>mapping the public sector workforce (Box 2.5). </p><p></p><p>Box 2.5. The French Interdepartmental Directory of State Occupations and </p><p>competencies dictionary </p><p></p><p>The French Interdepartmental Directory of State Occupations (Rime), created in 2006 and </p><p>updated in 2010 and 2017, aims to precisely identify the jobs that enable the state to carry out its </p><p>mission to serve its citizens. All of the state’s jobs are listed, which represents 2.5 million </p><p>people. It includes jobs occupied by the incumbents, as well as those held by contract workers, </p><p>whether civilian or military. This tool is very valuable for initiating the predictive management </p><p>of jobs and skills and defining the strategic HR policy actions to be carried out to accompany the </p><p>foreseeable evolution of missions and professions. One of the major objectives of the 3rd Rime </p><p>edition, published in 2017, is to make jobs of the state even more understandable at an </p><p>interdepartmental level, and to establish a common language for all the state’s services. This new </p><p>edition lists 282 reference jobs divided into 28 functional domains. For each reference job there </p><p>are the associated skills, competencies and knowledge required. Managerial skills and relational </p><p>skills (savoir-être) were newly added in this 3rd version. </p><p></p><p>To further enhance the use of the Rime in personalised HRM, it was supplemented in 2011 </p><p>by an inter-ministerial dictionary of the competences of the trades of the state (DICo), which </p><p>brings together all of the skills appearing in the Rime. The dictionary can have multiple </p><p>purposes, according to the user: </p><p></p><p>• For the recruiter, the dictionary gives guidelines to write a job card or to receive a </p><p>candidate. </p><p></p><p>• For the career counselor, it is useful to establish the skills profile of the interviewee. </p><p></p><p>• For the manager, it is an interesting contribution to the assessment of skills in the annual </p><p>professional interview. </p><p></p><p>• For any agent wishing to build his/her professional career to be better positioned in </p><p>terms of skills needed to evolve. </p><p></p><p>Skills are grouped into three sub-groups: 102 conceptual know-how competencies (savoir-</p><p>faire), 21 relational skills (savoir-être) and 40 contextual knowledge categories (rubriques de </p><p>connaissances). </p><p></p><p>The DICo will be updated within the second semester of 2017 in order to correspond to the </p><p>last Rime edition.  </p><p></p><p>Source: Provided to the OECD by France’s Directorate General for Administration and Public Service </p><p>(DGAFP). </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>64 – 2.

"Demographics-based" actions point to </p><p>the pressure facing public service employers who must react to demographics-related changes in </p><p>their personnel structures and in the broader workforce. By 2030, Germany is expecting a 27% </p><p>increase in population over 67 years old, and a decrease of 6.9% of the working age population. </p><p>Germany’s population is also becoming more ethnically diverse. Within the Federal </p><p>Administration, the average age of employees is also rising, and a high level of retirement is </p><p>expected by 2030. This presents challenges and opportunities for Germany’s labour force and its </p><p>public employment systems. </p><p></p><p>The Federal Government of Germany has taken on this challenge: In 2011, it presented a </p><p>report on demography, and in 2012 it published a comprehensive demographic strategy. The </p><p>report described the demographic change and its impacts on Germany in the medium and long </p><p>term. The demographic strategy, “Every Age Counts”, aims to take advantage of the </p><p>opportunities offered by population trends. It described for the first time all the fields of action </p><p>that are important for making policy in response to demographic change. On this basis, the </p><p>Federal Government launched a dialogue with representatives from every level of government, </p><p>from the private sector, social partners, the research community and civil society. Joint working </p><p>groups formulated concrete approaches and presented their initial results to the public at the </p><p>Federal Government’s demography summit in May 2013.  </p><p></p><p>On 14 January 2015, the Federal Government decided to follow up on this approach and </p><p>further develop its demographic strategy under the heading “Greater prosperity and better quality </p><p>of life for all generations”. In doing so, the Federal Government increased co-operation with its </p><p>partners in a total of ten working groups, including one focused on “the public service as an </p><p>attractive and modern employer”. The key objectives of this working group are: </p><p></p><p>• Ensuring that the strengthening of knowledge in public administration occurs promptly. </p><p></p><p>• Expanding family-friendly work practices. </p><p></p><p>• Ensuring that employees' ability to work is compatible with different stages in life.  </p><p>The process has been evidence-informed, drawing on, for example, employee surveys, </p><p></p><p>workforce data and statistics, and surveys of students preparing to enter the workforce. In this </p><p>context, the following actions, among others, are being advanced with the intention of ensuring </p><p>the timely transfer of knowledge and promoting the potential of employees, their skills and </p><p>expertise:  </p><p></p><p>• Strategic personnel planning aligned to demographic requirements. </p><p></p><p>• Establishment of a central job pool of all federal ministries and rotation programmes to </p><p>promote a diversity of assignments, employee development and more workforce agility. </p><p></p><p>• A greater focus on training, opportunities for further education, skills development and </p><p>information learning through work assignments or e-learning. </p><p></p><p>• Increased recruitment of skilled employees (joint web portal for all three levels of </p><p>government) with an additional emphasis on increasing the number of employees with </p><p>migrant backgrounds.

Closing skills gaps in the US Federal Administration (cont.) </p><p></p><p>The OPM has introduced various measures in recent years to address skills gaps concerns, </p><p>including a data-driven multi-factor model for identifying government-wide skills gaps in </p><p>mission-critical occupations. This model looks at indicators such as two-year retention rates, quit </p><p>rate, retirement rate and applicant quality for various occupations to categorise risk levels from 1 </p><p>to 5. This approach identified six groups of high risk mission critical occupations (MCO): </p><p>acquisition, audit, STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), HR, economist </p><p>and cyber. Actions intended to address identified skills gaps include: </p><p></p><p>• Leadership commitment: The Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO) Council is made </p><p>of up CHCOs from 24 federal administrations to advise and collaborate with the OPM </p><p>and other stakeholders to create human capital management strategies that attract, </p><p>develop and retain a high performing, engaged and diverse federal workforce. The OPM </p><p>has worked with the CHCO to provide the strategic direction necessary to close over 48 </p><p>unique agency-specific gaps. Activities have included the establishment of governance </p><p>structures, four-year assessment cycles, agency specific action plans, cross collaboration </p><p>networks, and quarterly monitoring processes. </p><p></p><p>• Capacity: Agencies have dedicated over 150 personnel from across government to </p><p>work on the skills gaps effort, organised into Federal Action Skills Teams (FASTs) </p><p>supported by the OPM. Each agency and government-wide MCO has a dedicated FAST </p><p>in place with regular meetings. Each member of the FAST has specific responsibilities, </p><p>such as staffing and hiring, and training and development. The OPM has encouraged </p><p>agencies with similar high-risk MCOs to share best practices, and has provided </p><p>guidance and training on the multi-factor model, root cause analysis, developing an </p><p>action plan, developing metrics, and quarterly reporting. </p><p></p><p>• Action plan: The OPM has required agencies to develop and submit action plans with </p><p>strategies linking to root cause analysis and milestones with outcome-oriented </p><p>performance metrics.

TOWARDS A HIGHLY SKILLED CIVIL SERVICE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>In the United Kingdom, the House of Commons conducted its own enquiry into the </p><p>progress of the UK Capabilities Plan, which aims to “transform the civil service into a </p><p>high-skilled, high-performance organisation that’s less bureaucratic and more focused on </p><p>delivering results” (see Box 2.8). Their analysis results in recommendations to develop </p><p>and carry out standardised skills audits of civil service organisations and articulates </p><p>support for the creation of a national Civil Service Leadership Academy.  </p><p></p><p>Box 2.8. Skills and capability in the UK civil service </p><p></p><p>Since 2012, the UK civil service has been taking steps to align their skills strategy with their </p><p>civil service strategic vision. The 2012 Civil Service Reform Plan identified capability gaps that </p><p>must be addressed in order to meet the plan’s objectives of reducing public expenditure while </p><p>meeting citizen’s growing service expectations. The plan called for a rethinking of the way </p><p>services are delivered, with more services commissioned from the outside and a much stronger </p><p>emphasis on digital. It recognised that implementation would depend on effective project </p><p>management and leadership. In 2013, the UK civil service published a capabilities plan for the </p><p>whole civil service which identified four priority skills gaps central to supporting the 2012 civil </p><p>service reform: </p><p></p><p>• Leading and managing change: the UK civil service annual staff engagement survey </p><p>(the People Survey) results indicate a need to be better at leading change. Change is a </p><p>constant feature of the modern civil service. The plan seeks to improve the management </p><p>of these changes and ensure that teams are equipped to embrace new ways of working.  </p><p></p><p>• Commercial skills and behaviours: ensuring that many more civil servants feel </p><p>confident and competent in a world where services are increasingly commissioned from </p><p>the private and voluntary sectors. The plan encourages civil servants to take decisions </p><p>and assess risk based on knowledge of markets, and be judged on whether taxpayers’ </p><p>money has been spent wisely to deliver the right outcome. </p><p></p><p>• Delivering successful projects and programmes: increasing the ability to deliver the </p><p>government’s priorities, “right first time”, drawing on project management disciplines </p><p>and methodologies to achieve predictable, consistent, robust results.  </p><p></p><p>• Redesigning services and delivering them digitally: ensuring that the civil service is </p><p>equipped to redesign services around the user in order to improve delivery, value for </p><p>money and agility for the future, using the power of digital. </p><p></p><p>The 2013 plan lays out ways to build, buy and borrow the capabilities needed. Building </p><p>internal capabilities through learning and development, buying through contracting and/or </p><p>recruiting, and borrowing through loans between departments and secondments with the private </p><p>sector. </p><p></p><p>These strategies are reinforced in the UK’s civil service plan 2016-2020, which sets out five </p><p>areas for action. The first looks at opening up recruitment across the civil service, to attract and </p><p>retain people of talent. The second looks to build career paths through professional development </p><p>frameworks, to map out key skills and experiences and ways to aid their development. </p><p>Leadership is the third area of focus, and the civil service will develop a Leadership Academy to </p><p>address this challenge. The fourth area focuses on employee inclusion with a goal for the civil </p><p>service to become the most inclusive employer in the United Kingdom. Finally, the civil service </p><p>is looking at pay and rewards frameworks with a view to increased flexibility for market </p><p>attraction of scarce skills. </p><p></p><p>Source: UK Cabinet Office (2013), Meeting the Challenge: A Capabilities Plan for the Civil Service, </p><p>www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/536961/civil_service_workforce_st</p><p>rategy_final.pdf. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>2.

Australia, through its </p><p>leadership and core skills strategy, provides a framework for organisations to conduct </p><p>skills analysis, supplemented by expert reports as needed. Canada is combining high-level </p><p>consultation with a focus on common business systems and data-driven departure </p><p>forecasting to better integrate skills into its workforce planning and assessment. Finland </p><p>has conducted surveys to identify skills gaps related to digital skills, and Trento in Italy </p><p>has implemented various consultative and participative steps to identify skills </p><p>requirements and develop a new competency model for its public employees (Box 2.9). </p><p>These examples show the range of approaches taken and suggest the need to think </p><p>systemically to combine multiple tools of analysis. </p><p></p><p>Box 2.9. Skills gap studies and practices in Australia, Canada, Finland, and </p><p>Trento, Italy </p><p></p><p>For the past five years, the skills needs and gaps of the Australian Public Service (APS) </p><p>have been identified through broad consultation and research underpinning the APS leadership </p><p>and sore skills strategies. The strategies seek to understand cross-APS skills needs and gaps by </p><p>speaking to a wide range of stakeholders and using academic research and peak body insights to </p><p>support and expand on these findings. Government reports, reviews and white papers provide </p><p>insight into the skills needs and gaps of the APS. Skills needs are also determined through </p><p>targeted initiatives for improvement. Examples include gender equality and diversity strategies. </p><p></p><p>The Government of Canada is currently taking steps to strengthen its ability to identify </p><p>current and future skills requirements at the enterprise level, with deputy heads responsible for </p><p>their own departments and agencies. Work is being done to advance the analysis to identify </p><p>common future skills in some key domains (e.g. policy, science/regulatory, external/internal </p><p>service delivery), and to complete a baseline analysis of common skills in specific occupational </p><p>groups.  </p><p></p><p>The adoption of the Common Human Resources Business Process (i.e. standardising </p><p>processes across the public service), progress toward automation of transactional functions (e.g. </p><p>simple staffing requests), and skills development within the human resources community itself </p><p>will strengthen integrated business planning and allow human resources staff to focus more on </p><p>planning, forecasting and analytical capacity to better support business objectives and outcomes. </p><p>The Government of Canada is assessing the feasibility of expanding its current departure </p><p>forecasting methodology to include occupational groups and departments to inform succession </p><p>planning, and is in the process of identifying positions belonging to specific functional </p><p>communities in order to identify potential knowledge gaps and develop future recruitment </p><p>strategies. In addition, mature functional communities with dedicated resources exist for many </p><p>occupational groups, where identified skills gaps and requirements inform both recruitment </p><p>strategies and learning and development activities. </p><p></p><p>In 2016, the Finnish Ministry of Finance implemented a survey to assess agencies’ current </p><p>skills and map needed skills. Target respondents were civil servants working within digital </p><p>government or with insight into needed skills. Findings of the survey included the wide gap of </p><p>skills level among government agencies, the importance of managerial skills in digitalisation, </p><p>and the need for more training and skills development.

The work group then defined a scale to rate the mastery of competencies </p><p>(from 1 to 5) in order to measure the gap between the level required and the actual situation. A </p><p>set of measures are to be carried out to close this gap (for instance ad hoc training programmes). </p><p></p><p>Source: Information provided to the OECD by Delegates of the Public Employment and Management </p><p>Working Party. </p><p></p><p>Attracting and selecting skills: Employer branding and targeted recruitment  </p><p></p><p>Workforce planning can help to identify skills needs and assess skills gaps, and can </p><p>result in a plan to fill these gaps, usually through the development or reallocation of the </p><p>current workforce, or the acquisition of new employees with the required skills. Until </p><p>recently, most OECD countries had implemented hiring freezes in the wake of the 2008 </p><p>crisis (OECD, 2016b). Prolonged hiring freezes cause strain on organisations, which have </p><p>little opportunity to renew their workforce to ensure the appropriate skills mix (OECD, </p><p>2011).  </p><p></p><p>As OECD economies emerge from these difficult times and face high levels of </p><p>retirement, many budgetary constraints remain. It is likely central government workforces </p><p>will remain leaner than in the past. This suggests an urgent need to ensure hiring is </p><p>undertaken with a careful assessment of the right skill sets needed to boost public sector </p><p>capacity and productivity, and civil services and public administrations are able to attract </p><p>people with these skill sets to their workplace. This section will look at the issues related </p><p>to bringing in new employees to fill skills gaps. It makes the following key points: </p><p></p><p>• Although most OECD civil services indicate that they remain relatively attractive </p><p>employers in the current job market, they also report difficulty competing for </p><p>specific skill sets with the private sector. Understanding what attracts people to </p><p>careers in the civil service can help to brand the civil service as an employer of </p><p>choice. </p><p></p><p>• Merit-based recruitment processes have been a bedrock of professional civil </p><p>services in most OECD countries for many years. However, some civil services </p><p>may need to update their processes to open up possibilities for recruitment at all </p><p>levels, quicken the speed of the process, and ensure selection is well attuned to </p><p>future-oriented skills and diversity requirements. Fast track programmes are one </p><p>way to reach out to specific skill sets which may be lacking. Some governments </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>2. TOWARDS A HIGHLY SKILLED CIVIL SERVICE – 73 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>are moving towards competency-based selection processes instead of relying on </p><p>educational qualifications as the primary indicator of merit.  </p><p></p><p>• Another fundamental aspect of attraction and recruitment relates to the terms and </p><p>conditions of employment. Many civil services use common employment </p><p>frameworks across various categories of employment. While this reinforces </p><p>internal equity, there may be benefits in bringing an evidence-based and </p><p>principled approach to the design of specific employment terms and conditions </p><p>for specific positions or professions. This can be done to align aspects of the </p><p>employment value proposition, such as pay and job security, with the </p><p>requirements of the job and the conditions of the broader labour market.  </p><p></p><p>Attractiveness and employer branding </p><p>In order to bring in new skills from the labour market, a first requirement is that </p><p></p><p>people with these skills are attracted to the jobs available. Attractiveness of positions in </p><p>the civil service is based on complex interactions between national and local labour </p><p>markets, government compensation packages, and the overall perception of government </p><p>as an employer and as a positive force in society. The SHRM survey asked respondents to </p><p>indicate whether any trend can be identified in the overall attractiveness of their civil </p><p>service as an employer. In general, the results are optimistic. Only 3 countries report </p><p>decreases in civil service attractiveness over the last five years, while 11 report increases. </p><p>Many countries base their statements on an increased number of applications for open </p><p>positions, while others look to the results of independent assessments which identify and </p><p>rate the top employers in a country. </p><p></p><p>A broad indicator of civil service attractiveness will mask attraction issues related to </p><p>specific professions, functions, skills or organisations. Seven OECD countries report </p><p>specific challenges attracting suitable senior level managers to posts, and most countries </p><p>(25) report specific challenges in key professions. The most commonly cited gaps are </p><p>people with specific technical skills in, for example, IT, health, engineering, commercial, </p><p>and law. These generally reflect a difficulty in competing with the private sector for skill </p><p>sets that are in demand by both sectors. It therefore appears that while many jobseekers </p><p>see the public sector as an attractive employer, the public sector remains challenged when </p><p>forced to compete with the private sector in tighter labour markets. As countries continue </p><p>to move from crisis to recovery and labour markets begin to tighten again, these </p><p>challenges may worsen.  </p><p></p><p>In the context of tight resource constraints, the attractiveness of the civil service needs </p><p>to be managed through active employer branding. Recognising the labour market </p><p>competition for talent, civil services compete with all sectors for the best and brightest, </p><p>especially in hard-to-recruit areas. Many of the skills highlighted in the framework above </p><p>(business skills, network management, high-level service orientation) are exactly the </p><p>skills in demand in private sector companies. Just over half of responding countries report </p><p>having employer branding strategies and actively reaching out to potential recruits in a </p><p>variety of ways. It appears most countries appeal to applicants’ sense of duty to public </p><p>service by highlighting meaningful and interesting jobs that contribute to the public good. </p><p>Integrity and ethics, diversity and inclusion, learning opportunities and work-life balance </p><p>are other features highlighted by a majority of countries in their recruitment material. </p><p>Elements of the employer value proposition traditionally associated with public sector </p><p>employment, such as job security, benefits and pensions appear to take a backseat, which </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>74 – 2.

The answers of federal employees are compared </p><p>to the answers of those who are not yet a federal employee. The 2016 survey puts </p><p>pleasant working atmosphere in third place when the question is asked “what attracts </p><p>one to the job”: 70% or more of those respondents who are already civil servant states </p><p>this element as vital, compared to 60% of the non-civil servants. </p><p></p><p>3. Job security: The public administration is one of the most secure employers in the </p><p>national labour market. This factor is always rated as highly important to current and </p><p>future employees. </p><p></p><p>4. Interesting job content: The societal relevance of public office is an asset. The 2016 </p><p>employer branding survey puts this in fourth place when asked “what attracts one to a </p><p>job”: 60% of civil servant respondents state interesting job content, compared to 70% of </p><p>those who are not (yet) a civil servant. Candidates want to do something “useful” and to </p><p>work to support the public interest  </p><p></p><p>5. Good work-life balance: The public administration scores highly in this respect. Many </p><p>administrations work accordingly to the NWOW principles (new ways of working – </p><p>including flexible work times and places). The 2016 employer branding survey puts this </p><p>in fifth place: 70% of both civil servants in service or those not yet civil servants state </p><p>this as important. </p><p></p><p>Source: Information provided by the Belgian Federal Administration. </p><p></p><p>Recruitment and selection practices </p><p>Most OECD countries have long installed merit-based recruitment systems that set </p><p></p><p>common standards for civil servants to meet through, for example, standardised testing. </p><p>These systems were designed to ensure a high degree of professionalisation (as opposed </p><p>to politicisation) of the civil service, and to ensure all applicants are provided with equal </p><p>opportunities. While such systems respond to values of professionalism and equal access, </p><p>they may underperform in a context of competition for particular skill sets. For example, </p><p>standardised testing remains a common mechanism in a majority of OECD countries, but </p><p>the question is whether the testing is appropriately adapted to the skills needed today. Can </p><p>these common recruitment mechanisms be applied to specialist skills, or does their use </p><p>prioritise generalist profiles? It is also not clear how good these mechanisms are at testing </p><p>for the kinds of behavioural, social and cognitive competencies increasingly prioritised by </p><p>OECD countries. </p><p></p><p>Merit systems developed in many OECD countries can also be rather slow to fill </p><p>vacant posts. Among OECD countries, 17 report it taking, on average, longer than three </p><p>months to fill vacancies at senior management levels; 15 countries report the same at </p><p>middle management and 14 at professional levels. This has a negative impact on business </p><p>planning and continuity, and when competing for talent in the labour market. Civil </p><p>services are increasingly competing with other employers for the best and brightest, and it </p><p>is possible many countries are losing out to organisations that can make quicker job offers </p><p>than civil services. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>76 – 2.

Government-wide efforts to attract skills in Korea </p><p></p><p>Since 1999, the Korean government has established an HR database (www.hrdb.go.kr) to </p><p>support government-wide HRM. Currently, data of over 290 000 persons are accumulated, </p><p>covering academic background, job career, permit, publications, and papers. The Ministry of </p><p>Personnel Management (MPM) is in charge of updating and making use of the database, </p><p>targeting the profiles of civil servants (above grade 4-5), high-level staff in public institutions </p><p>and private companies, professors, and experts in diverse fields. Central and local governments, </p><p>and public institutions may ask the MPM to suggest candidates for their vacancies, or they may </p><p>directly search the database under MPM’s approval. </p><p></p><p>After the MPM was established in 2014, the Korean government strengthened its efforts to </p><p>attract talented skills into the government. The MPM hired a civilian expert as the manager to </p><p>find the talented candidates demanded by ministries. The candidates hunted by the MPM were </p><p>either encouraged to apply for job openings, or scouted to appointments by ministries. For </p><p>example, lawyers with a professional background in the field of fair trade and international </p><p>business were respectively recruited by the Korean Fair Trade Commission and the Ministry of </p><p>Foreign Affairs. In 2015, the Korean government launched a portal (www.injae.go.kr) which </p><p>combines over 11 200 government bodies’ posting information, and the recruiting information </p><p>began to be provided through major private job portal companies from 2016.  </p><p></p><p>Source: Information from the Korean Ministry of Personnel Management. </p><p></p><p>The SHRM survey asks about measures taken to have more or less external </p><p>recruitment. At the most senior levels, 11 countries are taking measures to encourage </p><p>more, compared to only four countries that are actively reducing external recruitment. At </p><p>lower levels of the hierarchy, most OECD countries are taking measures to increase or </p><p>decrease levels of external recruitment. This is likely influenced by the ongoing impact of </p><p>the crisis, and suggests the need to ensure the external recruitment taking place is done so </p><p>with a clear strategy to address skills gaps, particularly skills that are harder to develop </p><p>from within.  </p><p></p><p>Recruitment will only help to address skills gaps if the merit-oriented systems are </p><p>aligned and tuned to the specific skills needed. To do this, most countries (26) link </p><p>recruitment to workforce planning. For example, in Australia, before considering any </p><p>recruitment action, agencies must undertake a careful and objective analysis to identify </p><p>whether the position needs to be filled, if it can be accommodated within the agency's </p><p>budgetary limits, and if it is classified correctly. There are also issues around how </p><p>increased expectations of diversity and representation impact merit-oriented recruitment </p><p>systems. It is beyond the scope of this report to address all of these questions, but some </p><p>hints may be readily available from Canada (Box 2.12). </p><p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>2.

Targeting recruitment strategies in the Government of Canada </p><p></p><p>The Government of Canada has identified three strategic goals to guide its recruitment </p><p>activities in support of a strong and productive workforce. </p><p></p><p>First, in response to the growing numbers of millennials shaping the workforce, the </p><p>government is targeting young recruits who are reflective of the full diversity of Canada. Some </p><p>key actions include: </p><p></p><p>• Strengthening post-secondary recruitment through a more co-ordinated and targeted </p><p>annual campaign. </p><p></p><p>• A new web presence to strengthen the public service brand and support recruitment and </p><p>retention. </p><p></p><p>• A high-flyer programme to attract top talent (e.g. Recruitment of Policy Leaders </p><p>programme see Box 2.12).  </p><p></p><p>Second, the government is encouraging innovation in recruitment and staffing through the </p><p>introduction of new internship programmes, simplifying the job application process, and piloting </p><p>new assessment tools. Embedded in these and other actions is the overarching goal of </p><p>strengthening diversity by attracting and retaining larger numbers of Indigenous Canadians and </p><p>other employment equity groups.  </p><p></p><p>Third, the government is strengthening onboarding and retention through improved </p><p>orientation and training sessions, networking, mentoring and immediate feedback from new </p><p>hires. Under the Blueprint 20201 initiative to help guide the evolution of Canada’s public service </p><p>as a world-class institution, the government is making continued progress to harness modern </p><p>workplace tools (e.g. mobile technology, collaborative workspace) and embrace new ways of </p><p>working to support the goal of being agile, creative and innovative. </p><p>1.

Across OECD countries, 17 report the existence </p><p>of fast track or high-flyer programmes (Box 2.12); there is a great deal of diversity across </p><p>these programmes.

Talent management is defined by the Chartered Institute of </p><p>Personnel and Development (CIPD) as “the systematic attraction, identification, </p><p>development, engagement/retention and deployment of those individuals who are of </p><p>particular value to an organisation, either in view of their ‘high potential’ for the future or </p><p>because they are fulfilling business/operational-critical roles” (quoted in Australian </p><p>Government, 2015: 1).

The UK example </p><p>takes a broad scope with a view to supplying talent to a wide range of professional </p><p>streams in the UK civil service. It offers 15 different schemes ranging from generalist to </p><p>digital, economic, project delivery and HR specialists. The UK programme admits around </p><p>1 000 new recruits annually. Denmark’s programme, on the other hand, takes on 16 </p><p>current employees who have already demonstrated high potential for senior leadership </p><p>positions. In all cases these programmes are highly competitive and thereby may ensure </p><p>civil services remain attractive to top talent. For example, Chile’s internships programme </p><p>received over 5 000 applications for 371 positions; Poland’s fast stream programme </p><p>received 367 applications for 35 positions; while the United Kingdom receives, on </p><p>average, 20 000 applications annually. The risk with all talent management programmes </p><p>is it creates elites in the system to which greater opportunities are offered for </p><p>development and advancement. Furthermore, tracking the success of these programmes </p><p>remains a challenge. Box 2.13 summarises the key feature of fast track programmes in </p><p>select OECD countries. </p><p></p><p>Box 2.13. Development programmes to attract talent in various OECD countries </p><p></p><p>The Flemish public service’s HR agency initiated an internal fast-track talents programme </p><p>in order to prepare civil servants for a job in middle management. Once employees with the </p><p>ambition to become head of division put forward their candidacy after an interview with their </p><p>manager, they were invited to several development-based tests. Based on the results of the tests </p><p>and the candidate’s portfolio, 25 talented employees were selected after discussion among </p><p>management committees and the government organisations. Through a mix of learning </p><p>activities, the participants were offered a learning experience lasting a year. Participation offers </p><p>no guarantee of a job, and a selection process remains mandatory. However, it was the first time </p><p>that a potential detection was undertaken on such a large scale by the Flemish Public Service. </p><p>Women were especially encouraged to take part due to an important diversity aim to increase the </p><p>number of talented women in middle management jobs within the Flemish Public Service. </p><p></p><p>The Canadian Recruitment of Policy Leaders (RPL) initiative focuses on recruiting </p><p>exceptional professionals with diverse achievements and experience into mid and senior-level </p><p>policy positions across the Government of Canada. Anyone with a post-graduate degree, record </p><p>of academic excellence or policy experience can apply online during the campaign period. </p><p>Making it into the pool does not guarantee a placement. However, the RPL has a very successful </p><p>rate of placement as the candidates are assigned a mentor to guide them through the final stages </p><p>of the hiring process. Mentors help candidates plan their timeline to begin work, explore options </p><p>to find the right job, and even arrange meetings with the hiring managers responsible for making </p><p>an official offer of employment to candidates.  </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>2.

The school </p><p>annually accepts up to 40 students who have passed four stages of examination on </p><p>knowledge/skills, language, motivation/competencies assessment and interview. In addition, </p><p>during the examination process a survey on voluntary activities is conducted to promote </p><p>candidates experienced in unpaid work for the common good. After the 19 month training </p><p>programme, the graduates are guaranteed employment in public administration at specific key </p><p>posts identified by the Prime Minister. While attracting many university graduates, the </p><p>government not only hires young talent, but has also earned an image as a good employer.

Pre and post-</p><p>assessment tests track the uptake of programme learning, and objectively measure whether and </p><p>how each and every participant has progressed. The programme consists of 10-16 module days, </p><p>and each module includes a variety of learning methods such as classroom teaching, case </p><p>studies, team exercises, group coaching and/or field trips. </p><p></p><p>Estonia: The Management Talents Programme (fast-track programme) was created with the </p><p>aim of attracting young talented graduates from universities to start their career in the public </p><p>service and help them grow towards becoming a future leader. The pilot programme was </p><p>conducted in 2012-2014, and the second programme took place between September 2015 and </p><p>May 2017. The participants are hired to their home ministry, pass several rotations to other </p><p>organisations, participate in group development activities (an extensive development programme </p><p>based on the competency framework of Estonian top civil servants, shorter training, workshops), </p><p>and individual development activities (mentoring, coaching, job shadowing). </p><p></p><p>France: The Interministerial Cycle of State Management aims to create a talent pool of </p><p>future top managers and to train senior deputy directors who are potentially able to become </p><p>directors in the short term. It is developed by the ENA (Ecole Nationale d'Administration) and </p><p>supervised by the Secretray General of the Government and Directorate General for </p><p>Administration and Public Service (DGAFP). Participants are trained during 7-8 months to </p><p>develop their management skills. Specific modules include becoming a director; managing </p><p>efficiency and change; innovation and digital; communicating and convincing; and motivating, </p><p>leading and developing a team. </p><p></p><p>Israel: The Civil Service Cadet Programme intends to build and train a management cadre </p><p>that will catalyse change in the civil service. Each year, this cadre is identified, screened, and </p><p>recruited into a six-year training and placement track, after which each cadet is placed in a key </p><p>position in the civil service. This experience is characterised by an opportunity for the cadets to </p><p>learn topics theoretically in the classroom, and afterwards be able to observe, experience and </p><p>acknowledge these topics on the ground accompanied by various methods, such as study visits </p><p>all over the country and abroad, encounters with people, organisations, perspectives and ideas </p><p>within the society, simulations, case studies, workshops, and peer learning. After a two-year </p><p>period, cadets are placed in a government ministry to work in two positions of influence over </p><p>four years, during which time they build their network and work with other cadets and people in </p><p>positions of influence, authority and leadership to catalyse change. Currently, cadets are placed </p><p>in more than 20 ministries and sub governmental organisations on five different content clusters: </p><p>HRM; social (health, welfare and education); regulations and economy; environment; and </p><p>governance and macro.

The kinds of protections and arrangements for civil servants differ </p><p>from country to country. For the purposes of this discussion, civil servants are those </p><p>employees who are covered under a specific public legal framework or other specific </p><p>provisions.  </p><p></p><p>Some countries report only civil servants employed at the central public </p><p>administration level2 (Canada, Italy, Korea, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland), </p><p>whereas countries such as Sweden and Denmark prefer to hire the vast majority of their </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>2.

Given this diversity of contractual </p><p>relationships, it may not be rare to find civil servants working side-by-side with </p><p>employees on temporary contracts or on loan from other departments.  </p><p></p><p>Significant differences exist in the way civil servants and other public employees are </p><p>managed. Civil servants are generally subject to more job security (19 countries), more </p><p>vigorous recruitment processes (19 countries) more opportunities for career advancement </p><p>(18 countries) and different pay scales (17 countries).  </p><p></p><p>These features were traditionally justified by the kind of work civil servants </p><p>undertook in the name of the “public good”, which demands higher standards for </p><p>accountability, transparency, and ethics to reduce the risk of corruption and/or perceived </p><p>conflicts of interest. Furthermore this requires some level of protection from political </p><p>interference in staffing decisions to ensure that the civil service is able to “speak truth to </p><p>power” and maintain legitimacy in the eyes of the public. For these reasons there has </p><p>traditionally been a focus on transparent, merit-based recruitment and high job security to </p><p>protect from politically motivated firing. This would suggest the assignment of civil </p><p>service status should be based on principles related to the nature of the job (e.g. level of </p><p>risk of corruption, political exposure) as opposed to the nature of the employer.  </p><p></p><p>In some countries, there is evidence the kinds of contracts offered are based on a clear </p><p>assessment of whether these jobs are core to the civil service and require the kinds of </p><p>protections and obligations that come with such positions. Jobs that bestow the holder a </p><p>certain level of public trust (e.g. managing significant public funds) and/or require policy </p><p>advisory skills to “speak truth to power” would more naturally fall under civil service </p><p>protections. There may be very good reasons for identifying certain types of skills that </p><p>would be best contracted through different, more flexible, mechanisms. However, it is </p><p>unclear whether strategic reasoning is driving the variation amongst contracts, or whether </p><p>it is a more haphazard approach based on the historical development of public </p><p>employment. </p><p></p><p>Figure 2.10.

TOWARDS A HIGHLY SKILLED CIVIL SERVICE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>While it is very difficult to find comparative indicators for these kinds of complex </p><p>systems, the OECD asked countries which types of employees (civil servants or other </p><p>public employees) filled which roles (Figure 2.10). The results suggest that in many </p><p>countries, there are few principles which clearly define roles for civil servants, and roles </p><p>for other public employees. For example, at senior management levels, 15 OECD </p><p>countries report both civil servants and other public employees in these posts, while 19 </p><p>countries reserve these positions for civil servants. Policy development roles are reserved </p><p>for civil servants in only 17 countries. Legal experts, service delivery employees, IT </p><p>specialists, and administrative support staff can be employed as civil servants or other </p><p>public employees in most OECD countries. This kind of blurring of functions and </p><p>employment contracts suggests that in many countries, the work undertaken may be less </p><p>of a determinant of an employment contract than other factors, such as historical </p><p>precedent or administrative efficiency. </p><p></p><p>The allocation of employment terms and conditions is still a very under-researched </p><p>phenomenon, and data is scarce; although there is evidence from the SHRM survey that </p><p>12 countries report the use of “other public employees” for specific functions as an </p><p>increasing trend. Estonia and Denmark both present examples of a principle-based </p><p>approach to determining employment relationships. Estonia distinguishes between core </p><p>functions and support functions. In Denmark, civil servants are confined to senior </p><p>managers and judges (see Box 2.14). </p><p></p><p>Box 2.14. The use of "other public employees" in Estonia and Denmark </p><p></p><p>In Estonia, in 2013, a new Civil Service Act entered into force, which also amended the </p><p>definition of an official. According to the new act, staff responsible for "core functions" (policy </p><p>making and implementation) are considered officials. Staff responsible for support functions are </p><p>regular employees, whose employment relations are regulated in the Employment Contract Act. </p><p>The support functions include accounting, human resource work, records management, activities </p><p>of procurement specialists, activities of administrative personnel, activities of information </p><p>technologists and other work in support of the exercise of official authority. The implementation </p><p>of the new law entailed the decrease of the number of officials as support staff are now </p><p>considered regular employees. </p><p></p><p>Persons working in the central government in Denmark are, in general, employed under </p><p>collective agreements or as civil servants. Some individual personnel groups are employed </p><p>according to regulations, and in a small number of cases, employment is based on individual </p><p>contracts. Since 1 January 2001, appointment as a civil servant is confined to positions specified </p><p>in a circular of 11 December 2000, amended by a circular of 17 June 2009, on the application of </p><p>civil servant employment in the state sector and the national church. Accordingly, it is typically </p><p>senior managers, judges and police and prison staff who are employed as civil servants. Other </p><p>groups are typically employed on collective agreement terms. Consequently, over the years there </p><p>has been a significant drop in the number of appointments as civil servants. </p><p></p><p>Source: Submitted through the 2016 Survey on Strategic Human Resource Management in Central/Federal </p><p>Governments of OECD countries. </p><p></p><p>A number of countries have also developed special mechanisms to bring highly </p><p>skilled individuals into the government at senior levels to work on special projects.

TOWARDS A HIGHLY SKILLED CIVIL SERVICE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>This section looks at the role of learning and skills development and makes the </p><p>following key points: </p><p></p><p>• Different institutional structures exist to manage and oversee civil service </p><p>training, and various approaches exist to align training at individual organisational </p><p>and civil service levels. What is important is that training and development is </p><p>organised and aligned to the core priorities of the civil service, ideally to the civil </p><p>service vision and competency frameworks identified above, but also to future </p><p>priorities such as foresight, innovation, and digital skills. </p><p></p><p>• Countries that combine individual learning incentives (e.g. learning plans linked </p><p>to performance management processes) and organisational plans (organisational </p><p>or civil service-wide plans) are more likely to be able to ensure civil servants </p><p>receive the training they need, and training provision is effectively co-ordinated. </p><p></p><p>• Developing a learning culture in the public sector will require much more than </p><p>well-coordinated training. Leadership development and online training are the two </p><p>highest priorities for OECD countries in terms of learning and development, and </p><p>these may help, but countries will also need to use a broader range of tools, such </p><p>as mentoring, coaching, networking, peer learning and mobility assignments to </p><p>promote learning as a day-to-day activity integrated into the jobs of civil servants. </p><p></p><p>Governance of civil service learning </p><p>The institutional oversight of skills development in the civil service tends to fall under </p><p></p><p>the responsibility of the central HR authority in most (21) OECD countries, although in </p><p>many countries the primary responsibility for training and development is delegated to </p><p>individual ministries and agencies, making it difficult to get a broad snapshot of the wider </p><p>landscape (Figure 2.15). In Australia, for example, a Secretaries’ Board guides the work </p><p>programme of the Centre for Leadership and Learning, which is the Australian Public </p><p>Service’s central training institution; while oversight arrangements vary for agency-level </p><p>learning and training. In Canada, some common learning activities are overseen by the </p><p>Treasury Board Secretariat and the Canada School of Public Service, while individual </p><p>departments also play a significant role in training within their organisation.  </p><p></p><p>Moving from the oversight function to the promotion, co-ordination and </p><p>administration of learning, OECD countries split relatively evenly into three groups. </p><p>Eleven countries report the existence of a single institution within government; for </p><p>example, the National School of Administration in Italy, or Portugal’s Institute for Public </p><p>Administration. Twelve countries report shared responsibilities by several governmental </p><p>institutions, while 12 others report delegation to the ministry/agency level (Box 2.16). </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>2.

For example, countries that employ </p><p>individual training plans may emphasise development as a responsibility of employees in </p><p>the management of their own careers, whereas countries that emphasise organisational </p><p>plans are likely to have delegated training provision to organisations and see training as a </p><p>requirement to ensure organisational capacity. A number of countries combine these </p><p>approaches, looking for synergies based on individual need, organisational capacity to </p><p>meet that need, and government-wide objectives. Korea’s Ministry of Personnel </p><p>Management is charged with setting standards that trickle down through organisations to </p><p>the individual civil servant (Box 2.18). </p><p></p><p>Box 2.18. Development planning and co-ordination in Korea </p><p></p><p>Since 1973, the Korean government has used a government-wide HRD strategy, which is </p><p>applied to all civil servants. Related law and regulations require the Korean Ministry of </p><p>Personnel Management (MPM) to establish a civil service wide HR development strategy which </p><p>is applied to all central government ministries and their training institutes. The strategy is </p><p>updated every year and includes HR development goals, priorities on the year’s education and </p><p>training contents, and guidelines on each ministry and training institute’s programmes and </p><p>policies. </p><p></p><p>Following the MPM strategy, each ministry develops their own training plan based on </p><p>research and surveys on HR development needs; this began after the 1998 amendment of the </p><p>civil service HRD law. MPM supports this process by providing HRD research results, sharing </p><p>HRD models and practices, providing education modules and materials, and even providing </p><p>consulting staff. The organisational plan contains the details necessary for operating each </p><p>ministry’s annual training programmes, and includes regulations on staff skills development and </p><p>the development of an individual self-development plan. The ministries’ affiliated training </p><p>institutes also establish an annual HRD plan. Ministries and affiliated training institutes’ </p><p>organisational training plans are reported to MPM early every year. </p><p></p><p>While following the organisational training plan, each ministry allows each civil servant to </p><p>draft an annual self-development plan. Individuals set up annual development objectives, which </p><p>are harmonised with individual career and organisational target and priorities. After consultation </p><p>with superiors or HRD officers in each ministry, they’re invited to participate in offline or online </p><p>programmes from diverse training institutes, obtain degrees or certificates, join academic or </p><p>professional seminars, organise or join study groups, and read work-related books. The ministry </p><p>monitors each individuals’ practice twice a year, and performance is reflected in promotion.

This means </p><p>developing organisations that motivate employees to be curious, ask questions, enquire </p><p>and learn. Organisations must provide quality learning opportunities for all civil servants, </p><p>and see these as essential components of their profession.

Leadership development in select countries </p><p></p><p>Australia’s Centre for Leadership and Learning defines leadership as mobilising others to </p><p>make progress on challenges and setting the culture of their workplaces. Leadership </p><p>development is self-transformative learning that supports an individual to understand behaviours </p><p>and consciously apply practices that expand responses and capabilities. Transforming daily </p><p>leadership practices requires a shift in self-concept as a leader and of leadership itself. Achieving </p><p>this shift requires sustained effort, ongoing opportunities for practice and experimentation, and </p><p>time for reflection.  </p><p></p><p>The Centre offers intensive leadership development for the four most senior levels of the </p><p>hierarchy. All development offered by the Centre is designed so that it: 1) includes opportunities </p><p>to reinforce learning over time using a range of interventions; 2) balances opportunities for on-</p><p>the-job learning, peer-based learning and classroom learning; 3) draws appropriately on the </p><p>Knowing Doing Being Framework (see the APS Leadership and Core Skills Strategy 2014-15); </p><p>and 4) draws on the best practitioners in their field whose work is recognised internationally. </p><p></p><p>Belgium’s Training Institute of the Federal Administration (TIFA) offers an intensive </p><p>development programme to managers at all management levels. Within this programme, TIFA </p><p>aims to empower managers in their own development process by using co-creation. It aims to </p><p>explore the wealth of experience and know-how already present within the groups by </p><p>maximising peer learning. TIFA also aims to create a network of managers within and between </p><p>federal organisations who support one another, give each other advice and share experiences and </p><p>best practices. Each year, 210 managers in the federal civil service are chosen and grouped </p><p>according to the challenges they face. The programme consists of 12 days of classroom training </p><p>over 12 months, and is tailor made to the needs of the group. In all cases, the programme </p><p>addresses management and leadership skills, especially coaching and feedback skills; raising </p><p>self-awareness and self-confidence; and networking and community-building.  </p><p></p><p>Belgium also runs a “mindful leadership programme” called In Vivo. This programme </p><p>targets 220 high level managers every year and includes: 20 days of learning focused on mindful </p><p>leadership, group dynamics and group mediation, process facilitation, coaching, and </p><p>organisational development; 7 days of peer coaching focused on mindful leadership and solution </p><p>focused coaching; 4 days of mindfulness training; and various individual coaching sessions.  </p><p></p><p>The Canada School of Public Service delivers modernised executive development learning </p><p>and leadership training, including programmes for new and aspiring managers and executives. </p><p>Two new leadership development programmes, one for senior executives and one intermediate </p><p>executives, were launched in 2016 to accelerate the development of promising executives, </p><p>particularly those from under-represented groups, including women, indigenous people, and </p><p>early-career executives. These programmes combine: on-the-job training, formal and informal </p><p>learning, experiential learning and community building opportunities. Each participant in these </p><p>programmes has an individualised plan informed by information from talent and performance </p><p>management cycles and psychometric assessments (track record interview, 360 evaluation, etc.). </p><p>Learning includes a common learning component over a 12-month period, and on-the-job </p><p>learning (or job placement) for some individuals. Both programmes maximise exchange between </p><p>participants, networking opportunities and mentoring relationships. Additionally, participants </p><p>teach each other by sharing their learning and insights with other public servants via </p><p>programmes and events. </p><p></p><p>Estonia provides training programmes for middle management and for top managers </p><p>separately. The Newton programme was created and run by the Top Civil Service Excellence </p><p>Centre to ensure a highly competent and motivated new generation of top executives in the civil </p><p>service.  </p><p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>2.

Leadership development in select countries (cont.) </p><p></p><p>The objectives of the programme are: to systematically develop the management </p><p>competencies of civil servants with leadership potential and to prepare potential future top </p><p>executives for the Estonian civil service; to encourage the participants to link their future plans </p><p>with the civil service and increase their readiness to take on more responsibility in their </p><p>respective areas of work; and to form common values and develop teamwork skills. The target </p><p>group of previous Newton programmes had been limited to middle-level managers and top </p><p>professionals in the civil service; however, this is now being expanded to a wider range of public </p><p>agencies and organisations. The Newton programme is based on the competency framework of </p><p>Estonian top civil servants and focuses on the challenges faced by the civil service in an </p><p>international context. The programme combines theoretical/academic and practical approaches </p><p>to offer participants the opportunity to learn (knowledge), develop their skills (skills) and </p><p>become a better leader (attitudes). The programme involves people from the public, private and </p><p>third sectors, from both Estonia and abroad, to share their knowledge and experiences and act as </p><p>inspiring role models. The approach to topics and the selection of methods is innovative and </p><p>diverse, with a particular focus on active learning and teamwork. Participants are offered </p><p>individual support and advice, as well as feedback, during the entire programme. The </p><p>programme lasts for about a year (160-180 academic hours). </p><p></p><p>Middle managers are a priority target group because they are the key players in spreading </p><p>common values and implementing change in a decentralised civil service. The competency </p><p>framework of Estonian mid-level managers is based on five core competencies that form the </p><p>basis for their training and development: 1) area development; 2) leadership; 3) personal </p><p>development; 4) process management; and 5) communication and co-operation. The programme </p><p>offers a unique combination of development support, practical exercises and training. It also </p><p>strives to unify the understanding of the middle level manager role by promoting trans-</p><p>organisational co-operation and creating communication networks. The programme has offered a </p><p>number of concrete ideas for management improvement in different government institutions. </p><p>During the programme, participants jointly solve concrete policy-making problems, which </p><p>contributes to the reforms taking place in real time. </p><p></p><p>Estonia’s Top Civil Service Excellence Centre of the Government Office was established to </p><p>provide centralised support in relation to the recruitment, selection, development and assessment </p><p>of 96 top executives in the civil service. In 2015, the Government Office of Estonia, in </p><p>collaboration with the Ministry of Finance of Finland, launched a one-year joint development </p><p>programme, Innovation Boot Camp for Public Sector Leaders, with the aim of developing </p><p>innovation capacity in both public sectors. The results of the programme encouraged the </p><p>development of a new programme concept for an international target group, in which top </p><p>executives of central government from four countries are invited to participate. The main aim of </p><p>the programme is to develop innovation capacity among the top leaders of the public service, </p><p>thereby fostering new opportunities to solve complex problems and increase the states’ strategic </p><p>agility.

It is perhaps surprising that while so many countries prioritise leadership </p><p>development, fewer prioritise coaching, which seems to be an ideal tool for such </p><p>development. It could be argued that these are the kinds of activities required to transition </p><p>from traditional training to a learning culture. A comparison of these findings with the </p><p>competencies prioritised in competency frameworks may provide an opportunity for </p><p>reflection. Most would likely agree that the top competencies (achieving results, values </p><p>and ethics, leadership, strategic thinking, communication etc.) would not easily be </p><p>developed through online courses, but would require a more experiential approach. Box </p><p>2.20 shows how coaching across countries has been implemented in the Netherlands and </p><p>Belgium’s Flemish regional government. </p><p></p><p>Box 2.20. Coaching as a means to developing top leaders in the Flemish and Dutch </p><p>civil service </p><p></p><p>The Flemish Public Service has set up a joint training programme with the Dutch Public </p><p>Service, whereby top managers are trained in coaching colleagues. This enables cross-border </p><p>peer coaching, which has a number of advantages, such as allowing peers to draw on a wealth of </p><p>experience as top managers of public organisations. Sometimes an external perspective is needed </p><p>to challenge perceptions and to ensure a greater sense of confidential and honest sharing; </p><p>coaching over the border can appeal to both of these expectations. Through the joint coaching </p><p>training peers also become familiar with the other country’s customs and governance styles.  </p><p></p><p>The coaching approach within the Flemish Public Service is enhanced because coaching has </p><p>a positive effect on the leadership style and culture in public organisations. Top managers’ </p><p>attitudes towards coaching, learning and development influences the culture of an organisation. </p><p>Scientific research points out that top managers also benefit themselves from coaching. They </p><p>become more effective in their daily work and are better able to guide their co-workers. Internal </p><p>coaching within the Flemish civil service has been more accepted, and the number of internal </p><p>coaching sessions has increased. </p><p></p><p>A supportive factor for coaching by top managers is that top managers realised that they also </p><p>benefited from coaching training and coaching colleagues as it gave them the opportunity to hold </p><p>a mirror up to themselves, and helped improve their interpersonal skills, listening capability and </p><p>self-confidence. </p><p></p><p>It is important that the co-ordinator of the coaching pool invests in the learning process of </p><p>the top managers/coaches, otherwise they become more advisers then coaches. Installing </p><p>supervision, workshops and lectures on coaching are necessary.  </p><p></p><p>About 15 employees from the Netherlands and Flanders have been matched to a coach from </p><p>the other country.

The programme by TIFA, the training </p><p>institute of the Belgian Federal Authority, provides a tailor-made approach for organisations to </p><p>develop hard skills for managers and management support. Learning takes place in a classroom </p><p>environment (which is very expensive), as well as online, in the workplace, together with </p><p>colleagues as experts, and in networks where good and bad practices are exchanged.  </p><p></p><p>For every management technique, TIFA offers three kinds of training: Self Service, Co-Lab </p><p>and Academy. </p><p></p><p>The Self Service is an open webpage on an e-learning platform www.ecampus.ofoifa.be. </p><p>Every person wanting to know how a certain management technique is (likely to be) used in the </p><p>federal administration can access at any time the available reference material in relation to that </p><p>management technique. All articles, checklists, videos, useful links, exercises and cases are </p><p>carefully selected by the trainers, who are federal experts, and are relevant for a public context.  </p><p></p><p>The Co-Labs are interactive training sessions of one or two days for federal civil servants </p><p>who already know the basics of management techniques. These include managers, collaborators </p><p>of management support teams, and project leaders (or destined to be) involved with management </p><p>techniques. The main aim is to learn from each other through cases, exercises, feedback and </p><p>hands on tips. The trainer, who is a federal civil servant and expert, coaches and explains the </p><p>basics. In order to participate in the Co-lab, an entry test is required to prove the civil servant’s </p><p>ability to manage the material of the Self-Service.  </p><p></p><p>The Academy offers expert support regarding a concrete project. Project teams can present </p><p>their project related to a determined management technique. Once selected, a full year of training </p><p>and intensive support is provided.

This programme was the </p><p>first Italian experiment of the social enterprise model applied to a public administration. </p><p>The programme began in May 2015 and ended in October 2015. It was addressed to 167 </p><p>managers of the regional government of Lazio and was part of an organisational </p><p>development strategy for regional managers designed to ensure achievement of the </p><p>administration’s strategic objectives. The innovative elements were the use of games as </p><p>a training tool and Yammer, an online platform designed to encourage co-operation.  </p><p></p><p>2. Agorà: talking to the internal and external client. This programme was addressed to </p><p>regional officials. It was part of a strategy to change culture and management styles, </p><p>with the emphasis on: becoming more inter-functional; improving dialogue within the </p><p>organisation among colleagues and with the outside world; creating and exploiting </p><p>synergies; and developing problem-solving skills in a horizontal and integrated manner. </p><p>From the methodological standpoint, the use of the “Moodle” e-learning platform </p><p>proved a useful and innovative teaching tool that enabled the trainees to create a </p><p>community for discussions, sharing ideas and solutions and accessing learning </p><p>materials. The numbers confirm that the “Agorà” training programme was successful as </p><p>it was attended by 1 022 participants, 70% of the target audience. </p><p></p><p>3. World Café for the Digital Agenda. This programme, which involved 1 600 </p><p>employees from the central and peripheral offices of the region, is part of the strategy </p><p>for achieving a “Digital Lazio by 2020”. The aim of the digital agenda is to turn the </p><p>regional administration into a body capable of making the most of the opportunities </p><p>offered by the Internet and technology, with a view to ensuring sustainable and lasting </p><p>development for its citizens.  </p><p></p><p>The regional digital agenda can be broken down into five areas of intervention, two of which </p><p>are a top priority for this training initiative: open and intelligent digital administration, and </p><p>citizenship and digital skills. Through the World Café, the regional government of Lazio offered </p><p>human resources departments a communication and training project geared to promoting a </p><p>systemic and massive diffusion of digital agenda issues, focused on participation, openness and </p><p>co-operation between citizens and administration. The programme began in October 2015 and </p><p>ended in February 2016. It included 20 World Café sessions, each of which involved about 100 </p><p>employees broken down into ten groups. Thanks to the facilitation tool, constructive </p><p>conversations were stimulated on complex projects in a concrete, exciting and productive </p><p>manner, with a special focus on efficiency of internal processes, involvement of citizens, and </p><p>improvement of services. </p><p></p><p>The 1 600 regional employees who participated in this programme offered an abundance of </p><p>meaningful contributions that were later analysed and summarised by the project team. This </p><p>material formed the basis of a questionnaire to assess how urgent the various project proposals </p><p>were perceived. The material was organised and systematically developed into an online </p><p>questionnaire, made up of 63 items, that was submitted to the participants of World Café for </p><p>further assessment in terms of urgency, desirability and feasibility. </p><p></p><p>Source: Submitted by the Italian Ministry of Public Administration. </p><p></p><p>A learning culture requires more than access to formal training: skills development in </p><p>the civil service needs to look beyond formal training to include broader learning </p><p>opportunities and the streamlining of learning into everyday work.

This work underlines the importance of considering the following key </p><p>points related to an organisation’s purpose, as well as its openness, capacity and </p><p>capability for learning. These points can be used to develop a checklist of elements that </p><p>contribute to an organisational learning culture (OECD, forthcoming): </p><p></p><p>• Purpose: without an established purpose, it will be difficult for an organisation to </p><p>know what it is learning and innovating for. </p><p></p><p>• Openness: organisations operate in an interconnected world, where more is </p><p>happening outside than within an organisation. Learning will be enhanced where </p><p>there is external engagement. </p><p></p><p>• Openness (diversity): diversity enables learning from different experiences, to </p><p>come up with new insights and ideas, and to understand the problems where </p><p>innovation is needed. </p><p></p><p>• Openness (service orientation): clients/customers/beneficiaries of public sector </p><p>organisations can be a rich source of learning, and organisations can promote </p><p>engagement and the use of tools to learn about and from these stakeholders.  </p><p></p><p>• Capacity (absorptive capacity): learning and innovation build on what has gone </p><p>before, and lessons will only make sense in context and with experience. This </p><p>suggests the need for moments of reflection based on past experience. </p><p></p><p>• Capacity (tolerance for risk and failure): some of the best learning comes from </p><p>experiences that didn’t work out as planned. This requires risk management </p><p>systems which are able to capture lessons effectively. </p><p></p><p>• Capability (leadership): learning takes time and resources. Leadership at all levels </p><p>is required to articulate learning as a core priority and provide the space and tools </p><p>necessary to make it happen. </p><p></p><p>• Capability (empowerment): learning and innovation depends on some degree of </p><p>autonomy and empowerment. </p><p></p><p>• Capability (infrastructure and processes): learning is a core function and needs to </p><p>be resourced with the right systems, tools and expertise. </p><p></p><p>• Capability (understanding systems): learning takes place in complex systems. An </p><p>understanding of the wider systems is needed in order to learn what the </p><p>underlying problems are and the full impact of responses. </p><p></p><p>• X-Factor: every organisation is different. There will be something specific to each </p><p>organisation that will impact the learning and innovation needs. </p><p></p><p>Several countries are prioritising the development of learning cultures that address </p><p>many of the themes highlighted by the OPSI report (Box 2.23). These countries generally </p><p>combine training with broader leadership and governance approaches to position learning </p><p>as part of everyone’s job. For example, Australia combines learning on the job with </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>98 – 2. TOWARDS A HIGHLY SKILLED CIVIL SERVICE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>opportunities for advanced university degrees. The Flemish Government in Belgium has </p><p>developed events to encourage employees to teach each other. </p><p></p><p>Box 2.23. Learning culture development in Australia, Ireland, Finland and </p><p>Flanders </p><p></p><p>A number of approaches are being taken to develop a learning culture in the Australian </p><p>Public Service (APS), including reinforcing the expectation that learning is part of everyone’s </p><p>job in the APS Leadership and Core Skills Strategy. To support the development of a learning </p><p>culture, the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) has published a guide to learning on </p><p>the job, a practical resource to help employees identify suitable and effective workplace </p><p>development opportunities aligned with their career aspirations and development needs. A </p><p>learning culture is also nurtured through other post-graduate opportunities, including Masters </p><p>and Graduate Diploma level qualifications through the Australia New Zealand School of </p><p>Government and the Public Sector Management Program, respectively. In Australia, there are a </p><p>number of successful communities for skills development from sharing practices and </p><p>experiences. The Centre for Leadership and Learning actively supports a number of groups </p><p>which bring practitioners from across the APS together to share, learn and make progress on </p><p>common challenges. The Core Skills Reference Group brings together APS learning and </p><p>development practitioners to workshop solutions for the core skills development priorities. The </p><p>Talent Management Working Group brings together talent management practitioners to share </p><p>practices and workshop solutions. </p><p></p><p>In Ireland, the Civil Service Management Board recently approved the new Learning and </p><p>Development Shared Model, which sets out a new blended approach to learning underpinned by </p><p>a digital platform supporting administration, delivery and procurement. It includes a civil service </p><p>Learning and Development (L&D) Centre with responsibility for core L&D policy development </p><p>and implementation, departmental business partners and decision makers who work </p><p>collaboratively with the L&D Centre, a new head of L&D role with responsibility for L&D for </p><p>the entire civil service, and an interactive online L&D delivery and support system. The L&D </p><p>Centre’s responsibilities include compiling statistics and reports on civil service skills, and </p><p>initiating an annual skills audit and review. Departments are expected to have detailed </p><p>knowledge on the range of skill sets and capacity within their organisation, and to address the </p><p>gaps while drafting their workforce plan.  </p><p></p><p>Since the Finnish government administration is based on a position system (open </p><p>recruitment) there cannot be any kind of formal career management that identifies potential early </p><p>in an employee’s career. However, the government encourages civil servants to develop </p><p>themselves and be mobile. In this regard, the Ministry of Finance organised a special Future </p><p>Leaders training programme for government administration managers in order to enhance </p><p>common corporate culture. In general, participants are considered to be potential future leaders. </p><p>The programme is also targeted at senior civil servants who have recently being nominated to </p><p>their offices, and especially those who have come from outside the government administration. </p><p>The Ministry of Finance has organised 10 Future Leaders courses with more than 280 </p><p>participants since 2008. The programme was evaluated in 2015 and received excellent feedback </p><p>from participants and other interest groups. In 2016, the ministry decided to reform the </p><p>programme and organise two pilot programmes with different course structures and training </p><p>methods. The main reasons for this reform were: 1) to get more impact through more </p><p>participants (50 participants in a year instead of previous 25); 2) to update the contents </p><p>considering the big changes in the operating environment; and 3) to experiment and design new </p><p>training methods and tools. On the basis on these pilot programmes, the ministry organised a </p><p>new programme in 2017. The main goals of the new Future Leaders programme are to </p><p>strengthen professional management and strategic competencies, to strengthen the value basis </p><p>and common starting points among the civil service, and to promote courageous leadership and </p><p>sensitivity to the future. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>2.

Learning culture development in Australia, Ireland, Finland and </p><p>Flanders (cont.) </p><p></p><p>The Flemish Public Service (Belgium) arranges an annual “Train your colleague” week. </p><p>The aim during this week is for staff members to follow knowledge-sharing sessions designed by </p><p>one of their colleagues. The idea is very simple, as everybody has work-related knowledge, </p><p>experience and talents from which colleagues can learn. Train Your Colleague stimulates staff </p><p>members to teach their colleagues something about a work-related subject that is important to </p><p>them through short initiatives. In 2014 and in 2015, 22 organisations and the Flemish Parliament </p><p>participated in Train Your Colleague week. Some 200 knowledge-sharing sessions were </p><p>organised each time, reaching more than 1 000 staff members. The sessions organised were </p><p>gradually opened to colleagues from other organisations within the Flemish Public Service. In </p><p>2015, half of the sessions were open to participants from the whole Flemish Public Service.  </p><p></p><p>Source: Case studies provided by delegates of the Public Employment and Management Working Party. </p><p></p><p>Using skills: Getting the most from investments in skills </p><p></p><p>Once skills are identified, acquired and developed, they will not have an impact </p><p>unless they are deployed in a system designed to make use of them. A well-known theory </p><p>of human performance says employees need three things in order to perform well: </p><p>abilities, motivation and opportunity. Most of this report has focused on the first two, but </p><p>without consideration of the second two, skills will not translate to performance.  </p><p></p><p>Recent OECD research on productivity in national economies emphasises two </p><p>significant relevant findings. First, skills match is a significant concern, and getting the </p><p>match right at the firm level can have an impact on productivity (OECD, 2015). </p><p>According to analysis conducted by the US Partnership for Public Service in 2016, only </p><p>56 % of US federal employees agreed that their talents are well used in the workplace, </p><p>which is a concern given the private sector scores, on average, over 20 points higher.3  </p><p></p><p>In another study (OECD, 2016c), the OECD finds that rather than the abundance of </p><p>skills in an economy, industry or firm that drives productivity, it is how intensively those </p><p>skills are used. One of the highest predictors of skills use is the existence of high </p><p>performance work practices, which include workforce management practices such as, </p><p>“the extent of team work, autonomy, task discretion, mentoring, job rotation and applying </p><p>new learning [which] influences the degree of internal flexibility to adapt job tasks to the </p><p>skills of new hires” (OECD, 2016c: 96). </p><p></p><p>This highlights a key challenge for all organisations, but one that may be particularly </p><p>difficult for public sector bureaucracies: how to make the best use of the skills they have </p><p>once they are attracted and developed? This section raises a number of ideas to address </p><p>this question, and makes the following key points: </p><p></p><p>• Skills match is very difficult to assess, but some countries are using employee </p><p>surveys as a source of insight. Employee surveys can also provide insight into a </p><p>range of other factors related to skills use, such as engagement and workplace </p><p>health issues. </p><p></p><p>• Mobility and agility are important factors. Ensuring opportunities for horizontal </p><p>mobility enables some skill sets to be shared across institutions, while vertical </p><p>mobility through career paths can help to ensure that people with in-demand skill </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>100 – 2. TOWARDS A HIGHLY SKILLED CIVIL SERVICE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>sets are organised in ways that allow them to develop, grow and put their skills to </p><p>best use. Some civil services have developed shared talent pools to ensure that </p><p>hard-to-find skills are available, even if temporarily, across the whole civil </p><p>service. </p><p></p><p>• Talent management programmes and the use of high performance work practices </p><p>are possibly the most valuable, but the hardest to implement as they rely </p><p>fundamentally on the quality of the management cadre in the civil service. </p><p></p><p>Assessing skills mismatch and employee engagement with employee surveys </p><p></p><p>All but 5 OECD countries use some form of employee survey, although only 14 </p><p>countries are using their employee surveys to identify skills mismatch. For example, to </p><p>assess if the Government of Canada is putting skills to best use, the Office of the Chief </p><p>Human Resources Officer has conducted the Public Service Employee Survey every three </p><p>years since 1999. The survey measures employees’ opinions in relation to employee </p><p>engagement, leadership, the workforce and the workplace. Employees are asked whether </p><p>their job fits with their skills, whether they receive the training they need, and whether </p><p>they think that the people hired can do the job (Figure 2.16). </p><p></p><p>Figure 2.16.

Each of these themes indicates employees are able to contribute their skills, </p><p>knowledge and energy in a positive way to their work environment. OECD (2016b) </p><p>explores how employee engagement contributes to civil service performance. The report </p><p>suggests leadership and management capability on the one hand, and modern, integrated </p><p>HRM on the other, play an essential role in promoting employee engagement to create an </p><p>atmosphere where employees are supported to perform at their best. While the knowledge </p><p>base for this type of evidence-driven HRM is still young, this report presents some good </p><p>practices and strategies for addressing and improving engagement: </p><p></p><p>• Regular employee surveys to measure and benchmark engagement and its drivers.  </p><p></p><p>• Customised reports for managers that benchmark their units’ scores against </p><p>similar units, their organisation, and the civil service average. </p><p></p><p>• Follow-up processes to develop action plans endorsed by individual managers, </p><p>with support from engagement specialists in central units (e.g. HRM authority). </p><p>To be successful, such plans generally need to include: </p><p></p><p> Clear and transparent commitment and accountability from the top leadership </p><p>of the organisation.  </p><p></p><p> Good two-way communication between employees and management through </p><p>multiple channels. </p><p></p><p> Meaningful opportunities for employees to contribute to workplace </p><p>improvements.  </p><p></p><p> Support to managers to develop action plans that improve their relationship </p><p>with their employees.  </p><p></p><p> HRM policies, strategies and tools which support employee well-being, </p><p>development and performance at all stages of the career cycle. </p><p></p><p>Mobility and agility </p><p>Workforce agility can help to match skills with positions by ensuring civil service </p><p></p><p>systems can effectively (re)allocate human capacity to emerging needs. Workforce agility </p><p>depends on effective workforce planning mechanisms and internal mobility, which </p><p>remain a challenge to promote effectively. In 2016, most (27) OECD countries reported </p><p>plans to increase internal mobility within their public administration, although only 12 </p><p>reported an actual increase of internal mobility between 2010 and 2016. Of the 27 </p><p>countries planning to increase mobility, 14 plan to use incentives and promote the </p><p>recognition of benefits of mobility. However, fewer countries have made lateral mobility </p><p>a prerequisite for upwards mobility: 10 reported mobility as an important factor for </p><p>promotion to senior management, eight to middle management, and only six countries </p><p>suggested mobility is a factor for promotion in professional positions. Some countries </p><p>have developed specific rotation programmes, described in Box 2.24, with a view to both </p><p>developing skills and matching people with skills to the right jobs. </p><p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>102 – 2.

The Interchange Canada Policy has been used to </p><p>facilitate movement between the federal government and provinces or territories, private </p><p>business, non-profit organisations, academia, and aboriginal organisations both within Canada </p><p>and internationally. Interchange assignments can be used to develop leadership competencies </p><p>through the use of assignments to organisations where specific experience could bridge the </p><p>skills-building gap. Interchange Canada can serve as an excellent means of temporarily attaining </p><p>skills unavailable in the home organisation and for building and transferring knowledge to </p><p>enhance internal capacity both within government and in other sectors. Furthermore, Interchange </p><p>Canada directly supports several government priorities such as recruiting mobile young </p><p>professionals, attracting mid-career specialists, and increasing interaction with non-government </p><p>organisations. </p><p></p><p>Denmark’s National Centre for Public Sector Innovation (COI) organised its first national </p><p>innovation internship in September 2015.

Common </p><p>standards and skills profiles are being developed for each function. Ireland is developing </p><p>career paths for their HR professionals, which, once established, may prove to be a model </p><p>for other professions, including ICT. Estonia has a long-term practice of administering </p><p>civil service co-operation networks of HRM managers and specialists. There are several </p><p>regular network activities and events that provide a platform for sharing best practice and </p><p>discussing ongoing reform initiatives.  </p><p></p><p>Some skill sets can be organised centrally and managed as a government-wide </p><p>resource. Various approaches to shared service centres and functional centres of expertise </p><p>are being implemented for certain technical functions and those that have a more natural </p><p>horizontal fit. These can be static (e.g. data warehousing) or dynamic (e.g. mobilising </p><p>legal drafters to departments with big reform programmes planned). For example, 27 </p><p>countries report the existence of one or more centralised unit to support public sector </p><p>innovation in civil services. Centralising the use of some skills sets and making them </p><p>available to the civil service more broadly may be an effective way of managing scarce </p><p>skills across organisations. Online platforms can help identify and manage skills pools </p><p>(Box 2.25). </p><p></p><p>Box 2.25.  Online platforms to make the best use of public skills in Belgium, </p><p>Canada, and France </p><p></p><p>Radar, the loaning service for talent, is a platform that brings together the supply and </p><p>demand for temporary assignments. All staff members of the Flemish public service can create a </p><p>profile and enter their talents. In addition, Flemish public service administrations can create and </p><p>launch assignments. All assignments have a temporary character. The size of the assignments </p><p>differ, and interested staff can do something different either permanently during a certain period </p><p>or for a certain percentage of the time. Radar works without mediation: thanks to a contemporary </p><p>design with an easy-access social-media experience, supply and demand find each other. Staff </p><p>members respond to published assignments and entities contact interesting profiles. After </p><p>approval from the managers, further agreements are made including the evaluation of the staff </p><p>member and discussions concerning the length, form, remuneration and employment conditions </p><p>of the contract. Radar starts from a talent approach, with staff members entering their skills. In </p><p>response, they can either be contacted or can search for assignments that match their talents. The </p><p>focus is not on doing something different, but on learning and taking the insights acquired into a </p><p>job. </p><p></p><p>“Jobs Marketplace” is a newly launched public service-wide Internet forum that serves as a </p><p>“one-stop shop” for employees to network professionally across the Canadian departments. It is </p><p>intended for staff mobility, as well as casual employment, students seeking employment </p><p>opportunities, micro-mission opportunities and a reference page to other sources of talent that </p><p>managers and human resource professionals can explore, including active pools of pre-qualified </p><p>employees from across the public service. Jobs Marketplace can also be used as a tool to </p><p>facilitate alternations during workforce adjustment situations. Jobs Marketplace will soon </p><p>include an automated matching tool, the Career ConneXions Opportunities Platform. This is a </p><p>tool that quickly matches opportunities with talented employees by leveraging the content in </p><p>employees’ online profiles.  </p><p></p><p>“SCORE” is the portal aimed at those who wish to join the French State civil service and </p><p>agents looking for professional evolution. It contains information on the different ways of </p><p>recruitment by competitive examination (external, internal, third competition, professional </p><p>competition, competition on title and works, single competition) or professional examination, on </p><p>recruitment without competition, and by way of “access to the careers of the territorial, hospital </p><p>and state civil service (PACTE)”, as well as the trades offered by the civil service of the state.  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>104 – 2.

It is about identifying </p><p>employees with high potential and ensuring they are developed and assigned to stretch </p><p>positions that put their talent to best use and enable them to grow. Good talent </p><p>management can result in the better retention of talent and ensure investments in the </p><p>development of high potential accrue back to the public service by reducing the need for </p><p>costly hiring. This can be particularly important during times of budgetary constraints to </p><p>counterbalance the loss of top talent through, for example, voluntary departure schemes.  </p><p></p><p>Talent management is different from the way most civil services approach career </p><p>development as it emphasises career progression based on future potential, not only past </p><p>performance. Past performance is not always an indicator of future potential, and this </p><p>approach helps to avoid situations where employees are promoted into positions for </p><p>which they are not ready. Good talent management also recognises not all careers need to </p><p>progress upwards, but employees may wish to move laterally to keep their motivation </p><p>high.  </p><p></p><p>A number of OECD countries are implementing talent management approaches. In </p><p>Canada’s federal public service, deputy ministers meet annually to discuss talent </p><p>management and consider promising leaders’ career progression across the public service. </p><p>The Australian Public Service Commission has developed a talent management guide for </p><p>its ministries and agencies and advises the establishment of talent councils in each </p><p>organisation.

The eight pilot projects </p><p>met these criteria: </p><p></p><p>• Reflected the vision of talent policy of the Flemish Public Service. </p><p></p><p>• There was a commitment between the manager, the HR business partner and the staff </p><p>members involved to learn from the project and share experiences. </p><p></p><p>• Two participants from each pilot project took part in the learning network and </p><p>committed, as ambassador of the project, to documenting and communicating what they </p><p>learned. </p><p></p><p>• The pilot project offered sufficient learning opportunities for talent-driven working </p><p>within the Flemish public service and differed sufficiently from other pilot projects in </p><p>theme and focus. </p><p></p><p>The pilot projects ran until June 2016.  </p><p></p><p>Learning network  </p><p></p><p>The managers and HR business partners involved in the pilot projects formed a learning </p><p>network that met six times and shared experiences, insight and knowledge acquired.  </p><p></p><p>Impact study on talent-driven working </p><p></p><p>To learn what works in the area of talent-driven working for tackling organisational issues, </p><p>the HR Agency also set up an impact study that took place throughout the summer of 2016. The </p><p>eight pilot projects were involved in this impact study. The aim was to harvest the learning </p><p>results from the experiments and to see what worked in a stimulating or restrictive way on </p><p>deploying talent-driven working within the entities.  </p><p></p><p>Talent labs for HR employees. </p><p></p><p>What is talent and how do I detect it? How do I support managers in the development and </p><p>deployment of talent? How can I help create a talent-driven climate in my organisation?

These were </p><p>half-day sessions in which one theme or approach concerning talent took a central place. The </p><p>aim of the sessions was to strengthen the substantive knowledge about talent among HR </p><p>employees.

For example, in the context of promoting public sector </p><p>innovation, 22 OECD countries indicated the use of autonomous, multidisciplinary teams, </p><p>and 20 indicated the use of innovation-oriented peer learning. Additionally, most civil </p><p>servants have participated in some form of training in the last 12 months. However, it </p><p>appears the large-scale adoption of HPWPs in most public sector organisations is rare.  </p><p></p><p>As civil services in OECD countries undertake the transformations necessary to </p><p>compete for talent and respond to the changing expectations of the citizens they serve, </p><p>they will need to reconsider not only the skills in their workforce, but also how to design </p><p>work systems that put those skills to best use. This is essential for employee retention. </p><p>Providing employees the autonomy implied by HPWPs also means investing in trust </p><p>within the organisation and updating management and leadership styles focused on </p><p>results.  </p><p></p><p>Leadership commitment and management capability: The ultimate keys to success </p><p></p><p>Chapter 2 of this report has identified a great deal of activity underway in OECD </p><p>countries to improve their strategic HR systems. Some countries are leveraging data to </p><p>help identify skills gaps and plan for the future. Some have invested in faster and more </p><p>refined recruitment systems and are taking a multidimensional approach to build a </p><p>learning culture in their organisations. Although it is important to have well-functioning </p><p>HR systems, if they do not have highly capable and effective leaders and managers they </p><p>will only produce disappointing results. </p><p></p><p>Leadership development is a very high priority amongst OECD countries, and this </p><p>chapter has highlighted various promising programmes and developments. However, </p><p>developing the right leadership styles and behaviours will take more than training </p><p>programmes; there also needs to be a systematic approach. Leadership commitment is </p><p>essential for any reform to achieve its intended goals, and HR reform is no exception. </p><p>Therefore commitment to workforce development at the highest levels of the </p><p>administration is a prerequisite for any of the reforms discussed in this report to produce </p><p>impact.

THE SKILLED CIVIL SERVICE OF THE FUTURE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>This report has looked at the skills needed in OECD civil services to build and protect </p><p>public value by considering four areas where the civil service interfaces with the public: </p><p>1) developing policy advice with elected representatives of the public; 2) delivering </p><p>services directly to citizens; 3) commissioning services for citizens through business type </p><p>contractual relationships with third party entities; 4) and managing through networks </p><p>where civil servants collaborate with different organisations in the public, private and/or </p><p>third sectors. None of these areas are new, but each has been changing, driven by three </p><p>interrelated drivers:  </p><p></p><p>1. The complexity of policy challenges: The multidimensional nature of many of </p><p>the persistent and emergent economic, social and environmental problems the </p><p>public sector is called upon to address demand a joined up systemic perspective. </p><p>Simultaneously, the volatile, unpredictable nature of policy challenges and their </p><p>environments requires fast responses. This demands governments that are nimble </p><p>and agile, able and ready to learn as they go, and can adjust paths and approaches </p><p>based on this learning.  </p><p></p><p>2. Digital transformation and future of work: Digitisation transforms society at </p><p>an increasingly fast pace. Citizens increasingly expect civil servants to be </p><p>networked and digitally capable. This also affects the nature of civil servants’ </p><p>work. The potential of digital technologies to inform and transform the way </p><p>policy, service delivery and government operations are run is enormous and </p><p>currently at very nascent stages. From a human resource (HR) perspective, </p><p>technology has likely reduced the number of low-level clerical jobs in the civil </p><p>service and is beginning to change the organisational structure from the traditional </p><p>pyramid shape into a diamond, where fewer lower level positions exist and the </p><p>majority of employees are mid-level knowledge workers. These changes also </p><p>emphasise a new way of working at the middle and top layers of the hierarchy – </p><p>one that emphasises leveraging new technological advances to better understand </p><p>citizens, customers, and/or users of services in order to improve service delivery </p><p>and public value creation. </p><p></p><p>3. The changing demographics/plurality of modern societies and the civil </p><p>service workforce: The ageing of society and, in many countries, the civil service </p><p>workforce, suggests challenges and opportunities. Many OECD civil services will </p><p>face a significant degree of retirement in the coming years, which presents </p><p>challenges to managing knowledge and skills transfer, but opportunities for </p><p>renewal. Many of those retiring will be replaced (although likely in fewer </p><p>absolute numbers) by a new generation of employee – digital natives who have </p><p>different expectations regarding the nature of work and the workplace. Managing </p><p>this transition requires a forward looking and strategic orientation. Replacing the </p><p>retiring workers with workers of the same ability will miss the opportunity to </p><p>effect long-lasting modernisation. At the same time, societies are becoming </p><p>increasingly diverse and pluralistic. OECD civil services that consider diversity a </p><p>benefit to their civil service stand much to gain by ensuring planning is done now </p><p>to replace the retiring workforce with one that has the skills, diversity and mindset </p><p>ready to innovate the civil service into the future.  </p><p></p><p>This report has presented an analysis of the changing skills needed in the civil service </p><p>to respond to these challenges and the management systems required to ensure the right </p><p>people are attracted, developed and put to best use in OECD countries’ civil services. </p><p>This places a focus on strategic HR systems that are essential for developing a civil </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>3. THE SKILLED CIVIL SERVICE OF THE FUTURE – 111 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>service that is fit-for-purpose and has the capabilities to adhere to the range of </p><p>recommendations from the public governance communities of the OECD. It is essential </p><p>that human resource management (HRM), management and leadership promote </p><p>capability to effectively advise and implement, to work in horizontal and agile ways to be </p><p>more effective and productive, and to constantly change and adjust to changing needs and </p><p>contexts. Key lessons include the following: </p><p></p><p>• Change is constant and the skill sets of civil servants need to become more </p><p>nimble, agile, and adaptable. Looking at the four skills areas of policy making, </p><p>citizen engagement, commissioning and network management helps to map these </p><p>changes and look to the future. </p><p></p><p>• The capacity and capability of the civil service workforce is fundamental to the </p><p>success of all public policy and reform. Investing in the right skills and </p><p>capabilities of the workforce will improve public governance and the functioning </p><p>of public systems across the sector. </p><p></p><p>• Emphasising capabilities recognises public employees are not homogenous or </p><p>mutually interchangeable. Maximising impact requires a view of the workforce </p><p>that is not only driven by numbers and cost, but by the skills and expertise </p><p>required by the job. This includes management that holds managerial skills. </p><p></p><p>• Data and evidence can be a powerful source of insight to understand current </p><p>workforce capabilities and gaps. Investing in a data driven approach to civil </p><p>service management promises significant potential, but requires a smart approach </p><p>to implementation. </p><p></p><p>• Attracting a greater diversity of skills into the civil service will require strategic </p><p>thinking regarding the employer value proposition and market segmentation. </p><p>Targeting graduates from specific programmes and ensuring employer branding is </p><p>aligned with the interests of those graduates is essential. </p><p></p><p>• Supporting a learning culture in the civil service will ensure the workforce is </p><p>consistently capable of renewing skills and keeping up with the fast-changing </p><p>nature of work. This means investing in learning opportunities for all staff and </p><p>developing career paths that emphasise learning throughout the career. Managers’ </p><p>responsibility to develop their employees is critical. </p><p></p><p>• Ensuring civil service organisations are ready to put these skills to work is </p><p>essential to drive value from the investments described above. Building networks, </p><p>managing mobility and centralising some functions can help. However, it is </p><p>ultimately a management task to engage employees and ensure they are provided </p><p>the right opportunities to use their skills and drive change in their organisations </p><p>and for the public they serve. </p><p></p><p>A professional, strategic and innovative civil service </p><p></p><p>The OECD strives to support countries to make evidence-informed investments that </p><p>can boost the capacity of their civil service. Identifying principles that can underpin these </p><p>decisions will support OECD governments to design and implement civil service reforms </p><p>that take into account capacity and capability, and balance short-term pressures with </p><p>future-oriented foresight to ensure sustainability over the long term. This involves </p><p>looking at the characteristics of the civil servants, the systems that manage them, and </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>112 – 3.

Traditionally, this meant </p><p>economists, lawyers, statisticians, and political scientists, but the recognition of the need </p><p>for more multi-disciplinarity brings in new skills sets, such as designers, data scientists, </p><p>policy historians, and foresight experts. Recently, many OECD countries have been </p><p>working on reinforcing the professional nature of the civil service, as well as giving </p><p>thought to a civil service of professions – meaning how best to structure different </p><p>specialisations within civil services which have tended to produce and value broad </p><p>generalist orientations. This leads to discussions regarding professionalising functions, </p><p>such as HR, ICT, or procurement. Although the concept of professionalisation has tended </p><p>to be unifying with a view towards common civil service standards, ethics and culture, a </p><p>professional civil service in the 21st century may also be increasingly diverse and </p><p>fragmented in terms of backgrounds and skills. </p><p></p><p>Strategic civil servants are those who can use their professional skills to create </p><p>impact and improve public value for their citizens and clients. They are proactive </p><p>problem solvers capable of collaborating across their diverse professional skills and </p><p>competencies. They are future oriented and evidence based, capable of taking risk-based </p><p>approaches and integrating resilience to face of a range of possible future scenarios and </p><p>outcomes. They are networked – able and ready to draw on a range of research, insight </p><p>and experience beyond their own spheres to inform policy ideas and service delivery </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>3.

A strategic commissioner is able to use the tools of commissioning to produce </p><p>impacts not only for the one service they are commissioning, but for society as a whole. </p><p>Strategic citizen engagement leverages the tools of consultation and collaboration to </p><p>generate insights that produce better services, as well as builds community consensus and </p><p>ownership that ensures sustainable services into the future. </p><p></p><p>Innovative civil servants can draw on six core skills areas to innovate the tools of </p><p>government themselves. They are able to approach their work in iterative ways that </p><p>generate learning and adaptation over time. They are aware of the potential of data and </p><p>structure projects that can collect and use data to inform and drive change. They are </p><p>citizen-centred – able to use a broad set of tools and methods to interact with their </p><p>stakeholders and direct beneficiaries to understand their reality and design a service that </p><p>meets their needs. They are curious, searching out opportunities to expand their own </p><p>knowledge and understanding, looking at solutions from other sectors or policy fields and </p><p>translating those to their scenarios. They are storytellers, ready to leverage a range of </p><p>tools to communicate with various stakeholders in ways they can understand and engage </p><p>with. Finally, they are insurgents – ready to understand how to effect change in the </p><p>systems within which they work, able to know when to push, how to negotiate, fight </p><p>and/or compromise. </p><p></p><p>…working in civil service systems which are…  </p><p>Chapter 2 of this report looks at how OECD civil services are managing the changing </p><p></p><p>skills needed in the public sector. There needs to be a view of the changing nature of the </p><p>work undertaken in order to identify the skills required and existing gaps to be filled. </p><p>Existing gaps need to be addressed by either buying skills in from the market or by </p><p>developing them within the existing workforce. Skills need to be used by organisations </p><p>and managers who are fit for purpose. The professional, strategic and innovative </p><p>categories discussed above may suggest particular focuses for HR reform, one building </p><p>on the next. </p><p></p><p>If professional civil servants are the foundation of effectiveness and capacity, then </p><p>merit systems are the managerial foundations. Most OECD countries have a long-</p><p>established merit-based system with clearly articulated qualifications and transparent and </p><p>open processes. However, many of these systems may be experiencing some strain to </p><p>keep up with the needs of the professional civil service in the 21st century. For example, </p><p>are they able to incorporate many of the new skill sets related to, for example, design, </p><p>data science, or behavioural economics? Are they able to assess behavioural </p><p>competencies included in most civil service competency frameworks, or ethics and </p><p>integrity? Are they effectively assessing and managing the future potential of employees, </p><p>or only their past performance? Are they able to provide for structured career paths that </p><p>ensure civil servants can build skills in their area of expertise and grow in their jobs? </p><p></p><p>Strategic workforce planning requires a vision to the future and a focus on workforce </p><p>quality and competency, not just numbers and costs. Competency management is a step in </p><p>this direction. Data-informed workforce management can provide a multi-dimensional </p><p>view of the workforce and the systems that attract, develop and retain employees. If civil </p><p>servants in a strategic workforce are able to combine their professional skills in ways that </p><p>drive value, then a strategic approach to management needs to include ways to attract and </p><p>retain a diverse set of skills. Not all professions may be attracted by the same sets of </p><p>employment terms and conditions. A principled and evidence-based approach to define </p><p>core civil service and other kinds of employment could help to optimise employment </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>114 – 3. THE SKILLED CIVIL SERVICE OF THE FUTURE </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>terms and conditions based on job requirements, worker expectations, and labour market </p><p>considerations. In a strategic civil service, recruitment is aligned to specific skill sets </p><p>needed, with development programmes designed to expand skills and encourage lifelong </p><p>learning. A high level of agility and flexibility in the system is also required to allocate </p><p>skills effectively and build the kinds of multidisciplinary teams needed to increase </p><p>impact. </p><p></p><p>An innovative civil service must be able and ready to put innovation skills to best </p><p>use, and requires a focus not only on strategic people management functions, but on open </p><p>and collaborative organisational cultures, leadership and management. This means a </p><p>management focused on people and knowledge, which centralises employee engagement </p><p>and uses employee surveys to inform management and organisational decision making. It </p><p>requires a look at the design of work and autonomy through the use of, for example, high </p><p>performance work systems. It requires diversity, mobility and the reinforcement of </p><p>learning. The OECD Strategic Human Resources Management (SHRM) survey suggests </p><p>that the concept of innovation is increasingly being incorporated into core HRM systems, </p><p>but it is still too early to tell if this is a passing fad or the emergence of a new and </p><p>sustainable focus for public sector HRM.  </p><p></p><p>.. and led by leaders who are… </p><p>Leadership is fundamental to civil service performance, and the specific skills and </p><p></p><p>styles of leadership underpin all of the above. In a professional civil service, senior civil </p><p>servants need to be trusted policy advisors to ministers, and effective transactional </p><p>managers capable of aligning organisational resources to implement decisions. In a </p><p>strategic civil service, leadership also needs to inspire and motivate civil servants to be </p><p>proactive and use their skills and resources to impact change. This requires a leadership </p><p>focused on transformation and change management, able to lead reforms and support </p><p>change. Finally, leadership in an innovative civil service may by more dispersed, </p><p>delegated, and collaborative. Management would be increasingly focused on adapting to </p><p>constant change. These themes are explored in recent and ongoing OECD work on civil </p><p>service leadership, for example “Engaging Public Employees for a High-Performing Civil </p><p>Service” (OECD, 2016). </p><p></p><p>Supporting countries to build their public workforce of the future </p><p></p><p>Further developing this model towards an OECD recommendation on public </p><p>employment will help inform countries on the best investments to make in their civil </p><p>service to maximise capacity and value for money. As this work progresses, the following </p><p>should be considered: </p><p></p><p>• This model is not meant to represent mutually exclusive options. The goal is not </p><p>to strive for an innovative civil service at the expense of a strategic civil service. </p><p>Rather, each builds on the next. Professional skills and merit-based processes </p><p>provide a foundation upon which to build strategic and innovative capability.  </p><p></p><p>• In some cases, tensions or contradictions may develop across the model. For </p><p>example, as civil services move towards the innovative end, they may reduce </p><p>reliance on professional accreditation and qualification in exchange for </p><p>competency based recruitment and promotion.  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>3.

The proposed recommendation would identify the </p><p>underlying principles that drive performance in a professional, strategic and </p><p>innovative civil service, and would be a clear statement by OECD countries of the </p><p>importance of this sometimes overlooked input into effective and productive </p><p>governance. </p><p></p><p>• Opportunities to engage with other OECD communities (e.g. E-Leaders working </p><p>party, the national contact points for public sector innovation) to further explore </p><p>the specific skills requirements of these groups and the implications for civil </p><p>service management. </p><p></p><p>• Opportunities to engage with specific countries to provide peer learning and share </p><p>expertise on building the workforce of the future. The frameworks presented in </p><p>this report provide for an analytical structure which could be used to assess skills </p><p>and workforce management in individual civil services and provide insights on </p><p>the challenges faced by OECD member countries.  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>116 – 3.

CORE SKILLS FOR PUBLIC SECTOR INNOVATION – 117 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>Annex A. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>Core skills for public sector innovation </p><p></p><p>Background and context </p><p></p><p>To meet today’s public policy challenges – continued fiscal pressures, rising public </p><p>expectations, more complex public policy issues – there is a crucial need to increase the </p><p>level of innovation in the public sector.  There is a fundamental need to increase the level </p><p>of innovation within the public sector of OECD countries and EU states if they are to </p><p>meet the challenges of the 21st century, a need which has only been increased by the </p><p>fiscal pressures placed on many states by the 2008-9 crisis. </p><p></p><p>At the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation’s November 2014 conference </p><p>“Innovating the Public Sector: From Ideas to Impact” – a forum that brought together </p><p>ministers, public sector leaders and innovators (both inside and outside the public sector) </p><p>– four “calls to action” were presented that needed to be urgently addressed to promote </p><p>and enable public sector innovation. The first of these calls is about the skills and </p><p>capabilities of officials. </p><p></p><p>A specific focus on skills for innovation </p><p>The innovation framework developed by the OECD (Figure A.1) puts people at the </p><p></p><p>centre of an innovative organisation. The capacities and competencies of individual civil </p><p>servants, the way they are organised in teams and structured in the public administration </p><p>that will likely determine how effective the public sector is at being innovative. </p><p></p><p>Preliminary data from the OECD’s 2016 survey of Strategic Human Resource </p><p>Management practices in government (the SHRM Survey) indicates that innovation is </p><p>among the highest priorities for HR reform across OECD countries. In 28 countries </p><p>public sector innovation features in government-wide strategic objectives, many are </p><p>developing learning and training programs for civil servants and civil service leaders, and </p><p>almost half of responding countries include innovation-related concepts in their </p><p>competency frameworks. </p><p></p><p>However, in many cases, the inclusion of innovation in HRM policies and practices </p><p>does not often extend beyond a passing reference and does not expand in detail the </p><p>specific skills and capabilities needed. </p><p></p><p>While the OECD has done significant work on the institutions of government and </p><p>rules and processes of governing, we still know comparatively little about the women and </p><p>men who work within these structures, the skills and knowledge they use, and what </p><p>motivates them to contribute.  It is only now that the OECD has started to unpack the </p><p>complex topic of skills and capabilities for public sector innovation – two particular </p><p>projects in 2016 have supported this work: a review of innovation skills for the Chilean </p><p>Laboratorio de Gobierno, and a work package in the grant from the European </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>118 – ANNEX A.

The four calls to action for governments at the OECD’s 2014 conference </p><p>“Innovating the Public Sector” </p><p></p><p>1. Focus on people – Governments must invest in the capacity and capabilities of civil </p><p>servants as the catalysts of innovation. This includes building the culture, incentives and </p><p>norms to facilitate new ways of working.  </p><p></p><p>2. Put knowledge to use – Governments must facilitate the free flow of information, data </p><p>and knowledge across the public sector and use it to respond creatively to new </p><p>challenges and opportunities. </p><p></p><p>3. Working together – Governments must advance new organisational structures and </p><p>leverage partnerships to enhance approaches and tools, share risk and harness available </p><p>information and resources for innovation. </p><p></p><p>4. Rethink the rules – Government must ensure that internal rules and processes are </p><p>balanced in their capacity to mitigate risks while protecting resources and enabling </p><p>innovation. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>Towards an OECD model of skills for public sector innovation </p><p>At the May 2016 meetings of the OPSI National Contact Points (NCP) and the </p><p></p><p>Working Party on Public Employment and Management (PEM) a joint session was held </p><p>for delegates to both groups on the topic of "Innovation Skills and Competencies in the </p><p>Public Sector". During the session the OECD Secretariat presented initial work on a </p><p>framework for skills and competencies for public sector innovation, as well as an update </p><p>on the initial work on the Chile Innovation Skills Review. This alpha prototype, </p><p>developed in collaboration with Nesta, presented over 40 attributes associated with </p><p>innovation skills and competencies grouped into five broad areas. </p><p></p><p>An interactive workshop was also included in the joint session for delegates to test the </p><p>alpha prototype in small groups and provide feedback to the Secretariat on its utility. At </p><p>the conclusion of the joint session it was agreed that "the Secretariat will work to develop </p><p>the skills mapping into a more specific and practical tool which identifies specific skills </p><p>needed for public managers to handle innovation projects". To achieve this, the </p><p>Secretariat has refined the initial prototype into a beta-version model of skills for </p><p>innovation, which is the substantive focus of this paper. </p><p></p><p>Alongside the beta model, and to support its development, the Secretariat </p><p>commissioned Nesta to undertake research into the skills of innovators in government in </p><p>the second-half of 2016. This research, the work to refine the model and other desk </p><p>research have identified two broad groups of individuals in government that can be the </p><p>focus of work on skills and capabilities for public sector innovation: “innovators coming </p><p>into government” and “officials becoming innovators”. </p><p></p><p>Many governments have made progress by bringing in external experts to set up new </p><p>projects and inject new thinking – this comprises the first group outlined above, </p><p>“innovators coming into government”. The key issues here are how government can best </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>ANNEX A. CORE SKILLS FOR PUBLIC SECTOR INNOVATION – 119 </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>utilise these people’s skills, motivate them, continue their professional development and </p><p>reward their successes.  </p><p></p><p>However, just relying on bringing in external expertise is insufficient to deliver a </p><p>systemic change in the culture of public sector institutions. To achieve the levels of </p><p>innovation needed requires not just bringing in 'new blood' but also ensuring that existing </p><p>public servants have the skills and capabilities to support innovative practices in </p><p>government – or, as we title our second broad group, “officials becoming innovators”. </p><p></p><p>Innovators coming into government </p><p>The research by conducted by Nesta for the Secretariat provides a detailed </p><p></p><p>exploration of the skills of innovation specialists that have been brought into government </p><p>from outside. The research used semi-structured interviews to explore the in-depth the </p><p>specific skills, education and backgrounds of innovation specialists. A number of these </p><p>interviews have been converted into eight “skills profiles” that provide a one-page </p><p>overview of the skills and capabilities of innovators working in different innovation roles </p><p>within the public sector. These skills profiles are included at pages XX-YY.  </p><p></p><p>Officials becoming innovators </p><p>In addition to the continued use of innovation specialists and external experts, </p><p></p><p>government increasingly need to improve the skills and capabilities of existing staff. The </p><p>Secretariat’s work in this domain has been to refine the prototype framework of skills and </p><p>competencies presented to the PEM and NCP meetings in May 2016 into a beta model </p><p>that presents skills areas of “core skills” for public sector innovation. </p><p></p><p>These six skills areas are not the only skills for public sector innovation, each </p><p>innovation project and challenge will have its own particular needs. Nor will all public </p><p>servants need to make use of or apply these skills in every aspect of their day-to-day job. </p><p>Rather, these are six skills areas that with proper promotion/advocacy and development </p><p>we believe can enable a wider adoption of innovation practices and thus an increased </p><p>level of innovation. In fact, there are a number of other skills that are already covered in </p><p>existing public sector competency frameworks that are relevant for innovation, such as </p><p>collaboration, strategic thinking, political awareness, coaching. </p><p></p><p>Leadership and management for public sector innovation </p><p>Alongside specific skills that enable public sector innovation, our research has </p><p></p><p>identified that mind-set, attitudes and behaviours can be just as important as specific hard </p><p>or soft skills in enabling innovation within the public sector. Beyond the focus of </p><p>individual skills and capabilities many research participants and stakeholders have </p><p>highlighted a number of other organisational factors that are also crucial for increasing </p><p>levels of innovation in the public sector. In particular, leadership capability, </p><p>organisational culture and corporate functions/systems (finance, HR, IT, legal) that are </p><p>enablers of innovation not 'blockers'. While outside the scope of the skills model, these </p><p>are important factors that need to be considered in operationalising/implementing the </p><p>skills model and achieving higher levels of innovation in the public sector. </p><p></p><p>The exclusion of leadership and management capabilities from the beta skills model </p><p>is neither an oversight nor because they are not important. In fact, the contrary applies, </p><p>high quality leadership and management are crucial for the success of public sector </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>120 – ANNEX A. CORE SKILLS FOR PUBLIC SECTOR INNOVATION </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p>SKILLS IN A HIGH PERFORMING CIVIL SERVICE © OECD 2017 </p><p></p><p>innovation, particularly in motivating and engaging employees to deliver in </p><p>difficult/complex circumstances .  </p><p></p><p>However, over the course of the research and refinement a form or set of leadership </p><p>and management capabilities have not emerged that are distinctly different from either an </p><p>embodiment by leaders and managers of the skills outlined in the model or more </p><p>‘standard’ concepts of leadership and management that are already espoused in public </p><p>sector competency frameworks (openness, honesty, trust, strategic thinking, staff </p><p>development and capability building).  </p><p></p><p>A crucial role that leaders and managers need to play is to support and enable their </p><p>team(s) to adopt more innovative approaches is to better manage the interface between </p><p>their team(s) and the wider organisation that they operate in. While there is much </p><p>similarity between any two organisations, each organisation has its own structure, culture </p><p>and operating environment. What is needed of leaders and managers to support </p><p>innovation in one organisation may be different from that in another.  </p><p></p><p>For example, in one organisation leaders and managers may need to focus on helping </p><p>to unblock procedural barriers put in place by corporate functions (finance, HR, IT, legal, </p><p>etc.) that stymy innovation, while in another setting they may need to work to overcome </p><p>silo-mentalities to enable two or more different teams to work together (either within the </p><p>same organisation, or between organisations). In these two situations there is a strong </p><p>element of mediation: defending the benefits of their team’s approach while fostering a </p><p>spirit of collaboration by pragmatically identifying ways forward that overcome the </p><p>impasse. </p><p></p><p>Another important role of all leaders and managers in the civil service is to promote </p><p>and advocate the work of their teams. In discussions with their own managers and </p><p>political leaders or during budgeting and strategic work-planning negotiations, they need </p><p>to communicate how the work of their teams is aligned with both organisational and </p><p>wider cross-government priorities/strategies. Similarly, when engaging with political </p><p>leaders, senior officials need to be able to extol the virtues and benefits of new and </p><p>different approaches and how innovation projects can deliver a government’s political </p><p>programme. </p><p></p><p>Alternatively, some political leaders are strong advocates of innovation in the public </p><p>sector; in this case, senior officials need to ensure that, while maintaining political </p><p>support, politicians are understand the high-level uncertainties and risks associated with </p><p>individual projects. </p><p></p><p>In reality, the collective leadership of both government and public sector </p><p>organisations is likely to include a mix of those who are enthusiastic supporters of </p><p>innovation, those who support it less strongly or are neutral, and those who are sceptical </p><p>of public sector innovation. As with traditional policy programmes, leaders and managers </p><p>need to build alliances to provide cross-government support, using natural cheerleaders to </p><p>bolster support and provide a network of advocates across government. </p><p></p><p>In all these situations the skills and capabilities required of leaders and managers have </p><p>no particularly distinct “innovation” component. However, when leading or managing an </p><p>innovation team it might require a stronger application of leadership and management </p><p>competencies, because in doing something “innovative”, and which is different from the </p><p>usual way of doing things, they may encounter stronger resistance than when they are </p><p>initiating or leading a more “traditional” project. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>ANNEX A.

However, for a modern 21st-century public service, all officials </p><p>should have at least some level of awareness these six areas in order to support increased </p><p>levels of innovation in the public sector. </p><p></p><p>• Iteration: incrementally and experimentally developing policies, products and </p><p>services </p><p></p><p>• Data literacy: ensuring decisions are data-driven and that data isn't an after </p><p>thought </p><p></p><p>• User centricity: public services should be focussed on solving and servicing user </p><p>needs </p><p></p><p>• Curiosity: seeking out and trying new ideas or ways of working </p><p></p><p>• Storytelling: explaining change in a way that builds support </p><p></p><p>• Insurgency: challenging the status quo and working with unusual partners </p><p></p><p>For each of these six skills areas the model provides a matrix that decomposes the </p><p>skill area into four elements of practice against three levels of capability. </p><p></p><p>The four elements of practice for each skill area break down the skill area into </p><p>tangible components that relate to the real-world usage of innovation skills – e.g. </p><p>“managing innovation projects” under iteration, “involving users in projects” within user </p><p>centricity, and “challenging the status quo” in the insurgency skill area. </p><p></p><p>The three levels of capability represent an evolution that officials can adopt in terms </p><p>of their understanding and adoption of skills for public sector innovation. </p><p></p><p>• The first level, basic awareness, is the first step in being able to utilise innovation </p><p>skills and is about getting a general understanding of what each element practice </p><p>is about and how it applies in a public sector context. </p><p></p><p>• The second level, emerging capability, leads on from having basic awareness to </p><p>starting to use innovation skills. For each element of practice the model outlines </p><p>how the skills can be applied in either an occasional fashion or in a “low </p><p>intensity” manner, that allows officials to experiment with using them in a safe </p><p>and/or controlled fashion. </p><p></p><p>• The third level, regular practitioner, shows how each element of practice can be </p><p>adopted in a deeper and/or more systematic way. Adopting these (and related) </p><p>practices in their day-to-day work will enable the vision of “officials becoming </p><p>innovators” set out earlier in this paper. </p><p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>124 – ANNEX A.

It is most </p><p></p><p>commonly associated with modern software development practices where new features or </p><p>updates to functionality are released when they are ready, rather than a "big bang" </p><p>approach that releases a large number of new/updated features at the same time. Iteration </p><p>skills aren’t just about project management, using prototypes and conducting experiments </p><p>can also be considered part of iterative practice. </p><p></p><p>Managing innovation projects </p><p>Iterative project management techniques (such as sprints or time-boxes, product </p><p></p><p>backlogs or workflows, and retrospectives) where each stage builds on the preceding </p><p>stage and there is greater opportunity to adapt and amend scope are well suited to </p><p>delivering innovation projects. However, iterative project management techniques are not </p><p>necessarily new to government –  Lean and other continuous improvement methodologies </p><p>have been used for many years in some governments to manage operational services. </p><p></p><p>Using prototypes to explore approaches </p><p>A prototype is an example of what something (a product, a service or system, a </p><p></p><p>policy) might look like. Prototypes are can be used to demonstrate what something might </p><p>look like, or to test whether something works. Prototypes can also be initial versions </p><p>which are then incrementally refined and turn into the final product.  They can be things </p><p>you use only as internal “proof of concept” exercises, or things that you use with service </p><p>users to test feasibility. </p><p></p><p>Conducting tests and experiments </p><p>Innovation projects typically involve testing whether something works, and using the </p><p></p><p>results of that testing to improve or refine work, or trying something else. Experiments </p><p>are more robust and formal ways of testing whether something works, and by </p><p>incorporating randomisation they can control for a range of potential factors that might </p><p>otherwise influence the results. </p><p></p><p>Taking risks, but not with time or money </p><p>Iterative approaches and project management methods can enable officials to try out </p><p></p><p>things that may not work, initially at a small scale and then progressively increasingly the </p><p>scale of the work. Using sand-boxes, prototypes and experiments allows officials to check </p><p>step-by-step whether something is working and if not take action sooner rather than later. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>ANNEX A.

However, the arrival of </p><p>the digital government agenda, and the subsequent bottom-up development of new online </p><p>services has placed the idea of "user needs" at the focal point of both policy making and </p><p>service design – in both the US and the UK, user needs are the first principle of </p><p>government guidelines for developing digital public services. </p><p></p><p>Solving user needs </p><p>Being user centred is about finding out what users need to do and designing a </p><p>policy/service that meets those needs, rather than what government assumes/thinks those </p><p>needs are. All public servants should consider whether their project, policy or service is </p><p>meeting user needs, and that user needs will change over time. While secondary sources </p><p>such as existing evidence/analysis, talking to employees that work with users or </p><p>organisations that deliver services to users, it is important to include primary research </p><p>with users when identifying, and validating, user needs – qualitative and ethnographic </p><p>methods (e.g. in-depth interviews and observation) are particularly useful for identifying </p><p>needs. </p><p></p><p>Focusing on users at every step </p><p>Projects must have sufficient resources and time allocated for discovering and </p><p></p><p>analysing user needs, and incorporating regular opportunities through the life of a project </p><p>to undertake research/testing with users to check what is being developed or implement is </p><p>meeting the needs of the users. </p><p></p><p>Considering how users think and act </p><p>Users are diverse, no two users are the same, when developing services it is important </p><p></p><p>to make sure it is easy for users to do what they need to do. Human centred design </p><p>principles allow us to think about how people interact with systems and processes, while </p><p>behavioural science can help us to analyse the way people think and respond to different </p><p>situations. It is also important to think about those with different and particular needs (e.g. </p><p>those with a disability), when developing digital services it is important to consider those </p><p>whether there users and you need to develop alternative approaches for. </p><p></p><p>Involving users in projects </p><p>To develop effective user centred services and policies, officials must adopt </p><p></p><p>participative approaches that involve users throughout the life of the project. This may be </p><p>as simple as undertaking user research at different stages (to identify needs; test </p><p>prototypes, alpha, beta, and live versions) through to deep participatory exercises such as </p><p>the co-production of a policy or service which aims to foster a sense of joint ownership of </p><p>the exercise between officials and users. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>ANNEX A.
