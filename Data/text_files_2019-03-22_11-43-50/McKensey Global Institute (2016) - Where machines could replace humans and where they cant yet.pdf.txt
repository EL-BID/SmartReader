replace humans—and 
where they can’t (yet)
The technical potential for automation differs dramatically across 
sectors and activities.

by Michael Chui, James Manyika, and Mehdi Miremadi

As automation technologies such as machine learning and robotics play 
an increasingly great role in everyday life, their potential effect on the 
workplace has, unsurprisingly, become a major focus of research and public 
concern. The discussion tends toward a Manichean guessing game: which 
jobs will or won’t be replaced by machines?

In fact, as our research has begun to show, the story is more nuanced. 
While automation will eliminate very few occupations entirely in the next 
decade, it will affect portions of almost all jobs to a greater or lesser degree, 
depending on the type of work they entail. Automation, now going beyond 
routine manufacturing activities, has the potential, as least with regard to 
its technical feasibility, to transform sectors such as healthcare and finance, 
which involve a substantial share of knowledge work.

These conclusions rest on our detailed analysis of 2,000-plus work activities 
for more than 800 occupations. Using data from the US Bureau of Labor 
Statistics and O*Net, we’ve quantified both the amount of time spent on 
these activities across the economy of the United States and the technical 
feasibility of automating each of them. The full results, forthcoming in

early 2017, will include several other countries,1 but we released some initial 
findings late last year and are following up now with additional interim results.

Last year, we showed that currently demonstrated technologies could 
automate 45 percent of the activities people are paid to perform and 
that about 60 percent of all occupations could see 30 percent or more of 
their constituent activities automated, again with technologies available 
today. In this article, we examine the technical feasibility, using currently 
demonstrated technologies, of automating three groups of occupational 
activities: those that are highly susceptible, less susceptible, and least 
susceptible to automation. Within each category, we discuss the sectors and 
occupations where robots and other machines are most—and least—likely 
to serve as substitutes in activities humans currently perform. Toward the 
end of this article, we discuss how evolving technologies, such as natural-
language generation, could change the outlook, as well as some implications 
for senior executives who lead increasingly automated enterprises.

UNDERSTANDING AUTOMATION POTENTIAL
In discussing automation, we refer to the potential that a given activity could 
be automated by adopting currently demonstrated technologies, that is to say, 
whether or not the automation of that activity is technically feasible.2 Each 
whole occupation is made up of multiple types of activities, each with varying 
degrees of technical feasibility. Exhibit 1 lists seven top-level groupings of 
activities we have identified. Occupations in retailing, for example, involve 
activities such as collecting or processing data, interacting with customers, 
and setting up merchandise displays (which we classify as physical movement  
in a predictable environment). Since all of these constituent activities have a 
different automation potential, we arrive at an overall estimate for the sector 
by examining the time workers spend on each of them during the workweek. 

Technical feasibility is a necessary precondition for automation, but not a 
complete predictor that an activity will be automated. A second factor to 
consider is the cost of developing and deploying both the hardware and the 
software for automation. The cost of labor and related supply-and-demand 
dynamics represent a third factor: if workers are in abundant supply and 
significantly less expensive than automation, this could be a decisive 
argument against it. A fourth factor to consider is the benefits beyond labor

2  We define “currently demonstrated technologies” as those that have already exhibited the level of performance 

and reliability needed to automate 1 or more of the 18 capabilities involved in carrying out work activities.  
In some cases, that level of performance has been demonstrated through commercially available products,  
in others through research projects.

substitution, including higher levels of output, better quality, and fewer 
errors. These are often larger than those of reducing labor costs. Regulatory 
and social-acceptance issues, such as the degree to which machines are 
acceptable in any particular setting, must also be weighed. A robot may, in 
theory, be able to replace some of the functions of a nurse, for example. But 
for now, the prospect that this might actually happen in a highly visible way 
could prove unpalatable for many patients, who expect human contact. The 
potential for automation to take hold in a sector or occupation reflects a 
subtle interplay between these factors and the trade-offs among them.

Even when machines do take over some human activities in an occupation, 
this does not necessarily spell the end of the jobs in that line of work. On the 
contrary, their number at times increases in occupations that have been 
partly automated, because overall demand for their remaining activities 
has continued to grow. For example, the large-scale deployment of bar-code

Analyzing work activities rather than occupations is the most 
accurate way to examine the technical feasibility of automation.

2Unpredictable physical work (physical activities and the operation of machinery) is performed in 
unpredictable environments, while in predictable physical work, the environments are predictable.

In practice, automation will depend on more than just technical feasibility. Five factors are 
involved: technical feasibility; costs to automate; the relative scarcity, skills, and cost of 
workers who might otherwise do the activity; bene�ts (eg, superior performance) of automation 
beyond labor-cost substitution; and regulatory and social-acceptance considerations.

scanners and associated point-of-sale systems in the United States in the 
1980s reduced labor costs per store by an estimated 4.5 percent and the cost 
of the groceries consumers bought by 1.4 percent.3 It also enabled a number 
of innovations, including increased promotions. But cashiers were still 
needed; in fact, their employment grew at an average rate of more than  
2 percent between 1980 and 2013.

THE MOST AUTOMATABLE ACTIVITIES 
Almost one-fifth of the time spent in US workplaces involves performing 
physical activities or operating machinery in a predictable environment: 
workers carry out specific actions in well-known settings where changes 
are relatively easy to anticipate. Through the adaptation and adoption of 
currently available technologies, we estimate the technical feasibility of 
automating such activities at 78 percent, the highest of our seven top-level  
categories (Exhibit 2). Since predictable physical activities figure prominently  
in sectors such as manufacturing, food service and accommodations, and 
retailing, these are the most susceptible to automation based on technical 
considerations alone. 

In manufacturing, for example, performing physical activities or operating 
machinery in a predictable environment represents one-third of the 
workers’ overall time. The activities range from packaging products to 
loading materials on production equipment to welding to maintaining 
equipment. Because of the prevalence of such predictable physical work, 
some 59 percent of all manufacturing activities could be automated, given 
technical considerations. The overall technical feasibility, however, masks 
considerable variance. Within manufacturing, 90 percent of what welders, 
cutters, solderers, and brazers do, for example, has the technical potential  
for automation, but for customer-service representatives that feasibility is 
below 30 percent. The potential varies among companies as well. Our  
work with manufacturers reveals a wide range of adoption levels—from 
companies with inconsistent or little use of automation all the way to quite 
sophisticated users.

Manufacturing, for all its technical potential, is only the second most readily 
automatable sector in the US economy. A service sector occupies the top 
spot: accommodations and food service, where almost half of all labor time 
involves predictable physical activities and the operation of machinery—
including preparing, cooking, or serving food; cleaning food-preparation

areas; preparing hot and cold beverages; and collecting dirty dishes. 
According to our analysis, 73 percent of the activities workers perform in 
food service and accommodations have the potential for automation, based 
on technical considerations.

Some of this potential is familiar. Automats, or automated cafeterias, for 
example, have long been in use. Now restaurants are testing new, more 
sophisticated concepts, like self-service ordering or even robotic servers. 
Solutions such as Momentum Machines’ hamburger-cooking robot, which 
can reportedly assemble and cook 360 burgers an hour, could automate a 
number of cooking and food-preparation activities. But while the technical 
potential for automating them might be high, the business case must take 
into account both the benefits and the costs of automation, as well as the 
labor-supply dynamics discussed earlier. For some of these activities, 
current wage rates are among the lowest in the United States, reflecting both 
the skills required and the size of the available labor supply. Since restaurant 

It’s more technically feasible to automate predictable physical 
activities than unpredictable ones.

employees who cook earn an average of about $10 an hour, a business case 
based solely on reducing labor costs may be unconvincing.

Retailing is another sector with a high technical potential for automation. 
We estimate that 53 percent of its activities are automatable, though, as 
in manufacturing, much depends on the specific occupation within the 
sector. Retailers can take advantage of efficient, technology-driven stock 
management and logistics, for example. Packaging objects for shipping and 
stocking merchandise are among the most frequent physical activities in 
retailing, and they have a high technical potential for automation. So do 
maintaining records of sales, gathering customer or product information, 
and other data-collection activities. But retailing also requires cognitive  
and social skills. Advising customers which cuts of meat or what color shoes 
to buy requires judgment and emotional intelligence. We calculate that  
47 percent of a retail salesperson’s activities have the technical potential 
to be automated—far less than the 86 percent possible for the sector’s 
bookkeepers, accountants, and auditing clerks. 

As we noted above, however, just because an activity can be automated 
doesn’t mean that it will be—broader economic factors are at play. The jobs of 
bookkeepers, accountants, and auditing clerks, for example, require skills  
and training, so they are scarcer than basic cooks. But the activities they 
perform cost less to automate, requiring mostly software and a basic computer.

Considerations such as these have led to an observed tendency for higher rates  
of automation for activities common in some middle-skill jobs—for example, 
in data collection and data processing. As automation advances in capability, 
jobs involving higher skills will probably be automated at increasingly high rates. 

The heat map in Exhibit 3 highlights the wide variation in how automation 
could play out, both in individual sectors and for different types of activities 
within them.4

ACTIVITIES AND SECTORS IN THE MIDDLE RANGE FOR AUTOMATION 
Across all occupations in the US economy, one-third of the time spent in 
the workplace involves collecting and processing data. Both activities 
have a technical potential for automation exceeding 60 percent. Long ago, 
many companies automated activities such as administering procurement, 
processing payrolls, calculating material-resource needs, generating

invoices, and using bar codes to track flows of materials. But as technology 
progresses, computers are helping to increase the scale and quality of these 
activities. For example, a number of companies now offer solutions that 
automate entering paper and PDF invoices into computer systems or even 
processing loan applications. And it’s not just entry-level workers or low-
wage clerks who collect and process data; people whose annual incomes exceed  
$200,000 spend some 31 percent of their time doing those things, as well. 

Financial services and insurance provide one example of this phenomenon. 
The world of finance relies on professional expertise: stock traders and 
investment bankers live off their wits. Yet about 50 percent of the overall 
time of the workforce in finance and insurance is devoted to collecting 
and processing data, where the technical potential for automation is 
high. Insurance sales agents gather customer or product information and 
underwriters verify the accuracy of records. Securities and financial sales 
agents prepare sales or other contracts. Bank tellers verify the accuracy of 
financial data.

As a result, the financial sector has the technical potential to automate 
activities taking up 43 percent of its workers’ time. Once again, the potential 
is far higher for some occupations than for others. For example, we estimate 
that mortgage brokers spend as much as 90 percent of their time processing 
applications. Putting in place more sophisticated verification processes for 
documents and credit applications could reduce that proportion to just more 
than 60 percent. This would free up mortgage advisers to focus more of their 
time on advising clients rather than routine processing. Both the customer 
and the mortgage institution get greater value. 

Other activities in the middle range of the technical potential for automation 
involve large amounts of physical activity or the operation of machinery 
in unpredictable environments. These types of activities make up a high 
proportion of the work in sectors such as farming, forestry, and construction 
and can be found in many other sectors as well. 

Examples include operating a crane on a construction site, providing 
medical care as a first responder, collecting trash in public areas, setting up 
classroom materials and equipment, and making beds in hotel rooms. The 
latter two activities are unpredictable largely because the environment 
keeps changing. Schoolchildren leave bags, books, and coats in a seemingly

In practice, automation will depend on more than just technical feasibility. Five factors are

random manner. Likewise, in a hotel room, different guests throw pillows in 
different places, may or may not leave clothing on their beds, and clutter up 
the floor space in different ways. 

These activities, requiring greater flexibility than those in a predictable 
environment, are for now more difficult to automate with currently 
demonstrated technologies: their automation potential is 25 percent. Should 
technology advance to handle unpredictable environments with the same 
ease as predictable ones, the potential for automation would jump to 67 percent.  
Already, some activities in less predictable settings in farming and construction  
(such as evaluating the quality of crops, measuring materials, or translating 
blueprints into work requirements) are more susceptible to automation.

ACTIVITIES WITH LOW TECHNICAL POTENTIAL FOR AUTOMATION
The hardest activities to automate with currently available technologies are 
those that involve managing and developing people (9 percent automation 
potential) or that apply expertise to decision making, planning, or creative 
work (18 percent). These activities, often characterized as knowledge work, 
can be as varied as coding software, creating menus, or writing promotional 
materials. For now, computers do an excellent job with very well-defined 
activities, such as optimizing trucking routes, but humans still need to 
determine the proper goals, interpret results, or provide commonsense 
checks for solutions. The importance of human interaction is evident in two 
sectors that, so far, have a relatively low technical potential for automation: 
healthcare and education.

Overall, healthcare has a technical potential for automation of about 36 percent,  
but the potential is lower for health professionals whose daily activities 
require expertise and direct contact with patients. For example, we estimate 
that less than 30 percent of a registered nurse’s activities could be automated, 
based on technical considerations alone. For dental hygienists, that 
proportion drops to 13 percent. 

Nonetheless, some healthcare activities, including preparing food in 
hospitals and administering non-intravenous medications, could be 
automated if currently demonstrated technologies were adapted. Data 
collection, which also accounts for a significant amount of working time in 
the sector, could become more automated as well. Nursing assistants, for 
example, spend about two-thirds of their time collecting health information. 



 10

Even some of the more complex activities that doctors perform, such as 
administering anesthesia during simple procedures or reading radiological 
scans, have the technical potential for automation.

Of all the sectors we have examined, the technical feasibility of automation 
is lowest in education, at least for now. To be sure, digital technology is 
transforming the field, as can be seen from the myriad classes and learning 
vehicles available online. Yet the essence of teaching is deep expertise and 
complex interactions with other people. Together, those two categories—the 
least automatable of the seven identified in the first exhibit—account for 
about one-half of the activities in the education sector. 

Even so, 27 percent of the activities in education—primarily those that 
happen outside the classroom or on the sidelines—have the potential to 
be automated with demonstrated technologies. Janitors and cleaners, for 
example, clean and monitor building premises. Cooks prepare and serve 
school food. Administrative assistants maintain inventory records and 
personnel information. The automation of these data-collection and 
processing activities may help to reduce the growth of the administrative 
expenses of education and to lower its cost without affecting its quality. 

LOOKING AHEAD 
As technology develops, robotics and machine learning will make greater 
inroads into activities that today have only a low technical potential for 
automation. New techniques, for example, are enabling safer and more 
enhanced physical collaboration between robots and humans in what are 
now considered unpredictable environments. These developments could 
enable the automation of more activities in sectors such as construction. 
Artificial intelligence can be used to design components in engineer- 
heavy sectors. 

One of the biggest technological breakthroughs would come if machines 
were to develop an understanding of natural language on par with median 
human performance—that is, if computers gained the ability to recognize 
the concepts in everyday communication between people. In retailing, 
such natural-language advances would increase the technical potential for 
automation from 53 percent of all labor time to 60 percent. In finance and 
insurance, the leap would be even greater, to 66 percent, from 43 percent. In 
healthcare, too, while we don’t believe currently demonstrated technologies 
could accomplish all of the activities needed to diagnose and treat patients, 



 11

technology will become more capable over time. Robots may not be cleaning 
your teeth or teaching your children quite yet, but that doesn’t mean they 
won’t in the future. 

As stated at the outset, though, simply considering the technical potential 
for automation is not enough to assess how much of it will occur in particular 
activities. The actual level will reflect the interplay of the technical potential, 
the benefits and costs (or the business case), the supply-and-demand dynamics  
of labor, and various regulatory and social factors related to acceptability. 

LEADING MORE AUTOMATED ENTERPRISES
Automation could transform the workplace for everyone, including senior 
management. The rapid evolution of technology can make harnessing its 
potential and avoiding its pitfalls especially complex. In some industries, 
such as retailing, automation is already changing the nature of competition. 
E-commerce players, for example, compete with traditional retailers by 
using both physical automation (such as robots in warehouses) and the 
automation of knowledge work (including algorithms that alert shoppers to 
items they may want to buy). In mining, autonomous haulage systems that 
transport ore inside mines more safely and efficiently than human operators 
do could also deliver a step change in productivity.

Top executives will first and foremost need to identify where automation 
could transform their own organizations and then put a plan in place to 
migrate to new business processes enabled by automation. A heat map 
of potential automation activities within companies can help to guide, 
identify, and prioritize the potential processes and activities that could be 
transformed. As we have noted, the key question will be where and how to 
unlock value, given the cost of replacing human labor with machines. The 
majority of the benefits may come not from reducing labor costs but from 
raising productivity through fewer errors, higher output, and improved 
quality, safety, and speed. 

It is never too early to prepare for the future. To get ready for automation’s 
advances tomorrow, executives must challenge themselves to understand 
the data and automation technologies on the horizon today. But more than 
data and technological savvy are required to capture value from automation. 
The greater challenges are the workforce and organizational changes that 
leaders will have to put in place as automation upends entire business 



 12

processes, as well as the culture of organizations, which must learn to view 
automation as a reliable productivity lever. Senior leaders, for their part, 
will need to “let go” in ways that run counter to a century of organizational 
development.5

Understanding the activities that are most susceptible to automation from 
a technical perspective could provide a unique opportunity to rethink how 
workers engage with their jobs and how digital labor platforms can better 
connect individuals, teams, and projects.6 It could also inspire top managers 
to think about how many of their own activities could be better and more 
efficiently executed by machines, freeing up executive time to focus on the 
core competencies that no robot or algorithm can replace—as yet.
