One of the main sources of inefficiency is high transaction costs. For individuals in a social network to be able to insure each other, money has to exchange hands. Prior to mobile money, a large share of money transfers happened either in person or by bus, both extremely costly ways to send money. When money is anchored to cash and cash movements are anchored to physical channels, the spatial distribution of social networks through which financial flows are possible, is limited. It implies that individuals largely share risk among friends or family who live close to them - this is not efficient as people who live close together are likely to face some of the same unexpected events, for example a drought in a farming community, and in such situations will be unable to insure each other.
km, which was a KShs 460 bus ride (the cost via M-PESA was KShs 35). As a result of the reduction in costs of sending and receiving money across distance, households that use (or have access to) M-PESA are better able to deal with unexpected events. The per capita consumption for households that do not use M-PESA falls by 7 percent when their household is hit by a negative shock. On the other hand, M-PESA users are able to maintain consumption levels steady in the aftermath of shocks. This capacity to absorb financial shocks is stronger for households in the bottom three quintiles of the wealth distribution in Kenya.
Mobile money has influenced the welfare of households and is shaping the emergence of a new financial economy in Kenya. Although M-PESA has led to large reductions in transaction costs, there is room for further reductions in transaction costs that would benefit Kenyan households. As is often the case, the next reductions in transactions costs will also be harder to achieve, and will require new innovations and new investments.
