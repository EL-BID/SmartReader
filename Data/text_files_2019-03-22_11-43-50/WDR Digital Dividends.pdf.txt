We fi nd ourselves in the midst of the greatest information and communications revolution 
in human history. More than 40 percent of the world’s population has access to the inter-
net, with new users coming online every day. Among the poorest 20 percent of households, 
nearly 7 out of 10 have a mobile phone. The poorest households are more likely to have access 
to mobile phones than to toilets or clean water. 

We must take advantage of this rapid technological change to make the world more 
prosperous and inclusive. This Report fi nds that traditional development challenges are 
preventing the digital revolution from fulfi lling its transformative potential.

For many people, today’s increase in access to digital technologies brings more choice 
and greater convenience. Through inclusion, effi ciency, and innovation, access provides 
opportunities that were previously out of reach to the poor and disadvantaged.

In Kenya, for example, the cost of sending remittances dropped by up to 90 percent after 
the introduction of M-Pesa, a digital payment system. New technologies allow women to 
participate more easily in the labor market—as e-commerce entrepreneurs, in online work, 
or in business-process outsourcing. The world’s 1 billion persons with disabilities—80 per-
cent of whom live in developing countries—can lead more productive lives with the help of 
text, voice, and video communication. And digital ID systems can provide better access to 
public and private services for the 2.4 billion people who lack formal identifi cation records, 
such as a birth certifi cate.  

While this is great progress, many are still left out because they do not have access to 
digital technologies. Those in extreme poverty have the most to gain from better commu-
nication and access to information. Nearly 6 billion people do not have high-speed internet, 
making them unable to fully participate in the digital economy. To deliver universal digital 
access, we must invest in infrastructure and pursue reforms that bring greater competition 
to telecommunications markets, promote public-private partnerships, and yield effective 
regulation.  

The Report concludes that the full benefi ts of the information and communications 
transformation will not be realized unless countries continue to improve their business 
climate, invest in people’s education and health, and promote good governance. 

In countries where these fundamentals are weak, digital technologies have not boosted 
productivity or reduced inequality. Countries that complement technology investments 
with broader economic reforms reap digital dividends in the form of faster growth, more 
jobs, and better services. 

The World Bank Group stands ready to help countries pursue these priorities. We are 
already working with clients to promote competitive business environments, increase 
accountability, and upgrade education and skills-development systems to prepare people for 
the jobs of the future.

xiv FOREWORD

While people around the world make more than 4 billion Google searches every day, 
4 billion people still lack access to the internet. The fi ndings of this Report should be used by 
all who are working to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. The greatest rise of 
information and communications in history will not be truly revolutionary until it benefi ts 
everyone in every part of the world.

Inclusion, effi ciency, innovation—these are the main 
mechanisms for digital technologies to promote 
development.

Although there are many individual success sto-
ries, the effect of technology on global productivity, 
expansion of opportunity for the poor and the middle 
class, and the spread of accountable governance has 
so far been less than expected (fi gure O.2).2 Firms are 
more connected than ever before, but global produc-
tivity growth has slowed. Digital technologies are 
changing the world of work, but labor markets have 
become more polarized and inequality is rising—par-
ticularly in the wealthier countries, but increasingly 
in developing countries. And while the number of 
democracies is growing, the share of free and fair 
elections is falling. These trends persist, not because 
of digital technologies, but in spite of them. 

So, while digital technologies have been spreading, 
digital dividends have not. Why? For two reasons. First, 
nearly 60 percent of the world’s people are still offl ine 

Digital technologies—the internet, mobile phones, 
and all the other tools to collect, store, analyze, and 
share information digitally—have spread quickly. 
More households in developing countries own a 
mobile phone than have access to electricity or clean 
water, and nearly 70 percent of the bottom fi fth of 
the population in developing countries own a mobile 
phone. The number of internet users has more than 
tripled in a decade—from 1 billion in 2005 to an 
estimated 3.2 billion at the end of 2015.1 This means 
that businesses, people, and governments are more 
connected than ever before (fi gure O.1). The digital 
revolution has brought immediate private bene-
fi ts—easier communication and information, greater 
convenience, free digital products, and new forms of 
leisure. It has also created a profound sense of social 
connectedness and global community. But have mas-
sive investments in information and communication 
technologies (ICTs) generated faster growth, more 
jobs, and better services? Indeed, are countries reap-
ing sizable digital dividends?

Technology can be transformational. A digital 
identifi cation system such as India’s Aadhaar, by 
overcoming complex information problems, helps 
willing governments to promote the inclusion of dis-
advantaged groups. Alibaba’s business-to-business 

OVERVIEW

Strengthening the 
analog foundation of the 
digital revolution

Digital technologies have spread rapidly in much of the world. Digital dividends—the broader development benefi ts from 
using these technologies—have lagged behind. In many instances digital technologies have boosted growth, expanded oppor-
tunities, and improved service delivery. Yet their aggregate impact has fallen short and is unevenly distributed. For digital 
technologies to benefi t everyone everywhere requires closing the remaining digital divide, especially in internet access. But 
greater digital adoption will not be enough. To get the most out of the digital revolution, countries also need to work on the 
“analog complements”—by strengthening regulations that ensure competition among businesses, by adapting workers’ skills 
to the demands of the new economy, and by ensuring that institutions are accountable.

institutions, amplify the voice of elites, which can 
result in policy capture and greater state control. And 
because the economics of the internet favor natural 
monopolies, the absence of a competitive business 
environment can result in more concentrated markets, 
benefi ting incumbent fi rms. Not surprisingly, the bet-
ter educated, well connected, and more capable have 
received most of the benefi ts—circumscribing the 
gains from the digital revolution.

and can’t participate in the digital economy in any 
meaningful way. Second, some of the perceived bene-
fi ts of digital technologies are offset by emerging risks 
(fi gure O.3). Many advanced economies face increas-
ingly polarized labor markets and rising inequality—in 
part because technology augments higher skills while 
replacing routine jobs, forcing many workers to com-
pete for low-paying jobs. Public sector investments 
in digital technologies, in the absence of accountable

4 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

foundation, consisting of regulations that create a 
vibrant business climate and let fi rms leverage dig-
ital technologies to compete and innovate; skills that 
allow workers, entrepreneurs, and public servants to 
seize opportunities in the digital world; and account-
able institutions that use the internet to empower 
citizens. The long-term development impact is by 
no means defi nitive, being continuously shaped by 
the evolution of technology (connectivity) and the 
country’s choice of economic, social, and governance 
arrangements (complements).4 Countries that are 
able to swiftly adjust to this evolving digital economy 
will reap the greatest digital dividends, while the rest 
are likely to fall behind (fi gure O.3 and box O.1). 

The triple complements—a favorable business cli-
mate, strong human capital, and good governance—
will sound familiar—and they should because they 
are the foundation of economic development. But 
digital technologies add two important dimensions. 
First, they raise the opportunity cost of not undertak-
ing the necessary reforms. They amplify the impact 
of good (and bad) policies, so any failure to reform 
means falling farther behind those who do reform. 
With digital technologies, the stakes have risen for 
developing countries, which have more to gain than 
high-income countries, but also more to lose. Second, 
while digital technologies are no shortcut to develop-
ment, they can be an enabler and perhaps an accel-
erator by raising the quality of the complements. 
Online business registries ease market entry for new 
and innovative fi rms. Well-designed internet-based 
training helps workers upgrade their skills. New 
media platforms can increase citizen participa-
tion. And digital enablers—digital fi nance, digital 
identifi cation, social media, and open data—spread 

To maximize the digital dividends requires better 
understanding of how technology interacts with other 
factors that are important for development—what the 
Report calls “analog complements.” Digital technol-
ogies can make routine, transaction-intensive tasks 
dramatically cheaper, faster, and more convenient. But 
most tasks also have an aspect that cannot be auto-
mated and that requires human judgment, intuition, 
and discretion. When technology is applied to auto-
mate tasks without matching improvements in the 
complements, it can fail to bring broad-based gains. 
The digital revolution can give rise to new business 
models that would benefi t consumers, but not when 
incumbents control market entry. Technology can 
make workers more productive, but not when they 
lack the know-how to use it. Digital technologies can 
help monitor teacher attendance and improve learn-
ing outcomes, but not when the education system 
lacks accountability.3

What should countries do? Making the internet 
universally accessible and affordable should be a 
global priority. The internet, in a broad sense, has 
grown quickly, but it is by no means universal. For 
every person connected to high-speed broadband, 
fi ve are not. Worldwide, some 4 billion people do not 
have any internet access, nearly 2 billion do not use a 
mobile phone, and almost half a billion live outside 
areas with a mobile signal. The unfi nished task of con-
necting everyone to the internet—one of the targets in 
the recently approved Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs)—can be achieved through a judicious mix of 
market competition, public-private partnerships, and 
effective regulation of the internet and telecom sector. 

Access to the internet is critical, but not suffi cient. 
The digital economy also requires a strong analog

5OVERVIEW

Box O.1 Frequently asked questions: The Report at a glance

What is the Report about?
It explores the impact of the internet, mobile phones, and 
related technologies on economic development. Part 1
shows that potential gains from digital technologies are 
high, but often remain unrealized. Part 2 proposes policies 
to expand connectivity, accelerate complementary reforms 
in sectors beyond information and communication technol-
ogy (ICT), and address global coordination problems.

What are the digital dividends?
Growth, jobs, and services are the most important returns 
to digital investments. The fi rst three chapters show how 
digital technologies help businesses become more pro-
ductive; people fi nd jobs and greater opportunities; and 
governments deliver better public services to all.

How do digital technologies promote development and 
generate digital dividends?
By reducing information costs, digital technologies greatly 
lower the cost of economic and social transactions for 
fi rms, individuals, and the public sector. They promote 
innovation when transaction costs fall to essentially zero. 
They boost effi  ciency as existing activities and services 
become cheaper, quicker, or more convenient. And they 
increase inclusion as people get access to services that 
previously were out of reach.

Why does the Report argue that digital dividends are not 
spreading rapidly enough?
For two reasons. First, nearly 60 percent of the world’s peo-
ple are still offl  ine and can’t fully participate in the digital 
economy. There also are persistent digital divides across 
gender, geography, age, and income dimensions within 
each country. Second, some of the perceived benefi ts of the 
internet are being neutralized by new risks. Vested business 
interests, regulatory uncertainty, and limited contestation 
across digital platforms could lead to harmful concentra-
tion in many sectors. Quickly expanding automation, even 

of mid-level offi  ce jobs, could contribute to a hollowing 
out of labor markets and to rising inequality. And the poor 
record of many e-government initiatives points to high fail-
ure of ICT projects and the risk that states and corporations 
could use digital technologies to control citizens, not to 
empower them.

What should countries do to mitigate these risks?
Connectivity is vital, but not enough to realize the full devel-
opment benefi ts. Digital investments need the support 
of “analog complements”: regulations, so that fi rms can 
leverage the internet to compete and innovate; improved 
skills, so that people can take full advantage of digital 
opportunities; and accountable institutions, so that gov-
ernments respond to citizens’ needs and demands. Digital 
technologies can, in turn, augment and strengthen these 
complements—accelerating the pace of development.

What needs to be done to connect the unconnected?
Market competition, public-private partnerships, and eff ec-
tive regulation of internet and mobile operators encourage 
private investment that can make access universal and 
aff ordable. Public investment will sometimes be necessary 
and justifi ed by large social returns. A harder task will be 
to ensure that the internet remains open and safe as users 
face cybercrime, privacy violations, and online censorship.

What is the main conclusion?
Digital development strategies need to be broader than ICT 
strategies. Connectivity for all remains an important goal 
and a tremendous challenge. But countries also need to 
create favorable conditions for technology to be eff ective. 
When the analog complements are absent, the develop-
ment impact will be disappointing. But when countries 
build a strong analog foundation, they will reap ample 
digital dividends—in faster growth, more jobs, and better 
services. 

benefi ts throughout the economy and society, fur-
ther strengthening the interaction between technol-
ogy and its complements.

Digital transformations—
digital divides
The internet and related technologies have reached 
developing countries much faster than previous 

technological innovations. For Indonesia to reap the 
benefi ts of steamships took 160 years after their inven-
tion and for Kenya to have electricity, 60 years; but for 
Vietnam to introduce computers, only 15 years. Mobile 
phones and the internet took only a few years. More 
households in developing countries own a mobile 
phone than have access to electricity or improved san-
itation (fi gure O.4, panel a). Greater internet access has 
led to an explosion in the production and consumption 



6 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

nearly 70 percent own a mobile phone. The lowest 
mobile penetration is in Sub-Saharan Africa (73 per-
cent), against 98 percent in high-income countries. 
But internet adoption lags behind considerably: only 
31 percent of the population in developing countries 
had access in 2014, against 80 percent in high-income 
countries. China has the largest number of internet 
users, followed by the United States, with India, Japan, 
and Brazil fi lling out the top fi ve. The world viewed 
from the perspective of the number of internet users 
looks more equal than when scaled by income (map 
O.1)—refl ecting the internet’s rapid globalization.

Connected businesses
Internet adoption has increased across businesses in 
all country income groups. Nearly 9 of 10 businesses 
in high-income OECD (Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development) countries had a 
broadband internet connection in 2010–14, compared 
with 7 for middle-income countries and 4 for low-in-
come countries. But adoption rates for more sophisti-
cated technologies such as secure servers, enterprise 
network, inventory management, and e-commerce 
are much lower in most developing countries. 

Connected governments
Governments are increasingly going digital, and a 
greater share of government jobs in developing coun-
tries is ICT-intensive than in the private sector. By 2014, 
all 193 member states of the United Nations (UN) had 
national websites: 101 enabled citizens to create per-
sonal online accounts, 73 to fi le income taxes, and 60 
to register a business. For the most common core gov-
ernment administrative systems, 190 member states 
had automated fi nancial management, 179 used such 
systems for customs processing, and 159 for tax man-
agement. And 148 of them had some form of digital 
identifi cation, and 20 had multipurpose digital iden-
tifi cation platforms. So far, developing countries have 
invested more in automating back-offi ce functions 
than in services directed at citizens and businesses.

The divide in digital access and use 
persists
The lives of the majority of the world’s people remain 
largely untouched by the digital revolution. Only 
around 15 percent can afford access to broadband 
internet. Mobile phones, reaching almost four-fi fths 
of the world’s people, provide the main form of inter-
net access in developing countries. But even then, 
nearly 2 billion people do not own a mobile phone, 
and nearly 60 percent of the world’s population has no 
access to the internet. The world’s offl ine population is 

of information around the world (fi gure O.4, panel b). 
But while the internet has reached almost all coun-
tries quickly, the intensity of its use has been lower 
in poorer countries—in large part because it has not 
spread as widely within those countries. And despite 
many great examples of the uses of new technologies 
in developing countries, advanced economies have 
been using them even more effectively.5 

Connected people
On average, 8 in 10 individuals in the developing world 
own a mobile phone, and the number is steadily ris-
ing. Even among the bottom fi fth of the population,

people are still offl ine in North America (fi gure O.5). 

The digital divide within countries can be as high 
as that between countries. Worldwide, nearly 21 per-
cent of households in the bottom 40 percent of their 
countries’ income distribution don’t have access to 
a mobile phone, and 71 percent don’t have access to 
the internet. Adoption gaps between the bottom 40 

percent and the top 60 percent and between rural 
and urban populations are falling for mobile phones 
but increasing for the internet. In Africa, the digital 
divide across demographic groups remains consider-
able (fi gure O.6, panel a). Women are less likely than 
men to use or own digital technologies. Gaps are even 
larger between youth (20 percent) and those more 
than 45 years old (8 percent).

government. And their use of e-government is highly 
uneven—citizens in the top 20 percent of income in 
the most connected EU country are 45 times more 
likely to use e-services than those in the bottom 20 
percent of income in the least connected EU coun-
try (fi gure O.6, panel b). Within countries, greater 
e-government use by individuals is associated with 
education, employment, urban residence, being male, 
and broadband access.

How the internet promotes 
development
Digital technologies have dramatically expanded 
the information base, lowered information costs, 
and created information goods. This has facilitated 
searching, matching, and sharing of information and 
contributed to greater organization and collaboration 
among economic agents—infl uencing how fi rms 
operate, people seek opportunities, and citizens inter-
act with their governments. The changes are not lim-
ited to economic transactions—they also infl uence 
the participation of women in the labor force, the 

The increased connectivity has had limited effect 
in reducing information inequality. For example, 
there are more contributions to Wikipedia from 
Hong Kong SAR, China, than from all of Africa com-
bined, despite the fact that Africa has 50 times more 
internet users.6 The amount of information published 
on the web, and its origin, often corresponds to what 
one sees in the offl ine world as well. For instance, 
85 percent of the user-generated content indexed 
by Google comes from the United States, Canada, 
and Europe, similar to the share of global scientifi c 
journals originating in these countries. In fact, the 
information produced and consumed in the digital 
economy has little bearing on the number of users of 
digital technologies. Given that nearly one-fi fth of the 
world’s population is illiterate, the spread of digital 
technologies alone is unlikely to spell the end of the 
global knowledge divide. 

Countries that have bridged the digital-access 
divide often face a new divide in digital capabilities. 
In the European Union (EU), businesses are more 
likely than citizens to use the internet to interact with 
the government. Citizens use e-government mostly 
for getting information and not for transacting with

creditworthiness. Or a small fi rm that cannot connect 
with a potential buyer in another country and does not 
know whether to trust a new business partner. Or a 
freelancer willing to perform small tasks for a fee. Or 
a homeowner looking to rent her spare room to local 
visitors. Or remote or marginalized population groups 
who fall outside the reach of the services that gov-
ernments provide. In all these cases, a fundamental 

ease of communication for people with disabilities, 
and the way people spend their leisure. By overcom-
ing information barriers, augmenting factors, and 
transforming products, digital technologies can make 
development more inclusive, effi cient, and innovative 
(fi gure O.7 and box O.2). Spotlight 1 in the full Report 
explores the links between these three mechanisms 
in the broader economic literature. 

The internet promotes inclusion
Before the internet arrived, some transactions were 
so expensive that a market for them did not exist. 
Two types of transactions fall into this category. 
First is when two parties to a potentially benefi cial 
transaction simply didn’t know about each other and 
faced exorbitantly high search and information costs. 
Second is when one party had a lot more information 
than the other. In the economics literature, such situa-
tions are known as information asymmetries between 
buyers and sellers, and in the absence of trust and 
transparency, many transactions do not take place. 

By reducing the cost of acquiring information 
and making more information available transpar-
ently, digital technologies can make new transac-
tions possible.7 Consider a poor farmer who cannot 
access credit because the lender has no way to assess

expanding trade, creating jobs, and increasing access 
to public services—and thus promoting inclusion.8

The internet promotes effi  ciency 
Perhaps the largest impact has been on transactions 
that existed before the arrival of the internet but are 
now quicker, cheaper, or more convenient to carry out. 

information problem makes it diffi cult to make a 
deal or a match. Mobile phone records, business-to-
business e-commerce, the sharing economy, online 
reputation mechanisms, and digital identifi cation sys-
tems all help to overcome these information barriers. 
While they make the market more effi cient, the big-
gest benefi t seems to be their market creation effects: 

Box O.2 e-commerce with Chinese characteristics: Inclusion, effi  ciency, 
and innovation in Taobao villages

The dynamic growth and rapid spread of e-commerce 
in China is best illustrated by the Shaji phenomenon. 
The economy of Dongfeng village in Shaji town (Jiangsu 
Province) shifted from pig farming in the 1980s to plastic 
waste recycling in the 1990s. In 2006, a migrant from 
the village returned to open an online shop to sell simple 
furniture. His success encouraged other villagers to do 
likewise, and by the end of 2010, the village had 6 board 
processing factories, 2 metal parts factories, 15 logistics 
and shipping companies, and 7 computer stores serving 
400 households engaged in online sales throughout China 
and even in neighboring countries. Shaji was one of the 
fi rst “Taobao villages”—named after an online shopping 
platform run by the Alibaba Group—where at least 10 per-
cent of households are engaged in online commerce.a The 
Taobao villages, and the rise of e-commerce in China more 
generally, illustrate how the internet promotes inclusion, 
effi  ciency, and innovation. 

Inclusion. While the economies of China’s coastal urban 
areas have grown rapidly over the last three decades, rural 
and western parts of the country have lagged behind. 
But China’s large investments in rural connectivity are 
beginning to pay off . More than 90 percent of villages will 
have fi xed broadband access by the end of 2015. Online 
commerce has allowed producers in towns and villages to 
participate in the national and even global economy. At the 
end of 2014, there were more than 70,000 merchants in 
200 Taobao villages, and many more in other rural areas. 
Most of the stores are small, with an average of 2.5 employ-
ees. About one-third of owners are female, and one-fi fth 
were previously unemployed. About 1 percent are persons 
with disabilities. One of Alibaba’s top “netpreneurs,” con-
fi ned to a wheelchair after an accident, built a thriving 
online livestock business.

Effi  ciency. Besides the Taobao e-commerce site for 
consumers, Alibaba and other Chinese fi rms operate 
business-to-business platforms. They facilitate intra- and 
inter-industry trade in China’s already effi  cient production 
sector, as well as exports. They also make it easier for for-
eign fi rms to sell in China. Consumers benefi t from greater 
selection and convenience on online retail sites. Online 
trade has not only helped raise rural incomes but also 
made shopping more effi  cient. Purchasing power in rural 
areas is only about one-third that in cities, but the aggre-
gate consumption of China’s 650 million rural residents 
is vast, contributing to the national goal of moving from 
an export- and investment-driven economy to one that is 
more consumption based. And the boom in online trade 
has spawned numerous logistics companies that provide 
quick delivery—sometimes by bicycle in towns and villages. 

Innovation. Taobao and other e-commerce platforms are 
examples of innovation generated by the economies of 
scale that emerge when transaction costs drop drastically. 
Since these platforms are highly automated, fees can be 
kept low, and operations are often fi nanced by advertising 
alone. Some problems cannot easily be solved solely by 
automation, such as creating trust in the market and pre-
venting fraud. Online ratings, escrow services, and confl ict 
resolution mechanisms address them. One of the most 
valuable assets Alibaba and other e-commerce operators 
accumulate is data. Each transaction contributes to better 
knowledge about the economy and consumer behavior. 
This information supports new business lines, such as 
extending credit to small fi rms based on automated eval-
uations of creditworthiness. This can also advance fi nancial 
inclusion. In early 2015, for instance, Alibaba’s Ant Financial 
teamed up with the International Finance Corporation to 
expand credit to female entrepreneurs in China.

11OVERVIEW

Many internet businesses or services use a platform 
or “two-sided market” model. The platforms match 
buyers with sellers or a service user with a provider. 
In a ride sharing service, the platform automatically 
matches drivers and passengers (innovation), the 
driver takes advantage of a fl exible income-earning 
activity not otherwise accessible (inclusion), and the 
passenger benefi ts from greater convenience and 
often lower prices (effi ciency). Online crowdfunding, 
job matching, room sharing, and music sites operate 
similarly (fi gure O.8). 

The dividends: Growth, jobs, 
and service delivery
The benefi ts of digital technologies fi lter throughout 
the economy (fi gure O.9). For businesses, the internet 
promotes inclusion of fi rms in the world economy by 
expanding trade, raises the productivity of capital, 
and intensifi es competition in the marketplace, which 
in turn induces innovation. It brings opportunities to 
households by creating jobs, leverages human capital, 
and produces consumer surplus. It enables citizens to 
access public services, strengthens government capa-
bility, and serves as a platform for citizens to tackle 
collective action problems. These benefi ts are neither 
automatic nor assured, but in numerous instances 
digital technologies can bring signifi cant gains.

This mechanism operates in two ways. First, the dra-
matic decline in the price of digital technologies has 
led businesses and governments to replace existing 
factors—labor and non-ICT capital—with ICT capital 
and to automate some of their activities. Airlines use 
online booking systems to fi ll planes. Supermarkets 
substitute cashiers with automated checkout count-
ers. Manufacturers use real-time inventory and sup-
ply chain management systems. And governments 
invest in information management systems and offer 
online services for a wide range of tasks—from issu-
ing drivers’ licenses to fi ling taxes. 

Second, digital technologies augment the factors 
not substituted and make them more productive. They 
help managers to better supervise their workers, poli-
ticians to monitor the service providers, and workers 
to use technology to become more productive, thus 
raising the returns to their human capital. By stream-
lining tasks and raising the productivity of existing 
factors, the internet can greatly increase economic 
effi ciency across fi rms, workers, and governments.

The internet promotes innovation 
The extreme case of effi ciency is when transactions 
are executed automatically, without human input, 
and transaction costs fall to essentially zero. This is 
the realm of the “new economy,” such as search or 
e-commerce platforms, digital payment systems, 
e-books, streaming music, and social media. The fi xed 
cost of building the platform may be large, but the 
marginal cost of carrying out another transaction or 
adding another user is tiny. This gives rise to increas-
ing returns to scale, which stimulate new business 
models and provide a major advantage to online 
fi rms competing with their offl ine counterparts. The 
zero marginal cost attracts new sellers and buyers to 
the fi rm’s platform, creating virtuous network effects, 
where the benefi t to a buyer increases as more sellers 
join in, and vice versa. An auction site attracts more 
bidders the more the sellers use it, and a search engine 
learns and becomes more useful the more searches 
are performed. Scale and zero marginal costs also 
explain why many of the social network sites have 
become the preferred vehicles for social mobilization 
and political protests. By enabling almost frictionless 
communication and collaboration, the internet can 
support new delivery models, encourage collective 
action, and accelerate innovation.

The 2016 WDR presents many examples of how 
the internet promotes inclusion, effi ciency, and 
innovation. In the internet economy the three mecha-
nisms often operate together. So the one-to-one map-
ping in fi gure O.7 simplifi es a more complex reality.

has become an essential part of a country’s infra-
structure—and a factor of production in almost any 
activity in a modern economy. Isolating the impact of 
digital technologies is therefore diffi cult at an aggre-
gate level. Firm-level analysis provides a more reli-
able picture.9 The internet enables many small fi rms 
to participate in global trade, thus leading to more 
inclusion; it makes existing capital more productive, 
raising effi ciency; and by stimulating competition, it 
encourages innovation. 

Expanding trade
The internet enables more products to be exported to 
more markets, often by newer and younger fi rms. A 
10-percent increase in internet use in the exporting 
country is found to increase the number of prod-
ucts traded between two countries by 0.4 percent. 
A similar increase in internet use of a country pair 
increases the average bilateral trade value per prod-
uct by 0.6 percent.10 Firms selling on eBay in Chile, 
Jordan, Peru, and South Africa are younger than fi rms 
in the offl ine markets.11 In Morocco, rural artisans, 
some of them illiterate, sell globally through the Anou 
crafts platform. At the other end of the spectrum, 
businesses trade on global e-commerce sites such as 
Alibaba’s in an online market that could reach more 
than US$6 trillion over the next fi ve years. Online 
platforms overcome trust and information problems 
through feedback and rating systems and by offering 
escrow and dispute resolution mechanisms. Easier 
trade of intermediate products encourages further 
“unbundling” of production processes, not just in 
the markets for goods but also for services.12 Firms 
in India, Jamaica, and the Philippines have captured 
a share of these global markets for services that range 
from traditional back-offi ce services to long-distance 
online tutoring. 

Improving capital utilization
Perhaps the greatest contribution to growth comes 
from the internet’s lowering of costs and thus from 
raising effi ciency and labor productivity in practi-
cally all economic sectors. Better information helps 
companies make better use of existing capacity, opti-
mizes inventory and supply chain management, cuts 
downtime of capital equipment, and reduces risk. In 
the airline industry, sophisticated reservation and 
pricing algorithms increased load factors by about 
one-third for U.S. domestic fl ights between 1993 and 
2007. The parcel delivery company UPS famously 
uses intelligent routing algorithms to avoid left turns, 
saving time and about 4.5 million liters of petrol per 
year. Many retailers now integrate their suppliers in 

The internet can lead to more trade, better 
capital use, and greater competition
The ICT sector is a fairly modest part of the overall 
economy. Its share in GDP is around 6 percent in 
OECD member countries and considerably less in 
developing countries (fi gure O.10, panel a). In the 
United States, home to 8 of the world’s 14 largest tech-
nology companies by revenue, the contribution of 
the ICT sector to GDP is around 7 percent. The corre-
sponding number for Ireland is 12 percent—a country 
that does not boast its own Silicon Valley, but attracts 
many foreign fi rms through its competitive business 
environment and favorable tax rates. In Kenya, which 
hosts one of the largest ICT sectors in Africa, the value 
added share of ICT services in GDP was 3.8 percent 
in 2013. 

The contribution of ICT capital to GDP growth 
has been fairly constant over the past two decades. 
In high-income countries, it has fallen from 0.7 per-
centage points in 1995–99 to 0.4 percentage points in 
2010–14 (fi gure O.10, panel b). In developing countries, 
the contribution of ICT capital to GDP growth has 
been fairly modest—around 15 percent of growth—
refl ecting lower digital adoption. With rapid diffusion 
of digital technologies into developing countries, this 
number could rise in the future. In addition, the indi-
rect contributions of ICT capital to economic growth, 
through improvements in total factor productivity 
(TFP), could be large as well, although rigorous evi-
dence linking the two is still missing. 

The rapid adoption of digital technologies in 
the economy has meant that its benefi ts are widely 
dispersed and its indirect growth impacts diffi cult 
to estimate. Like energy or transport, the internet

The internet can also facilitate market entry. Inter-
net fi rms can start and scale up quickly with relatively 
little staffi ng or capital investment. Cloud comput-
ing—the leasing of computing and data storage 

real-time supply chain management to keep inventory 
costs low. Vietnamese fi rms using e-commerce had on 
average 3.6 percentage point higher TFP growth than 
fi rms that did not use it (fi gure O.11). Chinese car com-
panies that are more sophisticated users of the inter-
net turn over their inventory stocks fi ve times faster 
than their less savvy competitors. And Botswana and 
Uruguay maintain unique ID and trace-back systems 
for livestock that fulfi ll requirements for beef exports 
to the EU, while making the production process more 
effi cient. 

Advancing competition
When fully automated internet-based services drive 
marginal transaction costs to zero, the consequences 
for market structure are somewhat ambiguous. Low 
marginal costs imply large economies of scale, which 
favor natural monopolies. In the offl ine world, such 
sectors—for example, electricity production—often 
require some form of regulation to protect consumer 
interests. But the characteristics of internet-based 
services could also encourage competition. Price-
comparison websites, for example, should reduce 
prices for consumers, even though the evidence 
shows that price dispersion on the internet persists, 
in part because companies are getting better at price 
discrimination—offering different prices to different

technology will have an advantage. But even the poor 
benefi t to some extent through indirect job creation 
and better access to work and markets. As governments 
and the private sector get better at tailoring digital ser-
vices to the poor, those gains will likely increase.

Creating jobs
The number of direct jobs created by digital technol-
ogies is fairly modest, but the number enabled by it 
can be large. In developing countries, the ICT sector 
accounts for only about 1 percent of the workforce on 
average: less than 0.5 percent in Bolivia and Ghana, 
and just under 2 percent in Colombia and Sri Lanka. 
In OECD countries, about 3–5 percent of the employ-
ment is in this sector. Instagram, a photo sharing app, 
had just 13 employees in 2012 when it was bought by 
Facebook for US$1 billion. Facebook had 5,000 employ-
ees at the time—compared with 145,000 at Kodak at its 
peak in photographic fi lm in the 1990s. Yet Facebook’s 
market value is several times what Kodak’s was back 
then.13 ICT jobs, however, tend to pay well, and each 
high-tech job generates 4.9 additional jobs in other 
sectors in the United States.14 In Kenya, the M-Pesa 
digital payment system creates additional income 
for more than 80,000 agents. And China’s State Infor-
mation Center estimates that the recent boom in the 
country’s e-commerce sector has created 10 million 
jobs in online stores and related services, about 1.3 
percent of the country’s employment. New opportu-
nities for entrepreneurship and self-employment are 
also growing rapidly in the digital economy.

The internet’s ability to reduce transaction costs 
increases opportunities for people who face barriers 
in fi nding jobs or productive inputs. This promotes 
inclusion for women, for persons with disabilities, 

services—reduces startup costs and allows fi rms to 
add capacity as the need arises, which also reduces 
risk to investors. Although many internet fi rms seem 
to operate in separate markets, most if not all com-
pete with offl ine fi rms. Instant messaging apps com-
pete with telecoms, search engines and social media 
sites compete with traditional media for advertising 
revenue, e-commerce fi rms compete with brick-and-
mortar fi rms, and mobile money competes with tra-
ditional banks. Innovations triggered by this online-
offl ine competition generally benefi t consumers, 
especially when offl ine markets are distorted. Trans-
port service companies such as Uber, Lyft, Olacabs, 
and Didi-Kuaidi Dache have disrupted taxi markets 
that tend to be overregulated with restricted entry and 
high prices. Similarly, TransferWise and Xoom have 
reduced regulatory rents in the fi nancial sector and 
cut the prices of international currency transfers by up 
to 90 percent. In Uganda, eKeebo allows independent 
or amateur chefs to provide and share home-cooked 
meals, circumventing restaurant licenses.

The internet supports job creation and 
makes workers more productive
People have an enormous desire to communicate 
and connect. The personal welfare gain from having 
access to digital technology is clearly great. Does it 
also increase people’s economic opportunities? People 
certainly use mobile phones and the internet more 
for social purposes than for professional ones. But an 
emerging literature also indicates that people realize 
tangible economic benefi ts. Quantifying these benefi ts 
is diffi cult, but qualitative evaluation of the evidence 
shows that benefi ts accrue most to those already better 
off (table O.1). Those who have the skills to leverage

remain high—almost 15 percent for an additional year 
of tertiary education in developing countries. 

The biggest gains from digital technologies for the 
poor are likely to come from lower information and 
search costs. Technology can inform workers about 
prices, inputs, or new technologies more quickly and 
cheaply, reducing friction and uncertainty.15 That can 
eliminate costly journeys, allowing more time for 
work and reducing risks of crime or traffi c accidents 
(box O.4).16 

Using technology for information on prices, soil 
quality, weather, new technologies, and coordination 
with traders has been extensively documented in 
agriculture (see sector focus 1 in the full Report). In 
Honduras, farmers who got market price information 
via short message service (SMS) reported an increase 
of 12.5 percent in prices received.17 In Pakistan, mobile 
phones allow farmers to shift to more perishable but 
higher return cash crops, reducing postharvest losses 
from the most perishable crops by 21–35 percent.18 
The impacts of reduced information asymmetries 
tend to be larger when learning about information 
in distant markets or among disadvantaged farmers 
who face more information constraints.19

Increasing the consumer surplus
Where the internet has led to a full automation of 
services, many jobs have been lost—few travel agents, 
booksellers, or music store employees are left. But 
these same dynamics have been a boon to consum-
ers. There are new digital goods and services—such 
as e-books, digital music, and search engines. And the 
internet has transformed existing ones—such as taxi 

and for people in remote areas (box O.3). Impact out-
sourcing brings internet-based jobs to the poor and 
vulnerable. The government of the Indian state of 
Kerala set up the Kudumbashree project to outsource 
information technology services to cooperatives of 
women from poor families; 90 percent of the women 
had not previously worked outside the home. Sama-
source and Rural Shores link clients in the United 
States and the United Kingdom with workers in 
Ghana, Haiti, India, Kenya, and Uganda. Of global 
online workers on the Elance freelancing platform, 
part of Upwork, 44 percent are women, and many 
wish to balance work and family life. Among respon-
dents to a survey of online workers for this Report, 
the ability to work fl exible hours from home is con-
sidered the greatest advantage of online work. 

Increasing labor productivity
For the economy as a whole, the most profound 
impact of the internet on individuals is that it makes 
workers more productive. By handing off routine and 
repetitive tasks to technology, workers can focus on 
activities with higher value. Judicious use of massive 
open online courses (MOOCs) or online teaching 
tools like Khan Academy lets teachers spend more 
time fostering discussion and working with students 
who fall behind. Researchers can dedicate more 
time thinking and innovating rather than searching 
for information or duplicating other people’s work. 
Managers can work more easily with teams across 
borders. These benefi ts are largest for the higher 
skilled. In fact, there has never been a better time to 
be a high-skilled worker, as the returns to education 

Box O.3 Bridging the disability divide through digital technologies

Over 1 billion people around the world have disabilities, and 
80 percent of them live in developing countries. Persons 
with disabilities face barriers to communicate, interact, 
access information, and participate in civic activities. 
Digital technologies are helping overcome some of these 
barriers. Technology enables multiple means of commu-
nication—voice, text, and gestures—to access information 
and engage with others. Voice recognition, magnifi cation, 
and text-to-speech functionality benefi t persons with 
visual, cognitive, learning, and mobility disabilities. Short 

message service (SMS), instant messaging, telephone relay, 
and video captions reduce communication barriers for 
persons with hearing and speech disabilities. Hands-free 
navigation and gesture-controlled interfaces assist persons 
with severe mobility impairments in using digital devices. 
But the mere existence of technology is an insuffi  cient 
condition to bridge the gaps in the socioeconomic inclu-
sion of persons with disabilities. A supportive ecosystem 
is needed to drive the implementation of accessible digital 
technologies.

an average of US$50 a month for services it now gets 
for free on the internet. Time-use data in the United 
States suggest that the median individual gains more 
than US$3,000 annually from the internet. In Estonia, 
digital signatures saved 20 minutes per transaction. 
And a study of the time costs of searching for infor-
mation shows that the average online search tends 
to be 15 minutes faster, the results are more accurate 
and relevant, and the experience more enjoyable than 
offl ine search in a library. On average, people might 
realize a consumer surplus as high as US$500 a year 
from such services, adding up to vast benefi ts when 
aggregated over all users. 

The internet can make governments more 
capable and responsive
Governments provide services that are typically 
nontradable, often lack scale, and are not subject to 
market competition. Raising effi ciency in the public 

and hospitality services, health, education, and retail. 
This has increased the variety of goods and services 
available, including those for leisure. The internet 
thus enhances consumer welfare, but in ways that are 
hard to measure.

People’s perceptions are that digital technologies 
have certainly made them better off. In 12 countries 
surveyed in Africa, 65 percent of people believe that 
their family is better off because they have mobile 
phones, whereas only 20 percent disagree (14.5 per-
cent not sure).20 And 73 percent say mobile phones 
help save on travel time and costs, with only 10 per-
cent saying otherwise. Two-thirds believe that having 
a mobile phone makes them feel more safe and secure. 

Some studies have attempted to quantify the 
economic value of these gains. A McKinsey survey 
of consumers in France, Germany, the Russian Fed-
eration, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United 
States in 2010 found that a household is willing to pay 

Box O.4 Digital dividends and the bottom billion

The poor benefi t from digital technologies, but only 
modestly in relation to the true potential. Nearly 7 of 10 
people in the bottom fi fth of the population in developing 
countries own a mobile phone, improving their access to 
markets and services. In rural Niger, agricultural price infor-
mation obtained through mobile phones reduces search 
costs by 50 percent.a In rural Peru, access to mobile phones 
boosted household real consumption by 11 percent between 
2004 and 2009, reducing poverty by 8 percentage points 
and extreme poverty by 5.4 percentage points.b

The poor can benefi t from digital technologies even when 
they don’t own a mobile phone or a computer. For exam-
ple, a digital ID, by giving millions of poor people an offi  cial 
identity, increases their access to a host of public and private 
services. In Narma Dih—a village in Bihar, India, with no 
electricity or all-weather roads—poor farmers benefi t from 
digitally enabled agricultural extension services from Digital 
Green, an NGO (nongovernmental organization) that trains 
farmers using locally produced how-to videos.c 

Yet the poor are capturing only a modest share of 
the digital dividends. While a majority of the poor have 
a mobile phone, they can’t access or aff ord the internet. 
In Latin America, fewer than 1 in 10 poor households is 

connected to the internet. In the Central African Republic, 
one month of internet access costs more than 1.5 times the 
annual per capita income. Even mobile phones are expen-
sive: the median mobile phone owner in Africa spends over 
13 percent of her monthly income on phone calls and text-
ing. And many poor lack the basic literacy and numeracy 
skills needed to use the internet. In Mali and Uganda, about 
three-quarters of third-grade children cannot read. In 
Afghanistan and Niger, 7 of 10 adults are illiterate. 

In advanced economies the poor face the prospects 
of stagnant wages and fewer opportunities, as they are 
increasingly forced to compete with those displaced by 
automation. Digital technologies can also exacerbate 
socioeconomic disparities. For example, the internet voting 
on municipal budget proposals in the state of Rio Grande 
do Sul in Brazil and citizen engagement initiatives such as 
Uganda’s U-report show that the new users are more likely 
to be male, young, university educated, and wealthy—those 
already better off  before the internet’s advent.d

Rapid technological progress will increasingly enable 
the poor to aff ord and use many digital services. But their 
ability to reap dividends from these investments will be 
largely determined by providing the analog complements.

17OVERVIEW

improved service effi ciency. E-procurement helped 
India and Indonesia inject more competition into the 
process by increasing the probability that the win-
ning bidder comes from outside the project’s region. 
This also improved the quality of infrastructure. But 
a majority of public sector digital technology projects 
fail to achieve the project objectives, resulting in con-
siderable fi scal waste.22 

Digital technologies can also improve management 
by monitoring the performance of workers. A small but 
growing impact evaluation literature reports generally 
positive effects of technology-based monitoring on 
worker absenteeism when combined with other insti-
tutional reforms.23 In Uganda, where teacher absen-
teeism is estimated at 27 percent, head teachers use 
mobile phones to record attendance and transmit data 
to a central database that generates weekly reports. 
Combined with incentive pay for teachers tied to atten-
dance, the program reduced absenteeism by 11 percent-
age points. The internet also provides real-time data for 
better planning and management of service facilities. 
In Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, and Zambia, health work-
ers use mobile phones to report counterfeit drugs and 
stock-outs. Aggregated in a central database and geo-
graphically mapped, this information helps adminis-
trators address drug and equipment shortages. 

Providing citizens the opportunity to give specifi c 
feedback quickly has helped improve performance in 
many instances. Mobile-phone apps like SeeClickFix 
and FixMyStreet in the United States and the United 
Kingdom let users report potholes, graffi ti, and illegal 
dumping. Governments can report back on fi xes, clos-
ing the feedback loop. Internet call centers enabling 
citizens to report problems and track the status of 
their requests are now standard in Barcelona, Buenos 
Aires, Muscat, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul, and Ulaanbaatar, 
to name a few cities. The Nairobi water company uses 
MajiVoice, and one of the electricity supply com-
panies in the Dominican Republic, EDE Este, uses a 
similar system to receive complaints, track their reso-
lution through an automated workfl ow, and regularly 
update citizens on progress. When implemented well, 
citizens eagerly take up the opportunity to give feed-
back, and resolution time declines (see fi gure O.12).

Advancing voice
Governments, particularly those in digitally advanced 
countries like Estonia, the Republic of Korea, and 
Singapore, are beginning to take advantage of data 
analytics and digital platforms for faster, more 
informed, and integrated policy making. The internet 
also opens new avenues for participatory democracy. 
Iceland has experimented with crowdsourcing its 
constitution, and Brazil and Estonia have explored 

sector is thus challenging, and one might expect 
the internet to bring large benefi ts in public service 
provision. There are indeed many examples where 
the internet has raised the capabilities of the public 
sector. Better tools for communicating with citizens 
and providing information also allow greater partici-
pation—through inclusion in government assistance 
programs, or feedback to and monitoring of public 
offi cials. And the internet helps citizens to connect 
online and organize for collective action in order to 
put pressure when government performance falls 
short of people’s expectations.

Expanding participation
Lack of identity is an impediment for poor people to 
exercise their basic democratic and human rights. 
Where civil registration systems are weak or non-
existent, many of the poor are simply not counted. 
Digital identifi cation can help overcome barriers 
to participation. Many countries have introduced 
general- purpose digital identity (ID) schemes or 
specifi c systems for elections or to manage postcon-
fl ict transfers—with numerous benefi ts, including 
making the public sector more effi cient. Nearly 900 
million Indians have been issued digital IDs in the 
past fi ve years, which they are using to open bank 
accounts, monitor attendance of civil servants, and 
identify recipients of government subsidies. Nigeria’s 
e-ID revealed 62,000 public sector “ghost workers,” 
saving US$1 billion annually. But the most important 
benefi t may be in better integrating marginalized or 
disadvantaged groups into society.

Digital technologies also enable the poor to vote 
by providing them with robust identifi cation and 
by curtailing fraud and intimidation through better 
monitoring. Mobile phones enable citizens to report 
instances of violence and voter intimidation, improv-
ing electoral participation. In Mozambique, SMS 
messages allowed citizens to report electoral irregu-
larities and increased voter turnout by 5 percentage 
points.21 Ushahidi and Uchaguzi are crowdsourced 
applications that report and map election violence 
in Kenya. By multiplying the sources of information, 
the internet can reduce the risk of media capture and 
make censorship diffi cult. 

Improving public sector capability
The internet raises effi ciency and productivity 
through automation and data-driven management. 
Almost all countries have tried to automate tax and 
customs administration, as well as budget preparation, 
execution, and accounting. Results have been mixed. 
E-fi ling reduces tax compliance costs, and one-stop 
computerized service centers and online portals have

The risks: Concentration, 
inequality, and control
So, the internet can be an effective force for develop-
ment. But as the Report documents, the benefi ts too 
often are not realized, and the internet sometimes 
makes persistent problems worse. Why? The key 
insight is that for complex occupations, business 
activities, or public services, the internet usually can 
make only a portion of tasks cheaper, more effi cient, 
or more convenient through automation. Another 
portion still requires capabilities that humans possess 
in abundance but computers do not. Many traditional 
tasks of an accountant or bank teller are now auto-
mated, such as making calculations or processing 
withdrawals. Others require complex reasoning or 
socioemotional skills, such as designing tax strategies 
or advising clients. Likewise, many public services 
involving provision of information or routine permis-
sions can be automated. But others, such as teaching 
or policing, need a high degree of human discretion, 
tacit knowledge, and judgment.

Many problems and failures of the internet sur-
face when digital technology is introduced but the 
important analog complements remain inadequate. 
What are these complements? The main ones are 
regulations that ensure a high degree of competition, 
skills that leverage technology, and institutions that 
are accountable (fi gure O.13).

•  When the internet delivers scale economies for 
fi rms but the business environment inhibits com-
petition, the outcome could be excessive concen-
tration of market power and rise of monopolies, 
inhibiting future innovation.

•  When the internet automates many tasks but 
workers do not possess the skills that technology 
augments, the outcome will be greater inequality, 
rather than greater effi ciency.

•  When the internet helps overcome information 
barriers that impede service delivery but govern-
ments remain unaccountable, the outcome will be 
greater control, rather than greater empowerment 
and inclusion.

The interplay between internet investments and 
reforms in complementary areas is at the core of pol-
icy debates about technology impacts. A 2008 study 
by Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz,27 drawing on 
earlier work by Jan Tinbergen, framed these dynam-
ics in the labor market as a “race between education 
and technology.” As technology progresses, some 
skills become obsolete. Workers must acquire new 

participatory lawmaking. By dramatically lowering 
the cost of communication and coordination, social 
media can overcome the traditional barriers to citizen 
collective action. A growing empirical literature has 
also shown that cellphones and the use of Twitter and 
Facebook aided protests during the Arab Spring in the 
Arab Republic of Egypt,24 antiwar demonstrations in 
the United States,25 and citizen mobilization across 
Africa.26

or oligopolies. The risk of allowing underregulated 
entrants into a market must therefore be weighed 
against the benefi ts to consumers from lower prices 
and greater convenience.

The third potential risk comes from the dominant 
position of many online platforms and internet inter-
mediaries. Economic history shows that fi rms are 
tempted to exploit a dominant position. Large inter-
net fi rms may be no exception. The economics of the 
internet favor natural monopolies,28 and some plat-
forms now dominate their markets. They enjoy such 
high profi ts that they can quickly capture new mar-
kets by buying out competitors or developing a rival 
service; local startups, including those in developing 
countries, are left with tiny niche markets. Some of 
the biggest internet fi rms now face scrutiny from 
regulators. Google, which captures almost one-third 
of global digital advertising revenue,29 has been inves-
tigated for preferential placement of its own prod-
ucts, exploiting third-party content, and exclusionary 
practices in its placement of advertising.30 Amazon, 
the largest sales platform for book publishers, has 
used its market power to enforce its pricing policies. 
Safaricom, operating the M-Pesa payment system, 
resisted the entry of competing service providers. 
The vast amount of identifi able personal information 
that many of these companies collect raises further 
challenges (box O.5).

It is too early to tell whether these problems will 
diminish the overall economic benefi ts from the 
internet or be mitigated by the sector’s low entry costs 
and rapid technological change. Consumers have 
generally benefi ted from the internet-based busi-
ness models of existing and new fi rms. Markets are 
extremely dynamic, so many advantages from scale 
or moving fi rst may be temporary. And greater size 

skills that help them become more productive with 
the help of that technology. Adjustment takes time 
and will be painful for many, but this is how econo-
mies progress. The sections that follow discuss risks 
and complements in the private sector, in labor mar-
kets, and in the public sector.

Growing concentration: The nexus 
between regulations and technology 
One of the main mechanisms for the internet to pro-
mote economic growth is competition. Information 
fl ows increase and speed up so that customers have 
more choice and can compare prices more easily. 
Firms that use technology more effectively will do 
well and force others to follow suit. There is consid-
erable evidence that this is happening throughout the 
economy, but three potential problems could emerge.

First, while the internet has spread quickly in the 
private sector of some countries, adoption among 
non-ICT fi rms has been slow in other countries. 
Larger, fast-growing, skill-intensive, export-oriented, 
and urban fi rms tend to use digital technologies 
more. The causes of these differences are not well 
understood. Differences in adoption rates may simply 
refl ect differences in income, sector characteristics, 
and management capabilities, but they could also be 
due to barriers to adoption (fi gure O.14). One possibil-
ity is high import duties for digital goods and services 
in some countries. Another is market distortions 
and protections that allow fi rms to maintain profi ts 
without threats from more innovative entrants. For 
example, fi rms in Mexico that faced competition 
from China increased the number of computers per 
employee and became twice as likely to use the inter-
net for purchasing as those that didn’t face signifi cant 
competition. 

Second, when online businesses enter the turf of 
their offl ine counterparts, disruption can be great, 
and regulators are often unsure whether or how to 
react. Recently, “on-demand economy” fi rms Uber 
and Airbnb have challenged established taxi and 
hotel industries. Their platform business model is 
scalable and global and has spawned numerous local 
imitators. In cities from Paris to Delhi to Beijing, 
the reaction has been a scramble by offl ine incum-
bents to keep these new competitors out, usually by 
appealing to regulators to enforce established sector 
regulations such as the knowledge of the city (in the 
case of London cabbies) or insurance requirements. 
This can be a valid appeal when regulations protect 
public safety and ensure minimum service levels. But 
these new models often succeed because they enter 
heavily distorted markets with virtual monopolies

Rising inequality: The race between skills 
and technology
If the internet and related technologies promote 
growth, how are the gains shared in the labor market? 
While digital technologies raise productivity and 
enhance overall welfare, labor market disruptions 
can be painful and can result in higher inequality. 
Global trends provide some indication. One is that 
the share of national income that has gone to labor, 
especially routine labor, has fallen quite sharply 
in many developing countries—though Brazil and 
Ukraine are exceptions (fi gure O.15).31 Inequality has 

allows large fi rms to provide services and products at 
low cost or free of charge, and their high profi ts fuel 
investments in research and development (R&D). At 
the same time, it is clear that competition and market 
structure on the internet are in many ways not so dif-
ferent from the offl ine world. Policies need to ensure 
that all innovative companies can enter markets and 
compete on equal terms. Otherwise, the economic 
performance between fi rms of different size and in 
different countries could diverge further and contrib-
ute to similarly divergent performance of national 
economies.

Box O.5 What Facebook “Likes” reveal—the convenience-privacy 
trade-off 

When economists such as George Stigler and Richard 
Posner wrote about privacy and economics in the early 
1980s, they raised many issues debated today, but at that 
time the “storage and retrieval of information, and its accu-
rate dissemination, [were] often extremely expensive.”a 
Today, an enormous collection of identifi able information is 
making service delivery more effi  cient and more relevant. 
Service providers can better target or price their products 
based on known characteristics and preferences. Search 
engines provide more relevant search results. Health and 
auto insurers can better price premiums with verifi able 
information about exercise or driving behavior. And gov-
ernments can use data systems to reduce the bureaucratic 
burden for citizens. In Estonia’s e-government system, 
citizens never have to provide the same information twice.

The problem is that few people know how these large 
amounts of data are collected and used—and who controls 
them. Users are not always aware of and providers often 
don’t tell what information is collected. The secret snoop-
ing by governments can be for legitimate law enforcement 
reasons, but sometimes violates laws and rights, as the 
Edward Snowden revelations about spying by the security 
agencies of the United States, the United Kingdom, and 
others have shown. A consequence has been a new “data 
nationalism,” where countries are demanding that data 
about their residents be stored within their territory or 
favoring domestic technology that may be inferior or more 
expensive, but is trusted more.

Data collectors often sell the data to others. One data 
broker assembled an average of 1,500 pieces of informa-
tion about more than half a billion consumers worldwide 
from information people provided voluntarily on various 
websites. But even easily accessible data such as Facebook 
“Likes” can predict sensitive characteristics including 
“sexual orientation, ethnicity, religious and political views, 
personality traits, intelligence, happiness, use of addictive 
substances, parental separation, age, and gender.”b And 
smartphone sensors can infer a user’s “mood, stress levels, 
personality type, bipolar disorder, demographics (e.g., gen-
der, marital status, job status, age), smoking habits, overall 
wellbeing, progression of Parkinson’s disease, sleep pat-
terns, happiness, levels of exercise, and types of physical 
activity or movement.”c 

The risks? Cybercrime such as identity theft when data 
stored insecurely fall into the wrong hands. Discrimination 
when customers are charged a higher premium or inter-
est rate, or denied a job based on erroneous information 
they can’t easily correct. Persistence of dated information 
that denies protection from embarrassing but irrelevant 
information or a second chance, which prompted Europe’s 
“right to be forgotten” ruling. And perhaps most impor-
tant, reduced trust and thus suboptimal use of the internet. 
These concerns vary across societies. Fifty-eight percent of 
Nigerians and 57 percent of Indians believe private infor-
mation on the internet is very secure, but only 18 percent of 
French and 16 percent of German respondents do.d

21OVERVIEW

increased more where this shift in incomes toward 
capital and away from labor has been higher (fi gure 
O.16). A number of recent studies have linked techno-
logical change to this rising inequality (see chapter 2 
in the full Report).

A related trend is the polarization—or “hollow-
ing out”—of the labor market, not only in advanced 
economies, but increasingly also in many developing 
countries. The share of employment in high-skilled 
occupations is up, as is the share of low-skilled jobs. 
The share of middle-skilled employment, in contrast, 
is down in most developing countries for which 
detailed data are available (fi gure O.17). And these 
types of jobs are often near the top of the income 
distribution in low-income countries, as in Africa. 
A notable exception to these global trends is China, 
where growing mechanization in agriculture has led 
to a (perhaps temporary) increase in routine, mid-
level labor. Exceptions also include some countries 
rich in natural resources and commodity exporters, 
which include several countries in Central Asia and 
Latin America.

What explains all this? Machines can increasingly 
perform routine tasks more quickly and cheaply than 
humans, and much of what is considered nonroutine 
today—such as translation, insurance underwriting, 
or even medical diagnostics—computers might do 
just as well tomorrow. Unlike previous technolog-
ical transformations such as the mechanization of

than in more advanced ones, where many of these 
jobs have already disappeared (fi gure O.18). But it will 
likely take longer in lower-income countries. Most 
of them are still fairly low-tech, with only about one-
third of urban jobs in a sample of developing coun-
tries using any ICTs at work. And wage rates are still 
low, with a larger share of manual nonroutine labor, 
so investments in technology will be less profi table 
for fi rms. This does not mean, however, that lower -
income countries need not pay attention to these 
trends. Most important, even without signifi cant 
employment shifts, the nature of jobs is changing 
toward skills that remain hard for technology to emu-
late: that is, advanced cognitive and socioemotional 
skills. The policy response, besides rethinking social 
protection systems, is better and more responsive 
education and training—areas where reforms take 
many years to pay off. 

It is important to keep in mind the historical per-
spective that job displacement and job losses from 
technological change are an integral part of economic 
progress. It is precisely rising productivity—as tech-
nology replaces some human labor but augments the 
skills of remaining and new workers—that generates 

agriculture or the automation of manufacturing, the 
internet affects well-paying white-collar jobs even 
more than blue-collar jobs.

Some mid-level workers will have additional skills 
that allow them to switch to better-paid nonroutine 
occupations in which technology tends to augment 
human capital and make skilled workers more pro-
ductive. These workers will gain from technological 
disruption. In developing countries, returns to educa-
tion are highest among those with tertiary education, 
and they are higher and rising faster in ICT-intensive 
occupations.32 Those who do not have such skills will 
need to seek work in lower-skilled, nonroutine occu-
pations, such as janitorial services, hospitality, or per-
sonal care. Demand for such services could increase, 
but perhaps not enough to prevent downward wage 
pressure as the available workforce in these sectors 
grows. These dynamics are consistent with the rising 
returns to education and income inequality we see in 
many countries. 

The implications for developing countries depend 
on the pace of technological disruption. The share of 
occupations that could experience signifi cant auto-
mation is actually higher in developing countries

growth and frees human and fi nancial resources 
for deployment in sectors with higher returns. It 
also reduces the need for humans to do physically 
hard, repetitive, or dangerous work. Such trends will 
be welcome in countries that are rapidly aging or 
where the population is declining, or in professions 
where skills are in short supply. Telemedicine and 
automated diagnostics, for instance, allow medical 
experts to serve many more people, even remotely in 
areas with a shortage of doctors.

And fears of “technological unemployment” go 
back to the industrial revolution. Even such think-
ers as the economist John Maynard Keynes and the 
writer Isaac Asimov submitted to this fallacy. Keynes, 
in the 1930s, predicted 15-hour workweeks by the 
end of the 20th century, and Asimov, in a 1964 essay, 
expected that one of the most pressing problems for 
humanity by 2014 would be boredom “in a society of 
enforced leisure.” Yet over the centuries, economies 
have adapted to massive changes in labor markets—
the largest by far, being the shift out of agriculture. In 
1910, there were 12 million farmworkers in the United 
States. One hundred years later, there were only 
700,000 in a population more than three times larger. 
Still, nobody can predict the full impact of techno-
logical change in coming decades, which may be 
faster and broader than previous ones. What is clear, 
however, is that policy makers face a race between 

technology and education, and the winners will be 
those who encourage skill upgrading so that all can 
benefi t from digital opportunities.

Engendering control: The gap between 
institutions and technology
The internet was expected to usher in a new era of 
accountability and political empowerment, with 
citizens participating in policy making and forming 
self-organized virtual communities to hold gov-
ernment to account. These hopes have been largely 
unmet. While the internet has made many govern-
ment functions more effi cient and convenient, it has 
generally had limited impact on the most protracted 
problems—how to improve service provider account-
ability (principal-agent problems) and how to broaden 
public involvement and give greater voice to the poor 
and disadvantaged (collective action problems).

Whether citizens can successfully use the internet 
to raise the accountability of service providers depends 
on the context. Most important is the strength of 
existing accountability relationships between policy 
makers and providers, as discussed in the 2004 World 
Development Report, Making Services Work for Poor People. 
An examination of seventeen digital engagement ini-
tiatives for this Report fi nds that of nine cases in which 
citizen engagement involved a partnership between 
civil society organizations (CSOs) and government,

Grande do Sul, online voting increased voter turnout 
by 8 percentage points, but online voters were dis-
proportionately wealthier and more educated (fi gure 
O.19). Even in developed countries, engaging citizens 
continues to be a challenge. Only a small, unrepresen-
tative subset of the population participates, and it is 
often diffi cult to sustain citizen engagement. There 
is no agreement among social scientists on whether 
the internet disproportionately empowers citizens or 
political elites, whether it increases polarization, or 
whether it deepens or weakens social capital, in some 
cases even facilitating organized violence.

The use of technology in governments tends to be 
successful when it addresses fairly straightforward 
information and monitoring problems. For more 
demanding challenges, such as better management of 
providers or giving citizens greater voice, technology 
helps only when governments are already responsive. 
The internet will thus often reinforce rather than 
replace existing accountability relationships between 

three were successful (table O.2). Of eight cases that 
did not involve a partnership, most failed. This sug-
gests that, although collaboration with government 
is not a suffi cient condition for success, it may well 
be a necessary one. Another ingredient for success is 
effective offl ine mobilization, particularly because 
citizen uptake of the digital channels was low in most 
of the cases. For example, Maji Matone, which facil-
itates SMS-based feedback about rural water supply 
problems in Tanzania, received only 53 SMS messages 
during its fi rst six months of operation, far less than 
the initial target of 3,000, and was then abandoned.

Political participation and engagement of the poor 
has remained rare, while in many countries the inter-
net has disproportionately benefi ted political elites 
and increased the governments’ capacity to infl uence 
social and political discourse. Digital technologies 
have sometimes increased voting overall, but this has 
not necessarily resulted in more informed or more 
representative voting. In the Brazilian state of Rio

25OVERVIEW

governments and citizens, including giving govern-
ments more capacity for surveillance and control (box 
O.6). Closing the gap between changing technology 
and unchanging institutions will require initiatives 
that strengthen the transparency and accountability 
of governments.

Making the internet 
universal, aff ordable, 
open, and safe
First-generation ICT policies involving market 
competition, private participation, and light-touch 
regulation have led to near-universal access and 
affordability of mobile telephony, but have so far been 
less successful in spreading internet services. Much 
of the explanation lies in continued policy failures 
such as regulatory capture, troubled privatizations, 
ineffi cient spectrum management, excessive taxation 
of the sector, and monopoly control of international 
gateways. At the same time the absence of global con-
sensus in dealing with the next-generation issues—
such as privacy, cybersecurity, censorship, and inter-
net governance—is resulting in more circumspect 
and diverse approaches to regulating the internet 
(box O.7 and fi gure O.20).

Supply-side policies: Availability, 
accessibility, and aff ordability 
A useful framework for analyzing supply-side ICT 
policies is to consider the value chain that stretches 
from the point where the internet enters a country 
(the fi rst mile), passes through that country (the mid-
dle mile) to reach the end user (the last mile), and cer-
tain hidden elements in between (the invisible mile). 

•  The fi rst mile can be improved by liberalizing the 
market for satellite dishes and eliminating monop-
oly status over the international gateway and cable 
landing stations. 

•  Strengthening the middle mile involves liberalizing 
the market for building and operating backbone 
networks, encouraging open access to the incum-
bent’s network, requiring all major infrastructure 
programs (such as roads, railways, pipelines, and 
energy distribution) to include provision for an 
optical fi ber link, setting up internet exchange 
points, and creating local caches for frequently 
used content. 

•  Government policies can encourage the provision 
of last mile connectivity by permitting competing 
facilities, especially for intermodal competition 
(between cable, wireless, and digital subscriber 

line), and mandating the incumbent to make local 
access lines available to competitors at wholesale 
prices (local loop unbundling). 

•  The most critical portion of the invisible mile 
involves spectrum management, which requires 
increasing the amount of spectrum available, 
ensuring competitive access, encouraging sharing 
of essential facilities, such as radio masts, and liber-
alizing the market for spectrum resale.

In addition to pure ICT policies, almost everything 
that the private sector, citizens, or governments do on 
the internet requires some essential building blocks 
(box O.8). 

Demand-side policies: Open and safe 
internet use
 The challenges facing internet stakeholders today are 
as much about how networks are used (demand) as 
how they are built (supply). Global interconnected-
ness introduces new vulnerabilities in areas where 
coordination mechanisms are weak, still evolving, or 
based on nongovernment models. Threats to cyber-
security, and censorship are undermining confi dence 
and trust in the internet and increasing costs to busi-
nesses and governments, resulting in economic losses

26 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

Box O.6  Nailing Jell-O to the wall—restrictions on the fl ow of 
information

Governments also interfere directly with digital networks 
to control access to information. An early internet pioneer, 
John Gilmore, claimed, “the Net interprets censorship as 
damage and routes around it.”a And Bill Clinton in 2000 
said, “trying to control the internet is like trying to nail 
Jell-O to a wall.”b Yet private software vendors and state 
institutions have fi gured out ways to censor access to inter-
net content, whether by shutting down the entire national 
web domain, as the Arab Republic of Egypt did in 2011 for 
fi ve days; by preventing access to specifi c domestic or 
foreign websites; or by targeting individuals’ blog posts 
or other social media postings. Google received 6,951 
requests from governments in 2013 to remove content from 
search results, with the largest numbers from Turkey, the 
United States, and Brazil. Other countries, including China 
and the Islamic Republic of Iran, block Google and some 
other internet sites completely, although such restrictions 
may change in the future.

Governments of all types restrict access to content such 
as child pornography, hate speech, insults, or criticisms of 
authority fi gures, challenges to cultural or religious morals, 
or reporting of uprisings or accidents. When accountable 
governments determine what should be censored, the 

result refl ects broad societal preferences. In autocratic 
countries, where use of the internet in government is often 
as high as in democratic countries (fi gure BO.6.1), leaders 
face a dilemma. If they permit open discourse on the inter-
net, they risk challenges to their authority. If they do not, 
they risk isolating themselves from the global information 
economy. This is a balancing act, and countries are becom-
ing more sophisticated in calibrating their control—for 
example, censoring content that might encourage collec-
tive action, but not individual criticism.

Internet fi ltering and censorship impose welfare and 
economic costs. First, the cost of censoring or fi ltering inter-
net content diverts public funds from other uses. Monitoring 
domestic internet traffi  c and selectively blocking foreign 
websites requires large fi nancial resources, technical know-
how, and dedicated staff —all of which could be deployed 
for more productive tasks. Second, fi ltering and methods to 
circumvent it can slow the speed of internet access, which 
hurts business users. Third, fi ltering can restrict access to 
economically or scientifi cally useful information, such as 
the Google Scholar search engine for academic papers—
indispensable in universities and labs. Fourth, in the view 
of the European Union, for instance, blocking foreign

websites may be considered a nontariff  trade barrier. Local 
companies will fi ll the gap. This could be considered an 
economic benefi t or transfer rather than a cost. But it pre-
vents domestic users’ access to possibly better products, 

and domestic champions will not face as much innovation-
inducing competition. Fifth, widespread censorship means 
that people avoid discussing and exchanging ideas openly, 
a prerequisite for an innovative and productive society.

Box O.7 Is the internet a public good?

The internet does not have all of the characteristics of a 
pure public good. Access to the internet often requires a 
fee, so individuals can be eff ectively excluded from its use. 
But once on the internet, the consumption of information 
by one user does not reduce its availability to others, so in 
that sense it is nonrivalrous (although capacity constraints 
can slow down access). One way to describe the internet is 
as a club good that is excludable but nonrivalrous, similar 
to cable television; or if bandwidth is scarce, as a private 
good with strong positive externalities—everyone benefi ts 
as more people come online. As more essential services 
and information migrate to the web, anyone without access 
almost becomes a second-class citizen. And all citizens 

benefi t when everyone else is better informed and when 
public services are provided electronically at lower cost. 

The private sector should take the lead in providing 
internet infrastructure and services because the business 
case is usually compelling. But public investment or inter-
vention is sometimes justifi ed where the private sector is 
unable to provide aff ordable access. Historical precedents 
include the United States Communications Act of 1934, 
which called for universal “wire and radio communication 
service,” even in remote rural areas. Some countries have 
gone further. Finland, for example, has defi ned access to 
the internet at broadband speeds as a legal right and pur-
sues a universal access policy.

Box O.8 The four digital enablers 

The WDR 2016 looks at how the internet increases produc-
tivity of businesses, opportunities for people, and the eff ec-
tiveness of governments. Across these domains, four major 
enablers of digital development are critical. Four spotlights 
in the Report discuss their benefi ts and potential risks.

Digital fi nance. Banks have been early and eager adopters 
of digital technologies, but many of the major innovations, 
such as online payments, mobile money, and digital cur-
rencies, have come from nonbank institutions, including 
telecom and internet companies. Some of these innovations 
took root fi rst in developing countries, where they over-
came shortcomings in traditional fi nancial systems. Their 
benefi ts are distributed widely. Secure online payments fuel 

e-commerce. Electronic transfers reduce the cost of sending 
remittances. Peer-to-peer lending can vastly improve the 
fi nancial access of startups. Governments can make pay-
ments and social transfers at lower cost and with less fraud 
and leakage. However, if fi nancial regulations don’t keep 
pace with the rapid technological progress, these innova-
tions could risk aff ecting the stability of the overall system.

Social media. Social networks are fundamental to human 
society, and digital technologies have accelerated their 
formation. More than one-fi fth of the world’s population is 
now believed to be a member of one or more social media 
platforms. These platforms have been credited with facilitat-
ing economically benefi cial interactions, channeling users’

behavior in ways that are consistent with development, pro-
viding a platform for information and dissemination during 
natural disasters and emergencies, and encouraging political 
mobilization and social change. Some analysts think that 
social media played a critical role in recent events such as 
the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street, and thereby were 
instrumental in spreading democratic ideas, although many 
remain skeptical of their actual impact. There is still much to 
learn about the role social media can play in development. 
While a source for innovative ideas, social media also remain 
conduits for gossip, slander, misinformation, harassment, 
bullying, and crime. One important lesson is that the impact 
of social media on development seems to be highly specifi c 
to context. Variation in access to technology, education, and 
broader sociopolitical context matters. For instance, there is 
evidence that people in more autocratic countries are less 
likely to forward information (for example, by re-tweeting it).

Digital identity. Being able to prove who you are may seem 
trivial, but it can be transformational for those excluded 
from jobs and services. Simple electronic identifi cation sys-
tems, often using biometric characteristics, have become 
an eff ective platform for secure bank transactions, voting, 
accessing social services, paying utility bills, and much 
more. Many countries, from Moldova to Nigeria and Oman, 
have introduced digital IDs. India is on track to register its 
entire population using its Aadhaar digital ID. In Estonia and 
other countries, thousands of diff erent types of public and 
private transactions are verifi ed with a unique electronic ID 

system, including legally binding contracts and voting in 
national elections.

Data revolution. In harnessing data for development, atten-
tion focuses on two overlapping innovations: “big data” and 
open data. Big data are voluminous or fast, and they come 
from myriad sources—from satellites to sensors and from 
clouds to crowds. Big data analytics is being deployed to 
improve traffi  c planning, estimate macro aggregates (also 
referred to as “nowcasting”), track the spread of epidemics, 
and improve credit scoring and job matching. Open data are 
those that are freely and easily accessible, machine-read-
able, and explicitly unrestricted in use. Governments are, 
or could be, the most important source of open data. 
Exuberant estimates of the current and potential economic 
value of big data and open data range from hundreds of bil-
lions to trillions of dollars per year. Yet sustained, impactful, 
scaled-up examples of big data and open data in developing 
countries are still relatively rare. Most big data are in private 
hands—large telecom and internet companies—which are 
reluctant to share it for fear of jeopardizing customer pri-
vacy or corporate competitiveness. Public agencies, too, are 
reluctant to share data, even when they have large public 
benefi ts. For example, of countries surveyed by the Open 
Data Barometer, one-third of the high-income countries 
and 85 percent of developing countries had made little or 
no progress in opening map data. Reasons include lack of 
technical skills, inadequate resources, and unwillingness to 
expose data to scrutiny.

Box O.8 The four digital enablers (continued)



29OVERVIEW

•  Workers, entrepreneurs, and public servants who 
have the right skills to take advantage of opportu-
nities in the digital world

•  An accountable government that effectively uses 
the internet to empower its citizens and deliver 
services.

What these priorities highlight is that core ele-
ments of the development agenda—business regula-
tions that ease market entry, education and training 
systems that deliver the skills that fi rms seek, and 
capable and accountable institutions—are becoming 
more important with the spread of the internet. Not 
making the necessary reforms means falling farther 
behind those who do, while investing in both tech-
nology and its complements is the key to the digital 
transformation.

Internet use still varies greatly between countries, 
as does the quality of complements, and both tend to 
move up with income (fi gure O.21). Policy priorities 
change as countries move along the digital transfor-
mation (fi gure O.22). Countries where internet use is 
still low should lay the foundation—such as removing 
barriers to internet access and adoption, promoting 
basic and digital literacy, and using the internet for 
elementary government functions like provision of 
information. As countries transition to higher levels 

as well as higher security spending. For privacy and 
data protection, different countries are taking quite 
different approaches. That makes it harder to develop 
global services. Ensuring safe and secure access will 
require enhanced international collaboration, based 
on a multistakeholder model.

Analog complements for a 
digital economy
The internet has great potential to promote economic 
development, but only some of that potential has 
so far been realized. It disrupts established markets 
for products, services, and labor, and it disrupts the 
public sector—major reasons for the frequent reluc-
tance to adopt and deploy the internet more broadly. 
But the benefi ts will come to those who embrace the 
changes the internet brings, not to those who resist 
them. And the way to get internet-enabled inclusive 
growth without long-term disruption is to strengthen 
the analog complements of digital investments (box 
O.9). Three policy objectives emerge from the analysis 
in the Report:

•  A business environment where fi rms can leverage 
the internet to compete and innovate for the benefi t 
of consumers

Box O.9 Technology and complements: Lessons from academic research

Recent research on growth, labor markets, and governance 
has taken a fresh look at the interplay between technology 
and other factors. These insights inform the discussion of 
policy priorities in this Report.

Rules. Technology interacts with rules (such as regulations 
and standards) to create new ideas, such as new ways of 
producing goods and services. Technology is traded across 
markets and borders, while most rules are established 
locally. When it encounters rules that do not match, tech-
nology fails to deliver the expected benefi ts. New busi-
nesses can acquire internet technology to reduce prices 
and increase convenience for consumers, but they will not 
be able to enter the market and compete if local regulations 
protect incumbents. 

Skills. Technology interacts with workers’ skills. It allows 
routine tasks to be automated. Workers with the right 

abilities will leverage technology to become more produc-
tive. Consider a modern offi  ce assistant who uses digital 
technologies to perform routine tasks quickly, and now 
spends far more time on personal interaction, complex 
scheduling, and other tasks that computers cannot easily 
perform.

Institutions. Technology interacts with discretion. Many 
tasks in government can also be automated, but others 
involve a high degree of judgment. That means that even as 
the internet can make many public service functions more 
effi  cient, the benefi ts will be limited when government 
offi  cials and workers do not have the incentives to use the 
technology for the public good. Teacher attendance can 
be fairly easily monitored using digital technologies, but 
the quality of teaching depends on the teacher’s training, 
resources, ability, and motivation.

the internet for most functions of government and 
for more participatory policy making.

Regulations that promote competition and 
entry
Digital adoption by fi rms varies among countries, 
and there are reasons for it to be slow. Most funda-
mentally, adoption requires knowledge about the 
technology, access to it, and knowledge of how to 
best apply it. But the most important driver is com-
petitive pressure, as fi rms adopting new technology 

of internet use, they require effective competition 
regulation and enforcement—including easy fi rm 
entry and exit; a greater focus on advanced cognitive 
and socioemotional skills that are augmented by tech-
nology; and effective e-government delivery systems 
for provider management and citizen engagement. 
Countries in advanced stages of the digital transfor-
mation need to tackle some of the most challenging 
tasks. They need to fi nd ways to facilitate “new econ-
omy” competition, to ensure lifelong learning and 
respond to the changing nature of work, and to use

Note: Technology is measured by the Digital Adoption Index (DAI). DAI is based on three sectoral subindexes covering businesses, people, and governments, 
with each subindex assigned an equal weight: DAI (Economy) = DAI (Businesses) + DAI (People) + DAI (Governments). Each subindex is the simple average 
of several normalized indicators measuring the adoption rate for the relevant groups. Similarly, complements is the average of three subindicators: starting a 
business; years of education adjusted for skills; and quality of institutions.

31OVERVIEW

benchmarking exercises and information programs 
can be effective. And to allow more innovative com-
panies to enter markets easily, countries need to 
improve fi rm registration and create greater market 
transparency to reduce price collusion, market shar-
ing, and rigged public procurement. E-government 
systems such as online business registration and 
e-procurement systems can simplify these processes 
and produce more openness.

Increase competition through eff ective 
regulation and enforcement
State control in economic sectors, barriers to entre-
preneurship, and restrictions on trade and investment 
reduce the incentives for fi rms in protected sectors to 
use digital technologies. Most countries have a com-
petition authority, although many were set up fairly 
recently and enforcement varies, especially when 
the state or politically connected fi rms benefi t from 
market restrictions. Moreover, the internet makes 
it easy to deliver services online from anywhere 
in the world, so how trade in services is regulated 
becomes increasingly important. Ethiopia, India, 
and Zimbabwe have the greatest restrictions on ser-
vice trade, but many other countries restrict specifi c 
services such as legal or accounting tasks. Countries 
can increase the competitiveness of their economies 
and encourage greater use of digital technologies by 
gradually reducing market distortions while building 
up effective competition enforcement. This applies as 

raise productivity and those who don’t fall behind. 
This highlights the critical role of a country’s business 
climate. It includes laws and regulations that ensure 
easy entry and exit of fi rms, and an open trade regime 
that exposes companies to foreign competition and 
investment. There is a political economy dimension 
to this as well—special interests infl uence regulators 
to keep markets closed to competition. This lessens 
the need for fi rms to reach for the technological fron-
tier. Where banks are heavily regulated and protected 
from new market entrants, they have less incentive 
to invest in effi ciency-boosting technology that might 
also help them serve customers better or reach new 
ones. But competition policy and enforcement are 
complex, and many low-income countries lack capac-
ity to design and implement them effectively.

Lower the barriers to digital adoption
In countries where the digital economy is still emerg-
ing, the priority is to facilitate connectivity and 
develop the foundation for effective competition reg-
ulation. Although 74 mostly middle- and high-income 
countries have unilaterally removed tariffs on ICT 
capital goods, computers and smartphones are still 
treated as luxury goods in some countries, including 
Turkey, where taxation adds almost half to the price of 
mobile handsets.33 Djibouti’s tariff on computers is 26 
percent. Many countries treat their telecom fi rms as 
cash cows. Where fi rms may have limited knowledge 
about how the internet can improve their business,

have the benefi t of being able to learn from the expe-
rience in the transforming countries before devising 
their own solutions.

Skills for the digital economy
Technological change means that many routine tasks 
will soon be done by machines. In contrast to previ-
ous episodes, the internet will also make many tasks 
carried out in white-collar jobs redundant. This puts 
a premium on different types of skills that automa-
tion complements rather than replaces (fi gure O.23). 
Education systems have been slow to respond to this 
challenge. Furthermore, the pace of change is fast, 
and the types of skills in demand change quickly. So 
workers will have to upgrade their skills frequently 
throughout their careers. These dynamics already 
play out in many transforming and some transition-
ing countries, but even for emerging countries it is 
not too early to prepare.

Start early with foundational skills
Skills development starts at birth and lasts a lifetime. 
Good parenting and early stimulation prepare chil-
dren for school, where cognitive and socioemotional 
foundations are laid. Technology can play a role. 
Even though the record on simply providing laptops 
or tablets to students is mixed, videoconferencing 
with English speakers from the Philippines has 
improved learning among fi rst graders in Uruguay. 
Khan Academy provides resources for independent 
learning, and using a gaming approach to math 
teaching benefi ted grade four children in Mumbai. 
But in these and many other cases, one factor was 
more important: the quality of teaching. It is no 
coincidence that Finland, one of the most connected 
and best-performing countries in educational test-
ing, uses very little technology in the classroom. 
It takes time to improve the quality of teachers, 

much to traditional businesses that use the internet 
as to internet platforms (box O.10).

Tailor “new economy” regulations to ensure 
competition
Internet fi rms create new business models and 
change market structure, posing new challenges for 
regulatory authorities. On-demand economy fi rms 
like Uber and Airbnb scaled up traditional ride shar-
ing and subletting to a global scale. But regulators 
struggle to determine whether these companies are 
taxi or hotel companies or simply software providers. 
Offl ine competitors complain that they do not follow 
the same regulations. Where these industries tend 
to be overregulated and their markets distorted, as is 
often the case in the taxi business, this new competi-
tion can encourage a general overhaul of the industry. 
In the United States, cities like New York and states 
like Massachusetts have begun to develop appropri-
ate regulations for these platforms, imposing safety 
and tax obligations but also reducing their competi-
tors’ regulatory burdens. 

Similar regulatory puzzles are posed by fi rms 
such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google. For example, 
Google is known as a search engine company but is 
better described as an advertising fi rm. These fi rms 
confound conventional competition law because they 
do not act as traditional monopolies. Their services 
are often free to consumers. But given their domi-
nance in the markets for online ads and books, they 
have considerable leverage over marketers and book-
sellers. This is similar to credit card companies’ posi-
tion with respect to retailers. Research by economists 
such as Jean Tirole has shown that regulations in 
such industries must be carefully tailored to guaran-
tee competition and avoid harm to consumers. These 
are very challenging problems, and most pressing in 
the transforming countries. Developing countries 

Box O.10 Opening the M-Pesa mobile money platform to competition

Safaricom’s mobile money system is a well-known success 
story. It was able to grow quickly because Kenya’s banking 
regulators initially decided to take a hands-off  approach. 
For seven years, Safaricom maintained a dominant position 
through exclusivity agreements locking agents into the 
system. Initially such arrangements were perhaps justifi ed 

because Safaricom incurred high costs developing the sys-
tem. But in 2014, Kenya’s Competition Authority changed 
the rules and opened the system to alternative mobile 
operators. The transaction cost of transfers of up to K Sh 
500 (US$4.91) fell from K Sh 66 to K Sh 44 (US$ 0.43).

33OVERVIEW

that traditional education systems do not teach 
and that are hardest to measure. Many countries 
are rethinking their approach. Singapore is moving 
from a fairly rigid “effi ciency driven” model that 
tried to get the best results from inputs (teachers 
and fi nance) to an “ability driven” model that empha-
sizes project work and fewer assessments in place of 
frequent testing. Colombia’s Escuela Nueva model, 
now serving 5 million students in 16 countries, also 
focuses on group learning and problem solving. These 
approaches change the relationship between teacher 
and student. No longer simply sources of information, 
teachers now must instruct students in how to fi nd 
information and apply it in a new and unexpected 
context. This requires changes in teacher training. 
There are many examples of how digital technologies 
can assist teachers and students—by allowing group 

however. But technology can help here as well, as  
Rio de Janeiro’s Educopedia platform shows (box 
O.11). Using technology to closely guide teaching 
is a second-best option that can improve learning 
outcomes at modest cost where teacher training is 
unlikely to improve quickly. This is the model used 
by the for-profi t Bridge Academy in Kenya and else-
where, where scripted instruction and automated 
administrative tasks help provide education at low 
cost. Although yet to be evaluated rigorously, such 
approaches hold promise to improve education.

Rethink curricula and teaching methods

for a career and not only a job. Modern labor markets 
require creativity, teamwork, problem solving, and crit-
ical thinking in ever-changing environments—skills

Box O.11 Mobilizing technology in teaching in Rio’s Educopedia 

Rio de Janeiro’s education department developed the 
Educopedia online platform of lessons and other resources 
in 2010 to improve public school teaching. The system 
focuses as much on providing materials for the teacher to 
improve lessons as on giving students access to learning 
resources. The system uses multimedia resources including 
videos, interactive quizzes, and digital libraries. It now 

serves almost 700,000 students. It has yet to be formally 
evaluated, but together with other reforms it likely con-
tributed to a more than 20-percent increase in the Basic 
Education Development Index in middle schools between 
2009 and 2012. And 80 percent of Rio’s students agreed 
that Educopedia helps their learning eff orts.

Improve informational services and 
monitoring
Although internet access is still low in many emerg-
ing economies, mobile phones are widespread and 
have great potential for improving services. In the 
health sector, simple mobile phone–based remind-
ers for taking medications have been effective for 
HIV patients in Malawi and for providing maternal 
health information in the Democratic Republic of 
Congo. Phones can support the monitoring of teach-
ers or other government workers where absenteeism 
is a problem, even if monitoring alone is insuffi cient 
to improve service quality or outcomes (box O.12). 
Monitoring also becomes important in provision 
by nonstate entities in weak institutional contexts, 
where for-profi t or non-profi t organizations deliver 
services often funded by the government. And digital 
technologies can improve electoral accountability. In 
Afghanistan, Kenya, and Mozambique, election mon-
itoring using cellphones helped uncover fraud and 
reduced election violence. This can complement—
or, even in low-capacity settings, replace—more 
demanding approaches such as biometric identifi ca-
tion (see spotlight 4 in the full Report).

Strengthen e-government delivery and 
citizen engagement
Where investments to automate government service 
delivery have advanced, complementary improvements 
in regulations, interdepartmental cooperation, and 
streamlining become more important. Rather than just 
replicating cumbersome processes such as business 
regulations online, automation provides an opportu-
nity for simplifying steps, increasing the impact as well 
as the transparency. E-procurement systems reduce the 
risk of corruption, but countries have invested less in 
them than in more complex budget or treasury systems. 
With greater internet use in a country, the scope for 

work among classrooms connected online, apps that 
stimulate creativity and problem solving, and games 
designed for education (“gamifi cation”).

Develop advanced technological skills and 
encourage lifelong learning
As more and more parts of the economy rely heav-
ily on the internet, demand for advanced ICT skills 
will also grow. Only a small share of the workforce 
will be involved in developing software or systems 
design, but exposing children to coding and basic 
ICT concepts can infl uence career choices for some 
and impart a basic understanding to many. NairoBits, 
a youth organization in Kenya, exposes underpriv-
ileged young people from informal settlements to 
web design and other ICT skills, while AkiraChix 
reaches out to “geek girls.” Women tend to be under-
represented in ICT fi elds, and encouraging girls to 
enter such professions and ICT companies to create 
welcoming environments for women will increase 
the available workforce in fi elds with rising demand 
for labor. With technology likely continuing to get 
more advanced and affecting ever more occupa-
tions, workers need to continuously reevaluate and 
upgrade their skills. Much of that will happen outside 
the formal education system, but governments can 
provide the incentives for fi rms and workers to create 
the mechanisms for lifelong learning.

Institutions that are accountable to 
citizens
Although the internet has enabled many governments 
to provide some basic services more effi ciently, tech-
nology so far has not strengthened accountability. For 
policies, this implies a dual strategy: tailoring the appli-
cation of digital technologies to environments with 
limited accountability in the short term, and strength-
ening institutions in the longer term (table O.3).

35OVERVIEW

collection of identifi able information creates privacy 
and security concerns. Automation changes work in 
ways that challenge existing social protections and 
reveal the inadequacy of existing labor laws. And scale 
economies create antitrust concerns. Digital safe-
guards that mitigate these risks become increasingly 
important as the digital transformation proceeds. 

Developing privacy policies
The fl ood of data collected on the internet brings many 
benefi ts to consumers and citizens but also raises the 
risk of abuse through cybercrime, discrimination, 
or manipulation. As of 2014, some 107 countries had 
privacy laws, but only 51 of them were developing 
countries. The basic principles of privacy law are well 
established. They should give users more control 
(and perhaps co-ownership) over their data and make 

digital engagement with citizens also increases. As long 
as access is not universal, there is a risk of leaving those 
unconnected behind. But citizen feedback systems 
have reduced problems such as petty corruption or poor 
services in the Dominican Republic, Nigeria, and Paki-
stan. As one Kenyan water utility manager said, “By 
introducing an automated complaint management 
system we took a noose and put it around our own 
necks. We are now accountable!” 

Deepen collaboration and participatory 
policy making
Even in countries with advanced e-government 
systems, their use remains surprisingly low. Many 
citizens prefer traditional ways of interacting with 
the government such as phones or mail, so parallel 
systems remain in place and savings go unrealized. 
Providing incentives such as faster tax refunds for 
e-fi ling or greater convenience through simplifi ed 
and closely integrated services across agencies 
increases their use. Estonia’s X-Road framework inte-
grates services from all parts of government as well as 
private or civil society groups according to protocols 
that govern data exchange and security standards.34 
Practically any transaction—from paying the parking 
meter to voting in national elections—can be done 
from a smartphone. Tangible benefi ts for citizens 
will lead to universal use of e-government services, 
making such platforms also suitable for broad-based 
participatory policy making.

Digital safeguards
Strengthening analog complements will ensure a 
high social and economic return from digital invest-
ments. But a downside risk remains. Returning to 
the Report’s framework (fi gure O.24), large-scale 

Box O.12 Can continuous monitoring and small sanctions improve 
provider performance?

Traditional monitoring systems are expensive and complex. 
New technologies lower these costs, allowing rewards or 
punishment to be more immediate and frequent. The idea 
comes from criminal justice innovations. Usually lawbreak-
ers face a low probability of being caught, but a large pun-
ishment. When people face a high probability, but fi nes are 

lower, violations become rarer. The idea could be extended 
to public service monitoring. In Niger, a well-designed 
monitoring system enabled by mobile phones motivated 
teachers because they felt their far-away superiors cared 
about their work and looked out for them.

36 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

Governing the internet
The internet emerged from U.S. government research 
in the 1970s, but as it grew into a global network 
of networks, its governance structure has evolved. 
Today, the internet is managed by an international 
coalition of governments, industry, technical experts, 
and civil society—in what is referred to as the multi-
stakeholder model. U.S. users are now a small minor-
ity of total internet users, given the dramatic growth 
in the number of users in developing countries, espe-
cially in Asia. Many countries are demanding more 
meaningful representation in the discussions of how 
the internet should be governed. In addition, the lack 
of trust among nations following the Edward Snow-
den episode, the surveillance by state agencies, and 
the increasing confl icts between national policy and 
regulations and global norms have raised questions 
about internet governance. 

Several countries have advocated for a mul-
tilateral model of governance, which would give 
national governments greater power in overseeing 
the internet, much the same way the United Nations, 
the International Telecommunication Union, or the 
World Bank are currently governed. The promoters 
of “multistakeholderism” argue that state control of 
the internet would not leave space for the range of 
players currently involved in internet governance 
and could pave the path for greater suppression of 
privacy and restrictions on access to information 
and on rights of free expression. The inability of the 
stakeholders of the internet to reach a consensus on 
future governance mechanisms can be costly; some 
have even suggested that the internet is at risk of 
splitting up into several local or regional internets. 
The broad-based, participatory approach involving 
all stakeholders is seen by many to be best suited to 
ensure an effi cient and unrestricted global fl ow of 
information essential for economic development. 

Creating a global digital market
The internet is encouraging more cross-border 
exchanges of goods and services, allowing consum-
ers and fi rms to bypass national borders. But cross-
border issues—such as barriers to data fl ows and unco-
ordinated intellectual property rights regimes—are 
impairing the growth of internet fi rms and robbing 
consumers of gains from increased digital trade. This 
has also meant that many startups from smaller coun-
tries with relatively modest domestic markets, partic-
ularly in Europe (box O.13), are moving their business 
to the United States as soon as they achieve a certain 
scale. The small scale imposed by cross-border barriers 
may also partly explain why e-commerce fi rms are 

opting out at the point of collection easier. Even when 
such laws exist, preventing abuse is diffi cult, espe-
cially where legal and enforcement capacity is weak.

Adapting social protection systems to 
changing labor markets
Better skills will help many workers cope with the 
effects of internet-enabled automation. But changes 
in the labor market also require rethinking social 
protection and tax systems. The on-demand economy 
leads to more informal employment, transferring 
insurance and occupational obligations to freelance 
workers. Strict labor regulations, common in devel-
oping countries, and overreliance on labor taxation 
encourage faster automation by making hiring more 
expensive. It would be better to strengthen work-
ers’ protection independently from work contracts 
by delinking social insurance from employment, 
offering independent social assistance, and helping 
workers retrain and fi nd new employment quickly. 
In many countries this requires major reforms. And 
countries just starting to develop social protection 
systems and deepening labor laws should design 
them for the 21st-century workplace, rather than copy 
what industrialized countries created for a very dif-
ferent world of work.

Building antitrust enforcement capacity
Regulatory reform that improves the business envi-
ronment is the fi rst priority. But even in countries 
with comprehensive competition policies, including 
easy market entry and exit, there will be cases in 
which mergers, collusion, or discriminatory pricing 
harm consumers by creating overly dominant enter-
prises or by keeping innovative competitors out. 
Because the internet is still quite new and its impact 
on markets constantly evolving, developing the 
capacity to investigate and prosecute complex vio-
lations to competition law will take time. Cases pur-
sued in high-income countries can provide guidance.

Global cooperation to solve 
global problems
The internet is truly an international network. It can 
be better managed with coordination across nations 
and serve as a powerful platform to facilitate global 
cooperation. Three priority areas are governing 
the internet, creating a global digital market, and 
providing global public goods—including those 
that promote poverty reduction and environmental 
sustainability. 



37OVERVIEW

problems—climate change, ozone depletion, air pol-
lution, epidemics—are features of globally intercon-
nected environmental, economic, and social systems 
and require global cooperation. What’s the role of 
development agencies, nongovernmental organiza-
tions (NGOs), and international organizations in a 
world where their fi nancial heft is small? The data 
and technology revolutions arrive in time to bridge 
the gap between their resources and ambition by 
amplifying the impacts of action and including more 
people in the formulation and execution of plans. But 
for this to work, development actors must tackle pol-
icy constraints, internal and external. 

Start with the how of development operations. 
With new technologies, development agencies can 
be more inclusive by tapping on benefi ciary wisdom 
in designing interventions. They can raise effi ciency 
by using rapid feedback to refi ne and improve their 
actions through trial and error. But these approaches 
won’t come easily in organizations that emphasize 
spending and outputs over results, have burdensome 
structures for accountability, and see any failures as 
damning rather than informative. If traditional agen-
cies can’t adapt, some of their business may be taken 
up by disruptive newcomers.

Next, the what. Development agencies can support 
information services that help individuals and sys-
tems managers make better decisions in ways that 
promote poverty reduction. These services have fi xed 

often losing money in Africa while being profi table in 
China and India. 

Some countries are considering regulations that 
make it legally binding for data of or about their 
citizens to reside within their national borders, also 
referred to as data localization or data nationalism. 
While such barriers may stem from legitimate 
concerns about privacy and security for their citi-
zens’ information, they can be costly. A study of six 
developing countries and the EU-28 found that such 
regulations can reduce GDP by up to 1.7 percent, 
investments up to 4.2 percent, and exports by 1.7 
percent.35 Restrictions on data fl ows face the risk of 
becoming a new tool for protectionism—disguised to 
impede trade and economic activity or to encourage 
domestic data-driven sectors. At the same time, coun-
tries should make it easier for fi rms to protect their 
intellectual property (IP) rights—but within limits 
that do not give excessive protections to large, well-
connected fi rms at the cost of stifl ing innovation and 
creativity. The process to apply for IP licenses should 
be harmonized, streamlined, and globalized—so 
fi rms need only to register their patent or trademark 
in any signatory country to protect it across member 
countries.

Providing global public goods
Sustainable development and poverty reduction are 
a focus of global partnerships. Many environmental 

Box O.13 European Union: A fragmented market for digital trade 

Despite being a single market with free fl ows of goods, 
services, and people for many decades, the European Union 
(EU) still functions like a fragmented market for digital trade. 
Consumers in the EU prefer to shop from online stores within 
their national borders. While 44 percent of consumers made 
an online purchase from a domestic business in 2014, only 15 
percent did so from a business in another EU country. Firms 
also face many diffi  culties selling their goods and services 
online into other EU markets. For example, Copenhagen, 
Denmark, and Malmo, Sweden, are separated only by an 
8-kilometer bridge, but a package sent from Copenhagen 
to Malmo costs €27, whereas the same package sent from 
Malmo to Copenhagen costs €42. Firms facing large costs 
to adapt to various national laws believe that the costs out-
weigh the benefi ts of selling online. 

In May 2015, the European Commission (EC) announced 
plans to create a Digital Single Market, in three main policy 
areas. First, the EC wants to increase the access for con-
sumers and fi rms to these digital goods and services by 
facilitating e-commerce, improving parcel delivery, and 
dealing with geoblocking, where access to online services 
or content is restricted to specifi c countries. Second, it will 
examine the regulatory environment for telecoms, media, 
online platforms, and data protection. Third, it will encour-
age more ICT investment and innovation through better 
standards and interoperability, and more use of “big data” 
and cloud computing. If EU reforms to create a common 
digital market are successful, they could become a model 
for other world regions.

some of this. Diffi culties in measuring technolo-
gy’s role are another partial explanation for the gap 
between individual cases of substantial benefi ts 
and modest macro effects. Technology impact is 
diffused throughout the economy, the world of 
work, and many aspects of personal life. And many 
benefi ts come in the form of higher quality or 
convenience—nonmonetary benefi ts not refl ected 
in GDP numbers. 

 3. Even if rapid progress in artifi cial intelligence could 
solve some of these problems, it could take decades 
(see spotlight 6 in the full Report). In the meantime, 
it would be unwise for policy makers to simply wait 
and watch.

 7. While the internet reduces the cost of information, 

it does not necessarily reduce the effort it takes 
humans to process that information. In fact, infor-
mation overload, in combination with behavioral 
biases, can promote herd behavior, amplify facts, or 
even be abused for marketing or manipulation.

 8. Overcoming information problems also improves 
market effi ciency and could even lead to greater 
innovation. For expositional simplicity, the Report’s 
framework is simplifi ed and focuses on the most 
important development outcome associated with 
each mechanism that is enabled by the internet.

 9. Moreover, cross-country regressions measuring the 
impact of digital technologies on growth could suf-
fer from several other problems involving measure-
ment issues, endogeneity of variables, and small 
sample size bias.

set-up costs in software and data assembly, but can 
have near zero costs for distributing information. So 
the private sector will tend either to shy away from 
providing these services, or will price them at a level 
that shuts out poor people who could benefi t. One 
area where the need for international cooperation 
and support is particularly acute is the collection and 
distribution of data on weather, climate, and trans-
boundary water fl ows, which are critically important 
to tackle climate change, improve natural resource 
management, and support agriculture. 

External agents and international organizations 
can help with targeted funding—for instance, fi lling 
the gap in African weather stations. They can support 
the complementary investments for information plat-
forms. And they can fi nd ways to encourage public and 
private sectors, in both the developed and developing 
world, to open and share data for public goods. 

Reaping digital dividends 
for everyone
Digital technologies are transforming the worlds of 
business, work, and service delivery. These advances 
are making the leading parts of the economy and 
society more productive—even as many still wait for 
the most basic benefi ts of the digital revolution. This 
Report argues that to ensure that everyone will reap 
the dividends of the internet, focusing on access to 
technology is essential but far from suffi cient. Why? 
Because technology needs to be complemented by 
improvements in areas that determine whether fi rms, 
people, and governments can make effective use of 
new digital tools. The analog foundation cannot be 
strengthened overnight. It requires overcoming some 
of the most protracted development challenges: how 
to create an environment for fi rms to thrive, how 
to build effective education and training systems, 
and how to make service providers more responsive 
to citizens. The stakes are high, because the digital 
revolution leaves behind countries that do not make 
the necessary reforms. For those that do, technology 
investments will produce ample digital dividends, 
and these dividends will be widely shared among all 
stakeholders.

42 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

To understand how the internet and related digital 
technologies affect development, it is important to 
understand what they actually do. It turns out that 
old economics explains the new economy quite well. 
In 1937, Ronald Coase—who would receive the Nobel 
Prize in Economics in 1991—published “The Nature of 
the Firm,” which asked why fi rms exist.1 Even though 
economics considers the market the most effi cient 
way to organize economic activity, large companies 
tend to operate in a self-contained command-and-
control environment. What Coase realized was that 
using the price mechanism incurred a number of 
additional costs, such as the effort of fi nding buyers 
or suppliers, and negotiating contracts and enforcing 
them. As long as the cost of making an exchange of an 
intermediate good or service in the market is larger 
than the profi t from that exchange, it is rational for a 
fi rm to produce it in-house.

Most of these Coasian transaction costs stem from 
the costs of acquiring and sharing information. Many 
years later, the internet and other digital technologies 
have vastly reduced many of these costs, with major 
implications for market and nonmarket exchanges 
among businesses, people, and governments. This 
spotlight describes how the decline of these transac-
tion costs affects economic development.  But fi rst, a 
working defi nition of the technologies covered in this 
Report.

While the World Development Report 2016 is not 
about specifi c technologies, it generally covers the 
impacts of digital technologies and services that 
greatly facilitate the creation, storage, analysis, and 
sharing of data and information. The Report uses the 
terms “digital technologies,”  “internet,” and sometimes 
“information and communication technologies (ICTs)” 
somewhat interchangeably. “Internet” emphasizes the 

central importance of connectivity. Faster computers 
and cheaper storage are useful in their own right. But 
the reason that all of these technologies have had such 
a massive impact on almost all aspects of life is that 
these devices are linked so that information can be 
distributed and accessed effortlessly from anywhere.

The internet promotes 
inclusion, effi  ciency, and 
innovation
Technology development has vastly reduced the cost 
and increased the speed of all the digital technologies 
that drive the internet—in some cases by more than 
30 percent per year. This continues a long-term and 
accelerating decline in the cost of computing. William 
Nordhaus, in 2007, estimated that since the era of 
manual computing in the mid-19th century, the cost 
of a computation has dropped by a factor of between 
1.7 trillion and 73 trillion.2 The result has been a far 
lower cost of acquiring and using information, which 
in turn has lowered transaction costs—and often as a 
consequence, production costs.

By lowering the cost of these transactions, the 
internet affects economic development in three 
major, interrelated ways. One is that the internet 
can help overcome information problems. In some 
instances, a mutually benefi cial transaction might 
not take place because the two parties simply had no 
way to fi nd each other or acquire enough information 
to confi dently proceed with the transaction; in such 
cases, the transaction costs are essentially infi nitely 
high. The emergence of e-commerce platforms has 
made it much easier for small producers to fi nd 
customers, and even for individuals who cannot use

traditional marketing tools like advertising or trade 
shows. Rural artisans in Morocco, some of whom 
are illiterate, have set up Anou, a web shop for their 
products that has attracted customers from all over 
the world.3 The internet, by vastly lowering search 
and information costs, creates these markets. This 
has many benefi ts, but the most important, arguably, 
is that it fosters inclusion—in new and existing mar-
kets, in social interaction, or in government service 
delivery systems. Inclusion for the individual usually 
means expansion of a market by those on the other 
side of the transaction, such as a fi rm or a govern-
ment that now serves more citizens.

Even when search costs are low, transactions often 
do not take place when one party to a transaction 
has much more information than the other. Take the 
example of extending credit to poor farmers. The high 
cost of gathering information about poor borrowers 
is a major deterrent to lending by banks.4 The poor 
therefore need to rely on informal moneylenders who 
charge exorbitant interest rates. But many of the poor 
possess mobile phones. Companies such as Cignifi  
have developed methods to judge the creditworthi-
ness of a potential borrower based on their mobile 
phone records. In Ghana, Cignifi  worked with the 
World Savings and Retail Banking Institute to cor-
relate savings behavior with mobile phone records.5 
The goal is to promote fi nancial inclusion among 
the unbanked, by assessing the savings potential 
and creditworthiness of low-income households that 
own mobile phones but have no access to fi nancial 
products.

There is a large literature on information problems 
and asymmetries by economists such as George Aker-
lof, Michael Spence, and Joseph Stiglitz, who jointly 
received the Nobel Prize in 2001. Akerlof was moti-
vated to write his most famous paper, “The Market 
for Lemons,” published in 1970, by the fact that when 
buying a used car, the seller usually has much more 
information about the car’s quality than the buyer.6 
Today, internet sites such as Carfax in the United 
States let buyers research the history of a car online, 
including whether it has been in an accident, how 
many owners it has had, and whether it has complete 
service records.

The second mechanism is closest to the original 
Coasian concepts of transaction and coordination 
costs. Most transactions were already taking place 
before the digital revolution, but the internet has made 
them faster, cheaper, or more convenient. In other 
words, lower transaction costs raise the productivity 
of existing factors of production. The internet has 
brought numerous effi  ciency improvements to busi-
nesses that, while individually often not spectacular, 

add up to enormous aggregate benefi ts. Better com-
munication and information processing improves 
supply chain management and enterprise resource 
planning. Retailers now share point-of-sale data with 
vendors globally in real time, essentially shifting 
inventory management to their suppliers. Tracking, 
navigation, and scheduling software improve capac-
ity utilization for logistics and transport companies. 
The delivery company UPS famously saves about 
1 million gallons of gas each year by using routing 
technology that minimizes left turns, where vehi-
cles are often held up by oncoming traffi c. Estonia’s 
X-Road is an e-government system that offers nearly 
3,000 services from 900 government and private 
sector agencies to the citizens online. The number of 
queries made through X-Road increased from half a 
million in 2003 to 340 million by 2014. As a result, each 
citizen saves about fi ve working days per year, adding 
up to 7 million workdays overall.

For many internet-based businesses or services, 
fi xed up-front costs can be high, but once the online 
platform is in place, each additional customer, user, or 
transaction incurs very little extra cost. The marginal 
transaction cost essentially drops to zero because 
what previously involved routine human labor can 
now be fully automated. This has led to enormous 
innovation—the third mechanism—that is typically 
associated with the “new economy.” These dynamics 
have important implications related to the nature 
of the scale economies that make this innovation 
possible, the new business models (and competition 
problems) this has spawned, and the unprecedented 
scope for customization of services.

The cost structure of many internet businesses 
gives rise to various types of scale economies.7 
Supply-side scale economies, where costs drop with 
an increasing number of transactions, favor the 
emergence of natural monopolies. Water or electric 
utilities operate in similar environments. Because 
entry costs are also high, such sectors tend to be 
regulated. Many internet-based markets—such as 
web searches, mobile payments, or online book-
stores—are also dominated by a few fi rms. At least 
initially, entry costs are low and such websites can 
scale up extremely quickly, even with relatively 
few resources. Facebook reached half a billion users 
with just 500 engineers.8 Walmart had to build 276 
stores before reaching US$1 billion in sales; Amazon 
needed just six warehouses to reach US$3 billion in 
2003.9 For many of these fi rms, the product they sell 
is also purely digital, such as digital music (Spotify in 
Sweden), e-books (Amazon in the United States), or 
online news and data.10 Others sell highly automated 
brokerage or matchmaking services for travel, jobs,

merchandise, or ride sharing. Many of these business 
models have been replicated by fi rms in developing 
countries. But even there, in many of these markets, a 
high degree of concentration has occurred in the last 
10 years. While in the early 2000s internet traffi c was 
distributed across thousands of companies, today just 
30 companies account for over half of peak internet 
traffi c in the United States—much of this is due to the 
explosion of video content.11

Scale economies also exist on the demand side. For 
many services, the more people use it, the more valu-
able it becomes to its users and the more new users it 
attracts. Social media sites or digital payment systems 
like M-Pesa in Kenya are examples. With supply-side 
scale economies, average cost drops with scale. With 
demand-side scale economies, average revenue or 
utility rises with scale. These network externalities 
benefi t users, but can also create lock-in effects; to 
switch to a different social media platform imposes 
very little actual cost on the user, but would require 
collective action by a large number of interconnected 
users to maintain the same level of utility.12

Ultralow marginal transaction costs have powered 
new business models. Many of these are web services 
operating platform markets or two-sided markets. 
The platform owner has two different customers, 
typically the user of the service and an advertiser 
who wants to reach the user. Rather than charging 
both, it makes sense to provide the service for free 
and increase the user base (at very little cost), which 
makes the other side of the market more lucrative. A 
classic 2003 paper by Jean-Charles Rochet and Jean 
Tirole shows that two-sided markets exist in many 
industries. 13  But the economics of the internet have 
led to a particularly effective grand bargain between 
platform owners, users, and advertisers (fi gure S1.1). 
This model raises diffi cult questions about competi-
tion policy. Because platforms often do not charge for 
a service, they do not actually exert monopoly power 
over users. But they could do so over vendors buying 
advertising space. Just four companies—Google, 
Facebook, Baidu, and Alibaba—now account for half 
of all digital advertising revenue. And, dominant plat-
forms could exert monopsony power (because there 
is a single or are just a few buyers). For instance, book 
publishers depend on Amazon for a crucial share of 
their total sales.

Because most processes can be automated, there 
is tremendous scope for customization of services. 
Most online behavior is automatically monitored—
sometimes anonymously, sometimes not. The mas-
sive data volumes collected by internet platforms 
have created a whole new branch of economics—
nano-economics—which studies individual, computer-

mediated transactions.14 The main benefi t to the user 
is that services can be tailored to individual needs and 
preferences—although at the cost of giving up privacy. 
For the seller, it allows more targeted advertising and 
even price discrimination, when automated systems 
can analyze user behavior to determine willingness to 
pay and offer different prices to different users.

There is ample evidence that e-commerce sites 
vary prices based on users’ estimated location, brows-
ing history, and even the type of device they use for 
access.15 Information can fl ow both ways, since many 
commercial websites provide feedback mechanisms 
that help the provider improve the product, but also 
allow the customer to assess the quality of a product 
or service. Businesses use such tools extensively, 
but the public sector has been slow to adapt them for 
better service delivery.

Finally, in many, if not most, transactions, more 
than one of the three mechanisms may be at work. 
For example, transactions on internet platforms typ-
ically involve all three. While the platform running a 
fully automated service is the main innovation, one 
side of the transaction often involves a provider of a 
service, such as an informal driver working through 
a ride sharing platform or a freelance worker in a 
remote location. For them, it will often be a case of 
inclusion in an otherwise inaccessible market trans-
action. The customer at the other end of the transac-
tion experiences increased effi ciency. A service that 
was typically available through another channel is 
now more convenient, faster, or cheaper. Figure S1.1.1 
in box S1.1 presents a graphic representation of the 
three mechanisms.

Box S1.1 Three ways in which the internet promotes development

Figure S1.1.1 provides a simple graphic representation of 
the eff ect of falling transaction costs. Imagine all transac-
tions in an economy arranged by the transaction costs they 
impose, from most costly on the left to least costly on the 
right. The upper curve shows these costs before the intro-
duction of the internet. With the internet, many such costs 
drop, and three things can happen.  On the left, there were 
some transactions for which the cost was so high in the 
pre-internet era, that there was essentially no market—the 
transactions did not take place. Making these transactions 
possible promotes inclusion as well as market expansion.

For example, women with small children or persons 
with disabilities have sometimes been unable to engage 
in work outside the home, but can now engage in tele-
work.a Many poor or disadvantaged populations will now 
receive public services because governments can use 
digital IDs to verify their eligibility.b And skilled workers 
and small fi rms in poor countries can trade their services 
in global markets, where they can earn higher returns. 
These are all examples where the internet, by overcoming 
information problems, contributes to greater inclusion.

In the middle of the fi gure, the internet lowers the 
cost of existing transactions—that is, those occurring 
even before the advent of the internet. This raises the 
effi  ciency of a vast range of activities. Purchasing goods, 
executing bank transactions, searching for a home or 
a job, paying taxes, or renewing a driver’s license gen-
erally used to require a trip to a shop or offi  ce, but can 
now be done with a click or a tap. Similarly, the internet 
has reduced costs for businesses when connecting and 
negotiating with buyers or suppliers, fi nding workers 
through job-matching services, and monitoring contract 
fulfi llment or employee performance. Many of the same 
benefi ts extend to governments, as well. These individu-
ally unspectacular effi  ciency gains may, in the aggregate, 
represent the lion’s share of benefi ts from the internet. 

The most dramatic impact of the internet is on the 
right-hand side of the fi gure. For many internet-based 
businesses or services, fi xed up-front costs can be high, 
but once the online platform is in place, each additional 
customer, user, or transaction incurs very little extra cost. 
In many cases, the marginal transaction cost is essentially 
zero because what previously involved routine human 
labor can now be fully automated. For purely digital 
products, such as e-books, the marginal production 
cost is also close to zero. This cost structure gives rise 
to various types of scale economies, often reinforced 
by network eff ects, where the more users a system has, 
the more useful it becomes.c Most of the so-called “new 
economy” fi rms are in this space.

inclusion, effi ciency, and innovation. It promotes 
the inclusion of fi rms in the world economy by 
enabling more fi rms to trade new products to new 
destinations. For instance, fi rms selling their goods 
online through Alibaba, China’s leading e-commerce 
company, are smaller and younger and export more 
products to different destinations than fi rms selling 
offl ine. It raises effi ciency by allowing fi rms to make 
better use of their capital and labor. For instance, real-
time data help equipment manufacturers in China 
turn over their inventory stocks fi ve times faster than 
suppliers not connected to the internet. It enhances 
innovation by enabling fi rms to exploit scale effects 
through online platforms and services that compete 
with conventional business models in retail, trans-
port, lodging, and banking, to name a few. These three 
mechanisms thus boost growth by expanding trade, 
increasing capital and labor utilization, and intensify-
ing competition (fi gure 1.1).1

But the benefi ts are neither automatic nor assured. 
Despite great opportunities, fi rms’ use of digital 
technologies differs substantially across countries 
due to variations in skills and infrastructure and in 
barriers to competition and market entry. Competi-
tion from China induced fi rms in member-countries 
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) to adopt new technologies to 
escape the competition from low-cost producers, 
accounting for 15 percent of their investment from 
2000–07. Manufacturing fi rms in Mexico responded 
to higher competition from low-cost Chinese pro-
ducers in the domestic and the U.S. (export) market 
by using digital technologies more intensively and 
productively. Manufacturing fi rms in Brazil facing 
an increase in competition are more likely to invest 
in e-commerce systems. Firms in Africa facing an 
increase in competition are more likely to use the 
internet to market their products or to manage their 
inventories. Firms’ use of digital technology also 

Digital technology creates opportunities to accelerate 
growth, but these are often missed because fi rms 
in sectors where technology’s impact is greatest are 
frequently protected from innovative competitors. 
Firms that face more competition use digital technol-
ogy more intensively and effectively—it enables them 
to reduce their costs to outperform their competitors. 
But fi rms in developing countries do not necessar-
ily have the incentive to adopt new technologies to 
increase their cost effectiveness because they are 
often protected from domestic or foreign compe-
tition. And it is precisely in protected sectors such 
as retail and wholesale trade, fi nance, transport, or 
public utilities where digital technology can increase 
productivity the most. Harnessing those opportuni-
ties thus requires policies that lower the barriers to 
competition and market entry, in addition to invest-
ments in infrastructure and skills. Only then will 
fi rms use new digital technologies more intensively 
and effectively—and only then will countries avoid 
falling behind.

Firms across the world are becoming more con-
nected. For instance, the share of fi rms with at least 
fi ve employees using broadband internet in lower- 
middle-income countries rose from 39 percent to 68 
percent from 2006–09 to 2010–14. And the growth 
rates and valuations of internet fi rms across the 
world are surging. Less visibly, but more importantly, 
digital technologies have transformed traditional pro-
duction structures, facilitating new, more cost-effec-
tive processes. Indeed, the vast majority of effi ciency 
gains emerge outside the information and communi-
cation technology (ICT) sector, where fi rms use the 
internet to sell and market their products online or 
share real-time information with suppliers to mini-
mize their inventory and with customers to optimize 
their services. 

The impact of digital technology on economic 
growth is mediated through three mechanisms—

CHAPTER 1

Accelerating growth



51ACCELERATING GROWTH

More than 90 percent of fi rms in high-income 
countries, and 46 percent in low-income countries, 
used electronic mail (e-mail) to communicate with 
clients between 2010 and 2014 (fi gure 1.2, panel b). The 
differences are greater when the internet is used for 
more demanding business activities. For instance, 42 
percent of fi rms in upper-middle-income countries 
had a website, and 30 percent purchased goods or ser-
vices online. Only 14 percent of fi rms in low-income 
countries purchased goods or services online, and 
only 11 percent delivered them online.

Developing countries such as Vietnam have 
invested heavily in the rollout of (broadband) internet 
infrastructure in recent years. As a result, the share 
of manufacturing and service fi rms in Vietnam using 
the internet for business activities rose to 71 percent 
in 2007 and 86 percent in 2011. Internet access was up 
almost uniformly across all provinces (map 1.1).2

But many advanced digital technologies have not 
yet diffused widely, even in high-income countries. 
Almost all European fi rms with at least 10 employees 
use a personal computer (PC) and broadband internet. 
About 80 percent have a website, and 60 percent use 
supply chain management software that is integrated 
with the ICT systems of customers or suppliers out-
side of the fi rm (fi gure 1.3). But less than 20 percent 

varies with barriers to competition across sectors in 
the same country. Business process outsourcing in 
the Philippines has few entry barriers, and fi rms use 
digital technology intensively—the retail sector on 
the other hand faces substantial restrictions to entry 
and is dominated by incumbent fi rms, with few of 
them offering e-commerce. 

Harnessing the full growth potential of digital 
technology is thus predicated not just on investments 
in skills (chapter 2) and infrastructure (chapter 4) but 
also on reforming regulatory barriers by overcoming 
vested interests to encourage all fi rms to compete by 
investing in these new technologies (chapter 5). This 
also involves overhauling regulatory regimes in the 
digital economy, especially in sectors where online 
and offl ine fi rms increasingly compete, such as retail, 
transportation, printing and publishing, lodging, 
and fi nance. The initial entry of internet fi rms into 
these sectors promotes competition and can disrupt 
traditional monopolies. But internet fi rms can be 
prone to anticompetitive behaviors by exploiting 
scale and network effects. So the regulators need to 
level the regulatory regime to guarantee free market 
entry and prevent market shares from becoming too 
concentrated. The greater digital adoption therefore 
needs to be accompanied by unifi ed standards, full 
interoperability, and competition across platforms 
and contracts. 

The goal is to have fi rms’ use of the internet pro-
mote competition, which encourages more fi rms to 
use the internet. But that will not happen if vested 
interest groups are strong enough to capture regu-
lators and create new barriers to competition and 
technology adoption. A level playing fi eld for busi-
ness was always important—digital technologies 
have made it an imperative.

Connected businesses
The adoption of broadband internet has increased for 
fi rms in all country income groups. Almost all fi rms 
in high-income OECD countries (with at least fi ve 
employees) used a broadband internet connection 
between 2010 and 2014, with usage rising from 79 per-
cent in 2006–09 to 92 percent in 2010–14 (fi gure 1.2, 
panel a). The increase between the two periods was 
even stronger for lower-income countries. The share 
of fi rms in lower-middle-income countries using 
broadband internet rose from 39 percent in 2006–09 
to 68 percent in 2010–14. The share in low-income 
countries in 2010–14 is still fairly low (38 percent), but 
with some notable exceptions.

of European fi rms purchase or sell goods or services 
online and use any cloud computing services. Only 8 
percent use cloud computing services to acquire man-
agement software and computing power. And only 3 
percent use radio frequency identifi cation devices, 
which are wireless microchips used to connect 
machines with one another (the “internet of things”). 

 The use of digital technologies is still basic in most 
developing countries. In Vietnam, only 2.2 percent of 
all fi rms sold their goods or services online in 2011 
(up from 0.6 percent in 2007). In Turkey, 92 percent 
of all fi rms with at least 10 employees had internet 
access in 2012, but only 71 percent used it for banking; 
55 percent had a website; and 10 percent made orders 
or reservations online. In Mexico, 84 percent of fi rms 
with at least 10 employees used the internet in 2012, 
but only 26 percent of employees had internet access; 
and only 13 percent of fi rms used e-commerce for pur-
chases, and 9 percent for sales. In Brazil, 63 percent 
of all manufacturing fi rms with at least 10 employees 
bought or sold products online, but only 28 percent 
provide an online catalogue or feature online orders 
on their website; and only 6 percent allow online pay-
ments. And less than half the manufacturing fi rms 
in Brazil have an information technology (IT) depart-
ment or use software supporting management, either 
for resource planning or customer relations.3

 b. Type of internet use, 2010–14a. Share of firms using broadband internet, 2006–14

More productive fi rms are early adopters 
of the internet
More productive fi rms are more likely to adopt the 
internet and use it more intensively. The percentage 
of fi rms having a website and selling or buying goods 
or services online tends to increase with fi rm pro-
ductivity in all country income groups (fi gure 1.4).4 
Firms in the most productive quintile are most likely 
to have a website or use broadband internet.5 The cor-
relation between fi rm productivity and e-commerce 
is stronger in upper-middle-income countries. In 
lower-middle-income countries, less than 13 percent 
of the most productive fi rms sold or bought goods 
or services online. The results suggest that only the 
more productive fi rms in developing countries over-
come (unobservable) barriers to using the internet 
more effectively.

African fi rms using the internet have on average 
3.7 times higher labor productivity than nonusers 
and 35 percent higher total factor productivity (TFP) 
(fi gure 1.5). But the most productive fi rms that do 
not use the internet have TFPs comparable to high-
productivity internet users. The differences are also 
found to be larger for labor productivity than for 
TFP, implying that African fi rms using the internet 
are not only more productive but also more capital 
intensive.6

Firms that use digital technologies intensively 
also share other characteristics of high-productivity 
fi rms. They tend to be larger, fast-growing, skill-
intensive, export-intensive, and located in the cap-
ital city.7 Larger fi rms use the internet more inten-
sively across all country income groups (fi gure 1.6), 
and 65 percent of large fi rms but only 21 percent 
of small fi rms use broadband internet in low-
income countries. The differences are comparable 
for fi rms that use the internet for more demanding 
business activities: 17 percent of small fi rms deliver 
goods or services using the internet in lower-
middle-income countries, compared with 43 percent 
of large fi rms.

Census and detailed survey data from Mexico, 
Turkey, and Vietnam confi rm the positive correla-
tion between internet use and the characteristics of 
high-productivity fi rms. Firms in Turkey using the 
web for online orders or reservations are 11 percent 
more productive, 25 percent larger, and twice as 
likely to export.8 Those having a website are twice 
as productive, twice as large, and more than twice as 
likely to export as fi rms that do not have a website. 
In Mexico and Vietnam, fi rms are more productive 
if they have more computers per worker, conduct 
e-commerce, or have a higher share of workers using 
the internet.9

Note: The fi gure shows the relative distribution of productivity for fi rms that 
use the internet and fi rms that do not. Productivity is measured by sales per 
worker, estimated at the sector level. Results are similar using value added 
instead of sales. Observations on the 45-degree line indicate that fi rms in 
both groups have the same productivity. Firms not using the internet are less 
productive (above the 45-degree line) throughout the distribution of labor 
productivity. For instance, the median productivity fi rm among nonusers has 
about the same productivity as the 20th percentile fi rm of the productivity 
distribution among internet users. The surveys are representative of all fi rms 
with at least fi ve employees in six African countries: the Democratic Republic 
of Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.

55ACCELERATING GROWTH

(5.4 percent) in developing countries, consistent with 
their less intensive use of ICTs. Firms in developing 
countries have considerable room to adopt digital 
solutions that have led to growth in high-income 
countries, such as using the internet for e-commerce 
or inventory management.

The true contribution to growth can be larger 
if ICT complements other production factors, but 
also smaller if it substitutes for them. Productivity 
externalities beyond measured production factors 
are ascribed to the residual TFP growth. A necessary 
(but not suffi cient) condition to accurately measure 
productivity externalities is analysis at the fi rm level.

Assessing the growth opportunities of the internet 
warrants more detailed analysis of the mechanisms 
for it to affect growth. Against this background, it is 
instructive to draw insights from the economics of 
the internet as well as from the past industrial revo-
lutions (see box 1.2). The internet reduces transaction 
costs, allowing fi rms to enter new markets, enhance 
their effi ciency, and exploit economies of scale, lead-
ing to innovation. It does this by reducing information 
frictions, search costs, and the costs to communicate. 
The decline can be dramatic if fi rms adapt their busi-
ness models to automate data-intensive transactions, 
generating economies of scale. 

More trade, higher 
productivity, and greater 
competition

Digital technologies raise growth, 
but quantifying their aggregate impact 
is diffi  cult
The accumulation of ICT capital accounted for almost 
20 percent of global growth between 1995 and 2014, 
growth accounting approaches suggest. However, the 
results need to be regarded with some caution, as the 
approach involves some severe measurement prob-
lems (box 1.1). The impact was largest between 2005 
and 2009, when it raised aggregate annual growth by 
1.3 percentage points a year in developing countries, 
out of a total of 6.6 percent among these countries, 
or 19 percent (fi gure 1.7). And among high-income 
countries, it contributed 0.4 percentage points out of 
1.2 percent, or 38 percent.10 

Digital technologies accounted for a higher share 
of aggregate growth in high-income countries, point-
ing to greater digital use. The accumulation of ICT 
capital accounted on average for 27 percent of aggre-
gate growth (2.1 percent) from 1995 to 2014 in high-
income countries and 14 percent of aggregate growth

Inclusion—facilitating international trade
Online marketplaces can reduce differences in the 
information available to buyers and sellers (for exam-
ple, information asymmetries), enabling more fi rms 
in developing countries to engage in international 

The reduction in transaction costs thus increases 
inclusion (market access), effi ciency, and scale, which 
translate into economic growth primarily through 
the three channels of trade, capital utilization, and 
competition. 

Box 1.1 Tracing back growth to a single, new technology suff ers from 
severe measurement problems

My view is that pinpointing precisely which (explanatory) variables matter for growth is impossible.
—Robert Barro, 2015

The limited number of observations relative to the seem-
ingly open-ended list of other potential growth correlates 
at the country level makes it almost impossible to reject 
alternative interpretations of the same macroeconomic 
correlation. Faster-growing countries, for instance, have 
more resources and economic opportunities available to 
invest in information and communication technology (ICT) 
infrastructure; thus, the direction of causality may run from 
growth to ICT rather than the other way around. Moreover, 
there are severe endogeneity issues, since diff erences in 
the provision of ICT infrastructure across countries are likely 
to be positively correlated with (time-varying) unobserv-
able, country-specifi c GDP correlates such as government 
accountability and other institutional factors, leading to an 
upward bias in ICT-growth elasticity estimates. 

Cross-country growth regressions are not an appropri-
ate tool to draw inference on the impact of ICT on growth. 
Numerous studies fi nd a positive correlation between GDP 
growth and (lagged) values of diff erent forms of ICT capital 
stocks based on cross-country growth regressions.a It is 
tempting to take the estimated ICT-growth elasticities at 
face value to quantify the impact of digital technologies 
on growth. But this approach has serious shortcomings. 
Most important, compared to the seemingly open-ended 
list of potential growth correlates, the sample sizes in 

cross-country growth regressions are fairly small due to the 
fi nite number of countries and the typically limited low-
frequency time-series variation in the data.b

Growth accounting provides a less ambitious approach; it 
decomposes aggregate growth into the contribution of each 
production factor without getting to the issue of causality. 
But its precision also hinges on the ability to compute ICT 
capital stocks, which requires measuring depreciation rates 
and price indexes for digital technologies that appropriately 
refl ect quality changes.c The approach also assumes that 
the contribution of each factor of production to output is 
proportional to the corresponding share in total input costs. 
So, the true contribution to growth can be larger or smaller.

Firm-level studies comprise large sample sizes and 
allow comparisons of the performance among fi rms oper-
ating in similar institutional environments. ICT investment 
is a fi rm’s decision—still it is not plausible to assume that 
it is independent of performance. A positive productivity 
correlation in the data might simply capture that more 
productive fi rms use digital technology more eff ectively, 
indicating that other potentially unobservable fi rm-specifi c 
factors explain the positive correlation between digital 
technologies and fi rm productivity. In fact, many fi rm-level 
studies claiming to fi nd productivity externalities still suff er 
from measurement and reversed causality problems.d,e

a.  See Czernich and others (2009), Koutroumpis (2009), or Niebel (2014) for more recent contributions using cross-country regressions to assess the 
impact of broadband infrastructure on GDP growth. Qiang, Rossotto, and Kimura (2009); Cardona, Kretschmer, and Strobel (2013); and Minges (2015) 
provide surveys of the literature using cross-country regressions to assess the correlation between ICT capital and broadband internet on GDP growth, 
respectively.

b.  Several researchers use methodologies, such as generalized method of moments (GMM) panel estimators, to address the endogeneity issue in cross-
country growth regressions, but the results are typically not robust to small variations in the included countries, time periods, or control variables due 
to the large number of necessary country-level control variables, given the open-endedness of potential factors correlated with growth and ICT capital 
investments (Hauk and Wiczarg 2009).

c.  But the acceleration in computing power (Moore’s observation) involves a severe measurement problem, as conventional price indexes do not capture 
changes in quality of hardware or software. Jorgenson (2001) addresses this problem for hardware by constructing a constant quality index of 
computer prices using hedonic techniques. The Conference Board (2015) uses the World KLEMS data following this methodology, harmonizing the most 
recent techniques across countries.

d. See, for example, Gordon (2010, 2014) or Acemoglu and others (2014).
e.  For instance, Draca, Sadun, and Van Reenen (2007) argue that causality has not yet been convincingly demonstrated.

Box 1.2 Is this time diff erent? Predicting labor productivity growth at the 
technological frontier based on lessons from past industrial revolutions

History shows that productivity growth driven by general purpose technologies can arrive in multiple waves; 
it need not simply arrive, give what it has, and fade away forever thereafter.

—Chad Syverson, 2014 

It is easy to fi nd echoes of today’s debates about the 
internet in the history of the industrial revolution. Each 
technological breakthrough comes with its own idiosyn-
cratic variations, but much can be learned by studying the 
deliberations and experiences of the past. 

Technological revolutions often take a long time to have 
signifi cant impacts. The maximum impact of steam power 
on British productivity growth was not felt until the third 
quarter of the 19th century, nearly 100 years after James 
Watt’s patent.a The benefi ts of railroads were fairly small 
initially, but grew as railroad productivity improved and 
rail output rose as a share of economic activity.b Similarly, 
investments in electrical capital equipment did not have 
important spillovers until the 1920s.c Initially, factory owners 
simply replaced large steam engines with large electric ones. 
It took nearly 40 years after electricity was widely available 
in the United States for organizational methods to catch up 
and develop more effi  cient decentralized production lines. 

How do information and communication technologies 
(ICTs) stack up with past major general-purpose technol-
ogies? For instance, electricity led to the invention of air 
conditioning, elevators, and home appliances half a century 
later. Arguably, the internet can be regarded as a major 
follow-up invention from the computer (or microchip), 
just as the internal combustion engine led to the interstate 
highway system in the United States 60 years later. The 
internet boosts the productivity of computers and mobile 
phones in the same way that highways boosted the produc-
tivity of cars and trucks.

U.S. data show that labor productivity increased on 
average by 2.4 percent annually after the inventions of the 
internal combustion engine, electricity, and running water 
between 1891 and 1972. Then it slowed, averaging only 1.4 
percent annually between 1973 and 1996. Between 1996 
and 2004, it surged again, growing 2.5 percent annually, 
which scholars ascribe to the fast spread of the internet.d

places that operate internationally, like eBay, Ama-
zon, and Alibaba, operate websites in local languages. 
Online marketplaces also include rating systems, 
allowing the buyer and seller to assess each other’s 
performance. The ratings and individual comments, 
visible to anyone, build trust for future transactions 
and encourage more responsible behavior. Many 
online marketplaces also provide payment and 
delivery services to reduce the cost of e-commerce.

trade (box 1.3). To purchase any product, the buyer 
must fi nd a seller, make a payment before receiving 
the goods, and trust that the seller will deliver the 
correct amount and quality on time. As a result of 
these information asymmetries, only the most pro-
ductive fi rms export—typically the larger and older 
fi rms.11 Online marketplaces help solve all three 
problems. They provide an organized marketplace 
for fi rms to advertise their products and fi nd buyers 
in overseas markets.12 They thus reduce the costs of 
trade by enabling fi rms to avoid intermediaries to 
establish trade connections or participate in costly 
trade fairs to market their products. Online market-

Since 2004 aggregate productivity growth has returned to 
its pre-1996 level, averaging 1.3 percent annually.

Does the 2004–13 productivity slowdown in the United 
States refl ect a petering out of the ICT revolution? Gordon 
interprets this as a sign that the IT (or internet) revolution 
does not have the same lasting impact as previous industrial 
revolutions triggered by the internal combustion engine or 
electricity.e But the diffi  culty of tracing a country’s growth 
performance to a single new technology, given severe mea-
surement and endogeneity problems, allows alternative 
interpretations of the same recent historical trend. 

Syverson overlays U.S. labor productivity in the electrifi -
cation era and the ICT era to show that productivity growth 
in both eras has exhibited remarkably common patterns so 
far (fi gure B1.2.1).f During the electrifi cation era, labor pro-
ductivity growth over the fi rst 25 years was relatively slow, 
just as it was in the ICT era from 1970 to 1995. Then both 
eras saw decade-long accelerations in productivity growth, 
spanning 1915–24 for electrifi cation and 1995–2004 for IT. 
Analogous to the 2004–12 slowdown, labor productivity 
growth slowed again in the electrifi cation era in 1924–32. 
Then labor productivity growth in the electrifi cation era 
sped up again, averaging 2.7 percent annually in 1932–40. 
This does not necessarily suggest that labor productivity in 
the United States will pick up again in coming years.

internet use and the importer has low internet use, 
relative to two countries with low internet use.15

Enabling more fi rms to reach new markets
The internet makes it easier to reach new markets 
and thereby increases the extensive margin of trade—
more fi rms start to export and more products get 
exported. A 10-percent increase in internet use in an 
exporting country increases the number of products 
traded between two countries by 1.5 percent; this 
increase in the extensive margin can account for as 
much as 78 percent of the total effect of the internet 

More internet use in a country is positively related 
to the growth of bilateral exports of goods and ser-
vices.13, 14 The relationship tends to depend on country 
income. Higher internet use in a developing country is 
related to higher exports to high-income countries, but 
not necessarily to other developing countries. Higher 
internet use in developed countries, in turn, has no 
effect on their exports. The similarities in internet use 
between trading partners can also affect how the inter-
net affects trade. The trade between two countries is 
25 percent higher if both countries have high internet 
use and 31 percent higher if the exporter has high 

Box 1.3 Is the internet reshaping economic geography? Not yet.

Fifteen years ago, a widely read study pronounced the 
death of distance and concluded that, with better and 
cheaper communication technology, geography will no 
longer infl uence individuals and fi rms. It argued that the 
internet is making it easier and cheaper to communicate 
over long distances. Goods and services, increasingly virtual 
and weightless, can be delivered over the internet. That 
makes location irrelevant to what an individual consumes, to 
where an individual works, or to where the fi rm establishes 
its business.a

Even though the internet has reduced the economic dis-
tance between countries, geography still determines fl ows 
of goods and services. Bilateral trade between countries is 
still negatively related to the distance between them after 
controlling for the eff ects of the internet.b And online trans-
actions are still negatively related to distance: transaction 
values on online market platforms like eBay in the United 
States and MercadoLibre in Latin America decline when 
the distance between buyers and sellers increases.c Internet 
websites hosted in countries closer to the United States 
receive more visits by U.S. consumers.d More generally, the 
number of online transactions globally declines when the 
bilateral distance between buyers and sellers increases.e 
Even so, the relationship between trade fl ows and geography 
is weaker for online transactions than for offl  ine transactions.

The impact of distance on digital goods may at fi rst 
seem counterintuitive, given that they are weightless and 

delivered over the internet. But distance might be captur-
ing taste preferences that can infl uence online activities. 
The eff ects of distance are not uniform across all website 
visits. Instead, websites selling digital goods that are dif-
ferentiated and dependent on taste (music and games) 
are aff ected by distance, but more standard digital goods 
(software and fi nancial information) are not.f The eff ect of 
distance on online transactions also diff ers across product 
categories, where goods that appeal to a local market (tick-
ets and sports memorabilia) are most aff ected by distance.g 

The impact of the internet on the location decisions of 
fi rms and the geography of jobs is less clear. The internet 
facilitates the dispersion of fi rms by allowing better com-
munication between workers performing complex tasks 
and greater disintermediation of production processes. 
And it enables the dispersion of jobs, as individuals fi nd 
work regardless of their location through online labor 
exchanges (chapter 2). But it also opens locations previ-
ously considered economically unfeasible and allows fi rms 
to cluster in locations to take advantage of comparative 
advantage, further enabled by better communication tech-
nology.h Jobs are clustered in these locations because the 
fi rms want to access the dense labor market and special-
ized inputs suppliers. The equilibrium eff ect of the internet 
on the location of fi rms and jobs is diffi  cult to determine, 
but the fi nal global pattern of fi rm location could be many 
clusters connected by the internet.i

Looking forward, the rise of online marketplaces 
can accelerate the integration of developing countries 
into world markets, opening substantial opportuni-
ties for trade and future growth. In China, Alibaba 
already enables smaller and younger fi rms to sell 
more products and reach more new consumers or 
businesses in foreign countries. Online marketplaces 
also emerged in other developing regions, but so far 
only on a (much) smaller scale or for market niches. 
The Moroccan online platform Anou enables artisans 
in rural areas to directly export their products online, 
cutting out traditional middlemen.22 The Kenyan 
online platform iProcure prescreens its vendors to 
provide reliable local procurement services connect-
ing agricultural businesses and institutional buyers.23 
So, e-commerce platforms should have substantial 
growth effects if they achieve suffi cient scale in devel-
oping regions (see box 1.4).

Increasing the volumes of exported 
products
The intensive margin of trade—defi ned as the average 
trade per fi rm or product—increases with the internet 
penetration of countries. A 10-percent increase in the 
internet use of a country pair increases the average 
bilateral trade value per product by 0.6 percent. 
More specifi cally, the average export value per fi rm 
increases by 1 percent if internet use increases by 10 
percent in the exporting country; it increases by 0.5 
percent if internet use increases by 10 percent in the 
importing country.24

The rollout of broadband infrastructure boosted 
exports and labor productivity in China even in the 
era before Alibaba, from 1999 to 2007. The number of 
internet users increased across all provinces between 
1997 and 2007, though it was stronger in coastal areas 
in the earlier years and in several inland provinces in 
later years.25 The value of real exports seems to have 
followed a similar pattern.26 The increase in internet 
domains and users per capita had a positive impact 
on fi rms’ manufacturing exports in ICT-intensive 
sectors.27 It raised the number of fi rms that export, 
the fi rms’ share of export in total sales, and the real 
value of fi rms’ exports. The higher share of internet 
domains and users also increased fi rms’ real output 
and labor productivity. 

Facilitating the unbundling of tasks
Better communication technologies have facilitated 
the unbundling of tasks, the “second unbundling” 
of international trade.28 Businesses can locate dif-
ferent stages of their production in different host 

on trade (fi gure 1.8). The impact of the internet is larg-
est if both countries have high internet use.16

Online platforms allow smaller fi rms to become 
exporters. The fi rms selling on eBay in Chile, Jordan, 
Peru, and South Africa are younger and have smaller 
market shares than fi rms in the offl ine markets.17 The 
Alibaba platform has a larger fraction of small fi rms 
than the offl ine market.18 Firms exporting through 
Alibaba also sell more products per fi rm.19

Online platforms enable fi rms to reach new 
export destinations, changing trade patterns. Mar-
keting goods globally on the internet is cheaper, 
and customizing the marketing information to suit 
the local context and language is easier. So, fi rms 
trading through online platforms can reach more 
destinations than their offl ine peers. Chinese com-
panies selling on Alibaba reach an average of 3 and 
a maximum of 98 export destinations,20 up from an 
average of one and a maximum of 50 export des-
tinations for the offl ine fi rms.21 The set of export 
destinations also differs for fi rms exporting online 
or offl ine in China. And a larger share of the online 
exports reach emerging markets such as Brazil, Col-
ombia, India, Nigeria, the Russian Federation, and 
Ukraine, compared with exporting offl ine, which 
is more intensive in low-income countries or tradi-
tional high-income markets such as Germany, Japan, 
and the United States (map 1.2).

Box 1.4 Successful online platforms account for local context and 
institutions

Successful online platforms cannot necessarily be trans-
planted to a foreign country without adapting to the 
local market and local institutions. The entry of eBay into 
China illustrates this. Both eBay and Taobao, Alibaba’s 
consumer-to-consumer (C2C) platform, entered the Chinese 
market in 2003. eBay immediately established its dominant 
market share of 85 percent by acquiring the Chinese market 
leader, EachNet.a Taobao, however, quickly assumed a dom-
inant position. By 2014, it accounted for over 80 percent of 
the Chinese C2C market (eBay exited the Chinese market 
in 2006). 

Alibaba’s success can be explained (at least in part) by 
its ability to adapt to local market conditions and culture to 
remove the information asymmetries unique to the Chinese 
C2C market. The Taobao website, for instance, indicates 
whether sellers are online and allows buyers to communi-
cate instantly with the sellers through an online messaging 
system.b Alibaba further guarantees foreign buyers in-time 
delivery of their money and implemented a system to verify 
sellers on its website for business-to-business (B2B) trans-
actions. Firms can buy a gold supplier status to have a third-
party verifi cation company conduct on-site quality control.

transaction immediately.

provide these services (see chapter 2).

Effi  ciency—raising fi rms’ utilization of 
capital and labor
Digital technologies help fi rms save costs by auto-
mating data-intensive production processes and 
reorganizing their business models, increasing their 
productive use of capital and labor.34 Computers 
and software allow fi rms to routinize processes, 
increasing management effi ciency and replacing 
personnel with, for instance, human resource or 
supply chain management software. The internet 
further increases the opportunities for cost saving by 
connecting machines, suppliers, and clients, so that 
fi rms can manage their supply chains and inventory 
more effectively in real time. The extent to which dig-
ital technologies raise labor productivity depends on 
fi rms’ activities, but examples abound across coun-
tries and economic sectors. 

The vast majority of effi ciency gains emerge 
outside the ICT sector, where fi rms use the internet 
to sell and market their products online or share 
real-time information with suppliers to minimize 
their inventory and with customers to optimize their 
services. The digital economy accounts for about 
6 percent of GDP in OECD countries (box 1.5). Less 
visible but more important for growth, incumbent 
fi rms in traditional sectors invest in digital technolo-
gies to save costs by optimizing their production and 
management processes. Retail companies such as 
Walmart, for instance, have integrated (global) sup-
ply chains to minimize their inventory holdings by 
linking electronic cash registers at retail outlets and 
business-to-business ordering systems with order 
dispatch and transportation scheduling at remote 
factories. So far, the largest effi ciency gains from 
fi rms using digital technologies have been found 
in wholesale and retail trade, business services, 
insurance, fi nance, and selected manufacturing 
sectors. The following section highlights selected 
illustrations of how digital applications boost fi rms’ 
effi ciency.

Increasing management effi  ciency
Crowdsourcing information through mobile phone 
applications is helping farmers in Tanzania to pre-
vent the outbreak of diseases. In Tanzania’s Lake 
Zone, 60 groups of farmers from 10 districts belong-
ing to the Digital Early Warning Network prevent 
the outbreak of the cassava disease by crowdsourcing 

countries to achieve greater effi ciency in each stage. 
This unbundling of tasks allows fi rms to outsource 
production processes and services to developing 
countries at lower cost, which in turn increases trade 
in intermediate goods and places more importance 
on global supply chains. This trend has, for example, 
enabled the strong growth in business process out-
sourcing in Eastern Europe, India, and the Philippines. 
The foreign value added content of exports increased 
substantially along all major trade routes over the past 
20 years, particularly among Asian economies.

Digital technologies reduce the costs of offshor-
ing, especially when the host country has signifi cant 
human capital. So, production structures become 
more globalized, and more fi rms choose to offshore 
different stages of their production. Higher use 
of ICTs by fi rms allows headquarters to manage 
increasingly complex functions, enabling them to 
confi dently send these functions overseas.29 As com-
munication costs decline, exports of headquarter 
services to foreign affi liates, such as professional and 
technical services, increase.30 These functions are, 
however, complex, implying that fi rms select host 
countries based on their human capital.31

Better use of digital technology in a country 
encourages multinational fi rms to locate their sub-
sidiaries there. Many foreign subsidiaries are in 
countries with high business use of the internet, and 
the entry of a multinational into a foreign market is 
positively correlated with business use.32 And the pro-
vision of digital technology in the host country has 
a stronger effect on the entry of multinational fi rms 
when the fi rm is in an industry that uses communi-
cation technology more intensively and has fewer 
routine tasks. 

The unbundling of tasks has driven the tripling 
of service trade over the past 15 years, particularly for 
business, professional, and technical services such 
as legal, advertising, consulting, and accounting. The 
internet makes it easier for headquarters to transmit 
information, supervise their factories, and coordinate 
the supply chain across borders, encouraging fi rms 
to outsource not only manufacturing but also service 
tasks. Trade in education and professional services 
has also increased.33 Trade in education services prior 
to the internet was conducted through correspon-
dence courses, with textbooks and course materials 
mailed between instructors and students. Now web-
sites provide massive open online courses, known 
as MOOCs, with video and other materials over the 
internet. They also connect health service providers 
enabling the spatial unbundling of health services, 
such as radiology. Similarly, professional and techni-



63ACCELERATING GROWTH

Box 1.5 The growth impact is largest when fi rms in traditional sectors use 
digital technologies to modernize their business

The digital economy accounts for about 6 percent of gross 
domestic product (GDP) in OECD (Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development) countries (fi gure B1.5.1).a 
In the United States, which hosts some of the biggest tech 
companies, the value added of information and communica-
tion technology sectors in GDP is 7 percent, compared with 
13 percent in real estate, renting, and leasing; 12 percent in 
wholesale and retail trade; and 8 percent in fi nance and insur-
ance or health and social services.b The value added of infor-
mation and communication technology (ICT) sectors in GDP 
is the highest in Ireland (12 percent), thanks to large infl ows 
of foreign direct investment. In Kenya, which hosts one of the 
largest ICT sectors among African countries, the value added 
share of ICT services in GDP was 3.4 percent in 2013; that 
includes telecommunications (and thus mobile money).c

Despite the strong growth and high market valuations 
of internet fi rms off ering conventional services, their mar-
ket shares in these traditional sectors to date have been 

relatively small. Consider Amazon. In the United States, its 
home market, Amazon accounted for only 1.7 percent of the 
retail market in 2014; e-commerce accounted for about 7 
percent of the U.S. retail market in 2015. By contrast, offl  ine 
sales accounted for more than 99 percent of all sales of food 
and beverages; 84 percent of clothing and furniture; and 59 
percent of books, magazines, and music.d

Less visible but more important for growth, incumbent 
fi rms in traditional sectors invest in digital technologies to 
save costs by optimizing their production and management 
processes. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that 75 
percent of the economic impact of the internet in 12 large 
developing and developed countries originates in fi rms 
in traditional sectors—fi rms that would exist without the 
internet but that use it to increase their cost-eff ectiveness.e 
The fi ndings are consistent with studies showing that the 
bulk of U.S. productivity growth over the past 15 years orig-
inated in ICT-using, not-producing sectors.f

Note: ICT value added is the diff erence between the ICT sector’s gross output and intermediate consumption. The data are from 2011. The aggregate of 
information industries here includes ISIC rev. 4 division 26 (manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products) and section J (information and 
communication), which in turn comprises divisions 58–60 (publishing and broadcasting industries), 61 (telecommunications), and 62–63 (computer 
programming, and information service activities). ICT industries are broadly defi ned, as they include publishing and broadcasting, trade and repair 
activities, and media and content industries (Division 63.9). 

a.  The McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika and others 2011) used a diff erent approach to compute the contribution of the internet to GDP. It computes the 
total value of three main activities based on the internet: activities using the internet as support (e-commerce, online content, or advertising); internet 
service providers; and software and internet service activities such as IT consulting, hardware manufacturers (computers, smartphones, or hardware 
equipment). They fi nd that these activities account on average for 3.4 percent of GDP among the G-8 countries, Brazil, China, India, the Republic of 
Korea, and Sweden in 2009. The impact is largest among the developed countries. The shares include publishing and broadcasting activities and 
media and content industries.

b.  The classifi cation includes internet fi rms such as search engines, but not online retailers. The market share of online retailers is, however, still relatively 
small: Amazon accounted for only 1.7 percent of the retail market in the United States in 2014; see http://www.bea.gov/.

effi cient real-time communication and coordination 
with clients and gives RW access to a large pool of 
independent carrier trucks. Each truck has a global 
positioning system (GPS), so RW can track shipments 
in real time and be notifi ed once the shipment is 
delivered. The technology shortens the supply chain 
gap between shipment and delivery in the domestic 
market, allowing RW to provide superior transport 
services at more competitive rates.

Connected water metering systems help munici-
palities identify leaks or changes in water use, reduc-
ing water losses by up to 10 percent. At its research 
center in France, U.S. manufacturer Itron developed 
water metering systems with wireless devices 
allowing remote reading over large distances, so 
that municipalities can reorganize maintenance and 
respond immediately to water waste or losses in the 
distribution network. The data also improve water 
consumption analysis to optimize client service and 
tariff structures. Itron’s production of communica-
tion devices has increased fi fteenfold since 2000, 
and its production of water meters threefold. Such 
connected metering systems have great potential to 
save drinking water—more than 30 percent of the 
drinking water produced worldwide never reaches 
the customer (often due to leaks).37

Looking forward, the internet of things should 
further increase the labor productivity of fi rms, 
implying substantial opportunities for more effi -
cient business models and thus future growth (see 
spotlight 6). For instance, the German truck body and 
trailer manufacturer Schmitz Cargobull uses telemat-
ics (the integrated application of telecommunications 
and data) in its trailers for real-time sharing of data 
with drivers, freight agents, and customers on main-
tenance, loaded weights, cargo temperatures, and 
truck locations. The company adjusted its organiza-
tional structure and management practices to max-
imize effi ciency gains and escape competition from 
low-wage countries. As a result, the fi rm’s production 
pace necessary to meet customer demand fell by 90 
percent, internal failures decreased by 92 percent, and 
yearly accidents declined by 95 percent between 2000 
and 2013, as its market share for refrigerated trailers 
in Europe rose to 50 percent.38

Enabling online marketing and distribution
Firms are fi nding new and more effi cient ways to 
market and distribute their products online. Carmak-
ers represented on the internet in China can attend to 
about 10 million searches each day on Baidu, reduc-
ing their marketing and sales costs relative to non-
connected manufacturers. Volkswagen, for instance, 

information.35 Each farmer has a topped-up phone 
card and has been trained to recognize early symp-
toms of cassava mosaic disease and brown streak 
disease. The farmers use the mobile phones to send 
monthly text messages to researchers about disease 
incidence. In return, they receive advice on disease 
control, and disease experts visit the area when more 
than 10 percent of the members of a group report the 
disease. The network, part of the Great Lakes Cassava 
Initiative, supports more than 1 million farmers in 
six countries.

Digital technologies help farmers in Botswana 
meet quality and traceability requirements for beef 
exports to the European Union. The farmers use the 
Livestock Identifi cation Trace-Back System, based on 
transponders inserted into each animal, transmitting 
information automatically to databases in 46 district 
offi ces. The centrally stored data allow exporters to 
trace beef to the individual cattle and their owners, 
necessary to meet traceability requirements for 
imports into the European Union. The technology 
also helps improve veterinary services and save costs 
by optimizing feeding schedules.

Digital interventions in agriculture seem to work 
best when the information provided to farmers is 
simple, such as real-time prices or weather forecasts. 
Based on simple mobile phone applications or inter-
net kiosks, real-time data improve farmers’ access 
to prices, local weather forecasts, and more detailed 
advice on agricultural practices and input use (see 
sector focus 1).

Real-time data help equipment manufacturers 
in China turn over their inventory stocks fi ve times 
faster than suppliers not connected to the internet. 
Supply chains and logistics operations account for 
10–20 percent of Chinese equipment manufacturers’ 
costs, so companies using real-time data to optimize 
inventories and transportation routes can achieve 
substantial effi ciency gains. Anji Logistics, a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Shanghai Automotive Industry 
Corporation, connects its IT systems with dozens 
of Chinese equipment manufacturers to manage 
logistics. General Motors China has cut costs and 
improved customer satisfaction by building internet 
connectivity into cars, so that dealers can check faults 
remotely and send maintenance alerts to owners. 
With only 20–25 percent of small manufacturing 
fi rms in China estimated to have used the internet in 
2013, there clearly is more scope to improve manufac-
turing effi ciency.36

The Egyptian logistics fi rm RW uses the online 
platform En2ly to optimize supply chains, shortening 
the time to deliver goods. The platform ensures more

is selling cars online to Chinese customers through 
its own website and on the e-commerce site Tmall.39 
Other manufacturers in China have been working 
with search engines to gain deeper insights into 
customer preferences to incorporate them in product 
development.

Vietnamese fi rms using the internet for 
e-commerce had 3.6 percentage point higher pro-
ductivity growth in subsequent years. The rollout of 
broadband internet infrastructure in Vietnam (see 
map 1.1) is positively correlated with fi rm productiv-
ity growth. Using the internet increased TFP growth 
by 1.9 percentage point; fi rms also doing e-commerce 
increased TFP growth by an additional 1.7 percentage 
point (fi gure 1.9). The effect of e-commerce is larger in 
sectors that use ICT more intensively, consistent with 
a causal impact on productivity growth (see box 1.6).40

Innovation—intensifying competition and 
creating new business models
Online services and platforms eliminate search and 
communication costs, increasing price transparency 
and lowering the fi xed costs to start a business. 
Lower fi xed and marginal costs enable new startups 
to exploit scale economies from the beginning, sup-
porting their rapid growth. The transaction costs for 
each new customer is almost zero for some services,

Note: Results are based on a regression of TFP or labor productivity growth 
on the one-year lag of a dummy if the fi rm used the internet and the one-
year lag of a dummy if the fi rm also conducts e-commerce. The regressions 
control for year fi xed eff ects, province fi xed eff ects, industry fi xed eff ects, 
fi rm age, fi rm size, foreign ownership, exports status, state ownership, and 
the share of workforce with a secondary schooling degree. The internet 
or e-commerce eff ects are signifi cantly larger in ICT-intensive industries, 
measured by World KLEMS two-digit sector-level data for Japan or the 
United States; two-digit sector-level data on telecommunication expenses 
in China; or four-digit sector-level data from a Vietnamese fi rm census, 
2007–12, with more than 300,000 observations each year. ICT = information 
and communication technology; TFP = total factor productivity.

Box 1.6 Do digital technologies embed productivity externalities?

Firms’ total factor productivity (TFP) growth in high-
income countries is often positively associated with 
information and communication technology (ICT) capi-
tal accumulation.a The relation has been stronger in the 
United States relative to the European Union, particularly in 
ICT-using sectors, such as retail and wholesale trade, 
fi nance, and other business services.b The few studies for 
developing countries show that the correlations between 
fi rms’ ICT capital stock and TFP growth in Brazil and India 
are comparable to those estimated for high-income coun-
tries.c A few recent studies focus on the impact of rolling 
out broadband infrastructure on fi rm productivity growth, 
but the results are ambiguous.d 

Knowledge spillovers?
Some recent studies suggest a causal impact of fi rms’ use 
of digital technologies on their TFP growth.e Identifying a 
causal impact requires that the spatial sequencing of ICT 

infrastructure rollout must be independent from productiv-
ity growth in the diff erent locations. Such a case is arguably 
provided by the limited funding of a public program rolling 
out broadband internet access points in Norway in the early 
2000s; the expansion of broadband increased fi rms’ pro-
ductivity.f Another study shows that establishments owned 
by U.S. multinational companies in the United Kingdom use 
their ICT capital stock more productively (after takeovers) 
relative to domestic fi rms and establishments owned by 
multi nationals from other countries. This productivity dif-
ferential is highest in exactly the same sectors that were 
responsible for the U.S. productivity surge from ICT invest-
ments in the 2000s, pointing to a causal impact of ICT on 
fi rm productivity among U.S. fi rms in these sectors.g

Foreign direct investment spillovers?
Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Jordan’s ICT sector 
did not lead to growth spillovers among domestic fi rms 

(Box continues next page)

and fi nance. Innovations include mobile money, dig-
ital marketplaces, price comparator websites, online 
media, and the sharing economy. The substantial 
scale effects for some activities have also led to  digital 

enabling scale effects and increasing the profi ts from 
innovation. Such scale effects inspire new business 
models based on the internet in services ranging 
from retail trade, transport, and logistics to tourism 

interacting with the foreign tech companies. Neither 
domestic fi rms supplying goods or services to foreign 
tech companies (backward linkages) nor domestic fi rms 
consuming their services (forward linkages) grew as results 
of such linkages. The lack of measurable growth spillovers 
could be due to the relatively small number of foreign 
multinationals in the ICT sector (8 in ICT-producing sectors, 
and 160 in ICT-using sectors). And there are still relatively 
few domestic ICT companies in Jordan, such as software 
programmers, which are expected to benefi t most from 
linkages with foreign tech companies. Furthermore, foreign 
fi rms like Microsoft or Oracle might use Jordan primarily as 
a hub to support regional activities involving few linkages 
to the domestic economy. The lack of spillovers to ICT-using 
sectors in Jordan suggests that Jordanian fi rms import ICT 
services rather than depend on the presence of foreign tech 
companies in the country.h

Producing new products and processes?
Broadband internet increases innovation. A study of 
German fi rms shows that broadband (DSL) infrastructure 
rollout between 2001 and 2003 increased fi rms’ process 
and product innovation once broadband internet was avail-
able within their districts (measured by the postal code).i 
A study of six African countries fi nds that more intensive 
use of computers or the internet enabled more product and 
process innovation in 2014.j 

Production technologies diff er in whether they are more 
or less widely applicable across products or industries. That 

is, some knowledge can be more readily adapted for use 
in related production processes while other knowledge 
is  limited in its application. So, products or industries 
embodying more applicable technologies also have more 
scope for technology externalities. A recent study uses pat-
ent citation data from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Offi  ce 
to trace the bilateral direction and intensity of knowledge 
fl ows between technologies. It fi nds that digital technol-
ogies typically are more widely applicable in driving the 
discovery of new technologies.k

Increasing international technology diff usion?
The internet reduces geographic distances, which are 
the main predictor of international technology diff usion. 
Technology spillovers provide an indirect channel for digital 
technologies to boost effi  ciency and thus fi rm productivity 
growth beyond fi rms’ measured ICT capital stocks. For 
instance, the internet might facilitate the (international) 
diff usion of technologies by providing access to relevant 
information or inducing knowledge spillovers between 
users. The literature suggests that geographic distances 
are barriers to international technology diff usion.l Likewise, 
several studies fi nd that bilateral trade fl ows embed learn-
ing externalities, spurring the diff usion of technologies. 
This Report provides evidence that the internet enhances 
trade and reduces distance, suggesting that the internet 
facilitates the international diff usion of technologies, even 
though the growth contribution of this channel is diffi  cult 
to verify empirically.

boundaries between the online and offl ine econo-
mies and can help break existing regulatory barriers 
to entry in sectors that are often protected from 
competition.

Mobile money spurs competition in fi nance. Safari-
com, the leading telecom fi rm in Kenya, launched the 
mobile money service M-Pesa in 2007, allowing users 
to transfer money through a simple text-based menu 

goods trading exclusively online, as for e-books, 
online search, and streaming music and videos—
making transport, storage, and distribution obsolete.

 Intensifying competition
Price comparator websites enhance transparency in 
prices and result in lower and less dispersed prices for 
consumers. Consider term-life insurance, where aver-
age prices have fallen up to 15 percent in the United 
States after the introduction of comparator sites.41 
These websites emerged in 1996 and eliminated the 
previously high markups. The potential customer 
fi lls out a medical questionnaire online, and the sites 
report quotes from companies that offer a suitable 
policy. In almost all cases, the individual does not buy 
the product directly online but gets connected instead 
to the offl ine seller. Comparator sites essentially pro-
vide an information platform between the consumer 
and the life insurance company that formerly was 
available only to brokers. In contrast, the prices of 
whole-life insurance, which were not covered by 
these sites, were not affected—whole-life insurance 
is a more complex product including built-in saving 
components, leaving more room for asymmetric 
information across buyers and sellers; a decline in 
search costs is thus less relevant.

Online registration systems can lower the cost of 
entry for new players, increasing competitive pres-
sure for incumbents. The number of newly registered 
limited liability fi rms has increased, on average, 56 
percent after the introduction of online registration 
systems (from 2.7 per 1,000 working-age population 
in years before the reform to 4.2 in the years after).42 
But this positive average impact masks heterogeneity 
across countries (fi gure 1.10). Thirty-three countries 
introduced online registration systems for fi rms 
between 2006 and 2012. The entry density declined 
somewhat in 8 of the 33 countries. 

Two out of three fi rms experience moderate or 
severe competition from digital innovations. The 
share of fi rms reporting competitive pressure from 
traditional competitors is somewhat higher than the 
share of fi rms reporting competitive pressure from 
digital technology startups (fi gure 1.11). Firms in tradi-
tional sectors using digital technologies to modernize 
their business are thus an important source of com-
petition (see also box 1.5).43

Bringing competition to incumbent fi rms
The internet has created new types of startups that 
base their business model entirely on the web but 
offer traditional services such as retail trade, fi nance, 
transport, logistics, tourism, media, publishing, and 
advertising. These new business models dissolve the

cial sector have been restrictive, with deposit interest 
rates partially liberalized only recently. In contrast, 
internet platforms for businesses are often loosely 
regulated, allowing them to offer fi nancial services 
that bypass regulations in the fi nancial sector.45 Yu’E 
Bao, Tencent’s online bank, and WeBank, for instance, 
offer online banking services in China. They collect 
deposits from households and lend money using big 
data analytics to assess the creditworthiness of poten-
tial borrowers. Yu’E Bao had 150 million subscribers 
by the end of 2014. These internet fi rms threaten the 
profi tability of traditional banks, increasing com-
petitive pressure. Similar startups have emerged in 
other countries. ZestFinance, LendUp, and Wonga 
currently target unbanked subprime customers in 
Canada, Europe, South Africa, and the United States. 
German startup Kreditech and Hong Kong SAR, 
China, startup Lenddo use information from social 
media profi les and networks to determine the cred-
itworthiness of potential customers. Lenddo targets 
the thriving middle class in developing countries, 
which often lacks access to local fi nancial services. 
Ghanaian startup Cignifi  uses borrowers’ mobile 
phone records to judge their creditworthiness.

Online marketplaces exert competitive pressure 
on brick-and-mortar retailers to innovate. The most 
prominent are online retailers and wholesalers such 
as Amazon and eBay in the United States, Alibaba in 
China, Flipkart and Snapdeal in India, Ozon in Rus-
sia, Jumia and Konga in Nigeria, and Takealot and 
Kalahari in South Africa. In the United States, online 
sales accounted for 25 percent of all retail sales for 
computers, electronics, and appliances in 2013. The 
competition from online retailers has led many large 
traditional retailers in the United States to combine 
digital and physical consumer experiences by offer-
ing online orders and in-store pickup services to 
improve their effi ciency. And some online retailers 
such as Amazon started to open brick-and-mortar 
stores to enjoy potential (marketing) advantages of 
traditional retailers.

Ride sharing services enhance competition and 
the effi ciency of transport services. Many cities 
around the world require drivers to hold a license 
to operate a taxi; entering the market is often asso-
ciated with high fi xed costs since licenses are issued 
rarely and must be bought from current owners. 
The licensing system, together with growing urban 
populations, has led prices for taxi medallions to sky-
rocket in large cities worldwide; in New York City, the 
cost of a single-taxi medallion increased from about 
US$400,000 in 2004 to more than US$1,100,000 in the 
beginning of 2013 (fi gure 1.12, panel a). But the new 

available on the most basic mobile phone. By the end 
of 2013, 17 million Kenyans, or more than two-thirds 
of the adult population, were using the service to pay 
for taxi rides, electricity bills, or daily supermarket 
purchases. M-Pesa also created new opportunities for 
innovation. Kopo Kopo partnered with Safaricom to 
offer mobile money services to businesses. One of the 
key factors underpinning M-Pesa’s success in Kenya 
was the regulator’s decision to permit the scheme to 
proceed as an experiment without formal approval: 
similar schemes in other countries have typically been 
held up by opposition from banks and regulators. 
Firm-level data show that M-Pesa reduces the prices 
of competing services in the fi nancial sector.44

Internet startups offering fi nancing based on “big 
data” analysis to target unbanked customers increase 
the competitive pressure for traditional banking ser-
vices. For example, in China, regulations in the fi nan-

business models. Airbnb operated in more than 40 
countries in 2014, enabling owners to let their homes 
for short-term rents. This puts competitive pressure on 
the hotel and tourism industry, which has frequently 
enjoyed high rents due to local market segmentation 
or exclusive contracts in developing countries. The 
Estonian startup TransferWise and the U.S. startup 
Xoom match requests for international currency 
transfers online, saving direct and indirect trans-
action fees by clearing reciprocal currency transfer 
requests. The startups reduce regulatory rents by 
reducing the prices of international currency transfers 
by up to 90 percent. Postmates and Parcel provide 
local logistics services in U.S. urban centers and are 
starting to compete with traditional service provid-
ers such as Federal Express, but also with existing 
e-commerce platforms by matching customers 
demanding any type of locally available goods with 
a pool of couriers. And Kenyan startup Sendy pro-
vides a platform accessible by simple mobile phones 
connecting customers with motorcycle couriers to 
offer delivery services payable with mobile money.47 
Upwork (formerly Elance-oDesk) matches fi rms in 
high-income countries with freelancers offering 
professional service tasks in developing countries. 
The Ugandan internet platform eKeebo connects 

competition from ride sharing services reversed the 
trend. In San Francisco, the home city of these com-
panies, taxi use fell 65 percent (fi gure 1.12, panel b). 
After decades of steady increases, single-taxi medal-
lion prices in New York City started to slump, falling 
to about US$800,000 by the end of 2014 (the trend is 
similar in other cities).46 The new competition also 
forces taxi companies around the world to reduce 
their prices or improve their services. Taxi companies 
in various cities have begun to develop joint smart-
phone applications enabling online payment, rating, 
and vehicle tracking in real time to compete with the 
ride sharing services. The trend is not confi ned to 
high-income countries. While Uber operates in more 
than 57 countries and 300 cities, regional competitors 
have emerged, such as Lyft and Sidecar in the United 
States, Hailo and BlaBlaCar in Europe, Kuaidi-Didi 
Taxi in China, Olacabs in India, and Easy Taxi in 
Nigeria.

Digital innovations increase welfare in many ways 
that are not necessarily captured by GDP statistics. 
These welfare gains are even more diffi cult to quan-
tify, but a growing literature is shedding more light to 
these “unmeasured benefi ts” of the internet (box 1.7).

 Internet platforms also reduce the entry costs 
in other service sectors contesting conventional 

Box 1.7 Much of the benefi t from the internet is unmeasured

The internet off ers many benefi ts to individuals that are not 
captured in the gross domestic product (GDP) statistics. 
Countries compute GDP based on activities measured in 
monetary terms and exclude activities that do not generate 
monetary transactions. But many online activities generate 
substantial benefi ts for the individual, such as time saved, 
consumer convenience, expanded choice, better quality 
leisure time, and access to more knowledge. These benefi ts 
can be understood as the consumer surplus: the diff erence 
between the price individuals are willing to pay and the 
actual price for the product or service, which is often free 
on the internet.

Economists are developing new techniques and col-
lecting new data to present a more accurate estimate of 
the consumer surplus from the internet. One method is to 
analyze the price and quality outcomes of using the internet 
in a sector. A recent study compares the online and offl  ine 
prices of used books, fi nding that online prices are lower than 

the prices in brick-and-mortar bookstores. It infers that the 
buyers and sellers are better matched online.a This stylized 
fact is an example of the “Long Tail” argument, which notes 
that online stores provide a larger variety of products and 
can sell niche products to more consumers.b The same study 
also estimates that the consumer surplus is higher when con-
sumers shift to purchasing used books online.c A study of the 
music industry fi nds that variety and diversity have improved 
since 2000, mostly because independent labels and musi-
cians can operate online and release their music digitally.d 

Another way to calculate the consumer surplus from the 
internet is to directly measure individuals’ willingness to pay 
for the internet (online products and services are often free 
and funded through advertisements). A McKinsey survey 
of consumers in France, Germany, the Russian Federation, 
Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States in 2010 
found that an average household would be willing to pay 
approximately €38 a month for internet services that it

70 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

Digital technologies can 
lead fi rms and countries to 
diverge

Divergence—with benefi ts short of 
expectations
Despite the opportunities, fi rms’ use of digital tech-
nologies differs substantially across sectors and coun-
tries; the differences prevail when comparing the ICT 
intensities of the same sectors across countries with 
a similar GDP per capita. The share of fi rms that used 
the internet for banking in 2012, for example, was 
below 20 percent in several middle-income countries, 
but more than 80 percent in others (fi gure 1.13).

This divergence in the intensity of internet use 
for fi rms in the same sector is confi rmed by more 
detailed survey data from six African countries in 
2014. The share of manufacturing and service fi rms 
with at least fi ve employees using the internet ranged 
from 22 percent in Tanzania to 73 percent in Kenya. 
Of manufacturing fi rms in Kenya, 41 percent used 

individuals who want an authentic home-cooked meal 
with independent or amateur chefs, circumventing 
restaurant licensing, which can be a source of rent-
seeking in developing countries.

Cloud computing can reduce the costs of entry in 
developing countries, implying substantial oppor-
tunities for innovation and competition and thus 
future growth.48 It provides computing infrastructure 
(processing, memory, and storage of data), platform 
applications, and software services for fi rms with 
access to the internet. Firms can use these services, 
for a fee, without investing in the underlying hard-
ware or software infrastructure. Cloud computing 
has signifi cantly reduced the fi xed costs of starting a 
business in the last decade. Startups can use the latest 
computing infrastructure, video conferencing ser-
vices, or online payment systems at much lower cost. 
The reduction in entry costs has so far materialized 
mainly in high-income countries. Although local pro-
viders have emerged in developing regions, such as 
Angani in Kenya and Data Park in Oman, these have 
not yet achieved suffi cient scale.

currently receives for free.e Similarly, an examination of 
time-use data estimates that the median individual gains 
more than US$3,000 annually from the internet.f 

A study comparing the outcomes of online searches to 
offl  ine searches in a library fi nds that the average online 
search tends to be faster by 15 minutes, the results are more 
accurate and relevant, and the experience is more enjoy-
able than the offl  ine search.g Also attempting to measure 
consumer surplus, another study fi nds that users of Google 
obtain a surplus of US$500 a year, on average, or a total of 
US$150 billion for a 300-million user base.h 

The increase in time saved and in quality—and thus 
the productivity of work from using the internet—can 
indirectly increase GDP statistics. Conversely, the internet 
has also reduced productivity by providing an easy way to 

procrastinate and distract oneself with social networking 
sites and cute animal videos. The aggregate eff ects of the 
internet use of individuals are diffi  cult to determine—an 
interesting avenue for further research.

But all this is not new. The initial gains from past techno-
logical change were also undercounted in GDP. For exam-
ple, the cost savings from railroads made up about three-
fourths of the total gains in GDP in the mid-19th century; by 
the early 20th century, this had fallen to about one-fourth. 
Time saving became by far the more important benefi t as 
commute times shortened and the leisure time of working- 
class customers increased. Similarly, U.S. national accounts 
did not refl ect the output from automobiles for nearly 15 
years after the Ford Model T, the fi rst mass-produced car, 
was available.

1.16). In Austria, 60 percent of retail and wholesale 
fi rms use integrated CRM systems, but only 28 
percent do in the United Kingdom. Half of all man-
ufacturing fi rms in Germany use these systems, 

it to manage their inventories, compared with 27 
percent in Zambia and only 6 percent in Uganda 
(fi gure 1.14). Of service fi rms in Kenya, 41 percent used 
the internet to manage their inventories, compared 
with 15 percent in Zambia, 12 percent in Uganda, and 
only 8 percent in the Democratic Republic of Congo 
and Tanzania. The divergence in the shares of man-
ufacturing or service fi rms that sell goods online or 
use the internet for marketing was comparably large 
across these six countries.49

The share of retail fi rms that sell their products 
online varies substantially across Latin American 
countries with a similar GDP per capita. In Bolivia, 
52 percent of all fi rms with at least fi ve employees 
in the retail sector sold their products online in 2010 
(fi gure 1.15). Peru had a slightly higher GDP per 
capita in 2010, but only 14 percent of retail fi rms with 
at least fi ve employees sold online. Only 18 percent 
of retail fi rms in Brazil sold online in 2010, and only 
27 percent in Panama. In Mexico and Uruguay, about 
half of all retail fi rms sold online; in Argentina 62 
percent. Variations in the share of retail fi rms that do 
e-commerce are comparably large in the other devel-
oping regions.

in developing countries contributes to cross-country 
divergence in incomes.

Why are the differences so large? In most coun-
tries, the physical infrastructure barriers to internet 
use are fairly small for most fi rms in urban areas. 
Differences in the affordability of the internet across 
countries have been an important factor (see chapter 
4). But equally important are other structural barri-
ers that limit fi rms’ ability or incentives to use the 
internet more intensively. That three-fourths of all 
retail fi rms in Panama do not conduct e-commerce, 
for instance, might be related to a regulatory barrier 
protecting domestic retailers: foreign-owned fi rms 
are not allowed to operate in Panama’s retail sector, 
reducing competitive pressure among domestic 
fi rms to increase their effi ciency (see fi gure 1.15). By 
contrast, there are no restrictions to foreign entry 
into the retail sectors in Argentina, Mexico, and 
Uruguay—where retailers use e-commerce more 
extensively.

Market power—scale and network eff ects 
can lead to anticompetitive behavior
The digital economy can be highly concentrated. 
Facebook is the leading social network. Amazon sold 
40 percent of all e-books in 2014. Google is the dom-
inant search engine in most countries: it accounted 
for about 25 percent of the display-ad market, while 
Yahoo and Facebook accounted for about 10 percent 
each.51 And while the sharing economy is increasing 
the number of market players in various services, Air-
bnb and Uber are its major platforms so far. 

compared to only 32 percent in Norway, 20 percent 
in Poland, 18 percent in Estonia, and 12 percent in 
Croatia. In Finland, 25 percent of professional service 
fi rms sourced CRM software from the cloud in 2014, 
but only 5 percent did in France or Lithuania. 

These fi ndings are consistent with previous stud-
ies showing that digital technologies diffuse much 
more slowly within developing countries than pre-
vious major technologies (for example, electricity or 
the steam engine).50 This lack of internet penetration

73ACCELERATING GROWTH

New digital solutions can also raise fi xed costs and 
thus lower competition in sectors such as manufac-
turing due to high up-front costs of software, data 
storage, analytics, and security. 

Safeguarding a level playing fi eld for business can 
thus also involve overhauling the regulatory regimes 
in the digital economy, including sectors in which 
technology is dissolving the boundaries between 
online and offl ine fi rms. The initial entry of internet 
fi rms into these sectors can disrupt monopolies, but 
regulators need to level the regulatory regime and 
prevent market shares from becoming excessively 
concentrated. 

The nexus of technology and 
regulation
The potential impact of the internet on fi rm pro-
ductivity is highest for activities where the internet 
can achieve large-scale effects and where contracts 
are easier to enforce—and thus can be automated. 
Economic activities can be classifi ed by the degree of 
their amenability to the internet, based on: 

•  Contract complexity. Some goods and services 
are contract-intensive, because they embody a 
higher share of intermediate inputs that require 
relationship-specifi c investments that are more 
diffi cult to enforce by written contracts.54 The less 
complex that goods or services are, the easier it is 
to enforce contracts and use internet platforms to 

Domestic mobile money markets are often con-
trolled by one or two operators. Safaricom, creator of 
the mobile money service M-Pesa, controls more than 
two-thirds of the mobile money market in Kenya (fi g-
ure 1.17). The mobile money market in the Philippines 
is a duopoly, with the largest operator controlling 77 
percent of the market.

What matters for antitrust regulators, however, 
is not the concentration of a sector per se, but the 
entry costs for new entrants or switching costs for 
consumers.52 The concentration of various markets 
in the digital economy—often two-sided markets in 
which platforms match service providers or sellers 
with users or buyers53—is not surprising. When the 
transaction costs to serve additional customers are 
close to zero, the most innovative fi rm—say, the one 
with the best search algorithm or online platform—
will be frequented by the most customers. As long as 
the fi xed entry costs are low, the industry remains 
dynamic, in the sense that entrepreneurs program-
ming more effi cient search engines or applying 
superior business models will be able to enter and 
disrupt the existing incumbent (through creative 
destruction). AltaVista, for instance, was once the 
most popular search engine, but it lost ground in 2001 
to new market entrant Google, which provided more 
effi cient services.

Network effects or anticompetitive behavior can, 
however, create barriers for startups. For instance, the 
more people who use Facebook, the higher the value 
for users to create content on its website. Similar net-
work effects (or switching costs) might exist for other 
online services. Google has been accused of using its 
dominant position in the market for online display 
advertising to curb competition and push companies 
toward its other services. Several Google competitors, 
including Microsoft and Yelp, had argued that Google 
unfairly demoted rivals in its search engine results to 
direct users toward its services. Similarly, Amazon has 
been accused of abusing its market power by delaying 
the shipping times of products from publishers that 
did not agree with its pricing mechanism.

The room for anticompetitive behavior varies 
among digital products and services. Network effects 
and switching costs appear to be large for search 
engines, allowing them to create barriers to scale for 
new fi rms offering this service. By contrast, program-
ming ride sharing platforms can be imitated fairly 
easily, and drivers can use more than one platform at 
the same time in the absence of exclusivity contracts. 
Indeed, multiple ride sharing platforms competing 
with each other have emerged. And traditional taxi 
companies have also started to use the technology.

more effectively. Two such barriers for fi rms are the 
skills of the workforce and the ability to reorganize 
management processes to make better use of the 
effi ciency gains that digital technologies can provide. 
There is even evidence that investing in ICTs without 
business process reorganization can reduce fi rms’ 
productivity growth.57

The correlation between fi rm productivity and 
ICT capital stocks among fi rms in India and Brazil 
increases signifi cantly after fi rms have reorganized 
their production structures or hired more skilled 
labor. Firms in Vietnam with a more educated work-
force or a higher share of managers relative to total 
staff had a stronger correlation between fi rms’ use of 
the internet (such as selling products online) and TFP 
growth in subsequent years.58 

The majority of fi rms in Eastern Europe and Cen-
tral Asia that use broadband internet have not reor-
ganized their businesses, pointing to potential ineffi -
ciencies in the way it is deployed. Only one-fourth of 
fi rms using ICTs have adjusted their organizational 
structures or management practices (table 1.2).

The differences in these complementary invest-
ments help explain the heterogeneity in the use and 
impact of digital technologies. For instance, fi rms’ 
investments in computerized information (digital 
technologies) are comparable among fi rms in the 
United States and Brazil (fi gure 1.18). But U.S. fi rms 

market these products and match buyers and sellers 
(table 1.1).55 

•  Scale eff ects. The impact of the internet is larger if the 
internet can help achieve scale effects. For instance, 
longer value chains require more intensive real-
time communication or sharing of large amounts 
of data between different stages of production or 
with suppliers and clients. The internet reduces 
these transaction costs, enabling scale effects and 
increasing management effi ciency.56

Firms using digital technologies need to 
invest in skills and reorganization
As for any new technology, integrating digital solu-
tions into fi rms’ business models can be risky and lead 
to costly failures. Digital technologies have often been 
called on to help meet supply chain needs, but not all 
have brought the expected widespread benefi ts. Five 
or ten years ago, radio frequency identifi cation tags 
for tracking individual goods were considered the 
major source for effi ciency gains. U.S. retailer Walmart 
required its biggest suppliers to use the tags, but their 
use has not taken off in the extended supply chain. 

The successful use of digital technologies depends 
on fi rms’ complementary investments in skills and 
organizational restructuring. That more productive 
fi rms use digital technologies (more intensively) 
suggests that there are barriers to fi rms using them

invest substantially more in training and develop-
ment (skills) and in business process improvements 
(reorganization), explaining why the impact of dig-
ital technologies on fi rm productivity is higher for 
U.S. fi rms. Similarly, fi rms in Japan and China had 
the highest investments in digital technologies, but 
they invested less in skills than France, Germany, the 
United Kingdom, and the United States.

Complementary skills and reorganizations are 
more important for more advanced digital technol-
ogies, potentially explaining the slow diffusion of 
some of these technologies across fi rms (see fi gure 
1.4). Implementing customer relationship or supply 
chain management software and integrating it with 
ICT systems of customers and suppliers requires a 
well-trained workforce and the adoption of new orga-
nizational processes incorporating real-time informa-
tion fl ows.

Countries need to invest in skills and 
logistics to enable fi rms to use ICT more 
eff ectively
Since a shortage of skills can lower aggregate pro-
ductivity growth despite investments in broadband 
infrastructure, countries need to invest in education 
to complement investments in new digital technolo-
gies (chapter 2). They also need to invest in infrastruc-
ture such as electricity, trade logistics, and payment 
systems.

Online marketplaces for nondigital goods enable 
scale effects if trade infrastructure is adequate. After 
an online transaction has been completed, the timely 
delivery of (physical) goods requires offl ine trade 
infrastructure.59 Countries thus need ports with 
enough capacity to connect domestic fi rms to inter-
national markets and effi cient domestic logistics 
infrastructure to complete the “last mile” delivery.

Online retailers in some countries still struggle 
to deliver their parcels to domestic customers. In 38 
countries in 2012—27 of them in Africa—less than 50 
percent of the population had access to home postal 
delivery (fi gure 1.19).

Faced with such diffi culties, many e-commerce 
companies have come up with their own solutions. 
Alibaba has partnered with logistics fi rms in China to 
create a network for delivering parcels to Chinese cit-
ies within a day. Flipkart has partnered with the Dab-
bawalas, the deliverymen famous for their reliable 
delivery of hot lunches, to deliver parcels in India. 
Russian online retailer Ozon created its own logistics 
service company to increase the speed of deliveries.

many countries but not in most African and Central

Asian countries (map 1.3). Consumers and fi rms need 
a way to pay for online transactions. e-commerce 
relies on the ability of fi rms and consumers to pay 
for their products online. Credit cards are accepted 
on most online platforms, but many individuals do 
not have credit cards: less than 10 percent of the pop-
ulation in developing countries had a credit card in 
2012.60 Online payment systems providing business 
accounts, such as PayPal, MercadoPago, and PayU, 
are alternatives. For instance, MercadoPago provides 
online payment services to small businesses that do 
not have bank accounts. 

The low share of fi rms using e-commerce in 
some developing countries can also originate from 
network effects in internet use. Network effects are 
present because the value of the internet to a fi rm 
depends on the number of internet users (creating 
online content). Thus low rates of domestic internet 
use by individuals, fi rms, and government reduce 
the benefi ts of e-commerce. But the argument is only 
relevant for fi rms that target the domestic market in 
developing countries with few internet users; export-
ing fi rms targeting world markets face over 3.5 billion 
potential online customers. The rapid increase in the 
number of internet users worldwide in recent years,

77ACCELERATING GROWTH

Consistent with the Schumpeterian mechanism, 
fi rms in more contested industries use digital tech-
nologies (more effectively). The allocation and selec-
tion mechanism in more contested markets drives 
fi rms to invest in new digital technologies.65 Compe-
tition from China has induced the adoption of new 
technologies and ICTs in OECD countries, accounting 
for 15 percent of their technology investment between 
2000 and 2007 and contributing to their productivity 
growth.66 Arguably, the entry and innovations of Tao-
bao, Alibaba’s consumer-to-consumer (C2C) platform, 
were at least in part encouraged by foreign compe-
tition from eBay. Similarly, fi rms in more contested 
sectors in Vietnam, which have higher entry and exit 
rates, are more likely to invest in broadband internet. 
And younger fi rms in Mexico use e-commerce more 
intensively: the share of online sales in total sales is 
almost twice as high in young fi rms (less than fi ve 
years old) than in older fi rms.67 In France, automo-
bile dealers enhanced their investments in ICT, such 
as human resource software and other innovations, 
when facing more intense product market competi-
tion after the liberalization of the automobile distri-
bution system in the European Union in 2002.68

In high-income countries, the youngest fi rms use 
the internet more intensively, while in low-income 
countries, the oldest fi rms do (fi gure 1.20). In low-
income countries, however, startups seem to face 
barriers to more intensive internet use, which the old-
est fi rms (typically also larger) tend to overcome. In 
middle-income countries, the results are mixed.

Domestic fi rms in developing countries use the 
internet more intensively when they face pressure 
from foreign competition. The probability that 
domestic fi rms (with at least fi ve employees) facing 
foreign competition use broadband internet increases 
by 41 percent; that they sell their products online, by 
29 percent; and that they purchase inputs online, by 
36 percent (fi gure 1.21). The increase in internet use 
due to foreign competition is independent of fi rms’ 
initial productivity.

Among six African countries in 2014, for instance, 
increased competition incentivized fi rms to use the 
internet more intensively, leading to more product 
and process innovation. Firms that had experienced 
more competitive pressure, leading to a decline in 
their market shares over the past three years, invested 
in more intensive uses of the internet. For example, 
a 10-percent reduction in the market share increased 
the probability that these fi rms used the internet to 
market their products, on average, by 11 percent, and 
the probability that they used the internet to manage 
their inventory by 8 percent.69 Domestic fi rms in 

together with the lower transaction costs in online 
marketplaces should, in turn, encourage more fi rms 
(in developing countries) to use the internet to export 
to foreign markets in coming years.

Countries need policies to encourage 
competition
Domestic or foreign barriers to entry and competition 
reduce fi rms’ incentives to invest in digital technol-
ogies or complementary skills and reorganization. 
Without competitive pressure, private fi rms lack 
incentives to invest in costly or risky new technol-
ogies. The complementary factors at the fi rm level 
correspond to competition policies at the country 
level. Firms are more likely to invest in skills or orga-
nizational restructuring if they are subject to product 
market competition.61

European manufacturers are investing in machines 
that communicate with one another (internet of 
things) to escape the increasing competition from 
low-cost Asian producers. For instance, BuS Elektronik 
invested in information technology to specialize in 
custom-designed electronics components produced 
in lot sizes that are too small to spur the entry of Asian 
electronics fi rms. The Daimler Group’s Smart auto-
mobile plant uses modern information technology 
to integrate assembly and production lines among 
a network of seven large suppliers. The interlinked 
production system allows Daimler to optimize its 
value chain and to customize its products, with 10,000 
variations of its vehicle cockpits. Low-cost factories in 
emerging countries cannot easily copy this strategy, 
which requires proprietary data.62

The mechanism is illustrated in Schumpeterian 
growth models predicting that each fi rm will invest 
in technologies new to the fi rm to reduce its costs 
and escape competition—albeit only temporarily. 
But these incentives are attenuated when leading 
fi rms in the sector have cost advantages that trailing 
fi rms cannot overcome. The market leaders have little 
incentive to invest in technologies new to the fi rm 
since they do not face competitive pressures to reduce 
their costs; the laggard fi rms are too far away from the 
frontier to bridge the cost gap and instead use vintage 
production technologies, focusing on local market 
niches to survive.63 Thus fast-growing sectors with a 
high share of fi rms using new technologies exhibit 
specifi c fi rm dynamics, echoing high fi rm churning 
and neck-and-neck competition market structures, 
forcing fi rms to enhance their effi ciency by investing 
in more productive technologies. The positive links 
among competition, technology adoption, and pro-
ductivity growth are well documented.64

Kenya and Uganda used the internet more intensively 
in sectors with increasing competition from foreign 
direct investment (FDI). The (more intensive) internet 
use due to higher competition had led to more prod-
uct and process innovation among fi rms in these six 
African countries.

Manufacturing fi rms in Mexico are more likely 
to invest in digital technologies and use them more 
productively when they sell products that are directly 
competing with imports from China. Firms that 
faced this external shock of higher foreign competi-
tion between 2000 and 2008, either in the domestic 
or the U.S. (export) market, increased their number of 
computers per employee, their share of labor using 
the internet, and their share of online purchases 
in total purchases in the subsequent four years, 
2008–12 (see fi gure 1.22). As a result, the share of 
labor using the internet in 2012 was 11 percent higher 
for fi rms that faced more Chinese competition—and 
the share of online purchases was 114 percent higher. 
The more intensive use of digital technologies due 
to Chinese competition translated into productivity 
growth among fi rms in Mexico. By contrast, ICT use 
had no impact on labor productivity growth among 
Mexican fi rms that did not face import competition 
from China.70

in competition in Brazil are more likely to implement

petitive pressure.71

Consistent with these fi ndings, aggregate sector 
and country data suggest a negative correlation 
between regulatory barriers to product market com-
petition and fi rms’ investments in digital technolo-
gies. More restrictive product market regulations on 
fi rm entry in service sectors are associated with lower 
ICT use (fi gure 1.23, panel a). The negative relation 
prevails when comparing restrictions to domestic or 
foreign entry in individual service sectors with fi rms’ 
internet use in these sectors across countries. Pro-
fessional service fi rms in Europe—for architecture, 
design, consulting, legal, and accounting—are less 
likely to sell their services online in countries that 
have higher barriers to entry in these sectors. Trans-
port service fi rms are less likely to purchase cloud 
computing services, such as CRM software, over 
the internet in European countries that have higher 
regulatory barriers for foreign fi rms to enter. Domes-
tic retail fi rms are less likely to use the internet for 
online sales if they operate in countries with higher 
entry barriers for foreign retailers. The same is true 

for manufacturing fi rms: higher nontariff barriers to 
trade are associated with lower ICT use in manufac-
turing (fi gure 1.23, panel b).72

Firms’ internet use varies with barriers to competi-
tion across sectors in the same country. The Philippine 
retail sector has substantial restrictions to domestic 
and foreign entry and is dominated by a few incum-
bent fi rms, while few fi rms use ICTs. Foreign retailers 
that aim to establish a commercial presence need to 
pass prequalifi cation procedures, meet minimum cap-
ital requirements, meet limitations to foreign equity 
participation, and have the majority of the board of 
directors be Filipinos. Only about 20 percent of retail 
fi rms (with at least fi ve employees) sell online in the 
Philippines.73 By contrast, the Philippine business pro-
cess outsourcing sector is characterized by high entry 
rates and few regulatory barriers to competition. It 
is intensive in ICT-related services such as software 
development, animation, contact centers, and tran-
scription. These ICT-specifi c services experienced 
high productivity growth in recent years and provided 
about 1.2 million jobs in 2015. Similarly, Nigeria’s retail 
sector, Indonesia’s banking sector, and India’s and 
Bulgaria’s ICT sectors are more internet intensive and 
have fewer regulatory barriers to competition in oth-
erwise diffi cult business environments.

higher fees, despite having competitive rates for 
customers. So greater digital use needs to be accom-
panied by unifi ed standards, full interoperability, and 
competition across platforms and contracts.

Overall, countries that pursue procompetitive reg-
ulations in most sectors grow faster, as fi rms in these 
countries invest in digital technologies and use them 
more effectively. Given the substantial variations in 
barriers to domestic or foreign competition and entry 
across countries, the divergence in fi rms’ use of the 
digital technologies across sectors and countries is 
not surprising.

The future of markets
Uber, the world’s largest taxi company, owns 

no vehicles. Facebook, the world’s most popular 
media owner, creates no content. Alibaba, the most 
valuable retailer, has no inventory. And Airbnb, the 

world’s largest accommodation provider, owns no 
real estate. Something interesting is happening.

The internet promotes competition, which encour-
ages more fi rms to use the internet—a potential 
virtuous cycle. So, competition is not only a comple-
mentary factor but also a mechanism for the internet 
to increase growth. Internet fi rms can circumvent 

Regulation to foster competition in the digital 
economy needs to consider network effects and 
switching costs, which can lead to new entry barri-
ers in parts of the digital economy. To address these 
changes in market structures, regulations must 
prevent anticompetitive behavior and ensure that 
potential entrepreneurs have fair market access. Reg-
ulatory authorities in many countries play a similar 
role for other network industries, such as electricity 
or telecommunications. Regulators in several coun-
tries have made phone numbers portable across car-
riers—so that users can keep the same phone number 
while switching to a new provider—minimizing 
switching costs and ensuring a level playing fi eld for 
new entrants. Similar regulatory innovations might 
be required for social media, digital marketplaces, 
digital payment systems, and the sharing economy, 
where users need to be able to change internet plat-
forms with ease and at zero cost. 

But regulating the digital economy is far from 
straightforward. It requires deep understanding of 
technical characteristics of the corresponding tech-
nology. Most internet fi rms, operating in two-sided 
markets, can blur price signals in either of the two 
markets. For instance, sharing economy platforms 
typically set the rates they charge customers as well 
as suppliers (drivers or homeowners). Once the plat-
form has a large set of users, it can charge suppliers

politically connected fi rms.76 Only 28 percent of all 
fi rms innovate in politically connected industries, 
compared with 37 percent in industries without polit-
ically connected fi rms (fi gure 1.24). 

Economic activities with a high potential growth 
impact from digital technologies are often protected 
from foreign or domestic competition in developing 
countries. The potential impact of the internet on 
fi rm productivity is often highest for economic activ-
ities that typically have higher barriers to competi-
tion (table 1.3). These sectors include utilities that are 
often natural monopolies, which are more diffi cult to 
regulate. But they also include banking, insurance, 
transport, retail trade, and some professional ser-
vices, which are often protected by regulations from 
more foreign or domestic competition in developing 
countries (see fi gure 1.23).

In sum, developing countries with an institutional 
environment that safeguards competition and easy 
market entry will more likely harness the full growth 
opportunities of digital technologies and catch up 
faster with high-income countries. But countries 
will more likely remain poor if the institutional envi-
ronment allows fi rms to obtain profi ts by lobbying 
for protection rather than investing in new digital 
technologies.77

regulatory barriers to competition and entry in tra-
ditional sectors such as retail, transport, or fi nance. 
But this will not happen if vested interests are strong 
enough to capture regulators and create new barriers 
to competition and technology adoption. 

For instance, some taxi companies try to protect 
their lucrative businesses by pushing for new reg-
ulations that block ride sharing companies. Prices 
of the ride sharing companies, estimated before the 
ride takes place, can easily be compared, introducing 
greater transparency—something that taxi regulators 
attempted for years by requiring taxis to publish their 
price lists. Cities with tighter market controls like Bar-
celona, Berlin, and Paris recently saw widespread pro-
tests by the taxi industry, as opposed to Dublin, which 
deregulated its taxi market and lifted restrictions on 
the number of taxis practically overnight in 2000 
(fares remain regulated).74 In India, taxi associations 
wrote to the Reserve Bank of India complaining that 
Uber’s credit card transactions violate the country’s 
foreign exchange regulations. Uber collects the fare 
from a passenger’s credit card, transmits it abroad in 
a foreign currency, and then sends 80 percent of the 
transaction value back to the driver. The taxi associa-
tion argues that this violates Indian laws that permit 
Uber to collect the commission but not the fare in a 
foreign currency. 

In Morocco, the market power of fi rms owned by 
infl uential politically connected businessmen stifl es 
competition, ICT adoption, and innovation among 
manufacturing fi rms. Firms that are directly or indi-
rectly owned by the political rulers are larger, have 
higher market shares, and have higher profi ts.75 The 
larger scale seems to help these fi rms adopt digital 
technologies and innovate (fi gure 1.24). While polit-
ically connected fi rms individually invest more in 
ICT, their presence seems to discourage other fi rms 
from doing so. Politically connected fi rms appear 
to dominate their markets: only 30 percent of them 
report more than fi ve competitors, compared with 65 
percent of all other fi rms; only 11 percent of politically 
connected fi rms report price competition in domestic 
markets, compared with 37 percent of all other fi rms. 
There is no difference between politically connected 
and unconnected fi rms for price competition in for-
eign (export) markets. The dominance of politically 
connected fi rms and the resulting lack of competition 
seem to discourage all other fi rms in their industry 
from adopting digital technologies or innovating, 
leading to inferior aggregate technology adoption: 
only 32 percent of all fi rms in industries with at 
least one politically connected fi rm have a website, 
compared with 40 percent in industries without

 10.  The results here are somewhat higher than the ones 
in Jorgenson (2011), who fi nds that the accumulation 
of ICT capital raised aggregate growth by 13 percent 
a year on average for more than 100 countries from 
1995 to 2008. Moreover, Manyika and others (2011) 
estimate that the average contribution of the inter-
net (alone) to economic growth was 0.3 percentage 
points among seven high-income countries between 
2004 and 2009, and 0.4 percentage points for fi ve 
large developing countries (Brazil, China, India, 
the Republic of Korea, and the Russian Federation). 
These results should be regarded with caution, how-
ever, since the growth contribution of the internet is 
effectively equated with the contribution of TFP.

 11.  Melitz 2003.
 12.  The internet reduces information frictions by provid-

ing a tool for fi rms to easily fi nd information about 
new markets and advertise their products to multiple 
buyers. In addition, the internet can reinforce busi-
ness and social networks and reduce communication 
costs with potential customers (Rauch 1999; Rauch 
and Trindade 2002; Fink, Mattoo, and Neagu 2005). 

 13.  Freund and Weinhold (2004) examine the growth 
of bilateral merchandise exports of 56 countries 
and (2002) consider the growth of U.S. imports and 
exports of services. Both studies use data from 1995 
to 1999.

 14.  There are two common measurements of internet 
usage in these studies. Freund and Weinhold (2002, 
2004) and Clarke and Wallsten (2006) measure inter-
net usage by the number of web hosts, while Osnago 
and Tan (2015) use the percentage of individuals 
using the internet in a country. 

 15.  Osnago and Tan (2015) estimate a panel gravity equa-
tion using aggregate bilateral trade fl ows from 2001 
to 2012 for all countries with country-pair and year 

Notes
 1.  These channels can affect growth through more than 

one mechanism. For instance, the internet increases 
trade not only by allowing more and smaller fi rms 
to export (inclusion) but also by allowing existing 
exporters to trade more intensively, exploiting econ-
omies of scale (effi ciency).

 3.  The results are based on ICT surveys linked to census 

data of fi rms in manufacturing and service sectors. 
The data cover more than 300,000 fi rms in Vietnam 
in 2011 (Nguyen and Schiffbauer 2015); 8,000 fi rms 
with at least 10 employees in Turkey in 2011 (Atiyas 
and Bakis 2015); more than 52,000 fi rms in Mexico 
in 2009 (Iacovone, Pereira-Lopez, and Schiffbauer 
2015); and more than 3,000 manufacturing fi rms in 
Brazil (Cirera, Lage, and de Oliveria 2015).

Note: The approximate grouping of sectors for the potential impact of digital technology is determined by scalability and contract complexity of most products 
in the sector, as defi ned in table 1.1. Digital technologies have a high potential in sectors that are more scalable and less complex (upper left cell in table 1.1), 
a medium impact for sectors that are more scalable but more complex or less scalable but less complex, and a low impact for sectors that are less scalable 
and more complex (lower right cell in table 1.1).  The approximate grouping of sectors for the degree of competition is based on sectors’ tradability, their 
average barriers to foreign or domestic entry across countries (for example, the Product Market Regulation Index [OECD, various years] and the Services Trade 
Restrictions Index), and their fi xed costs (natural monopolies or land intensiveness). — = not available.

 40.  The analysis is based on an annual panel of fi rm cen-

sus data from 2007 to 2012 with more than 300,000 
observations each year. TFP is estimated following 
the methodology of Olley and Pakes (1996). Each 
regression controls for two-digit sector dummies, 
year dummies, and fi rm characteristics (fi rm size, 
age, and ownership as well as export status). See 
Nguyen and Schiffbauer (2015) for details.

 41.  Brown and Goolsbee 2002. Their availability raised 
price dispersion initially and then reduced it as inter-
net use became more widespread, which is consis-
tent with the theory of search costs by Stigler (1961) 
and Stahl (1989).

 42.  The results are based on a regression of the average 
entry density on a dummy that is one in the years 
of or after the reform, controlling for year-specifi c 
effects.

 43.  The positive link between the use of new technology 
and competition is well documented. For instance, 

fi xed effects. They determine whether a country has 
high internet usage when it has an internet usage 
above the median for all countries, which changes 
yearly.

 16.   The results are based on Osnago and Tan (2015). 
 17.  eBay 2013. 
 18.  Chen and Xu (2015) compare transaction-level data 

from AliExpress (a branch of Alibaba) and Chinese 
customs data across seven months. The online trade 
data are transaction-level data based on AliExpress 
from January to July 2014, and the offl ine trade data 
are Chinese customs data from January to July 2006.

 19.  Chen and Xu 2015. 
 20.  The average number of export destinations is rel-

atively low since the study focuses on only nine 
products that are narrowly defi ned at the 10-digit 
level (harmonized classifi cation system). Thus, the 
average fi rm is only exporting about two different 
specialized products, for instance, silk and pure cot-
ton T-shirts.

 21.  As a comparison, large fi rms selling on eBay reach an 
average of 30 export destinations (eBay 2013); large 
fi rms are defi ned as having an annual export of more 
than US$10,000 in 2012.

 22.  See http://www.theanou.com/.
 23.  Andjelkovic 2015.
 24.  Tan 2015; Osnago and Tan 2015. Tan (2015) uses the 

World Bank Exporter Dynamics Database (World 
Bank, various years) and estimates a panel regres-
sion to examine the effect of the internet usage of 
4.5 million fi rms in 47 developing countries between 
2002 and 2012. A product is defi ned as a harmonized 
system (HS) six-digit category.

 25.  This measure of physical infrastructure predicts 
fi rms’ internet use; it is strongly positively correlated 
with the number of internet users by province over 
time (correlation coeffi cient of 0.55). Therefore, the 
length of the fi ber-optic cables per population is also 
a good proxy for the number of “last mile” connec-
tions to fi rms or households in a province.

 26.  The number of exporting fi rms and fi rms’ export 
share follow a similar pattern across provinces over 
time.

 27.  Fernandes and others (2015) use changes in the 
number of internet users per capita, Chinese inter-
net domains per capita, and the length of fi ber-optic 
cables per population to measure the rollout of 
broadband infrastructure across Chinese provinces 
between 1999 and 2007. The analysis is based on cen-
sus data for manufacturing fi rms. The ICT intensity 
per industry is measured by the ICT capital services 
share in total capital services based on World KLEMS 
two-digit sector-level data for the United States, 
two-digit sector-level data on telecommunication 
expenses in China, and four-digit sector-level data 
from a Vietnamese fi rm census. All empirical speci-
fi cations include fi rm fi xed effects and year x province

 63.  See Aghion and others 2001. The theoretical frame-

work is also closely related to Parente and Prescott 
(1999). Aghion and others (2001) also discuss whether 
perfect competition can reduce the incentives for 
any innovation by reducing the discounted present 
value of associated rents, leading to an inverted 
U-shaped relation between competition and growth. 
They provide evidence, however, that the negative 
part in the competition-growth nexus is less empiri-
cally relevant (see also Aghion and others 2006, 2008,
2009).

 64.  For instance, Aghion and others (2006, 2008, 2009) 
fi nd that more product market competition and 
entry deregulation lead to higher productivity 
growth. Buccirossi and others (2013) show that 
improvements in competition policy, measuring 
restrictions to domestic and foreign entry and 
restrictions to antitrust, led to higher TFP growth 
among 22 industries in 12 OECD countries. The 
effect was strongest for antitrust activities.

 67.  The fi ndings are consistent for the other available 

measures of ICT, such as the share of fi rms that have 
a website or use e-commerce in Vietnam (Nguyen 
and Schiffbauer 2015), and the average share of a 
fi rm’s workforce using the internet or the share of 
fi rms’ e-commerce purchasing over total purchases 
in Mexico (Iacovone, Pereira-Lopez, and Schiffbauer 
2015).

 69.  Cirera, Lage, and Sabetti 2015. The results are based 

on more than 2,300 fi rms in these six African coun-
tries in 2014.

 70.  The effect is based on a regression of (log) labor 
productivity from 2008 to 2012 on the ICT variables, 
the product-level degree of import competition from 
China from 2000 to 2008 (in the Mexican or U.S. 
markets), and the interaction term between these 
two variables. Each regression controls for fi rm fi xed 
effects and changes from 2008 to 2012 in other fi rm 
characteristics (fi rm size, age, location, exports, for-
eign or state ownership, and share of skilled labor). 
See Iacovone, Pereira-Lopez, and Schiffbauer 2015. 
The results are robust when using the interaction 
term between household internet use at the province 
level and sectors’ ICT intensity based on U.S. data as 
an instrumental variable controlling for the endoge-
neity of the ICT variables.

Collard-Wexler and De Loecker (2015) show that 
two-thirds of the higher productivity in the U.S. 
steel sector after the introduction of a major new 
technology, the minimill, originated primarily from 
an increased competition effect and only one-third 
from a technology replacement effect. In particular, 
the minimill expansion drove a productivity resur-
gence at the surviving vertically integrated produc-
ers and thus for industry as a whole.

 53.  A two-sided market is one in which (1) two sets of 

agents interact through an intermediary platform 
and (2) the decisions of each set of agents affect the 
outcomes of the other set of agents, typically through 
an externality (Rysman 2009). For instance, in an 
e-commerce platform like Amazon, the two agents 
are the consumers and the online sellers whereby 
consumers benefi t from more online sellers using 
the platform and vice versa.

 54.  Nunn (2007) constructed a measure of contract 
intensity for tradable goods. Contract-intensive 
goods include packaging machinery, musical instru-
ments, and alcoholic beverages. Goods with low con-
tract intensity include wearing apparel, frozen food, 
plastics and rubber, base metals, or fertilizers.

 55.  The correlation coeffi cient between the contract-
intensity four-digit sectors in Vietnam from 2007 to 
2011 and the share of fi rms that use the internet (have 
a website) in these sectors is 0.44 (0.28); see Nguyen 
and Schiffbauer 2015. 

 56.  Bloom, Sadun, and Van Reenen (2012) argue that 
digital technologies enhance managers’ information 
set, improving their ability to monitor staff and 
allowing them to delegate decisions to subordinate 
management layers. They show that the impact of 
good management practices on fi rm productivity is 
larger in ICT-intensive sectors.

 71.  Cirera, Lage, and de Oliveria 2015. An increase in 
competition is measured by a change in fi rms’ mar-
ket share in previous years. The results are based on 
a multinomial logit regression from 2009 to 2012 
where the dependent variable indicates different 
stages of the e-commerce system; the most advanced 
e-commerce system also allows for online payments. 
The regressions control for fi rm characteristics such 
as fi rm size, age, export status, and ownership and 
sector-specifi c effects.

 72.  Countries with available data that are not members 
of the World Trade Organization (Afghanistan, 
Kazakhstan, Lebanon, and Liberia) are excluded 
because they do not face restrictions on using tar-
iff rates as an alternative mode to restrict import 
competition.

time, Ireland set up a “hardship fund” with payments

suffered by license holders due to the devaluation 
of their assets, although the general consensus was 
that the government was under no obligation to 
compensate the taxi industry.

 75.  The analysis is based on 48 politically connected and 
620 nonconnected manufacturing fi rms with at least 
fi ve employees in the World Bank Enterprise Surveys 
data in 2004 and 2007. The 48 politically connected 
fi rms operate in almost all of the 22 two-digit man-
ufacturing industries. But within these, they operate 
in fewer than half of the more than 100 four-digit 
subsectors in total. See Saadi (2015) for more details.

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

Across the developing world, agriculture sustains the 
majority of rural livelihoods. Ever since people have 
grown crops, raised livestock, and caught fi sh, they 
have sought information from one another. What is 
the most effective planting strategy on steep slopes? 
Where can we buy improved seeds? Who is paying 
the highest price at the market? Over time, weather 
patterns and soil conditions change. Epidemics of 
pests and diseases come and go. Updated information 
allows farmers to cope with and benefi t from these 
changes.

Providing such knowledge can be challenging. 
Agriculture is location-specifi c, and farmers need 
accurate local weather forecasts, advice on agricul-
tural practices and input use, and real-time informa-
tion about prices and market logistics. Harnessing 
the rapid growth of the internet and associated digital 
technologies such as mobile phones is critical to help-
ing farmers obtain the information they need and to 
promoting transformative agricultural development. 
Interest is especially keen in increasing access to 
extension services, improving marketing of outputs, 
and arranging logistics. The body of rigorous, quan-
titative evidence on the ways in which digital inno-
vations can help improve the lives of rural people is 
growing steadily.

Enhancing on-farm 
productivity 
Agricultural productivity varies dramatically around 
the world. While credit constraints, missing insurance 
markets, and poor infrastructure account for some of 

this disparity, suboptimal agricultural practices and 
poor management are also to blame. New produc-
tion technologies such as improved seed varieties, 
nutrient management, and pest control methods are 
not necessarily reaching farmers. Public extension 
agents can overcome information barriers related to 
new agricultural practices and technologies, but such 
extension programs have been burdened by limited 
scale, sustainability, and impact.

Digital technologies help overcome these con-
straints. They are reviving agricultural extension and 
advisory services around the world. In cooperation 
with agricultural research and extension services, 
organizations such as Digital Green, the Grameen 
Foundation, and TechnoServe deliver timely, rele-
vant, and actionable information and advice to farm-
ers in South Asia, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan 
Africa, respectively, at a dramatically lower cost than 
traditional services can. Rather than always visiting a 
farmer, extension agents use a combination of phone 
calls, text, videos, and internet to reduce transac-
tion costs and increase the frequency of interaction 
with farmers. Governments, in partnership with 
mobile operators, use phones to coordinate distri-
bution of seeds and subsidized fertilizers in remote 
areas through e-vouchers, as in Nigeria’s large-scale 
e-wallet initiative (spotlight 2, “Digital fi nance”). 
Technology fi rms such as Climate Corp, based 
in Silicon Valley, are pioneering the provision of 
agrometeorological services for early warning of 
weather and climate risks. A number of innovations 
aim for real-time and accurate weather monitoring 
using remote sensing and technologies enabled with 
geographic information systems (GIS) for climate-
resilient agriculture.

Facilitating market 
transparency 
Agricultural product markets in many developing 
countries are poorly integrated. High search costs 
have tended to lower competition and create an 
ineffi cient allocation of goods across markets. When 
the internet took off in the mid-1990s, it was often 
claimed that it would improve price transparency, 
cut out middlemen, and make markets more effi -
cient. Indeed, rapid adoption of digital technologies 
has dramatically reduced the search costs incurred 

by farmers and traders, and hence overcome an 
important constraint in the context of limited infra-
structure. As Robert Jensen’s classic 2007 study of 
sardine fi shermen and wholesalers in Kerala, India, 
found, the introduction of mobile phone service dra-
matically reduced price dispersion and waste in the 
sardine catch, increasing welfare for producers and 
consumers (fi gure F1.1). Similar effects have been 
shown for communication platforms such as Esoko 
in Ghana, e-Choupal in India, and telecenters in Peru, 
as well as studies on grain traders in Niger and farm-
ers in the Philippines.1

Enabling effi  cient logistics 
and improving quality 
control 
Digital technologies also improve the management 
of agricultural supply chains. With globalized food 
systems, ensuring food safety has become more com-
plex. These trends have catalyzed innovations to trace 
the food supply from producer to consumer—which 
is important for developing countries that want to 
reach new export markets. Smallholder farms can 
turn to cooperatives and aggregators, who use digital 
tools to improve collection, transportation, and qual-
ity control. By opening up new specialized market 
opportunities, the internet has improved consumer 
protection and farmers’ livelihoods.

Lessons for adapting digital 
technologies for agriculture
Why do many of these innovations fail to scale up 
and achieve wider acceptance? One reason is market 
fragmentation—even though market consolidation 
will, over time, enhance growth prospects. Another 
reason is the lack of fi nancially sustainable business 
models that will attract private sector investments 
in innovative solutions for small-scale agriculture. 
There is great potential for the internet and related 
technologies to improve rural economies, but several 
lessons need to be kept in mind.

First, agriculture is becoming increasingly 
knowledge-intensive and high-tech. Some of the 
world’s newest industries have started to put money 
and tech talent into farming—the world’s oldest 
industry. Digital soil maps, remote sensing, and global 
positioning system (GPS) guidance are critical tools 
for modern farmers. “Big data” for precision agricul-
ture increases yields and effi ciency. These high-tech 
tools mostly benefi t big farms that can make large 
investments in technology. But there are also many 
innovative ways in which illiterate and otherwise dis-
advantaged people use digital technologies, such as 
basic mobile phones. Greater efforts to close the digital 
divide in rural areas can have great payoffs.

Second, basic price and market information sys-
tems can improve effi ciency and welfare. The evi-
dence, although strong, is still limited to certain coun-
tries and certain contexts. A number of recent studies 

have cast doubt on the overall novelty of information 
provided to the farmer and the degree of competition 
in many markets. One explanation of weak effects is 
low take-up of fee-based price information services. 
But even when farmers are seemingly better informed, 
they may not necessarily be able to act on that infor-
mation because of the inaccessibility of alternative 
markets and the complex interlinked relationships 
between buyers and sellers in low-income developing 
economies. Rather than assuming that an information 
and communication technology (ICT) approach will 
always be cost-effective and yield a better outcome, 
a more nuanced understanding of the underlying institu-
tional environment and constraints is warranted. 

Third, technology-enabled interventions are no 
panacea in themselves, and need to be backed by 
complementary investments in physical infrastructure, 
including electricity and literacy. The versatility and 
near-constant innovation that characterize digital 
technologies can sometimes be a distraction that can 
cause interventions to focus more on the technology 
than on the demands and priorities of the intended 
benefi ciaries and the trade-offs imposed by resource-
constrained environments.

Finally, information technology (IT) policy and the 
broader regulatory environment in a country should be 
discussed jointly. Whereas the expansion of mobile 
phone access has been rapid and commercially self-
sustaining even among many of the poor, the same is 
not true of the internet. In the long run, the internet 
can have an even greater impact on rural growth; 
much depends on fi nding sustainable business mod-
els to encourage its spread in the poorest parts of the 
world.

Until a few years ago, agricultural productivity in 
Nigeria was declining, even though government 
spending had increased.1 Since then, agriculture has 
become a driver of economic growth. One reason has 
been an innovative mobile wallet system initiated 
jointly by the public and private sectors and run 
by Cellulant, a mobile services company. Nigeria’s 
smallholder farmers depend on subsidized fertilizer, 
but this crucial resource too often did not reach ben-
efi ciaries. The 2012 Growth Enhancement Support 
Scheme introduced mobile technology to transfer 
fertilizer subsidies directly to farmers, taking the 
government out of the business of procuring and dis-
tributing fertilizer. The support scheme now helps up 
to twice as many farmers, at one-sixth the cost. The 
transfer system relies on a database of more than 10.5 
million farmers, who, as registered recipients of the 
subsidies, now have a better chance of gaining access 
to formal or regulated fi nancial services. Based on 
this initial success, the system is expanding, aided by 
a digital identifi cation system and biometric signa-
tures, taking fi nancial services far into Nigeria’s rural 
hinterland.

This example and many similar experiences cov-
ered throughout this Report illustrate the large impact 
of the internet and related digital technologies on the 
fi nancial sector.2 Digital fi nance has promoted fi nan-
cial inclusion, providing access to fi nancial services 
to many of the 80 percent of poor adults estimated 
to be excluded from the regulated fi nancial sector.3 
It has boosted effi ciency, as the cost of fi nancial 
transactions has dropped and speed and convenience 
have increased. And it has led to major innovations 

in the fi nancial sector, many of which have emerged 
in developing countries (box S2.1). The benefi ts per-
vade almost all areas discussed in this Report. Digital 
fi nance makes businesses more productive, allows 
individuals to take advantage of opportunities in the 
digital world, and helps streamline public sector ser-
vice delivery.

Like all great opportunities, digital fi nance also 
comes with risks. What makes online fi nancial 
systems easy to use for customers also makes them 
susceptible to cybercrime. The entry of nontraditional 
players poses new challenges for policy, regulation, 
and supervision. And the ease of transferring funds 
across the globe—often anonymously, using means 
such as cryptocurrencies—might increase illicit fi nan-
cial fl ows.

Benefi ts of digital fi nance
Digital fi nance promotes fi nancial inclusion
More than 2 billion people have no access to any 
fi nancial services. Overall, only about 59 percent of 
men and 50 percent of women in developing coun-
tries have an account at a regulated fi nancial insti-
tution. Women, the poor, and small businesses often 
rely on informal fi nancial services, even when they 
receive public transfers or remittances.

Digital payment systems help overcome barriers to 
accessing fi nancial services. Mobile money schemes, 
in particular, allow people who own a phone but do 
not have a bank account to make and receive pay-
ments. In the right environment, these systems can 
take off and reach massive size rapidly (fi gure S2.1). 
Digital payments can reduce costs to recipients.4 For 
instance, farmers in Niger realized time savings for

Box S2.1 Innovations in digital payments

There are four major innovations in digital payments.

Wrappers create a digital interface with traditional 
payment systems such as credit cards or bank accounts. 
Many are off ered by nontraditional providers, including 
internet intermediaries such as Google Wallet and Apple 
Pay. 

Mobile money systems store money in the national 
currency as credit on smart cards or a system provider’s 
books, and enable payments online or through mobile 
phones. A well-known example is M-Pesa, run by 
Safaricom. These systems can off er lower fees and easier 
use than traditional payment systems, even for those 
without a bank account. 

Credits and local digital currencies are alternative units of 
account (not in national currency) designed to promote 

spending in a local economy or as a means of exchange 
in computer games.

Digital currencies are both a new decentralized payment 
scheme and a new currency. Such schemes record trans-
actions in a publicly visible ledger. Most digital curren-
cies, including Bitcoin, are cryptocurrencies because they 
use cryptographic techniques to ensure secure validation 
of transactions.

To get a sense of the magnitude of digital payment 
fl ows, consider this: In 2014, the volume of Bitcoin 
transactions worldwide was about US$23 billion; for 
mobile payments on M-Pesa in Kenya, it was about 
US$24 billion; for the online payment platform PayPal, 
it was US$228 billion; and for the credit card issuer Visa, 
it was US$4.7 trillion.

each payment equivalent to an amount that would 
feed a family of fi ve for a week. Digital payments 
increase control, since senders of remittances can 
have a greater infl uence on how recipients use the 
money, including for savings. Digital fi nance can 
increase the incentive to save, through automatic 
deposits, text reminders, or default options. Texted 
reminders increased savings in Bolivia, Peru, and the 
Philippines by up to 16 percent.5 Digital payments 
improve risk management by making it easier to 
receive support from social networks that can act as 
safety nets. M-Pesa users were better able to absorb 
income shocks compared to nonusers.6 Digital pay-
ments speed up delivery, which is especially impor-
tant in case of emergencies such as natural disasters. 
And they increase security compared to traveling with 
large amounts of cash, as is commonly necessary in 
low- and middle-income countries.

 Digital fi nance can increase women’s economic 
participation. In part, this is because digital payments 
can more easily be concealed by the recipient than 
cash, at least temporarily, which helps shift economic 
decision making in favor of women. Access to savings 
instruments also increases female empowerment 
and the consumption and productive investment of 
female entrepreneurs. There is a signifi cantly positive 
relationship between female labor force participation 
and female bank account ownership.7 

Information asymmetries—when one party to a 
transaction knows much more than the other—are 
pervasive in the fi nancial sector. In credit markets, 
especially those for informal enterprises and low-
income borrowers, the lender usually has limited 
information about a potential borrower’s ability to 
repay a loan, thus impeding lending. Digital tech-
nologies help estimate credit scores from digital 
footprints. Alifi nance, a subsidiary of the Chinese 
e-commerce fi rm Alibaba that is now part of 
Ant Financial, provides loans to vendors on its 
e-commerce platform. Many vendors have small 
operations and face diffi culties obtaining loans in the 
traditional fi nancial system. Alifi nance’s credit scor-
ing model is based on at least three months of a ven-
dor’s online activity and makes loan decisions auto-
matically and almost instantly. Loans are Y 20,000 
to Y 30,000 (US$3,500 to US$5,000), on average, with 
fl exible repayment terms. Micro lending elsewhere 
that serves small farmers or small businesses func-
tions similarly, often using mobile phone payment 
records to assess credit risk. M-Shwari, operated by 
the Commercial Bank of Africa and Safaricom, is a 
bank account linked to Kenya’s M-Pesa payment 
system. It pays interest on deposits and provides 

short-term loans with approval often in a matter of 
seconds based on M-Pesa usage history. Between 
November 2012 and early 2015, the system issued 21 
million loans to 2.8 million unique borrowers, with 
an average loan amount of US$15. 

Digital fi nance can increase effi  ciency
The internet reduces the cost of many fi nancial 
transactions by allowing their unbundling into sep-
arate components that can be automated or provided 
by specialized entities. A retail payment consists of 
pre-transaction, authorization, clearing, settlement, 
and post-transaction, each one again involving several 
steps. Specialized providers can execute individual 
steps, yielding economies of scale that translate into 
savings. Such service providers are becoming more 
widespread in developing and emerging markets.

Governments can also lower the cost of fi nancial 
transactions. Electronic payment cards reduced costs 
of social transfers in Brazil’s conditional cash trans-
fer program, Bolsa Familia, from almost 15 percent to 
under 3 percent of total payments.8  McKinsey esti-
mated in 2010 that digital payments could save the 
government of India US$22 billion per year.9 A large 
part of these savings comes from lower leakages and 
reduced fraud. Electronic payments create a clear 
digital record and can be traced, so the likelihood of 
funds not reaching the benefi ciary or of duplicate 
payments or payments to “ghost” recipients who 
do not exist will be lower. Evidence from India also 
shows that using smart cards rather than cash for 
social security payments halved the incidence of 
demands for bribes.

Digital fi nance spurs fi nancial innovation
The fi nancial sector is transaction-intensive and has 
always been at the forefront of adopting new tech-
nology. Automation has led to a signifi cant reduction 
in fi nancial transaction costs. This has spawned 
innovations, such as automated credit scoring using 
advanced analytics and massive amounts of data. 
Automating processes allows new, so-called fi n-tech 
fi rms to offer services often at lower costs than tra-
ditional providers, including money transfer across 
borders (Xoom, TransferWise) or short-term loans 
(Wonga, ZestFinance). Part of the Alibaba Group in 
China, Yu’E Bao—or “leftover treasure” in Mandarin—
is a fi xed-income investment fund into which cus-
tomers can easily transfer balances from their Alipay 
digital payment accounts. Established in 2013, by the 
end of 2014, the fund had 185 million users and about 
US$93 billion in assets. Peer-to-peer lending platforms 
operate without traditional fi nancial intermediaries,

instead matching potential lenders and borrowers 
directly.

The emergence of digital currencies has been 
another innovation made possible by the internet. 
Bitcoin, the most well-known, was created in 2009. 
Its value in terms of national currencies has fl uctu-
ated widely, its acceptance as a means of exchange 
has been limited, and there have been widely publi-
cized instances of fraud. But a recent analysis by the 
Bank of England suggests that the key innovation 
of such currencies is the distributed ledger that 
removes the need for accounting and settlement by 
intermediaries such as banks.10 This model could also 
work for other fi nancial assets such as loans, stocks, 
or bonds, although it is unlikely to spread widely 
anytime soon.

Managing risks
The rapid development of whole new segments of 
fi nance has raised policy questions. How should these 
new areas of fi nance be regulated and supervised, for 
instance to ensure consumer protection? Do they 
pose signifi cant risks to fi nancial stability? And do 
they make it easier to commit fi nancial fraud or illicit 
fl ows of funds?

One characteristic of digital fi nance has been the 
rise of nontraditional providers of fi nancial services 
such as money transfers, savings, and lending. Some 
of these are new companies such as peer-to-peer lend-
ing fi rms like Kickstarter or LendingTree. Others are 
nonfi nancial institutions setting up a fi nance arm 
(or “nonbank”), such as e-commerce sites like eBay 
(owner of PayPal) and Alibaba; internet intermediar-
ies like Google; electronics and software developers 
like Apple; and telecom operators like Safaricom. This 
raises several concerns. 

One concern is that traditional fi nancial regula-
tion does not always cover these companies or they 
are held to a different standard, such as reduced 
oversight, even though they can scale up quickly. 
These problems are somewhat similar to the “shadow 
banking problem” that preceded the global fi nancial 
crisis, and regulators are exploring ways to shift 
from regulating entities to regulating activities. Tra-
ditional fi nancial institutions, in contrast, use regu-
latory arguments to keep out innovative providers 
of digital fi nancial services that could greatly benefi t 
consumers and fi rms. This has obstructed the growth 
of online payment systems in Central America, for 
example. Light regulation fosters innovation. M-Pesa 
could not have grown as quickly had Kenya’s central 
bank erected strict regulatory hurdles.

Second, digital fi nance is bringing large num-
bers of people into the fi nancial system for the fi rst 
time. This requires strong consumer education and 
consumer protection, including promoting fi nancial 
literacy and fraud prevention, dispute resolution 
mechanisms, and data privacy.

A third concern is that fi nancial innovations could 
pose a systemic risk to a country’s banking sector, 
including credit, liquidity, operational, and consumer 
risk. Prudential regulation of digital fi nance reduces 
this risk, but may involve high compliance costs 
that raise barriers to entry, and thus to competition. 
Concerns about risks to the banking system were 
raised about Bitcoin, but analysis by the Bank of 
England, for instance, suggests that digital currencies 
play too small a role to threaten fi nancial stability. A 
greater concern may be that fi nancial innovations 
create distortions in fi nancial markets that could have 
larger implications. For example, if automation and 
“big data” approaches make it much easier to issue 
consumer credit but not commercial credit, fi nancial 
institutions might overallocate to the former, poten-
tially creating a credit bubble and reducing credit 
availability for investments that increase productivity.

Finally, there are concerns about increased fraud 
in the fi nancial system.11 With the rise of electronic 
banking, cyberattacks on fi nancial institutions and 
on other sectors processing electronic fi nancial trans-
actions have also increased. Massive theft of credit 
card information from retailers has highlighted the 
stakes involved. Larger fi nancial institutions have the 
resources and know-how to continuously upgrade 
online and mobile security through tools such as 
encryption or strong authentication. In fact, banks 
have been at the forefront of developing secure trans-
action processes. But smaller and nonfi nancial institu-
tions may be more at risk. Apart from monetary losses, 
a large risk is also a loss of trust in digital fi nancial sys-
tems that may hinder further innovation in the sector.

Besides fraud and theft, digital fi nance could facili-
tate fi nancial fl ows for illegal or illicit purposes.12 Such 
transfers could be money laundering (“cyberlaunder-
ing”), when illegally obtained funds are turned into 
seemingly legal assets through a process of deposit, 
layering, and integration with legitimate funds. They 
could represent payments for illegal goods or services 
such as drugs. Or they could be illicit fi nancial fl ows—
often from developing countries to capital markets in 
industrialized countries—that represent the proceeds 
from tax evasion, corruption, or bypassing of capital 
controls. Some fl ows may be to circumvent arbitrary 
regulations by unaccountable governments, but often 
they are the result of illegal activity that deprives a

country of fi nancial resources that, in aggregate, are 
thought to exceed the value of development aid.13 

The anonymity, speed, ease of transaction, and 
global reach of digital fi nance make illegal and illicit 
transfers easier, including through the ability to split 
large transactions into small tranches. Internet sites 
such as online casinos and digital currencies that offer 
a high degree of anonymity aid such activity. One 
study found that online casinos offered customers a 
choice of 235 payment options.14 And Bitcoin has been 
used to circumvent capital controls. Because these 
fl ows as well as cybercrime generally cross borders, 
it is not always clear which jurisdiction is responsible.

Although the internet might make illegal money 
transfers easier, it can also help address the problem. 
In contrast to cash, electronic transfers leave a trail that 
can aid law enforcement. Digital technologies could 
also help establish registries of benefi cial ownership 
of fi nancial and commercial holdings and transaction 
monitoring systems, a current priority of the G-20. 
This could reduce tax evasion and cyberlaundering—
although the barriers to developing such directories 
tend to be due more to resistance by tax havens than 
to technical reasons, and reforms have mostly been 
prompted by high-profi le disclosures (box S2.2). 
More generally, technology as a tool for tackling the 
problem of illicit fi nancial fl ows can complement, but 
not substitute for, proper legal frameworks, interna-
tional cooperation, and public-private collaboration. 

As with international reporting obligations aimed at 
preventing fi nancing of illegal activities or terrorism, 
a greater regulatory burden and reporting require-
ments can tax the resources of smaller countries, 
which may require assistance to comply.

Digital fi nance is developing rapidly, and constant 
changes will challenge the ability of regulators to 
catch up. Both too much and too little intervention by 
policy makers entails risks. Even in light of new types 
of fi nancial crime online, however, the opportunities 
of digital fi nance for inclusion, effi ciency, and inno-
vation will likely outweigh the risks.

Box S2.2 Technology can help unveil illicit money fl ows

Global communication networks have made it easier to 
move illicit money around the world and to shelter assets 
from domestic tax authorities. But recent high-profi le 
cases also show how a combination of human interven-
tion and technology increases the chances of detection. 
In each case, large datasets were leaked by insiders to 
tax offi  cials or watchdog groups such as the International 
Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). One case in 
2014, Off shore Leaks, yielded 260 gigabytes of accounts 
data in off shore tax havens, including the British Virgin 
Islands and Cook Islands. Collaborating with media 
outlets, experts from Costa Rica, Germany, Malta, and 
the United Kingdom developed automated software 
tools for organizing and searching this massive dataset. 

The largest number of addresses tied to these off shore 
accounts were from a number of large emerging econ-
omies. Besides Off shore Leaks, Swiss Leaks yielded data 
about secret bank accounts in Switzerland, and Lux Leaks 
documented strategies that international corporations 
use to avoid taxes in countries where they make profi ts, 
notably by channeling them through Luxembourg. While 
many clients are from developing countries, they get help 
from western accountants, and much of the money ends 
up in industrialized countries or their off shore territories. 
Increased transparency, thanks to technology’s ability 
to sift through large leaked datasets, is encouraging 
reforms that will make it harder to hide assets in foreign 
jurisdictions.

costs when fi rms innovate and automate processes, 
or from fully digital goods and services that allow 
fi rms to exploit economies of scale (fi gure 2.1 and 
spotlight 1). 

But not everyone stands to benefi t automatically. 
Only by improving internet access and basic literacy 
and updating skill and training systems will the ben-
efi ts be realized and broadly shared. For the world’s 
poor, the key is to leverage digital technologies to 
improve the productivity of household enterprises, 
subsistence family farmers, and the informal sector. 
Yet for every person connected to the internet in 
developing countries, almost three are not; among 
the poor, more than six are not; and many also lack 
access to such complementary infrastructure as 
electricity or roads. Even if connected, many cannot 
read or use the information the internet provides. For 
workers in more organized labor markets, conditions 
are changing rapidly. New jobs require different skills 
from old jobs, and many new jobs are informal or 
nonwage, without benefi ts or worker protections. 
Greater computer power and internet connectivity 
make some skills obsolete by substituting for work 
that is codifi able and routine, and thus can be auto-
mated. The remaining tasks require complex skills 
that complement technology, such as creativity, criti-
cal thinking, and problem solving. These skills remain 
hard for technology to emulate, but also for education 
and training systems to provide, leaving many work-
ers unprepared for the modern world of work.

Thus while digital technologies can raise produc-
tivity and enhance overall welfare, associated labor 
market disruptions can be painful and can result in 
higher inequality. High-skilled workers are the biggest 
winners when paired with digital technologies. Glob-
ally, returns to education remain high, at 10 percent per 
year, and are even higher for those using technology 
at work. The poor, with no access to technology and 
lacking skills, see few of the direct downsides from 
technological adoption but also only partial benefi ts. 

Digital technologies can improve overall welfare 
and reduce poverty, but without complementary 
investments, they can also worsen inequality. In 
Africa alone, 11 million youth are expected to enter the 
labor market every year for the next decade.1 Born in 
the internet era, they live in a world full of new and 
exciting opportunities.2 Farmers use mobile phones 
to get price information and technical advice. Women 
facing barriers to work outside their homes can work 
online and better balance work and family. And many 
have found earning opportunities through online 
work and the on-demand economy. But these new 
opportunities come hand in hand with fundamental 
and rapid changes in the world of work, as digital 
technologies increase the demand for advanced 
skills, and many skills quickly become obsolete. 
From a technological standpoint, fewer than half of 
today’s schoolchildren in China, Croatia, or Thailand 
can expect to fi nd a job in an occupation that exists 
today.3 But more than jobs disappearing, they will be 
transformed. The challenge for policy makers is to 
ensure that all current and future workers can seize 
the growing economic opportunities that accompany 
the spread of digital technologies. The risk is that 
rapid technological change will end up increasing 
inequality and leaving many behind—blunting the 
digital dividends.

The potential gains from technological progress 
for workers and consumers in developing countries 
are indeed large. Digital technologies can create jobs 
and increase earnings in the small information and 
communication technology (ICT) sector—and much 
more in the sectors that use ICT. They also increase 
worker productivity by augmenting human capital 
and—especially critical for the poor—connecting peo-
ple to work and markets. And they can benefi t con-
sumers by lowering prices and expanding the variety 
of goods and services available, thus producing con-
sumer surplus. Most of these consumer gains come 
from lower marginal production and distribution

(fi gure 2.2). A technology diffuses rapidly when it is 
low in cost, easy to use, has high potential benefi ts, 
and fi ts well with the local context. Low-cost mobile 
phones—which can be shared, prepaid, billed in 
prices per second, and do not require much literacy 
or numeracy for basic use—fi t this description, and 
are the technology of choice among the poor.8 In 
Cameroon, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, 
more than four in fi ve mobile phone owners have 
simple phones, not capable of browsing the internet.9 
Personal computers and the internet, by contrast, 
require literacy and often foreign language (especially 
English) skills. Computers with internet capabilities 
in the Warana subdistrict in Maharashtra, India, for 
instance, went largely unused except for transmitting 
market information to farmers—a function later sub-
stituted by mobile phones, which were cheaper and 
easier to use.10

Communications, entertainment, and searching 
for information are the most common uses for mobile 
phones and the internet. In African countries, social 
networking, sending and receiving e-mails, instant 
messaging, and checking facts and defi nitions are the 
most common uses of the internet (fi gure 2.3). This is 
similar in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Uru-
guay, and the European Union countries, especially 
with social networking (between 50 and 80 percent 
of all internet users).11 The use of digital technologies 

But it is the middle class that can be hollowed out as 
jobs held by this segment—often medium skilled—are 
transformed, partly driven by technological change. 
 Machine operators and clerical support workers, for 
example, perform many “routine” tasks that are easily 
automated. Since 1995, the share of routine employ-
ment in total employment has fallen by 8 and 12 per-
centage points in developing and developed countries, 
respectively.4 Such medium-skilled jobs, critical to the 
growth of the middle class and held disproportion-
ately by the bottom 40 percent of the welfare distri-
bution, give way either to high-skilled jobs that only 
a small share of workers qualify for, or to low-skilled 
jobs that face increasing competition and most likely 
declining wages. 

So the race is on between skills and technology, 
and the outcome will determine whether the divi-
dends from digital technologies are realized and the 
benefi ts widely shared. It is important to bridge the 
digital divides both in access and in capabilities. This 
second divide separates the digitally savvy, who can 
make productive use of digital technologies and have 
skills that complement them—and the digitally poor, 
who remain unconnected and unskilled. Providing 
current and future workers with the cognitive, tech-
nical, and socioemotional skills that are augmented 
by technology—and not replaced by it—is a priority. 
Given the fast pace of technological change—with 
more intense job creation, destruction, and realloca-
tion to be expected—labor regulations, taxation, and 
social protection systems will have to support labor 
mobility and adapt to the changing nature of work. 
This is the analog foundation for workers to succeed 
in a digital world.

Connected people
The world is more connected than ever. On aver-
age, 8 in 10 people in the developing world own a 
mobile phone (map 2.1). Digital technologies, often 
low-end phones, connect the more than 60 percent 
of the world’s people who did not have a landline 
phone as late as 2000. More people have access to 
a mobile phone than to secondary schooling, clean 
water, or sanitation.5 Internet adoption lags behind 
mobile phone access, but has tripled since 2005. In 
developing countries today, 28 percent of the popu-
lation reports access to the internet at home, and in 
advanced economies, 80 percent.6, 7 

Mobile phones are driving this interconnect-
edness, especially among the poor. All regions are 
converging in mobile phone use, but South Asia and 
Sub-Saharan Africa lag far behind in internet access

gender (fi gure 2.4). In African countries, the bottom 
40 percent is only one-third as likely to have access 
to the internet as the upper 60 percent;17 18 percent 
of men report using the internet versus 12 percent of 
women, and 20 percent of youth versus 8 percent of 
those more than 45 years old. Such demographic gaps 
persist also in Latin America, and even in high- and 
middle-income European countries.18

The digital divide refl ects inequalities in access 
and barriers to productive use. Many areas simply 
remain unconnected (chapter 4). Even when a region 
is connected to the internet, access is not easy. In 
Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda, more than 
three in four users still access the internet in com-
mercial internet cafes, where high costs and slow 
connections limit use.19 A survey of 25 developing 
countries found that although commercial cafes 
were more expensive than telecenters, they had more 
skilled staff and more reliable infrastructure and 
service.20 But this is not the whole story. Illiteracy and 
lack of skills are important barriers. In a subsidized 
internet and mobile telephony program in rural Peru, 
mobile phone ownership increased, on average, by 12 
percentage points, but internet use increased by only 
2 percentage points.21 Explaining this gap is the lower 
internet use among adults than among youth, and 
the lack of use among the uneducated. Even among 
the literate, internet use may be limited by a lack of 
content in local languages.22 

Creating jobs, boosting 
labor productivity, and 
benefi ting consumers
The overall impacts of digital technologies on 
employment and earnings are positive, if highly 
heterogeneous (table 2.1). As discussed throughout 
this chapter, rigorous evidence remains limited, but it 
suggests that most gains accrue disproportionally to 
the better educated, with technology complementing 
the skills and assets of users. But there are exceptions. 
In Peru, between 2007 and 2009, new internet users 
had higher income growth than those who remained 
nonusers, with larger gains in rural areas.23 And in the 
United States the diffusion of broadband increased 
employment rates more in rural areas than in urban.24 

What explains the aggregate differences? The 
fi rst factor is the type of technology. Mobile phones 
can be particularly benefi cial to people in more dis-
advantaged groups—who often lack skills for using 
the internet, or work in agriculture, where mobile 
phones alone can pay off. Thus the benefi ts from 
mobile phones tend to be widespread. In Peru, for 

for work, education, and health is more limited but 
increasing. Across the European Union, around 60 per-
cent of internet users search for health information, 
and 13 percent make appointments with health practi-
tioners online.12 In Brazil, 60 percent of internet users 
use it for educational purposes, and in Mexico, 35 
percent.13 One in four individuals who use the internet 
in African countries reports doing so to get health and 
education information.14 Uses vary across population 
groups. In Brazil and Mexico, women, rural, and poorer 
populations are less likely to use the internet for fi nan-
cial transactions or dealing with public authorities, 
but in both countries these same groups are equally 
or more likely to use it for educational purposes than 
men, urban, and richer populations.15 Across countries, 
children and youth are most likely to use the internet 
for education.

The digital divide persists
Despite the rapid spread of digital technologies, more 
than 800 million people lack mobile access worldwide 
(63 percent of them in the bottom 40 percent of the 
income distribution), and 4.3 billion lack internet 
access (49 percent in the bottom 40).16 For every 
person connected to the internet in developing coun-
tries, almost three are not, and in some countries, 20 
are not. Big gaps remain by income, age, location, and

their productivity and earnings. Digital technolo-
gies can also connect people to work and markets 
and facilitate the accumulation of productive 
assets. This increases effi ciency in the labor market 
and the overall economy by allowing workers and 
fi rms to better leverage existing assets. 

•  Benefi ting consumers. When digital technologies 
automate processes and generate economies of 
scale, they can lower prices and create new goods 
and services, thus increasing consumer surplus.

While quantifying these benefi ts is diffi cult, 
the evidence discussed in the rest of the chapter 
suggests that they accrue most to those already 
better off (table 2.2). Employment in the ICT sector 
and in ICT occupations is limited and mostly for 
high-skilled workers. In industries that use ICT, the 
potential is greater, especially for those who have 
skills that better complement the technology. But the 
largest payoff from digital technologies is increased 
labor productivity. Better and cheaper information 
that helps connect people to inputs, outputs, and 
work is particularly promising for the poor, since 
it addresses a key barrier to raising incomes for 
people previously disconnected from markets. The 
lower communication costs associated with mobile 
phones, the most common technology for the poor 
today, can increase the effi ciency of agriculture and 
labor markets, raising household incomes and reduc-
ing poverty. As governments and the private sector 
get better at tailoring digital services to the poor, 
those gains should increase. 

both mobile and internet use, the better educated 
benefi ted most, but while very few of the less edu-
cated adopted the internet, they benefi ted greatly 
from their new mobile phones.25 Second is the labor 
market context. Technology makes a difference when 
it helps overcome obstacles to employment or higher 
productivity. In Peru, mobile phones were more ben-
efi cial in agriculture, where lack of access to relevant 
and timely information kept people from accessing 
better opportunities, whereas internet access made 
more of a difference outside agriculture, where 
employers seemed to demand ICT skills and internet 
use. If the constraints are elsewhere, technology will 
not make a difference. In rural South Africa, the roll-
out of mobile phone networks increased employment 
among women, but only for those who did not have 
signifi cant family responsibilities.26

These aggregate effects of digital technologies on 
opportunities are mediated through three mecha-
nisms (see fi gure 2.1):

•  Creating jobs. Digital technologies promote inclu-
sion by boosting employment and earnings in 
the ICT sector or in ICT occupations across the 
economy. But most important, they support jobs 
and earnings in sectors that use ICT when fi rms 
and the self-employed adopt new technologies and 
grow, as well as through ICT-enabled outsourcing 
and entrepreneurship. 

•  Increasing worker productivity. By taking on some 
tasks previously performed by workers, digital 
technologies augment workers’ skills, increasing

production spillovers. The median hourly earnings in 
the ICT sector and in ICT occupations are 1.5 times 
higher than in urban non-ICT sectors or non-ICT 
occupations in developing countries.31 The high pay 
refl ects a workforce that is better educated than aver-
age. It likely also refl ects the relative scarcity of ICT 
workers in some countries, driving up the skill pre-
mium. These high-paying jobs create more demand 
and new jobs outside ICT. In the United States and 
Turkey, one job in the high-tech industry generates 
an average of 3 to 5 additional jobs elsewhere in the 
local economy.32 Many of these additional jobs are 
low-skilled or medium-skilled in such local services 
as retail, cleaning, and food preparation. Kenya’s 
mobile money service M-Pesa uses more than 80,000 
agents or service locations that make an average 
profi t of US$70 a month.33 Hormuud Telecom—the 
largest operator in Somalia—employs 5,000 staff but 
supports 25,000 agents. Given the high skill require-
ments of the ICT industry, these employment spill-
overs are more likely to benefi t the poor.

nologies lies outside the ICT sector. By improving

the economy (chapter 1), digital technologies can 
increase aggregate employment and earnings. In 
China, between 1997 and 2007, the increase in internet 
domains and users per capita had a positive impact 
on fi rms’ employment in ICT-intensive industries.34 

Creating jobs

In ICT sectors and occupations
In terms of employment, the ICT sector is small, has 
high entry barriers, and remains male dominated. 
The ICT sector employs, on average, 1 percent of 
the workers in developing countries (fi gure 2.5). 
ICT occupations—such as network administrator 
and electrical and electronic engineer—are also 
1 percent of employment in developing countries, 
and 2–5 percent in member-countries of the Organi-
sation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD).27 Even in the United States, since 2000, new 
technology-related industries—such as e-commerce 
and social networking—have accounted for only 
0.5 percent of employment.28 Nor is the sector labor 
intensive. Instagram, a photo sharing app, had just 
13 employees in 2012, when it was bought by Face-
book for US$1 billion. Facebook, in turn, had 5,000 
employees at the time—compared with 145,000 at 
Kodak at its peak in photographic fi lm in the 1990s. 
Yet Facebook’s market value is several times what 
Kodak’s was back then.29 And most of these jobs are 
high-skilled. In developing countries, on average, 
half of all workers in the ICT sector have a tertiary 
education, compared with one-quarter elsewhere. 
The gender gap is also large, with men 2.7 times more 
likely than women to work in the sector and 7.6 times 
more likely to be in ICT occupations.30

While not numerous, ICT jobs pay well and can 
generate additional jobs through consumption and

future.38 These jobs are often in business processing, 
including call centers and bookkeeping. Such jobs 
include those that can be broken down into routine 
tasks but also those requiring high skills and judg-
ment if they can be reliably performed and monitored 
remotely. Almost half of business process outsourc-
ing (BPO) is in banking and fi nancial services, and 
another 20 percent is in high-tech and telecommuni-
cations. Some tasks of radiologists and other medical 
services are increasingly also offshored. India, China, 
the Philippines, and South Africa are the leading BPO 
hosts.39 The BPO industry in India employs more than 
3.1 million workers, 30 percent of them women.40 In 
the Philippines, it employs 2.3 percent of all workers 
(box 2.1). In rural India, a three-year awareness pro-
gram on opportunities in the BPO industry increased 
women’s enrollment in relevant training programs, as 
well as school enrollment among young girls, by 3–5 
percentage points.41 

New technologies are now also challenging the 
status quo of the outsourcing industry. Many of 
the characteristics that make jobs “offshorable” also 
make them more vulnerable to automation. So, as 
technology improves and wages rise, some of the jobs 
typically offshored, such as call center jobs, could be 
automated. Indeed, a local health care company in 

In Brazil, between 2009 and 2013, fi rms in industries 
intensive in the use of ICTs had higher wage increases 
across skill levels than the rest of the economy (fi gure 
2.6), although they did not experience faster employ-
ment growth. Wage growth was especially high for 
workers moving across fi rms.35 

Recent studies, despite measurement diffi culties, 
fi nd a positive causal effect of fi rms’ technology 
adoption on employment and earnings, especially 
in fi rms with skilled workers who can make the best 
use of digital technologies. Thanks to a tax allowance 
program for ICT investments in small fi rms in the 
United Kingdom, digital technologies raised labor 
productivity within fi rms and increased the demand 
for workers performing high-skilled tasks.36 In Nor-
way, a 10-percentage-point increase in broadband 
availability in a municipality raised wages of skilled 
workers by about 0.2 percent, while lowering wages 
for low-skilled workers.37

Internet-enabled off shoring and 
outsourcing, including online work 
Internet-enabled offshoring is an important source 
of jobs in developing countries and for women. An 
estimated one in four jobs in the United States has 
already been offshored or could be offshored in the

cent of women earning at least US$1 a day. Nine in ten 
of the women had previously not worked outside the 
home.45 Samasource, RuralShores, and Digital Divide 
Data are three private service providers. Samasource 
splits jobs into microwork for almost 6,400 workers, 
mostly in Ghana, Haiti, India, Kenya, and Uganda, on 
average more than doubling their previous income.46

Online work can prove particularly benefi cial for 
women, youth, older workers, and the disabled, who 
may prefer the fl exibility of working from home 
or working fl exible hours. On freelancer.com—an 
online outsourcing platform with more than 10,000 
microworkers globally—57 percent of workers are 
between 16 and 25 years of age.47 In Elance (part of 
Upwork), 44 percent of workers are women, com-
pared with just 25 percent in the nonagricultural 
economy (fi gure 2.7). In a survey on microworkers
.com carried out for this Report, 27 percent of workers 
see being able to work at home and fl exible hours as 
the main advantages of working online. These are 
the reasons most cited, even more often than earning 
extra income, especially among women (fi gure 2.8).

Internet-enabled entrepreneurship and 
self-employment
By lowering information barriers and costs, the 
internet increases experimentation and gives rise to 
new opportunities for entrepreneurship and self-

South Africa is already using Watson, IBM’s artifi cial 
intelligence system, to assist in customer service.42 

Outsourcing opportunities are increasing in other 
areas through online work, providing workers and 
fi rms with access to larger, even global, employment 
marketplaces (box 2.2). People can work for any 
employer anywhere, with parties buying and selling 
services that can be delivered online. Upwork (for-
merly Elance–oDesk), the largest online outsourcing 
service, had 2.8 million job postings worldwide in 
2014.43 Online jobs range from the very simple that 
can be completed in a few minutes—such as sign-
ups, forum participation, review writing, and website 
testing—to the more complex, such as software devel-
opment, translation services, data entry, and admin-
istrative support. The online work market, though 
still a tiny fraction of overall employment, is worth 
around US$1 billion annually, up from US$700 million 
in 2009.44

Impact-outsourcing brings online work to vul-
nerable communities. Still in its infancy—employing 
around 150,000 workers, or 3 percent of the total BPO 
industry—it is taking hold in India, Kenya, and South 
Africa. The government of Kerala, India, outsources 
information technology services to cooperatives 
of women from poor families through the Kudum-
bashree (“Prosperity of the Family”) project. Average 
earnings were US$45 a month, with close to 80 per-

employment (box 2.3). Many are in the ICT sector, 
but others are ICT-enabled (see also chapters 1 and 
4). Alibaba in China, the world’s largest e-commerce 
platform by sales volume, supports an estimated 
10 million jobs, or 1.3 percent of China’s workforce. 
Online shop owners using Alibaba in China, on 
average, employ 2.6 additional workers. Four in ten 
shop owners are women, 19 percent were previously 
unemployed, 7 percent were farmers, and about 1 
percent are persons with disabilities. Alibaba is esti-
mated to support an additional 2 million jobs, most in 
logistics.48 In Morocco, home-based female weavers 
sell rugs and other textiles over the internet to keep 
a larger share of their profi ts.49 Etsy, a peer-to-peer 
e-commerce platform focused on handmade or vin-
tage items, and similar services, can take this to scale. 
Etsy has 20 million active buyers and 1.5 million active 

sellers worldwide, with 31 percent of its sales outside 
the United States.50

As online commerce, the on-demand or sharing 
economy—in which people rent assets or command 
services directly from one another, coordinated 
through the internet—is growing rapidly, if still small 
overall and just emerging in developing countries. 
More than two-thirds of internet users globally are 
willing to be part of the sharing economy.51 In Uganda, 
food delivery services online are used by the diaspora 
to send in-kind remittances to family members. In 
Kenya, Sendy connects customers with motorcycle 
couriers for delivery services, which can then be 
paid with mobile money. As of March 2015, Airbnb—
the largest site for peer-to-peer accommodation—
reported operating in more than 34,000 cities and 190 
countries, with more than 25 million guests.52 Peer-to-

Box 2.1 Business process outsourcing and jobs in the Philippines: 
Opportunities and challenges from technological change 

The information technology (IT) and business process out-
sourcing (BPO) industry in the Philippines has been a driver 
of economic growth and job creation in the last decade. It 
has grown at an average of 24 percent annually, and its share 
of the global off shore services market went from 5 percent 
in 2006 to 11 percent in 2013. Direct employment reached 
1 million full-time employees in August 2014 from virtu-
ally zero in 1999, accounting for around 2.3 percent of the 
country’s total employment. The industry has a robust voice 
sector (primarily call centers), accounting for 64 percent of 
the industry’s revenue. Health care information management 
employment grew by 47 percent from 2012 to 2013. IT out-
sourcing revenues also grew by 52 percent from 2012 to 2013, 
while knowledge process outsourcing grew by 18 percent. 

Earnings and skill requirements vary across these sec-
tors. Industry-specifi c jobs tend to be higher skilled than 
those that cut across industries (such as human resources 
business processing), as they require more technical knowl-
edge. In 2012, average annual compensation per employee 
in the industry was around US$8,849, with the highest aver-
age compensation in software development (US$17,383). 
It was US$8,301 for contact centers and US$7,687 for other 
BPOs. High-skilled, high-paid occupations—as are most 
research and development–related jobs in knowledge 
process outsourcing (such as market research and medical 

transcription), IT outsourcing (such as software and applica-
tion maintenance), engineering services (such as engineer-
ing design and digital mapping), and creative processes 
(such as art production and game testing and support)—are 
intensive in nonroutine cognitive and interpersonal tasks. 
Middle-skilled occupations are intensive in routine cognitive 
tasks, mostly in nonvoice BPO (such as back-offi  ce fi nance 
and accounting or human resources), but can also include 
many of the jobs in voice business processing (such as cus-
tomer service and technical support).

Progress in digital technologies and international com-
petition increases the need to move to more high-value-
added, nonroutine jobs. In the Philippine IT-BPO industry, 
85 percent of the revenues are generated in jobs inten-
sive in routine cognitive tasks, with workers increasingly 
susceptible to automation. Low wages will delay this 
process but are unlikely to halt it. As the global market 
for complex services grows, providing a larger volume of 
high-value nonvoice services can promote the industry’s 
sustainability. This transition requires a concerted eff ort 
among business, academia, and government to make sys-
temic improvements across the IT-BPO ecosystem, such as 
enhancing telecommunications infrastructure and directing 
industry-government partnerships toward more nonvoice 
training and skills development.

Box 2.2 The economics of online outsourcing 

Online outsourcing or freelancing platforms match fi rms 
and workers to perform work online. They can reduce 
contracting costs and the time it takes to match employ-
ers and employees. Through Upwork, the largest of these 
platforms, the time it takes to hire a worker can fall from 43 
to 3 days.a On the workers’ side, around 45 percent of free-
lancers on Upwork earn most or all of their income through 
online work. In oDesk—with Elance, one of the two original 
platforms behind Upwork—hourly earnings are on average 
14 times higher than minimum wages in developing coun-
tries (fi gure B2.2.1, panel a). This is partly explained by the 
fact that online workers are better educated than those in 
the general economy. High-paying work is concentrated 
in information and communication technology (ICT) areas 
such as software development, which can pay twice as 
much as online work in writing and translation, and even 
three to four times more than that in customer support and 
sales.b

Thanks to the internet and innovations in monitoring 
and feedback systems, online labor markets are becoming 
global. Online job platforms increase the pool of talent for 
fi rms, especially for smaller enterprises, and provide an 
opportunity to monetize skills that may not be in suffi  cient 

demand in the local economy. An individual in Mongolia 
with expertise in web development and a programming 
language such as Python can make close to US$40 an hour 
online. On Upwork, 90 percent of the work is off shored. On 
the largest platforms, most employers are located in devel-
oped countries and most workers in developing countries. 
Australia, Canada, and the United States are the largest 
employers. On oDesk, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, the 
Philippines, and the United States have the largest number 
of contractors in relation to their populations (fi gure B2.2.1, 
panel b). 

Yet the internet only partly overcomes labor market 
segmentation, and some barriers to inclusion and to fur-
ther expansion of online labor markets remain. On Upwork, 
a given worker is 1.3 times more likely to fi nd work in 
her domestic market, and domestic contractors get paid 
more than international contractors for the same type of 
work.c Online outsourcing is most likely to function like 
a truly global market when tasks are less complex and 
involve fewer local institutions and less communications. 
Additional constraints that could be addressed by policy 
are related to language (mainly English), regulations, pay-
ment platforms, and trust.d

peer car services such as Uber, which operates inter-
nationally, or Didi Kuaidi in China, are growing fast. 
Expanding the principles of the on-demand economy 
to the urban self-employed in developing countries 
could be particularly promising. These workers often 
lack references and documented work histories when 
seeking jobs and depend on word of mouth to expand 
their customer base. In this setting, the sharing econ-
omy’s decentralized, crowd-based rating systems can 
help control quality, build trust, and maintain a live 
“resume.” Plumbers and handymen can expand their 
client pool by building strong reputations online. 

These new jobs in the sharing economy have 
advantages for workers, but they also come with trade-
offs. The main advantages for workers are supple-
mental income and fl exibility. In the United States, 61 
percent of sharing economy participants say earning 
extra money is their main motive.53 Workers appear 
to sort into a working arrangement that suits their 
preferences and family circumstances. Two-thirds 
of Uber drivers in the United States vary their hours

112 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

Workers who are able to work with digital technol-
ogies and complement them are well positioned to 
access more (and more rewarding) employment and 
higher wages. Returns to education have fallen only 
in Latin America. Everywhere, average private returns 
remain high—at 10 percent per year—despite large 
increases in the supply of educated workers in the 
last few decades. Returns to tertiary education are the 
highest, at 14.6 percent; tertiary education is the only 
educational level for which returns have not fallen 
since the early to mid-1990s.55 That refl ects strong 
demand for advanced skills, especially among women 
(fi gure 2.9). Returns to education are higher and have 
been rising more rapidly in ICT-intensive occupations 
compared to the rest of the economy (fi gure 2.10).

Connecting people to work and markets
Digital technologies help overcome barriers to pro-
ductive employment and connect workers and entre-
preneurs to (global) markets, clients, and suppliers. 
This is particularly important for the disadvantaged 
or often-excluded groups such as the poor, women, 
minorities, the disabled, and people in remote regions 
(box 2.4). For all of them, high search costs, long dis-
tances, and a lack of information are key obstacles. 

worked by more than 25 percent from week to week. 
This fl exibility is likely to be valuable for women and 
youth and for people between jobs. But these benefi ts 
come at a possible cost since these jobs do not provide 
much work security or protection to workers.54 

Increasing worker productivity

Increasing returns to human capital 
Digital technologies can complement human capital, 
allowing workers to focus their efforts on activities 
with higher value and making them more productive. 
Farmers can use precision agriculture or track live-
stock. Teachers can use massive open online courses 
(known as MOOCs) or online teaching tools like Khan 
Academy, better using study time inside and outside 
the classroom to increase practice and discussion, 
and dedicating more time to children who fall behind. 
Researchers can dedicate more time to thinking and 
innovating rather than spending time searching for 
information or duplicating other people’s work. Man-
agers can work more easily with teams across borders.

In fact, there has never been a better time to be a 
well-educated worker. Chapter 1 shows how digital 
technologies increase labor productivity within fi rms. 

Box 2.3 Expanding opportunities through online music

Usman Riaz began piano lessons at age six in his native 
Pakistan. He later wanted to explore new instruments and 
musical styles, but he could not fi nd the right teachers in 
his own country. Instead, watching videos online, he taught 
himself percussive guitar, a style that uses the strings and 
the instrument’s body for percussive eff ects. Riaz also used 
the internet to showcase his music. His song “Fire Fly” went 
viral in 2011. A year later, he shared a stage in Edinburgh 
with Preston Reed, one of his online idols. 

The internet has exposed people around the world to 
new cultural infl uences—not just global pop culture hits, 
but also in the tiniest niches. Whether it has also helped 
many more artists in developing countries gain access to 
arts and entertainment markets is diffi  cult to say, given the 
lack of suitable data. Globally in 2014, revenues for recorded 
music were about US$15 billion and falling, compared with 

US$25 billion for live performances, whose revenues are 
rising.a Pirating, YouTube, and music streaming have led to 
an overall decline of music sales in developed and devel-
oping markets. Most of the revenue goes to the biggest 
stars: the top 1 percent of artists earn about 80 percent of 
recorded music revenue.b At the same time, fi le sharing has 
raised the demand for concerts,c which has always been 
the biggest source of income for most musicians.d As the 
cost of recording and distributing music has gone down, 
online music sharing could become an eff ective advertising 
vehicle for musicians in developing countries—although 
limited internet access and slow speeds make this harder. 
Even if only a small minority break into national or even 
international entertainment markets, the welfare benefi ts 
of being able to learn from others and share talents on the 
internet can still be signifi cant.

113EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES

The internet makes labor markets more effi cient 
by connecting a larger pool of individuals and fi rms at 
lower cost.56 Indeed.com, Monster.com, and elempleo
.com are international platforms that aggregate job 
vacancies from different sources and allow fi rms to 
post job openings, and workers to apply for jobs and 
post résumés. Similar services exist for local markets, 
such as aldaba.com in the Dominican Republic and 
kariyer.net in Turkey. Social and professional net-
working sites also provide information on potential 
workers, often on behavioral aspects and social ties 
not refl ected in traditional resumes. LinkedIn, the 
largest online professional network, has more than 
310 million registered members, 67 percent outside 
the United States. In Brazil, LinkedIn’s penetration 
rate is already at 8 percent.57 In most countries, online 
job search remains concentrated among youth and 
the best educated and grows with income: online job 
search among the employed and unemployed is above 
20 percent in urban Armenia and Georgia, but below 
5 percent in urban Bolivia, Ghana, the Lao People’s 
Democratic Republic, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam.58 

Online job boards, social media, and matching 
platforms can improve labor market effi ciency, espe-
cially in developing countries and in the informal 
sector, where information failures are large. Online 
job matching is cheaper and faster than traditional 
methods.59 In Peru, integrating mobile phones into 
traditional public intermediation services increased 
employment among job seekers by 8 percentage 
points in the short term.60 In Germany, online job 
seekers are better matched to jobs, are happier with 
work, and have higher chances of promotion and job 
security.61 But other studies fi nd no effect of online 
tools on the speed of matching or on the length of 
unemployment.62 The large number of applications 
per vacancy and stale resumes and job posts makes it 
costly for employers to select workers and for work-
ers to fi nd available jobs. As online tools become more 
advanced, however, matching is becoming more 
effective. In the United States, the average unemploy-
ment duration for internet searchers was 25 percent 
shorter than for noninternet searchers, reversing 
earlier results.63 

Online tools can address many labor market fric-
tions, but much of this potential remains unrealized. 
A fi rst challenge is reaching lower-skilled workers. 
Some services, such as Souktel, are solving this via 
mobile phone (box 2.5). Babajob in India and Duma 
in Kenya have also implemented innovations to 
reach the bottom of the pyramid. They use text mes-
saging and “missed calls” to connect low-skilled and 
informal workers to vacancies. A second challenge is

make it easier to work away from an offi ce. In the 
European Union, telework doubled to reach 9 percent 
in the fi rst half of the 2000s, and around 23 percent 
of enterprises in the EU-15 employed teleworkers in 
2006, up from 16 percent in 2003 and 18 percent in 
2004. In the United States, in 2009, one-quarter of 
workers used telework regularly.66 

The rise in telework has been particularly rapid 
among female workers in Europe.67 Budget airlines, 
such as JetBlue, manage their customer support 
centers largely with home workers, mostly women.68 
Telework can also make it easier for youth to combine 
school and work and for older workers to work longer. 
These new work arrangements can address skill gaps 
and increase productivity. Facilitated by the internet, 
home-based work in a 16,000-employee travel agency 
in China improved worker productivity by 13 per-
cent.69 And where there is a shortage of doctors, tele-
medicine and examinations of digital X-rays can be 
very helpful. In Uruguay, through teleconferencing, 

providing supporting services. There is high demand 
for supporting services in online work, especially 
from women. In Souktel, 40 percent of women and 
30 percent of men report a need for career coaching.64 
A third challenge is receiving up-to-date vacancy 
information, since many postings are stale. Employ-
ers also report a fairly high rate of no-shows for 
interviews. A two-side rating system—quality control 
on vacancies’ expiration dates, and short message 
service (SMS) reminders to candidates selected for 
interviews—can address some of these shortcomings.

Making work more fl exible
Digital technologies can bring women and new 
entrants into the labor market, especially in white- 
collar occupations, by allowing people to work on 
different schedules or from different locations. In 
Georgia, Romania, and Ukraine, more than 10 percent 
of employment is part-time, up from less than 5 per-
cent a decade earlier.65 Video conferences and e-mail 

Box 2.4 Bridging the disability divide through digital technologies

For most people, technology makes things easier. For people with disabilities, it makes things possible.

—Mary Pat Radabaugh, formerly with the IBM National Support Center for Persons with Disabilities

Prakash lost his sight at birth. Today he is a successful 
entrepreneur and programmer running his own information 
technology (IT) company in a mid-size city in India. Screen- 
reading and voice-recognition software enable him to use a 
computer and write computing programs, and the internet 
helps him fi nd and connect with clients. Technology aug-
ments his business and his life. 

Around the world, more than 1 billion people have dis-
abilities, 80 percent of them in developing countries. They 
face infrastructure and environmental barriers to social, 
fi nancial, and civic participation, which digital technologies 
can help overcome. Technology enables multiple means 
of communication—voice, text, and gestures—to access 
information and engage with others. Magnifi cation, voice 
recognition, and text-to-speech benefi t persons with 
visual, cognitive, learning, and mobility disabilities. Short 
message service (SMS), instant messaging, telephone 
relay, and video captions reduce communication barriers 
for those with hearing and speech disabilities. Hands-free 
navigation and gesture-controlled interfaces help those 
with severe mobility impairments. 

But if not designed to be accessible, digital technolo-
gies can widen the disparities between persons with and 
without disabilities. Free and low-cost mobile apps off er 
increased functionality for persons across the disabil-
ity spectrum. Assistive software is available for feature 
phones. Accessibility enhancements for web browsers 
promote greater internet use by persons with disabilities. 
Governments should focus on building the capacity of pub-
lic bureaucracies, teachers, vocational trainers, employers, 
and information and communication technology (ICT) 
professionals to design accessible content and support ICTs 
for persons with disabilities; developing the legal, policy, 
and regulatory foundation for accessible ICT; supporting, 
through public-private partnerships, the development of 
accessible ICT, such as local language text-to-speech and 
voice-recognition software; and mainstreaming accessibil-
ity in all public services off ered through ICT, such as disaster 
warnings and communications, public services, and fi nan-
cial services.

Box 2.5 Using digital technologies to match workers with jobs: 
Souktel in West Bank and Gaza 

Souktel is an online job-matching service started in 2009 
and operating primarily in West Bank and Gaza, but also 
active in the Arab Republic of Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, 
Rwanda, and Somalia. There are more than 15,000 regis-
tered job seekers. The service registers job seekers through 
short message service (SMS) and online, provides informa-
tion on vacancies, advises on resume preparation, and does 
active job matching by screening potential candidates for 
vacancies. Notifi cations on relevant job vacancies are sent 
through voice calls and SMS once or twice a week. Job seek-
ers in the platform are young (80 percent are age 15–25) 
and well educated (all have completed secondary and half 
have completed tertiary education). Among Souktel’s core 
users, 4 of 10 do not have jobs. Women are 30 percent of 
all online job seekers in Souktel, a share that is 15 percent-
age points higher than at the national level (fi gure B2.5.1, 

panel a). There are 200 registered employers, 80 percent of 
which are medium in size. 

The main benefi t that job seekers see in Souktel’s ser-
vice is saving time and money. Most workers look for jobs 
that match their skills and experiences, but more than one-
third look for jobs in new occupations or industries. Souktel 
connects users to better-paying jobs. The share of workers 
earning less than the overall average monthly earnings 
(around US$500 per month) drops both for men and 
women after fi nding a job through Souktel (fi gure B2.5.1, 
panel b). About 70 percent of users have been invited for 
a job interview at least once. Employers report that using 
online job platforms allows them to hire from a prescreened 
pool of high-quality candidates and reduces the time and 
cost for hiring. Firms report a reduction in recruiting costs 
of about 20 percent.

of identifying borrowers can improve access to fi nan-
cial and other services at the bottom of the pyramid.75

Through social and professional networking sites 
and better connections with friends and family, 
the internet also enlarges, deepens, and leverages 
social capital to fi nd jobs and access resources (spot-
light 3).76 In the United States, internet users have a 
larger extended network activated when looking for a 
job.77 Digital technologies can also increase agency 
and modify aspirations, affecting social norms that 
can be barriers to participation, employment, and 
productivity, especially for women,78 much the same 
as with soap operas in Brazil and cable television in 
India.79 In Africa, the internet appears to broaden 
social interactions with groups with different politi-
cal views or religious beliefs.80 The internet and 

an individual’s long-term productive capacity. They 
can help build human capital throughout the life 
cycle, managing risks and increasing access to fi nan-
cial capital and remittances (sector focus 2; spotlight 
2; box 2.6). Since the poor are often most constrained 
by these factors, they stand to benefi t the most. 

Mobile money accounts can drive fi nancial inclu-
sion. In Sub-Saharan Africa, 12 percent of adults have 
mobile money accounts, compared with just 2 percent 
worldwide, and 45 percent of them have only a mobile 
money account.73 In Kenya, access to mobile money 
has helped in managing risk. Statistically comparable 
households that were not connected to M-Pesa, the 
mobile money service, experienced on average a 6–10 
percent reduction in consumption in response to sim-
ilar shocks.74 And biometric tools that reduce the costs 

Box 2.6 The impact of digital technologies on remittances

Online and mobile money transfer systems off er new 
cost-eff ective means of sending money. In Kenya, among the 
53 percent of adults who reported having sent remittances 
in the past year, 90 percent did so using a mobile phone.a 
Today, the average cost of sending money is 8 percent of 
the remitted value. Mobile technology can lower this cost 
by removing the need for the physical presence of staff  and 
customers, while ensuring timely and secure transactions. 

Digital technologies make domestic and international 
remittances cheaper. In Kenya, in 2008 shortly after M-Pesa 
entered the market, the cost of sending US$100 domesti-
cally was US$12 by MoneyGram, US$20 by bank wire, US$6 
by postal money order, and US$3 by bus, compared to 
US$2.50 by M-Pesa. In Cameroon, costs have declined by 
20 percent since mobile money entered the market. Prices 
have also fallen for international remittances. In the United 
Kingdom-Bangladesh corridor, the cost of sending US$200 
through Western Union fell from 12 percent in 2008 to 7 per-
cent in 2014 after the entry of digital competition. Between 
the United States and Mexico, Xoom charges 4.4 percent for 
online money transfers, down from Western Union’s 6.2 per-
cent. But the costs are still high for the poor, since they make 
many small transactions, which tend to be more expensive—
more than 5 percent for amounts less than US$5.

Across the board, traditional remittance service provid-
ers are building their own mobile and online capabilities, 

but international digital remittance services have yet to 
take off  in a substantial way. As of early 2012, only 20 
percent of 130 mobile banking operators worldwide off ered 
such services. The value of international remittances 
through mobile phones accounted for less than 2 percent 
of global remittances in 2013. 

Policy action is called for on several fronts. First is 
fostering innovative cross-border mobile money transfer 
technologies. That requires harmonizing banking and tele-
communications regulations to enable banks to participate 
in mobile money transfers, mobile companies to off er 
mobile money services without exclusivity agreements, 
and telecommunications fi rms to off er micro-deposit and 
savings accounts. It also requires simplifying regulations 
aimed at stopping money laundering and the fi nancing of 
terrorism for small-value transfers. And it requires ensuring 
that mobile distribution networks are open to multiple 
international remittance service providers. 

Second is increasing competition by eliminating telecom 
monopolies and exclusivity contracts. The experience in the 
United States-Mexico corridor shows how eliminating an 
exclusivity agreement between Western Union and Elektra 
can reduce prices. The interoperability of money transfer 
operators in remittance markets, as in Indonesia, Pakistan, 
Sri Lanka, and Tanzania, can reduce prices further.

Benefi ting consumers

My life became easy after I started using the internet. 
We can learn about any subject. It also helped me earn 

some income online by using freelancer sites. It helps me 
to fi nd health and beauty tips, to know current events and 

news. Through internet, I am able to stay connected with 
my friends and relatives.

—Young woman, microworker in Amazon 
Mechanical Turk, September 201495

Beyond earning opportunities, the internet offers 
many benefi ts to individuals as consumers, such as 
consumer convenience, expanded choice, better qual-
ity leisure time, and access to more knowledge. These 
benefi ts are consumer surplus, often not captured in 
GDP statistics (chapter 1). 

Digital technologies have thus enhanced welfare. 
Across 12 countries in Africa, 62 percent of people 
believe that their family is better off because of mobile 
phones, whereas only 21 percent disagree (17 percent 
are not sure). And 76 percent of people say mobile 
phones help save on travel time and costs. A majority 
(62 percent) also believe that mobile phones make 
them more secure (fi gure 2.11). The annual consumer 
surplus from Google search has been estimated at 

mobile phones also increase ties between migrants 
and those remaining in the home country.81

Improving access to information 
For the poor—who rely on mobile phones and often 
did not have access to a fi xed line—the biggest gains 
from digital technologies are likely to come from 
lower information and search costs. When making 
agriculture and labor market decisions, individuals 
often rely on informal sources, such as family and 
neighbors, or are left with no information: six in ten 
farmers in Boyaca, Colombia, do not know the prices 
in the capital city.82 Information technologies can 
inform workers about prices, inputs, or new technol-
ogies more quickly and cheaply, reducing friction and 
uncertainty, eliminating costly journeys, and reduc-
ing the risks of accidents and crime.83 In rural Niger, 
mobile phones reduced search costs by 50 percent.84 In 
turn, these benefi ts can reduce poverty. In rural Peru, 
mobile phones increased household real consumption 
by 11 percent between 2004 and 2009 and reduced pov-
erty by 8 percentage points.85 Mobile phones have also 
been found to reduce poverty in East Africa.86

Using technology for getting information on 
prices, weather, soil quality, and new technologies, 
and for coordinating with traders is becoming more 
common in agriculture (sector focus 1). Among fi sh-
ermen in the Indian state of Kerala, price information 
on mobile phones increased their profi ts 8 percent.87 
In Honduras, farmers who got market price informa-
tion via SMS reported an increase of 12.5 percent in 
prices received.88 In Argentina, the TRAZ.AR program 
to track animals increased profi ts per kilo of meat 
by 8 percent.89 In Pakistan, thanks to mobile phones, 
farmers shifted to more perishable but higher return 
cash crops, reducing postharvest losses from the 
most perishable crops by 21–35 percent.90 

Digital technologies make the largest difference 
when learning about information in distant markets or 
among disadvantaged farmers who face more informa-
tion constraints.91 An adult education program on using 
simple mobile phones in Niger increased internal labor 
migration and communication with migrants on labor 
market conditions in faraway regions.92 Gains and uses 
are more common when the information transmit-
ted is simple (as with prices or weather) rather than 
nuanced or diffi cult to convey (as in agricultural exten-
sion).93 Similarly, when information provided through 
technology is not relevant to local needs or when there 
are other constraints to economic activity—such as 
physical infrastructure or market structure—there are 
fewer or no gains, as in cases in Ethiopia and Nigeria.94

118 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

especially the case when the skill needs of new jobs 
are different from those of the old jobs. Beyond 
skill-upgrading, the challenge is to ensure that labor 
regulations facilitate and do not impede these tran-
sitions, and that social protection systems support 
workers when they are between jobs or not working 
regularly.

A second risk relates to the changing nature of 
work and the quality of internet-enabled jobs, such 
as microwork or jobs in the on-demand economy. 
These new forms of work provide workers and fi rms 
with fl exibility and improve effi ciency in the use of 
resources, but also come with a possible erosion of 
workers’ bargaining power and a lack of benefi ts, 
such as unemployment and health insurance or 
severance pay. In most cases, workers are considered 
independent contractors rather than employees. In a 
world where a job in a fi rm has been a pathway out 
of poverty because fi rms help share risks and provide 
capital, training, and technology,104 higher nonwage 
employment and this “new informality” may not be 
desirable. 

In developing countries, most work does not have 
these benefi ts, but especially in advanced countries, a 
balance is needed between effi ciency and protection 
to avoid a “race to the bottom” in terms of workers’ 
protections. Already, some microwork platforms and 
companies in the sharing economy provide insurance 
to workers and collect taxes, but these new develop-
ments in the labor market raise questions about 
traditional approaches for protecting workers. As dis-
cussed in chapter 5, this will probably require reforms 
not only in the new industries but also in the tradi-
tional ones to ensure that all workers—irrespective of 
their type of work contract—have basic protections. 

Perhaps the biggest risk from technological 
change, however, is that of widening income inequal-
ity. Although technologies are becoming widespread, 
the economic payoffs are not. The poor almost exclu-
sively use only mobile phones not connected to the 
internet. And even if they had access to the internet, 
they lack the skills to use it productively, with many 
still unable to read in the fi rst place. Positive impacts 
from using digital technologies—as with other tech-
nologies in the past century—are most likely to be 
captured by those already better off. In the United 
States, the adoption of advanced internet applications 
by fi rms led to substantial wage growth in the 6 per-
cent of counties that were the wealthiest, the most 
educated, and had an IT-intensive industry, with no 
effect elsewhere. Technology explains more than half 
the difference in wage growth between already well-
off counties and others.105 

US$500 per user, or US$150 billion for the 300 million 
users.96 In Estonia, digital signatures saved 20 min-
utes per signature.97 In Europe and the United States, 
consumers are willing to pay an average of US$50 a 
month for services that they now get for free on the 
internet.98 Large consumer surpluses have also been 
estimated for Brazil, China, and Mexico.99 

The rapid adoption of digital technologies, despite 
the costs, speaks for itself. In developing countries, 5 
percent of consumption goes into ICT, ranging from 
2.8 percent in the poorest households to 6.6 percent in 
the richest. In Africa, in addition to covering the cost 
of the hardware, the median phone owner spends 
more than 6 percent of his or her monthly income 
on mobile phones for calls and SMSs. The share is 
over 13 percent when accounting for people who own 
a mobile phone but do not work (mostly youth and 
spouses).100 

Benefi ts to consumers, while signifi cant, also 
come with risks. There are concerns about loss of pri-
vacy (chapter 4); information overload, as more and 
more information—some relevant and some not—is 
at our fi ngertips; and “overconnectivity,” since people 
are constantly online and reachable. The line between 
leisure and work is blurring. Digital technologies 
make leisure time more enjoyable and less costly, but 
also make workers more productive and allow them 
to work away from the offi ce. More than one-third 
of internet users in the United States report working 
longer hours because of technology, despite also feel-
ing more productive.101 

Labor market polarization
can lead to greater inequality
For workers, digital technologies generate new 
opportunities for employment and earnings, but 
also risks. One major risk is related to the speed of 
labor market changes and the destruction of jobs. 
Nonstandard forms of work and shorter job ten-
ures are likely to become more common, especially 
among youth. Internet access has been associated 
with more job-to-job fl ows, within the same fi rm and 
across employers.102 Large-scale automation can also 
accelerate job destruction, especially in developed 
countries. In addition to factory automation, there is 
automation of logistics and processing, digitization 
(data entry, publishing/printing), and self-service 
(document creation and management versus clerical 
support, or retail self-checkout).103 

These changes are good for aggregate productiv-
ity, as discussed in chapter 1, but can create challenges 
for individuals in the transition to new jobs. This is 



119EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES

The risk of rising inequality is evident in the 
declining shares of (routine) labor in national income, 
and the “polarization” of the labor market—that is, the 
declining employment in middle-skilled occupations 
relative to those in low- and high-skilled ones, and 
the heightened competition for low-skilled jobs. The 
concern is that the ladder to the middle class is pulled 
away as middle-skilled jobs disappear or are funda-
mentally transformed by digital technologies. 

Declining shares of labor in national income
Various factors, including technology, are shifting 
the distribution of income within countries away 
from routine labor and toward nonroutine labor and 
capital.106 In the past few decades, and especially after 
2000, the share of national income going to workers 
has fallen steadily in developed and many developing 
countries, driven by a falling share of income going 
to workers performing mostly routine tasks that fol-
low exact, well-defi ned procedures that can be easily 
automated (fi gures 2.12 and 2.13). In the United States, 
at the technological frontier, the share of income 
going to routine labor has fallen from 38 to 23 percent 
since the late 1960s, with a simultaneous rise in the 
nonroutine labor share from 24 to 34 percent. In Hon-
duras and Romania, in the 2000s, the income share of 
nonroutine labor increased from 28 to 32 and from 21 
to 25 percent, respectively, with declines in the share 
of routine labor.107 Where the labor share has fallen 
most, inequality has risen most (fi gure 2.14). A grow-
ing literature also links recent technological change 
to widening inequality.108

Yet declining labor shares in income and job polar-
ization are only symptoms. At their heart is the fact 
that digital technologies complement and augment 
some skills (and thus some workers) while replacing 
others. Since not everybody has the skills that go well 
with digital technologies, many can end up falling 
behind. Education and skills thus determine whether 
the promise of digital dividends is achieved, or 
whether technological advances translate into more 
inequality in a race between skills and technology.113 
Understanding this dynamic is critical: inequality 
will increase if more workers do not acquire the mod-
ern skills most in demand. But if education and train-
ing systems increase the supply of workers who meet 
the changes in skill demands, more workers would 
benefi t from technological change and inequality 
could decrease.  

The race between skills and 
technology
With rising computing power, combined with the 
connectivity and informational value of the internet, 
digital technologies are taking on more tasks. They 
are particularly good at performing tasks that follow 
explicit, codifi able procedures—that is, routine tasks. 
Some of these tasks are cognitive, such as processing 
payrolls, keeping books, or doing arithmetic. Others 
are manual or physical, requiring simple motions and 
muscle power, such as driving a train or assembling 
goods. These tasks can be easily automated. Nonrou-
tine tasks, by contrast, are less amenable to automa-
tion. Doing research, maintaining personal relation-
ships, and designing new products have proven hard 
to automate; so have manual tasks that involve signifi -
cant dexterity, such as cleaning and providing security 
services or personal care. Technology is even moving 
into areas once thought to be the exclusive domain of 
humans, such as driving or writing news articles.

So, the impact of digital technologies on jobs 
depends on the type of tasks and how technology 
either complements or substitutes workers in those 
tasks. A job comprises many tasks, each character-
ized by the skills most used to perform it (cognitive, 
socioemotional, or manual) and by how amenable it 
is to automation or codifi cation (table 2.3). In some 
cases, technology augments labor by complementing 
workers. Both the researcher and the hairdresser do 
tasks that are nonroutine and not easily programmed 
into a computer, but technology makes the researcher 
(who uses more advanced skills at work) much more 
productive, while barely affecting the hairdresser. 
This means that technology is skill-biased.

Employment polarization 
Declining labor shares coincide with the polariza-
tion of labor markets, most notably in high-income 
countries.109 Employment is growing in high-skilled, 
high-paying occupations (managers, professionals, 
technicians) and low-skilled, low-paying occupations 
(elementary, service, and sales workers). Middle- 
skilled, middle-paying occupations (clerks, plant 
and machine operators) are being squeezed (fi gure 
2.15). In high-income countries, on average, the share 
of routine labor in employment has fallen by about 
0.59 percentage points a year since 1995, or almost 12 
percentage points for the period. In the United States, 
local labor markets susceptible to automation due to 
specialization in routine task-intensive occupations 
have no net decline in employment, but they expe-
rience polarization in manufacturing and services.110 

There are signs that employment is also polarizing 
in a number of low- and middle-income countries. The 
average decline in the share of routine employment 
has been 0.39 percentage points a year, or 7.8 per-
centage points for the period. China is an exception, 
since the mechanization of agriculture increased the 
share of routine employment.111 Labor markets in low-
income countries such as Ethiopia, with a large share 
of employment in manual occupations, are also not 
polarizing; neither is employment in Mongolia or Latin 
American countries where other factors—such as a 
commodity-driven boom benefi ting low-skilled work-
ers—could play a larger role in shaping labor markets.112

cases, technology is labor-saving. The fundamental 
questions then become: To what extent are different 
occupations and countries’ labor markets affected 
by skill-biased and labor-saving digital technologies? 

In other cases, workers are in jobs that are routine, 
whether mostly manual or mostly cognitive, and 
are susceptible to automation and to seeing their 
jobs profoundly transformed or vanishing. In these

Note: The fi gures display changes in employment shares between circa 1995 and circa 2012 for countries with at least seven years of data. The classifi cation follows Autor 2014. High-skilled 
occupations include legislators, senior offi  cials and managers, professionals, and technicians and associate professionals. Middle-skilled occupations comprise clerks, craft and related trades 
workers, plant and machine operators and assemblers. Low-skilled occupations refer to service and sales workers and elementary occupations. For the United States, comparable data could 
be accessed only for a short period (2003–08); consistent with Autor (2014), the observed polarization is limited in this period, with most of it having taken place in earlier years.

to be a worker with only ‘ordinary’ skills and abilities 
to offer, because computers, robots, and other digital 
technologies are acquiring these skills and abilities at 
an extraordinary rate.”114 So, recent skill-biased tech-
nological change favors workers with advanced skills 
(table 2.4). Not only is overall employment moving 
toward occupations intensive in these more advanced 
skills, but even within a given job, skill demands are 
similarly shifting.

Because of this, two sets of skills are increasingly 
important in today’s labor markets: ICT skills and 

And what are the typical characteristics of workers in 
occupations that, in the absence of effective policies, 
stand to gain or lose from technological change?

Skill-biased technological change and the 
new digital divide
As Brynjolfsson and McAfee write in The Second 
Machine Age, “There’s never been a better time to be 
a worker with special skills or the right education, 
because these people can use technology to create 
and capture value. But there’s never been a worse time

tasks in which digital technologies make them more productive. Occupations in quadrants 1 and 2 are composed of many tasks that can be easily automated. 
Productivity in occupations in quadrant 3 is by and large not directly aff ected by digital technologies.

what will enable them to participate productively 
in life, as in Albania, Indonesia, Jordan, Malaysia, or 
Peru.117 About three-quarters of third-graders in Mali 
and Uganda cannot read.118 Beyond basic literacy, ICT 
skills are defi cient. In Africa, 7 in 10 people who do not 
use the internet say they just don’t know how to use 
it, and almost 4 in 10 say they do not know what the 
internet is.119 In high-income Poland and the Slovak 
Republic, one-fi fth of adults cannot use a computer.120

The use of ICT skills at work is unequal, but their 
importance is growing. On average, one-third of urban 
workers (and 20 percent of the bottom 40 in urban 
areas) in developing countries use a computer at work, 
for example (fi gure 2.18). This number is likely to raise 
quickly, with ICT use increasing as countries become 
richer and as work becomes more complex (fi gures 2.16 
and 2.19). 

Employers are looking for ICT skills, but cannot 
fi nd them. In the former Yugoslav Republic of Mac-
edonia, 43 percent of fi rms say ICT skills are very 
important for workers, but more than 20 percent say 
that workers lack them.121 Although the same workers 
lacking ICT skills often also lack other skills or face 
other barriers to employment, digital literacy limits 
their employment opportunities (fi gure 2.20). The 
use of digital technologies at work is associated with 

higher-order cognitive and socioemotional skills (box 
2.7). Since 2000, the ICT intensity of employment has 
increased by almost 10 percent in low- and middle-
income countries, almost twice as fast, on average, as 
in high-income economies (fi gure 2.16). The share of 
employment in occupations intensive in nonroutine 
cognitive and socioemotional skills has also increased 
in low- and middle-income countries, from 19 to 23 
percent. However, the decline in occupations inten-
sive in routine skills was even larger, from 50 to 44 
percent (fi gure 2.17).115 This is the driving force behind 
the polarization of labor markets. The new economy 
offers, therefore, a premium for ICT skills, strong 
foundational cognitive and socioemotional skills, 
and for more advanced nonroutine 21st-century skills 
such as critical thinking, complex problem-solving, 
creativity, and expert communication. In fact, work-
ers using these “new economy” skills and technology 
are better remunerated—by 25–40 percent—than 
their peers with the same level of education but per-
forming traditional tasks and jobs.116

Poor digital literacy limits the productive 
use of digital technologies 
It is hard to use the internet when, even among youth, 
more than half have a level of functional literacy below 

Box 2.7 Skills wanted: Key concepts

Beyond foundational cognitive skills, such as basic literacy 
and math, a well-educated worker in a modern economy 
needs to develop the following skills:

Nonroutine, higher-order cognitive skills. These refer to 
the ability to understand complex ideas, deal with complex 
information processing, adapt eff ectively to the work envi-
ronment, learn from experience, engage in various forms of 
reasoning, to overcome obstacles by critical thought.a More 
specifi cally, these include skills such as unstructured prob-
lem solving, and critical thinking, learning, and reasoning.

Technical skills, including information and communication 
technology (ICT) skills. Technical skills are those abilities 
needed to carry out one’s job, such as the ability to repair 
a water leakage for a plumber, the knowledge to operate 
a machine for a worker at a factory, or the knowledge to 

work with a software for a person at a bank.b They also 
include ICT skills. ICT skills refer to the eff ective application 
of ICT systems and devices, and range from ICT specialists 
who have the ability to develop, operate, and maintain ICT 
systems, to basic ICT users, who are competent users of 
the mainstream tools needed in their working life (e-mail, 
Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Word).c 

Nonroutine interpersonal, socioemotional skills. Socio-
emotional skills (also called soft or noncognitive skills) 
encompass a broad range of malleable skills, behaviors, 
attitudes, and personality traits that enable individuals to 
navigate interpersonal and social situations eff ectively.d 
These include grit or the perseverance to fi nish a job or 
achieve a long-term goal, working in teams, punctuality, 
organization, commitment, creativity, and honesty.

High-order cognitive and socioemotional 
skills are more important in the new 
economy
Technological progress is redefi ning the nature and 
content of jobs. Some of today’s jobs are new and 
require new skills—software publishers, data scientists, 

higher earnings, even after accounting for educa-
tional attainment. Across a sample of eight develop-
ing countries, the return associated with using ICT at 
work is around 40 percent.122 In Brazil, and focusing 
on workers most similar to one another, returns to 
internet use are about 10 percent.123

the weight of China in manufacturing supply chains, 
the decline in routine labor in the rest of the world 
could simply be the result of a shift of routine labor 
to China’s manufacturing sector. Between 2000 and 
2010, the share of employment in routine occupations 

enterprise mobile developers. Others have long existed 
but have been transformed. Consider, for example, the 
job description of an accountant in the 1970s and today. 
Specialized softwares have automated many of the 
accountant’s original tasks, shifting her job toward 
more advisory services and critical thinking. Employers 
now demand more “new economy” skills: that is, high-
order cognitive and socio emotional skills, as evidenced 
in countries as diverse as Brazil, Malaysia, and FYR 
Macedonia (fi gure 2.21).

At the aggregate level and within fi rms, new 
technologies substitute for workers performing 
routine tasks, while making skilled workers who 
execute nonroutine abstract tasks more productive.124 
Across 28 studies, more than half of the top fi ve skills 
demanded by employers are socioemotional, another 
30 percent are higher-order cognitive, and 16 percent 
are technical.125 High-order cognitive skills include 
reasoning, problem solving, and critical thinking, 
while socioemotional skills refer to behavior, person-
ality traits, and attitudes, such as grit, teamwork, self-
discipline, dependability, and leadership. These are 
things that are still hard for technology to replicate. 

These new economy skills pay off. Workers with 
strong cognitive and socioemotional skills in Arme-
nia, Georgia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and 
Vietnam are more likely to be employed and have 
better-quality jobs.126 In Vietnam, within a given 
industry, performing nonroutine analytical tasks car-
ries a 23-percent earnings premium, and interactive 
(that is, interpersonal) tasks a 13-percent premium, 
whether combined with routine or nonroutine tasks 
(fi gure 2.22). In  Armenia and Georgia, the premium 
for problem solving and learning new things is close 
to 20 percent.127 More generally, in 12 of 16 mostly 
developing countries, wages in nonroutine occu-
pations increased signifi cantly more than wages in 
routine occupations between 2005 and 2011.128

In addition to technological change, other factors 
help explain these global labor market trends. Trade, 
urbanization, structural transformation, and global-
ization fundamentally shape labor markets and in a 
number of cases are likely to be even more important 
than technology. In some Latin American countries, 
for example, commodity-driven economic booms 
have boosted low-wage earnings and show no polar-
ization at the aggregate level. Moreover, distinguish-
ing among factors is more diffi cult because they are 
related to one another.129 

Yet technological change seems to be an important 
part of the explanation. First, occupations most inten-
sive in the use of digital technologies are also most 
intensive in nonroutine cognitive and interpersonal 
skills (fi gure 2.23). Second, globalization and trade do 
not fully explain the observed polarization.130 Given

sector too, digital technologies are substituting for 
workers performing routine tasks. In the Indonesian 
Treasury, electronic budget planning and execution 
is linked to job redefi nitions and reassignments for 
around 5,000 workers (of 8,000) who previously pro-
cessed payments, disbursements, and cash manage-
ment.137 In Pakistan, the automation of systems in the 
central bank made 3,000 of 12,000 employees redun-
dant (mostly low-skilled staff). The savings boosted 
the salaries of remaining employees.138

Two-thirds of all jobs could be susceptible to auto-
mation in developing countries in coming decades, 
from a pure technological standpoint (fi gure 2.24). 
Estimates for the United States and Europe range 
between 50 and 60 percent of jobs.139 Given expected 
advances in artifi cial intelligence, falling ICT prices, 
and increased coverage of the internet, the potential 
for automation is clear. Rapid automation of a large 
number of jobs would be problematic: It may take 
time for new jobs to be created, and even if they are, 
retraining takes time and may be diffi cult. 

Yet, even if technologically feasible, large-scale net 
job destruction due to automation should not be a con-
cern for most developing countries in the short term. 
Even in the United States, on average, there were no net 
employment declines in local labor markets most sus-
ceptible to automation (that is, those specialized in rou-
tine, task-intensive occupations).140 New jobs and new 
tasks in existing occupations are created. Machines 
and digital technology are not perfect or even good 
substitutes for many tasks (at least not yet), especially 
those requiring adaptability, common sense, and cre-
ativity.141 The expansion of automated teller machines 
(ATMs) in banks went hand-in-hand with an expan-
sion of bank transactions, branches, and employment. 
Cashiers continue to do some of the things that ATMs 
do, but they also do other things, such as client support, 
where human interaction remains important.142

Full automation of jobs takes time, even in the 
developed world. In the United Kingdom, an exoge-
nous increase in ICT investment between 2000 and 
2004 led to a short-term increase in the demand for 
nonroutine skills, but only to the limited substitution 
of routine workers during that period.143 Why? Because 
it takes time to make the necessary organizational 
changes (chapter 1), and because labor reorganizations 
tend to happen in periods of recession rather than in 
booms.144 Not all disruptive technologies are adopted 
quickly, implemented fully, or yield immediate bene-
fi ts.145 Barriers to technology adoption, lower wages, 
and a higher prevalence of jobs based on manual dex-
terity in developing countries mean that automation 
is likely to be slower and less widespread there (see 
fi gure 2.24). But as wages rise, and in countries with 

in China rose from 19 to 27 percent (see fi gure 2.15, 
panel b). Yet manufacturing employment in China 
is also polarizing, for the increase in routine labor 
is explained by the mechanization of agriculture. 
Moreover, across most countries with relevant data, 
employment is polarizing even within services, sug-
gesting an additional effect in skill demand over and 
above what can be explained by trade or the structural 
transformation of developing economies.131 This evi-
dence is also consistent with the evidence for OECD 
countries linking changes in skills requirements to 
technological changes, even within occupations.132

Labor-saving technologies: Automation 
and job displacement
There is concern, especially in advanced countries, 
that technology is killing jobs and depressing 
wages.133 Manufacturers are using machines that 
substitute for workers in warehouses or auto plants. 
More than 200,000 industrial robots come into use 
each year, and that number is rising.134 Increasingly, 
automation is taking place in services.135 In call cen-
ters, technology can answer routine customer service 
requests. In retail, technology and “big data” suggest 
what to buy. Software is handling accounting, trans-
lations, and paralegal services. Travel agents have all 
but disappeared, with three-quarters of all travel in 
the United States now booked online.136 In the public

fostering entrepreneurship and improving produc-
tivity and the allocation of resources, have led in due 
time to more jobs elsewhere.

Will this time be different? Large factories and 
electrifi cation did lead, as now, to a polarization of 
employment by hollowing out the middle of the skill 
distribution. The share of employment of blue-collar 
workers in manufacturing fell from 39 percent in 1850 
to 23 percent in 1910, as new capital goods allowed 
factory owners to unbundle and simplify tasks that 
could now be performed by unskilled workers. Elec-
trifi cation increased the relative demand for workers 
intensive in clerical and managerial skills compared 
with manual and dexterity skills among white-collar 
workers. Among blue-collar workers, it increased the 
demand for manual workers relative to the demand 
for workers performing tasks intensive in dexterity 
needed to operate machines before electrifi cation.147 

Despite these similarities, the biggest difference 
from past waves of technological progress is that 
the polarization of the labor market today is affect-
ing both blue-collar and white-collar workers.148 It is 
probably easier for white-collar workers to transition 
to other white-collar jobs, but in the aggregate, there 
may be fewer well-paying jobs for a large and diverse 
pool of potentially dislocated workers. Even if all 
those jobs do not fully disappear—unlikely in a short 
period—they will be signifi cantly transformed. 

And here is where a second lesson from history 
is relevant. Individuals and governments adapted to 
technological change, but this process took time and 
required deep institutional changes in education, 

Technology, Automation, and Economic Progress, 
there were also concerns about automation in this 
wave of technological change. Unemployment fears 
have gone unrealized because new technologies, by

Box 2.8 Concerns about technological unemployment are not new 

We are being affl  icted with a new disease of which some readers may not yet have heard the name, 
but of which they will hear a great deal in the years to come—namely, technological unemployment. 

This means unemployment due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at 
which we can fi nd new uses for labour. 

—John Maynard Keynes
“Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,” 1931

The situation will have been made the more serious by the advances of automation. The world of A.D. 2014 will have 
few routine jobs that cannot be done better by some machine than by any human being. Mankind will therefore 

have become largely a race of machine tenders. Schools will have to be oriented in this direction . . . It is not only the 
techniques of teaching that will advance, however, but also the subject matter that will change. Even so, mankind will 

suff er badly from the disease of boredom . . . The lucky few who can be involved in creative work of any sort will be 
the true elite of mankind, for they alone will do more than serve a machine.

130 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

19th century in the United States led to an upskilling 
of employment as increases in middle-skilled sales 
and clerical employment compensated for the decline 
in blue-collar jobs. With electrifi cation, displaced 
workers typically moved to lower-skilled jobs at 
lower wages, such as truck drivers, but large increases 
in new middle-skill employment outweighed the 
decline in blue-collar employment.154 While the steam 
engine in the 18th century led to the disappearance 
of coachmen for horse-drawn carriages155 and to the 
substitution of workers in mining, in due time it also 
was at the center of steam-powered boats, locomo-
tives, and automobiles. Mechanics, road building and 
maintenance, and dealerships have created many jobs 
of diverse skill profi les ever since. 

Yet as a result of this process of job creation and 
destruction, technological change disrupts labor mar-
kets and can hurt individuals whose skills are substi-
tuted by technology, because they often do not have 
the skills required in many of the new jobs. Even for 
those who stay within the same occupations, jobs will 
be transformed, requiring modern skills. The speed of 
these changes appears to be accelerating, intensify-
ing creative destruction and the pace of labor market 
changes. 

Since digital technologies have different applica-
bility to different kinds of work, the extent of disrup-
tion across countries will refl ect differences in eco-
nomic and occupational structures. Numerical clerks 
or secretaries, often users of digital technologies, also 
perform many tasks that can be easily automated. 
Managers or software developers, by contrast, while 
intensively using digital technologies, also comple-
ment them well, so they are not easily substituted by 
machines. And for occupations that use little technol-
ogy, some are hard to automate, such as hairdressers, 
while others could be automated, such as assemblers 
(fi gure 2.25). 

More advanced economies can expect larger dis-
ruptions in the near future since they use more tech-
nology at work and are experiencing faster changes in 
skill requirements (fi gure 2.26).156 And while they have 
smaller shares of employment in routine occupations 
susceptible to automation, their higher wages make it 
easier for automation to be economically viable. Low- 
and middle-income countries can also expect substan-
tial disruptions, albeit with a time lag, given their rapid 
technological adoption and large number of workers 
in routine occupations. Their low skill base suggests 
important challenges ahead, however. In poorer coun-
tries, where wages are lower and technological adop-
tion is slower (chapter 1), the disruptions are likely to 
arrive more slowly, giving more time for policies and 
institutions to adapt. All this has implications for

The future of jobs
Be an expensive complement (stats knowhow) to 

something that’s getting cheaper (data).

—Hal Varian, Chief Economist, Google, 2014

Technological progress makes the jobs challenge 
more complex. Digital and mechanical technologies, 
and deindustrialization, mean that the manufactur-
ing sector is likely to generate fewer jobs than in the 
past, especially for unskilled workers.150 ICT manufac-
turing can be expected to create jobs, although mostly 
high-skilled and likely concentrated in specifi c coun-
tries, as now. Since manufacturing jobs have been an 
important source of better-paying jobs as workers 
move out of agriculture, this is an important devel-
opment. The service sector is also increasingly being 
automated. Of particular concern are jobs that have 
so far actually grown thanks to digital technologies, 
such as low- and middle-skilled call center jobs. 
Employment in the ICT service industry, even more 
than its manufacturing counterpart, is expected to 
grow, but also among higher-skilled workers in lead-
ing countries. 

Future employment growth is likely to come from 
jobs that cannot be fully or partially automated, largely 
outside the ICT industry. New jobs are also likely to 
emerge in the digital economy—in the analysis of data 
such as data scientists, in the development and main-
tenance of apps and other software, and in support ser-
vices. New opportunities will also arise in ICT-enabled 
services, such as the on-demand economy. But the 
signifi cance for employment generation, especially in 
most developing countries, is likely to be small.

The potential for employment creation lies in the 
rest of the economy, as digital technologies allow 
businesses to expand. Among the low-skilled, some 
services that must be delivered face-to-face or require 
awareness and situational adaptability (housekeep-
ers, hairdressers) are likely to grow. Among the 
high-skilled, occupations will rely on modern skills 
involving creativity and social interactions. Some 
observers call this the polarization in “the high-tech, 
high-touch” economy.151 

Although impossible to predict in advance, jobs are 
likely to arise in new industries and occupations. New 
industries arising from digital technologies since 
2000 account for only 0.5 percent of employment in 
the United States,152 and there is evidence of (young) 
skilled workers having to take on less-skilled jobs.153 
But historically, economies have been able to create 
enough jobs through technological change. The initial 
labor market polarization caused by factories in the 



131EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES

changes in labor demand have in turn implications 
for earnings. But employment polarization does not 
necessarily mean wage polarization. 

Three interrelated factors mediate the impact of 
digital technologies on earnings:

•  Complementarity with technology. Workers in jobs 
that use and complement technology are likely 
to see both an increase in employment and an 
increase in earnings because of higher productivity. 
This is the case for workers who use nonroutine 
cognitive skills and ICT skills. Workers in routine 
occupations, however, will see less demand for 
their skills, bringing down both their employment 
and their wages.

•  Product demand. If workers produce goods or ser-
vices that consumers keep buying as they get richer 
or as the price declines, increases in productivity 
can translate into increases in wages. This is often 
the case for workers with nonroutine skills pro-
ducing, say, knowledge, management expertise, or 
medical services. If not, increases in productivity 
can lead to lower employment and earnings in that 
sector because fewer workers can satisfy demand, 
as for many agricultural goods. 

whether countries need not just to develop modern 
skills among children and youth, but also to come up 
with a strategy for the retraining and lifelong learning 
of the current stock of (older) workers.

The challenge is to start reforms today to max-
imize the digital dividends and to prepare for any 
disruptions. Even if expected labor market changes 
are similar in Malaysia and South Africa, Poland and 
Turkey, or Finland and Italy, skill systems vary widely 
and not all are prepared to equip workers with skills 
that complement technology. This process needs to 
start very early in life, and education and training 
systems are notoriously diffi cult to change. So, any 
reform takes many years to have effects, which is why 
there is a race between skills and technology. Some 
skill systems are well-positioned, but for many others, 
skills—and hence, people—are losing the race.

Making the internet work for everyone
To design policy responses to technological change, it 
is important to understand who the changes are likely 
to affect the most, and how the process plays out both 
in terms of employment and earnings. As discussed, 
employment is likely to polarize, with routine occupa-
tions losing ground to nonroutine occupations. These

132 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

The young, the better educated, and those already 
better off are most likely to benefi t from digital tech-
nologies—with older workers, those with less educa-
tion, and the poor falling behind. The former group is 
more likely to have more advanced skills—especially 
cognitive and ICT skills—regardless of their occu-
pation or work status.158 In addition, these groups 
are disproportionally likely to be in, or to move into, 
occupations that pay well and are likely to grow in the 
future—those intensive in nonroutine skills (fi gure 
2.27).159 Recent evidence from the United States shows 
that there has been a marked decline in the rate at 
which workers transition into routine employment 
(particularly among the young) but that women and 
those with higher education levels have found it 
easier to adjust to these changes by moving into the 
high-paying, nonroutine cognitive jobs.160 

A big challenge for policy makers, especially in rap-
idly aging societies, is managing skill obsolescence. 
Recall that the surge in the demand for new economy 
skills has been concentrated among young workers 
(see fi gure 2.21). Digital technologies accelerate the 
depreciation of skills and work experience, affecting 
especially older workers (box 2.9). But obsolescence is 
not destiny or the same for all types of skills. Most liter-
ature argues that younger workers have a comparative 
advantage in tasks where problem solving, learning, 
and speed are important (“fl uid” abilities), and older 
workers have an advantage when experience and ver-
bal abilities matter more (“crystallized” abilities).161 But 
evidence from Germany shows that workers in their 
50s experienced a more rapid growth in tasks intense 
in fl uid cognitive skills than those in their 30s.162 Box 
2.10 examines the gender impacts in more depth.

A policy agenda
Digital technologies improve overall welfare and can 
reduce poverty, but without complementary policies, 
many benefi ts can go unrealized and inequality can 
increase. To capitalize on the benefi ts—and to do 

•  Labor supply. The higher the skill requirements for a 
job, the more diffi cult it is for new workers to enter 
that market. So, higher demand for workers would 
translate into higher wages. If, however, it is easy to 
retrain for a new job or skill requirements are low, 
there can be downward pressure on wages because 
of increased competition. Workers in nonroutine 
cognitive occupations are likely to see their higher 
productivity rewarded as higher earnings because 
entry barriers are high. But low-skilled workers 
in nonroutine manual occupations are likely to 
see their earnings fall over time as middle-skilled 
workers in routine occupations are displaced and 
start competing for the available jobs in low-paying 
occupations (table 2.5).157

Therefore, the main winners from technological 
change will have and use new economy skills and gain 
employment in nonroutine cognitive occupations.

Note: Labor market disruption is an index that goes from 0 (no disruption) to 1 (highest disruption). It is 
the standardized summation of two components, equally weighted: the probability of an average job 
being computerized (Frey and Osborne 2013, and adjusting for adoption lags), and the intensity of ICT use 
at work. For each country, the ICT intensity of employment corresponds to the average for countries at 
the next level of development, to be more forward-looking. The quality-adjusted years of education are 
constructed by adjusting average years of education for each country with the World Economic Forum’s 
quality-of-education indicator. For example, if a country has, on average, 10 years of education and 
scores 3.5 on the indicator (which ranges from 0 to 7), its quality-adjusted years of education are 5.  See 
Monroy-Taborda, Moreno, and Santos, forthcoming, for the WDR 2016. GDP = gross domestic product.

in seizing the opportunities that the internet gener-
ates (chapter 5). 

The most crucial element is skills development. 
A modern economy requires workers with mod-
ern skills. For people to become online workers 
and traders, farmers to use technology to become 
more  productive, or for workers to access modern, 

so without leaving people behind—internet access 
(chapter 4) needs to be complemented with an “ana-
log” policy agenda. In addition to supporting entre-
preneurship and innovation to expand businesses 
and job opportunities, this agenda should ensure that 
education and training systems, labor regulations, 
and social protection institutions support all workers

the returns to experience, especially among older workers. 

In Mexico, as in other Latin American countries, wage 
inequality has declined since 2000. A declining skill pre-
mium has been one of the drivers of this trend because the 
wages of the low-skilled rose and those of the high-skilled 
fell. The average hourly wage for college-educated workers 
fell 2 percent a year between 2001 and 2014. 

Why have high-skilled wages declined in Mexico, when 
in most countries, especially outside of Latin America, 
returns to tertiary education continue to rise (despite 
increasing educational attainment everywhere)? It could 
simply be that the supply of educated workers has out-
paced demand for them. But there are three alternative 

explanations for the decline in relative wages of skilled 
workers: low-quality tertiary educated graduates, a skills 
mismatch among young workers, or skills obsolescence 
among older workers.

New research fi nds that the fall in the skills premium is 
driven at least partly by skills obsolescence among older 
workers. First, the earnings of the oldest cohort, above age 
50, declined fastest (40 percent during the period). But for 
the youngest cohort—aged between 23 and 30—earnings 
increased. Second, earnings start to decline at a younger 
age over time. If age is a proxy for work experience, this 
means that, among older workers, the return to education 
and the return to experience are falling. This could be evi-
dence of an accelerated skills obsolescence.

Box 2.10 Digital technologies and economic opportunities: A gender lens 

Digital technologies can empower women economically 
and socially. Because social norms and time and mobility 
constraints are often more severe for women than for men, 
women could benefi t greatly from technology.a

Digital technologies can reduce gender gaps in labor 
force participation by making work arrangements more 
fl exible, connecting women to work, and generating new 
opportunities in online work, e-commerce, and the sharing 
economy. In Elance, a platform for online work now part of 
Upwork, 44 percent of workers are women, compared to 
an average of 25 percent in the nonagricultural economy 
globally. Business process outsourcing in India employs 
more than 3.1 million workers, 30 percent of them women. 
Four in ten online shop owners on Alibaba are women. 
Moreover, technology can help improve women’s access 
and accumulation of productive assets. The digitization of 
land registries, for example, can be particularly benefi cial 
for women.b These improved opportunities, in turn, can 
increase investments in young girls’ human capital.c

Technology-driven shifts in skills demand can reduce 
wage gaps, especially among the better educated. Women 
are well positioned to gain from a shift in employment 
toward nonroutine occupations, and away from physical 
work.d In Germany and the United States, the use of digital 
technologies at work explains a signifi cant share of the 
increase in female labor force participation and employ-
ment in the past few decades.e Similar changes have taken 
place in Brazil, Mexico, and Thailand, and also explain 
a large part of the reduction in gender wage gaps.f New 
technologies level the playing fi eld, particularly among the 
better educated, who take on jobs that use their compara-
tive advantage in nonphysical work.g Recent evidence from 
the United States shows that it is the better educated and 
women who are able to get the high-paying jobs intensive 
in nonroutine skills as middle-skilled jobs shrink.h 

Digital technologies also impact women’s voice and 
agency. Increased access to information can aff ect gender 
norms and aff ect aspirations, often faster than expected.i 
Social media is an additional outlet for women to participate 
in public discussions and voice their opinions (spotlight 
3). “My Dress, My Choice” in Kenya, a social media move-
ment against female violence that mobilized thousands of 
Kenyans, including through street protests, eventually led 
to changes in relevant laws.j Some of the new innovations 
of the digital economy, such as digital payments, mobile 
money, and taxi sharing rides, can also increase women’s 

agency and control over economic resources, and their 
safety. For example, in Niger, greater privacy and control 
of mobile transfers, compared to manual cash transfers, 
shifted intrahousehold decision making in favor of women, 
the recipients of the transfer.k

But in many countries, gender gaps in technology use, 
and in working in the ICT sector, remain vast. Over 1.7 billion 
women in low- and middle-income countries do not own 
mobile phones. Women in those countries are 14 percent 
less likely to own a mobile phone than men, on average. 
Women in South Asia are 38 percent less likely to own a 
phone than men.l Barriers to access can be particularly 
salient in the case of the internet, especially in poor and 
remote localities where access is predominantly outside 
the home, and where social norms for socializing or safety 
concerns can become a barrier.m In Africa, for example, 
women are 50 percent less likely to use the internet than 
men.n In addition to ownership and access, lack of control 
over the use of the technology can be an additional barrier 
for women. In the Arab Republic of Egypt and in India, for 
example, 12 percent of women stated that they did not 
access the internet more often because they did not think it 
was appropriate, and more than 8 percent did not access it 
more often because family or friends would disapprove.o In 
the labor market, women are also much less likely to work 
in the information and communication technology (ICT) 
sector or in ICT occupations, which are well paid. These lat-
ter gaps partly refl ect women’s low participation in science, 
technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education, itself 
a product of early gender-based biases in formal and infor-
mal education (chapter 5). 

Even with gender parity in ownership, access, and 
control over digital technologies, gains are not automatic. 
They need to be complemented with analog changes that 
address the underlying barriers to women’s employment, 
voice, and agency. In rural South Africa, for example, mobile 
phones increased employment mostly among women, as 
long as they did not have large child care responsibilities.p 
In addition, technologies can have gender-diff erentiated 
eff ects, as shown throughout this chapter. This suggests 
that interventions around digital technologies would 
become more eff ective if they were more gender-informed, 
including by having women participate early on in the 
design of interventions and of the technologies themselves.

Moreover, by circumventing, rather than eliminating, 
some of the barriers to employability faced by women,

taking a wide perspective, it is also used to include

better-paying jobs, skills need to be upgraded. Current 
and future workers need to develop the lifelong cog-
nitive, technical, and socioemotional skills required 
of a well-educated worker in the 21st century. Work-
ers also need to be capable of processing the ever-
increasing information available on the internet. 
Building these skills requires actions affecting all 
relevant environments for learning: families, schools, 
universities, training systems, and fi rms. Given the 
speed of technological changes, these skills will also 
require constant updating throughout the life cycle as 
workers prepare for careers that last more than one 
job. Digital technologies themselves can help (sector 
focus 2 and chapter 5). Complementary reforms are 
also needed in tax policy, social protection, and labor 
market institutions to facilitate the transition of 
workers from old economy jobs to new economy jobs, 
and address the distributional consequences of the 
digital revolution.

the internet could actually delay necessary reforms. For 
example, home-based work could help connect women 
to work in environments where social norms or child care 
responsibilities are a barrier to women working outside 
the home. But if working outside the home continues to be 

seen as unacceptable for women or if there is no availability 
of aff ordable child care, technology could end up delaying 
fundamental reforms. Addressing these underlying con-
straints remains key to the gender and overall economic 
agenda.

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

Educational policy makers and planners face a per-
sistent challenge related to the potential use of infor-
mation and communication technologies (ICTs) in 
remote, low-income communities around the world: 
most products, services, usage models, expertise, and 
research related to ICT use in education come from 
high-income contexts and environments. One conse-
quence is that “solutions” enabled by technology are 
imported and “made to fi t” in environments that are 
often much more challenging. Sometimes this works; 
sometimes it doesn’t. The One Laptop per Child proj-
ect in Peru provided hundreds of thousands of pieces 
of low-cost computing equipment to students in 
rural schools. But early research found no evidence 
of increased learning in math or language.1 This is 
one high-profi le example of the diffi culties faced in 
introducing hardware-centric educational technology 
projects conceived in highly developed environments 
into less developed places without suffi cient atten-
tion to local contexts. 

An alternate approach would consider how to inno-
vate using existing technology that is already avail-
able in a local environment. In addition to exploring 
the uses of new technologies, it might also be useful 
to ask, How can we innovate using what is already avail-
able? In many low-resource communities, the best 
technology is the one that people already have, know 
how to use, and can afford. In most circumstances, 
this is the mobile phone. The SMS Story project in 
rural Papua New Guinea is one example of an inno-
vative approach to using a “new” technology in ways 
that meet local needs and that the original designers 
of the technologies may not have dreamed of. 

Few educational environments are more challeng-
ing than those found in remote locales in the Pacifi c 

island nation of Papua New Guinea. These areas are 
characterized by poverty, low levels of literacy, geo-
graphic remoteness, linguistic diversity (over 800 
languages are spoken across the island nation), low 
teacher quality, and a lack of teaching and learning 
materials. Many rural classrooms have few books—
and some none at all. Few students read at grade level, 
and teachers often do not know what materials they 
are meant to cover in a given week—or how to teach 
them effectively. Most of them do, however, have 
mobile phones.

The SMS Story project demonstrates that it is pos-
sible to orient and motivate teachers in useful ways 
using technologies already at hand. It sent daily text 
message stories and teaching tips to teachers as an aid 
to help improve student reading. The result? Teachers 
were reminded and motivated to teach reading every 
single day. While reading comprehension did not 
noticeably improve, the intervention halved the num-
ber of children who could not read anything. While 
this was hardly a “silver bullet” solution, SMS Story 
offers one model for using connected technologies 
in simple ways to help address some long-standing, 
seemingly intractable challenges facing educators 
in rural schools in Papua New Guinea. While no one 
would suggest that these results imply that these 
schools do not need books, such simple interventions 
can be modestly transformative in ways that are 
inclusive, effi cient, and scalable.2 

The evidence base for investments in educational 
technologies in middle- and low-income countries 
is weak—but growing. Until recently, there were 
few rigorous randomized studies on the impact of 
investments in educational technologies that could 
inform related policy decisions; now there are almost 
two dozen. In addition, a signifi cant body of practical 
evidence has also been collected based on experiences

in middle- and low-income countries. Characteristics 
of many successful technology-enabled educational 
projects in such places include:

•  A focus on the “guided use” of technology, and not 
just providing tools for general use; 

• Providing relevant curricular materials; 
• The shared use of devices in school settings; 
•  Attention to pedagogy, teacher support, and 

development; 
•  Using technologies in ways that are supplemental 

and practical; and
•  Using evaluation mechanisms that go beyond 

outputs.3

A number of key challenges remain that inhibit 
the potential positive impact of new technologies 
on teaching and learning. Foremost among these are 
a pernicious focus on providing technology alone, 
and a related belief that educational challenges can 
be overcome simply by providing more and better 
devices and connectivity. The so-called Matthew 
Effect of educational technology holds that those 
most likely to benefi t from the use of new technol-
ogies in educational settings are those who already 
enjoy many privileges related to wealth, existing lev-
els of education, and prior exposure to technology in 
other contexts. Policies that neglect to consider this 
phenomenon may result in projects that exacerbate 
existing divides within an education system, and 
indeed within larger society.

Education challenges cannot be overcome simply 
by providing more and better ICT devices and con-
nectivity. There is sometimes talk that technology will 
replace teachers. In reality, experience from around the 
world demonstrates that, over time, the role of teachers 
becomes more central—and not peripheral—as a result 
of the introduction of new technologies.4 That said, 
while technology will not replace teachers, teachers who use 
technology will replace those who do not. These teachers, in 
addition to having a suite of basic technology-related 
skills, will be asked to take on new, often more sophis-
ticated duties and responsibilities in ways that will 
challenge the existing capacity of many educational 
systems to prepare and support teachers over time.

Understanding the local education challenge 
and context before proposing a technology-driven 
solution is a critical fi rst step. A number of recent 
articles in the popular press have proclaimed many 
high-profi le efforts to use new technologies within 
educational systems, including variations of the One 
Laptop per Child initiative in countries around the 
world, as “failed experiments.” The speed of techno-
logical change almost always outpaces the ability of 

educational planners to keep up. When it comes to 
the use of technology in education, educational sys-
tems may therefore be fated to exist effectively in a 
state of permanent experimentation. That said, exper-
iments should, by defi nition, teach something. A sad 
fact of too many experiments in educational tech-
nology use around the world remains that they have 
implemented technological “solutions” to problems 
that have not been well understood. If you are pointed 
in the wrong direction, technology may help you get 
there more quickly. At a fundamental level, many of 
these efforts are not really failures of technology, but 
rather a result of poor planning and an inability to 
learn from failure and adapt. As such, they are not a 
result of technology failures, but rather human ones.

148 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

When considering another person in the world, 
a friend of your friend knows a friend of 

their friend, on average. 

—Lars Backstrom and colleagues, 
“Four Degrees of Separation” (2012)

That remarkable statement cannot yet be applied to 
everyone in the world, but a 2011 study showed that 
it pertained to the active users of Facebook—some 721 
million people at the time, and their 69 billion friend-
ships.1 The average of 3.7 intermediary links between 
randomly selected people in the global Facebook pop-
ulation contrasts with the 5.7 links between Nebraska 
residents and Bostonians documented in Milgram’s 
famous “six degrees of separation” study from 1967.2 
From 2011 to early 2015, the network’s user base had 
doubled, with each user having an average of 338 
“friends.”  This is more than twice Dunbar’s number, 
which asserts that 150 is the maximum number of 
stable relationships that humans can retain.3 These 
statistics show some of the ways in which social net-
works are expanding and changing with the advent of 
social media on the internet.

Social networks are fundamental to human soci-
ety. They constitute the fabric of relationships that 
support trust, reputation, and social cohesion. For 
instance, a debtor may be less likely to default on a 
loan if both she and her lender share a dense network 
of mutual friends. Social networks exert peer pressure 
on behavior and shape aspirations for work, marriage, 
and consumption. By defi ning social boundaries, 
they can be instruments both of social inclusion and 
exclusion. They also are a conduit of gossip, slander, 

harassment, bullying, and infectious disease, as well 
as job opportunities and innovative ideas.

One of the clearest channels by which networks 
affect economic development is the diffusion of 
innovations. Networks provide the medium through 
which people learn of an innovation. Adoption by 
a trusted person then initiates a chain reaction of 
adoptions through the network, accelerating as peer 
pressure bears on laggards. The impacts can be large. 
An experimental study on the adoption of weather 
insurance (an unfamiliar innovation) by Chinese 
farmers found that, while attending an intensive 
information session on the product boosted take-up 
rates by 43 percent, merely having a friend who 
attended such a session had almost half that effect, 
and was equivalent in impact to a 15-percent subsidy.4 
Impacts were larger when those initially informed 
were more central to the network. Social networks are 
also important channels for transmission of health 
behavior, and there is a tendency for people with poor 
health behavior to clump in networks isolated from 
those with healthier behaviors.5

Enter the internet, in the form of Facebook, 
LinkedIn, and Twitter based in the United States; 
Sina Weibo and WeChat in China; VK in the Russian 
Federation; and many other social media platforms 
designed to encourage the formation of social links. 
There are many types of social media, but social net-
working sites and micro blogs are most relevant in 
the context of social and economic development. A 
simple typology is based on whether communication 
is directed at specifi c recipients, and whether ties are 
explicit (prompted by invitation, acceptance, or refer-
ence within a social network) or not (table S3.1). 

Social scientists distinguish between weak ties and 
strong ties in social networks. Weak ties exist between

people who could be considered acquaintances rather 
than friends. Such ties can be useful to transmit novel 
information about technologies or other useful and 
new knowledge, since information comes from peo-
ple with whom interaction is more sporadic. Strong 
ties, between people who have more in common 
(family, friends, or close colleagues), are a source of 
emotional support but may be less important as a 
source of novel information, since members of a close 
group are likely to have the same information. Strong 
ties within “closed” groups with relatively weak ties 
to outsiders can be important, as this may increase 
trust and facilitate coordination, in part because of the 
high reputational cost of bad or unproductive behav-
ior within the group. Social capital is likely higher in 
groups linked by strong ties. Social networking sites 
are considered more important for developing strong 
ties, while microblogs foster weak ties. One observer 
compared Facebook to a cocktail party where you are 
surrounded by people you know and like, while Twit-
ter is like someone standing at a street corner with a 
megaphone shouting “Check this out!”

Social media platforms change the dynamics of 
social networks in at least three ways. First, they 
encourage expansion of the scope and density of net-
works, since links are very easy to form, regardless of 
physical distance. Second, they speed the diffusion of 
information between links. Third, they increase the 
visibility of opinions and some behaviors across the 
network. Research on the development impacts of 
social media is still at an early stage, but there is some 
evidence on how they affect economic development, 
how they prompt changes in behavior, how they help 
in emergency situations, and how they can increase 
people’s voice.6

Social media and economic 
development
Social media act as a channel for communication 
and information exchange, thus reducing transaction 
costs for economically benefi cial, as well as potentially 
harmful, interactions. Research in Nigeria showed 

that social media supported microfi nance by facilitat-
ing information fl ow to the poor and small business 
owners. 

A study of a group of women in Jakarta showed 
that their use of social media encouraged their entre-
preneurial activities and helped them fi nd customers 
for their products, although the specifi c context of this 
study—they were middle-class urban residents—may 
not be transferable to every other place. Social media 
sites can also be a source for economically useful data, 
including about consumer preferences and complaints. 

Social media and 
behavioral change
Commercial ventures take advantage of the features 
of social media—often for marketing purposes—as 
they exploit the huge amounts of information about 
personal preferences, buying habits, and relation-
ships. But online behavior can also be channeled 
in ways that are consistent with development. For 
instance, individuals can be encouraged to share their 
progress in meeting exercise or learning goals with 
their social network, thus using peer pressure and 
competition to maintain motivation. Experiments 
show that, in principle, networks can be manipulated 
to encourage desired outcomes. For instance, an 
online experiment showed that when participants 
were networked in tight clusters, a promoted health 
practice diffused more quickly than in a loosely struc-
tured network.7 

Social media and 
emergencies
Before, during, and after natural disasters or other 
urgent crises, social media platforms are useful for 
disseminating information and as a management 
tool, such as to channel requests for assistance. The 
key contribution is that information does not just 
fl ow one way from offi cials to citizens as through 
radio or television, but in all directions between offi -
cials, citizens, and the private sector.

Social media and 
community voice
Recent events such as the Occupy Wall Street move-
ment or the Arab Spring have raised questions about 
the role of social media in facilitating social change. 
Some analysts think social media played a central 
role, including by spreading democratic ideals across 
borders. They also make movements less dependent 
on charismatic leaders or ideologues. Others are more 
skeptical, arguing that revolutions occurred long 
before social media, and the apparent inability to 
form strong leadership through such tools can reduce 
the chances for lasting change. An additional issue is 
the role of social media in spreading false information 
or to correct misinformation. The intensity of a crisis 
changes the quality of infor mation shared on Twitter. 
And, interestingly, fact-checking conversations on 
Twitter are more likely to occur between strangers 
than between friends. Whether social media can 
encourage collective fact-checking will infl uence its 
role in social learning in the context of social and eco-
nomic development.

There is still much to learn about the role that 
social media can play in development. One important 
lesson is that their impact is country-specifi c and 
context-specifi c. Variations in access to technology 
and education obviously matter. But there are also 
large variations in how people use social media and 
how they share information. People will more likely 
share information broadly if they think they can 
infl uence events or policy. There is evidence that peo-
ple in more authoritarian countries are less likely to 
forward (re-tweet) information. 

Finally, general-purpose social media platforms 
may have less of an impact in poor communities 
compared with more targeted social media interven-
tions. Examples in other parts of the Report show that 
purpose-built platforms set up by public institutions 
or development agencies as part of program deliv-
ery may be more effective. They could, for instance, 
deliver extension services to farmers or connect par-
ticipants with leaders to foster aspirational change.

ing communication costs through digital platforms, 
they enable citizens to connect with one another at 
unprecedented scale, fostering citizen voice and col-
lective action.

But the impact of these mechanisms on capability 
and empowerment depends on the strength of gov-
ernment institutions. Institutions are the formal and 
informal rules that shape the incentives and behav-
iors of politicians, government offi cials, and citizens. 
Strong institutions create incentives for politicians 
to work toward the public good and for bureaucrats 
to be accountable to those politicians. Digital tech-
nologies, aligned with the incentives of politicians, 
government offi cials, and service providers, can thus 
be highly effective in improving outcomes. By con-
trast, politicians in clientelist political institutions 
are largely accountable to a small set of elites and 
reject digitally enabled reforms that hurt vested inter-
ests; instead, they use these technologies for greater 
control. And patronage-based bureaucracies resist 
e-government advances that would reduce discretion 
and rent-seeking. This misalignment between digital 
technologies and weak or unaccountable institutions 
creates the twin risks of increasing elite control 
and wasting scarce public resources on ineffective 
e-government projects. 

Why do these institutional constraints persist? 
Digital technologies, particularly social media, have 
uncovered egregious abuses of public authority and 
triggered both virtual and physical citizen protests 
around scandals. But they haven’t sustained collective 
action around failures of service delivery. Service 
delivery problems are more diffi cult to monitor and 
attribute to specifi c government offi cials, and only 
rarely become salient in fl ashpoint events that trig-
ger protests—like the excessive use of force by police. 
And they cannot be improved by one-off actions that 
change a bad policy or pass a new law. Addressing ser-
vice delivery failures requires sustained citizen voice 
through effective offl ine mobilization by civil society 

Have digital technologies made governments more 
willing and able to deliver services to their citizens? 
Not yet. Governments have invested heavily in dig-
ital technology over the past two decades, and these 
efforts have made it easier in many countries for busi-
nesses to fi le taxes, and for the poor to get an offi cial 
identity allowing them to receive welfare payments 
and vote in elections. Digital technologies have also 
enabled governments to receive regular feedback 
from service users, improving service quality. But 
all too often the successes are isolated—limited to a 
few activities, sectors, or locales. Many investments 
in e-government fail to have any impact other than 
wasting scarce fi scal resources. Digital channels 
for mobilizing citizens to pressure policy makers to 
become more responsive have had little effect. And 
the new technologies have enhanced the capacity 
of unaccountable governments for surveillance and 
control. In sum, digital technologies have helped will-
ing and able governments better serve their citizens, 
but they have not yet empowered citizens to make 
unwilling governments more accountable. 

Effi cient service delivery requires a capable gov-
ernment that can implement policies and spend pub-
lic resources effectively. It also requires an empow-
ered citizenry able to hold politicians and policy 
makers to account so that governments serve citizens 
and not themselves or a narrow set of elites.1 Digital 
technologies can strengthen government capability 
and empower citizens through three mechanisms 
(fi gure 3.1). They overcome information barriers and 
promote participation by citizens in services and in 
elections. They enable governments to replace some 
factors used for producing services through the auto-
mation of routine activities, particularly discretion-
ary tasks vulnerable to rent-seeking, and to augment 
other factors through better monitoring, both by 
citizens through regular feedback on service quality 
and within government through better management 
of government workers. And by dramatically lower-

than in transactional government-to-citizen and 
government-to-business services like e-fi ling of taxes 
and portals that enable citizens to access a variety of 
services from one website (fi gure 3.2). Policy priorities 
are also evident in cross-national patterns of the 
detailed indexes of different e-government systems 
constructed for this report.3 The level of e-government 
unsurprisingly increases with per capita income, 
but the gap between high-income and low-income

organizations. But in the absence of willing and able 
governments to partner with, civil society initiatives 
often remain small, with limited citizen interest or 
impact. 

The dependence of digital technology on initial 
institutional conditions, though, varies by service 
and activity. For services and activities based on 
more routine tasks that are easy to monitor, digital 
technologies can improve outcomes rapidly and 
signifi cantly—even when institutions are relatively 
weak. In effect, the technology substitutes for the 
institutions, as with cash transfers, licensing and 
registration services, and monitoring elections, all 
much improved by digital technologies in many 
low-income countries. But for services and activities 
that require more discretion from workers and are 
hard to monitor, the quality of institutions is much 
more important, and digital technologies have an 
incremental effect. The technology only comple-
ments or augments the initial institutions, as with 
teaching, health care, and organizational manage-
ment, where digital technologies have an impact 
only if institutions are strong. 

Given the importance of institutions for service 
delivery, the policy agenda is to use digital technol-
ogies to strengthen institutions. The variation in 
interaction of institutions and digital technologies 
by service and activity, and the considerable hetero-
geneity of institutions even within countries, can 
guide policy and open many possibilities for service 
improvements in even the most challenging con-
texts—in short, for digital dividends. 

Connected governments
The advent of the internet in the mid-1990s triggered 
the rapid diffusion of e-government systems to auto-
mate core administrative tasks, improve the delivery 
of public services, and promote transparency and 
accountability. By 2014, all 193 member-states of the 
United Nations had national websites: 101 enabled 
citizens to create personal online accounts, 73 to fi le 
income taxes online, and 60 to register a business.2 In 
all, 190 countries had automated government fi nan-
cial management, 179 had automated customs, and 
159 had automated tax systems. And 148 countries 
had digital identifi cation schemes, although only 20 
had multipurpose digital identifi cation for such ser-
vices as voting, fi nance, health care, transportation, 
and social security.

Developing countries have invested more in 
core government administration systems like fi nan-
cial management, customs, and tax management

For example, more than 60 percent of public sector 
workers are in jobs that require intensive use of tech-
nologies in Bolivia, Colombia, and Kenya, compared 
with only approximately 20 percent of private sector 
workers. But the gap persists in 22 of the countries 
when the public sector is compared only with large 
private sector fi rms (those with more than 50 employ-
ees). Governments are also more intensive users of 
technology in high-income countries like Germany, 
Japan, and the United States.

Whether this substantial investment in 
e-government has strengthened state capability and 
improved outcomes will be explored at length in the 
next section. One indication of the limited return 
on these investments is citizen use of e-government 
services, which has lagged behind supply (fi gure 3.5, 
panel a). Even in countries where internet access is not 
a constraint, as in Europe, citizens use e-government 
mostly to get information (on average 44 percent of 
individuals in the European countries for which data 
are available visited a government website at least once 
in the past year to get information) and not for trans-

countries is lowest for administrative systems and 
highest for online services for citizens and businesses, 
with digital identifi cation systems in the middle (fi g-
ure 3.3). Fifteen middle-income countries score in the 
top quartile of administrative e-government systems, 
with Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru in the top 10 
worldwide, and Nepal, Rwanda, and Uganda scoring 
highly among low-income countries. India and Paki-
stan have more advanced digital identifi cation sys-
tems than high-income North American countries, 
pointing to the potential for “leapfrogging” that these 
technologies offer. 

Governments are more intensive users of infor-
mation technology than fi rms. Survey data on the use 
of digital technologies (computers, mobile phones, 
and the internet) in nonagricultural jobs from 30 
countries show that in all but one country, a higher 
share of public sector workers are in jobs that require 
frequent use of the technology in their daily work as 
compared to private sector workers (fi gure 3.4). This 
gap is not surprising for developing countries, where 
most fi rms are small and in the informal sector.

many citizens use online services in the richest coun-
tries than in the poorest, with a similar gap between 
the highest and lowest income quartiles within 
countries (fi gure 3.5, panel b). Within countries, use 
is unsurprisingly associated with age, education, 
and urban residence. Businesses are more likely 
than individuals to use the internet to transact with 
the government (fi gure 3.5, panel c), and the use of 
e-services by business is also less sensitive to income 
across countries.

In low-income countries, limited internet access 
means that mobile phones, not the internet, drive 
interconnectedness, as chapter 2 discussed. Surveys 
of the use of digital technologies in 12 African coun-
tries reveal that only 5 percent of individuals had used 
the internet to obtain information from, or interact 
with, the government, compared to 63 percent of 
respondents who had used their mobile phones to 
contact health workers (fi gure 3.6). Internet-based 
e-services will therefore be biased against the poor in 
developing countries. Mobile e-government portals 
have become more common, nearly doubling from 
25 countries in 2012 to 48 in 2014, but still are not on 
par with internet services.5 More than three-quarters 
of countries archive information on their websites 
for education, health, and fi nance services, but fewer 
than half send e-mail or Rich Site Summary (RSS) 
updates, and only a handful send short message ser-
vice (SMS) updates. 

Greater state capability and 
citizen participation
What impact have these signifi cant investments in 
e-government had on strengthening government 
capability to deliver services and expanding citizen 
participation? If politicians and policy makers want 
to improve services, they need a capable government 
to convert policies and spending into better outcomes. 
Resources must be collected and spent without leak-
age. Teachers and health workers must be present in 
classrooms and clinics, and then must be motivated 
to work. Benefi ciaries of government programs must 
be properly identifi ed and reached. And governments 
often must help citizens make better decisions, 
overcoming bad habits or a lack of information. But 
as underlined in the 2004 World Development Report, 
Making Services Work for Poor People, and subsequent 
research, weaknesses in each of these links in the 
service delivery chain make services fail in develop-
ing countries. Improving government capability or 
implementation capacity is key for effective service 
delivery.

acting with government (only 29 percent returned a 
form online in the past year). These patterns are also 
refl ected in surveys of citizens in Australia, Canada, 
and New Zealand—countries that rank 8, 10, and 15, 
respectively, in the provision of online services. The 
majority of respondents use government websites for 
information and prefer to use traditional channels like 
voice calls to undertake transactions such as register-
ing their children for day care.4 

Both between and within European countries, the 
use of e-services depends on income. Three times as

Digital technologies can help improve govern-
ment capability and citizen participation by: 

•  Informing citizens and giving them an offi  cial identity 
so that individuals can make better decisions for 
their health, their safety, and education for their 
children, and can access a variety of publicly and 
privately provided services; 

•  Streamlining processes to reduce discretion and 
opportunities for rent-seeking, ensuring that public 
resources are collected and spent effi ciently, with-
out leakage; 

•  Receiving feedback from service users to regularly 
track satisfaction, identify problems, and improve 
service quality;

•  Improving service provider management through better 
monitoring so that government workers both show 
up at work and are productive.

Digital technologies have had varying impacts 
across these channels (table 3.1). The clearest impact 
involves addressing a lack of information and weak

157DELIVERING SERVICES

Informing citizens and giving them an 
identity
Digital technologies are enabling governments to 
overcome barriers of geography, low physical con-
nectivity, and limited administrative capacity to pro-
vide information and deliver services to previously 
unreached citizens, improving citizen participation 
and choice. The most popular and promising inno-
vations in poor countries entail the use of mobile 
phones to implement a variety of health interven-
tions—so-called “m-health” (mobile health) initiatives. 
These can focus on either health providers, such as 
point-of-service data collection, disease surveillance, 
health-promotion campaigns, and telemedicine; or 
on citizens, such as SMS reminders to parents to get 
children vaccinated or to patients to undertake ther-
apy (sector focus 3). While hundreds of pilot m-health 
initiatives are underway, robust evidence in devel-
oping country contexts is limited largely to the pos-
itive effects of reminding patients to adhere to their 
antiretroviral therapy schedules.6 Initial results from 
pilots in Bangladesh, India, South Africa, and Tan-
zania suggest that regular SMS communication can 
induce similar behavior changes in expectant moth-
ers by providing information on neonatal health.7 
The initial results are also promising from m-health 
initiatives that assist health providers in recording 
patient information, monitoring pregnancies, and 
reporting drug stock-outs.8 

communication—citizens’ lack of knowledge about 
issues that affect their welfare, their inability to com-
municate with one another and with government, 
and government’s inability to be informed about 
citizens. For example, the provision of information 
to citizens, particularly to poor citizens in remote 
locations through mobile phones, has helped people 
make better decisions on a variety of issues. And dig-
ital identifi cation, by giving poor citizens a verifi able 
identity, has enabled them to participate in public and 
private services previously denied to them.

Digital technologies have been less effective in 
solving government failures associated with rent- 
seeking and in strengthening the incentives of gov-
ernment bureaucrats and service providers to per-
form due to principal-agent problems associated with 
information asymmetries. Automating government 
functions and services has been at best partially suc-
cessful; these are often complex and costly systems to 
implement. The failure rate is high, and so is the risk 
of wasting public funds. Citizen feedback has been 
effective when citizens have an incentive to provide 
feedback and the services are fairly easy to monitor, 
and when governments have the capacity to respond 
to this feedback. It is not effective when these condi-
tions are absent. Aside from a few isolated examples 
of reducing absenteeism, digital technologies have 
not signifi cantly improved service provider manage-
ment in government bureaucracies.

158 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

Weaknesses in civil registration in developing 
countries mean that approximately 2.4 billion people 
in the world do not have birth certifi cates and other 
offi cial documents to prove who they are, preventing 
many from opening bank accounts, registering prop-
erty, or receiving public transfers.13 Digital identifi -
cation (ID) programs that use biometrics to register 
and authenticate individuals, although complex and 
thus risky to implement, provide a robust solution to 
this problem. They enable poor countries to leapfrog 
the decades-long processes that developed countries 
went through to build their traditional, paper-based 
civil registration systems (see spotlight 4). These 
schemes are expanding; 148 of 197 countries have 
some form of electronic ID. But only 20 countries 
have a multipurpose ID with digital signature capa-
bility that can be used for multiple online and offl ine 
services; 100 have digital identifi cation systems lim-
ited to a few functions (services like voting or public 
sector payroll that cover only subsets of the general 
population); and 49 have no digital ID of any kind.14

Evidence on the impact of these schemes, while 
largely anecdotal, points to signifi cant potential ben-
efi ts of reducing leakages in government welfare 

This use of digital technologies to overcome geo-
graphic, infrastructure, and administrative bottle-
necks to information and communication is particu-
larly powerful in emergencies like disease outbreaks, 
natural disasters, and confl ict (box 3.1).

Digital technologies can also strengthen social 
norms and promote civic behavior like voluntary tax 
compliance or energy conservation through “peer 
comparisons”—making an individual’s actions more 
observable to others and making others’ actions 
more observable to the individual.9 For instance, tax 
evasion is pervasive in developing countries. Some 
governments collect less than half the taxes due to 
them.10 Simple behavioral nudges, such as naming 
and shaming tax delinquents by publishing their 
names on websites, can be a cost-effective inter-
vention even in low government capacity contexts. 
Such peer comparisons have improved tax com-
pliance in Norway and the United States, although 
the developing country evidence is more mixed.11 
Comparisons of a household’s power consumption 
with that of neighbors, as done by companies like 
Opower, can also help conserve energy through peer 
pressure.12 

Box 3.1 Digital technology and crisis management

Digital technologies have helped monitor and manage 
human and natural disasters, such as wars, fl oods, earth-
quakes, and epidemics. The internet can help in coordi-
nating data fl ows and improving the timeliness of decision 
making, while mobile phones can disseminate vital infor-
mation. Social media can also help survivors communicate 
their status and mobilize volunteer resources and donations 
outside the disaster zone. A few examples of responses to 
recent crises show the range of possibilities:

•  The Ebola epidemic in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone 
created logistical challenges for the organizations that 
responded, not least how to pay fi eldworkers in remote 
and rural locations, many of them not local. The United 
Nations Development Programme set up a scheme to 
use mobile phones to make direct payments to the Ebola 
response workers in Sierra Leone and Liberia, who num-
bered some 60,000 at the height of the crisis.a 

•  The earthquakes that struck Nepal in April and May 2015 
left at least 8,500 people dead, more than 17,000 injured, 

and many thousands homeless. Although donations came 
in from all over the world, ensuring that aid reached the 
areas most aff ected proved a challenge. One response, 
coordinated by Kathmandu Living Labs,b was to develop 
a dynamic map (quakemap.org) as a centralized platform 
for displaying incident reports and off ers of assistance. 
The map is built around the OpenStreetMap and uses 
the Ushahidi platform for incident reports—both based 
on open-source software and crowdsourced information.c

•  Recovering from confl ict and civil war requires long-
term nation building, and more than 40 countries have

programs and empowering women through fi nancial 
inclusion and access to government cash transfers (box 
3.2). Biometric registration, authentication, and pay-
ments in India’s National Rural Employment Guarantee 
Scheme, the world’s largest workfare program, reduced 
the time for paying benefi ciaries by 29 percent and leak-
ages by 35 percent (see spotlight 4).15 But these schemes 
are complex and have all the risks of wastage associ-
ated with large government information technology 
projects. They also raise concerns about government 
surveillance, violation of privacy, and data integrity. 

A more recent initiative around digital informa-
tional services is the open data movement, publishing 
government data in machine-readable format as a plat-
form for the private sector to develop applications to 
deliver new e-services to citizens. Countries continue to 
join the Open Government Partnership, but initiatives 
are in their infancy. According to the Global Open Data 
Index, only 13 percent of the datasets in 110 countries 
were “open”—public, machine-readable, and nonpropri-
etary.16 Many governments have no desire to open their 
data or lack the capability to do so. Making meaningful, 
good-quality data publicly available depends on sound 
core administrative  systems—countries with more 
advanced core systems have greater budget transpar-
ency (fi gure 3.7)—and on effective interministerial

Box 3.2 Empowering women through digitally enabled social programs 

Safety net programs are becoming more eff ective through 
digital systems for registering, authenticating, and pay-
ing benefi ciaries, promoting inclusion and empowering 
women. 

Consider the Absa Sekulula (“It’s easier”) welfare pay-
ment card in South Africa, the Benazir Income Support 
Programme (BISP) in Pakistan, and a pilot mobile money 
cash transfer experiment in rural Niger. The programs in 
Pakistan and South Africa rely on a debit card payment 
mechanism linked to an effi  cient management information 
system and biometric identity database. When benefi -
ciaries register, their personal data and biometrics are 
captured and authenticated in minutes, a biometric debit 
card is issued in a few days, and the system automatically 
credits cardholder accounts monthly with the appropriate 
grant amount. In Pakistan, 4.5 million BISP benefi ciary 
households receive their payments through debit cards 
within 72 hours of disbursement from the government. So, 
the elderly, parents, and people with disabilities no longer 

have to wait in line for cash or worry about keeping their 
payments safe. The Niger pilot led to improved nutrition for 
children, in part because of the time savings for mothers. 

Female empowerment is one major benefi t of the BISP 
and the Niger programs. Women in BISP mostly receive the 
payments on behalf of their households, increasing their 
authority to make decisions on how the cash is spent, their 
mobility, and their engagement with formal institutions. 
The Niger mobile transfer, by reducing the observability of 
the amount and timing of the cash transfer, increased wom-
en’s bargaining power in the household, changing house-
hold agricultural activities and expenditures in ways that 
benefi t women. To quote Amina Bibi, a BISP benefi ciary, 
“Women are being encouraged and empowered. Because 
of this program people who did not let their women leave 
the house earlier are allowing them to do so. Women now 
have confi dence that they, too, can do something for the 
betterment of their family.”

routine manual processes prone to error and manip-
ulation, reduces the number of government interme-
diaries in a transaction, and establishes audit trails to 
curtail rent-seeking. Digital registration and payment 
systems have, for example, signifi cantly reduced leak-
ages in transport subsidies for the poor in Colombia 
(box 3.3). Given the importance of mobilizing and man-
aging resources, almost all countries have tried to auto-
mate budget preparation, execution, and accounting 
and some aspects of tax and customs administration. 
Management information systems are also exten-
sively used in education, health, land management, 
and social protection services. In the past decade, 
one-stop shops or service centers that provide citizen 
and business services—such as registration, licensing, 
records, bill payments—in a single physical space or 
web portal have become popular, with initiatives in 
many countries, including Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, 
Brazil, Cambodia, India, Kenya, Moldova, Mozam-
bique, Oman, Peru, and Uganda (box 3.4). 

Given the methodological diffi culties in measuring 
government productivity, the impact of e-government 
must be assessed indirectly through, for instance, 
changes in fi rms’ perceptions of tax compliance costs, 
the competitiveness of government procurement, and 
corruption in taxation and government contracting 
after the introduction of e-government systems in a 
country. These indirect measures, from regular sur-
veys of fi rms in select European and Central Asian 

cooperation and coordination. The necessary support-
ive ecosystem of a vibrant private sector and civil soci-
ety to use open data is also often missing.

The impact after governments open up is also 
unclear. In the United States and the United Kingdom, 
the take-up of open data has been limited to a few sec-
tors where there is consumer demand, like real estate, 
transport, energy, and health care, so the private 
sector has an incentive to develop applications on 
the open data platform.17 In Kenya, Moldova, and the 
Philippines, which have opened hundreds of govern-
ment datasets, the motive has been more to increase 
transparency than to spur business opportunities for 
the private sector. In locales in Kenya and the Philip-
pines, fewer than 15 percent of survey respondents 
with internet access had heard of the Open Data Ini-
tiative.18 Some media and civil society organizations 
use open data in their advocacy campaigns, but such 
initiatives generally are few and fragmented.

Box 3.3 Targeted public transit benefi ts in Bogotá

Public transit is essential for 64 percent of the 8 million peo-
ple living in Bogotá, Colombia. As in many major cities, hous-
ing is often distant from work, especially for low-income resi-
dents. But using public transit can be costly for the poor, who 
spend about 25 percent of their income on transportation, 
compared to 3.5 percent for high-income residents. To help 
overcome this spatial mismatch, the city built an integrated 
public transport system (SITP) anchored by the Transmilenio 
bus rapid transit and collective bus transport. To increase 
aff ordability for low-income users, the city introduced a 
subsidy—in 2014; it gave a 50-percent discount for 40 trips 
per month. Eligibility is tied to a database of benefi ciaries of 
social programs (SISBEN), and by February 2015 it reached 
about 26 percent of the target population. 

The subsidy is transferred on smart fare cards activated 
and replenished at charging stations. This technology 

makes it easier and more fl exible to provide targeted 
demand-side subsidies with lower scope for leakage 
and abuse. Most public transit systems, in contrast, rely 
on undiff erentiated supply-side subsidies. Linking the 
transit user and SISBEN databases makes targeting effi  -
cient. Introduction of the smart card system has not been 
without startup problems. The smart cards do not work 
on the entire system yet. Someone traveling on diff erent 
portions (“Phases”) of Transmilenio and on the collective 
system will need two smart cards and possibly cash as well. 
These parallel systems need to be integrated into the SITP. 
Technically, this is straightforward (for example, by using 
turnstiles that receive the smart cards in all the buses and 
stations). The challenge is to achieve consensus between 
the bus operators, the collection fi rm in charge of the smart 
cards, and the city’s government.

with Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kosovo having the 
biggest declines in inspections, and Bosnia and Her-
zegovina, Montenegro, and Tajikistan reporting an 
increase in inspections after the introduction of the 
e-government system. E-fi ling also lowered fi rms’ 
perceptions of paying bribes to tax offi cials only mar-
ginally, with medium-size fi rms and fi rms that export 
less likely to pay bribes to tax offi cials after the intro-
duction of e-fi ling.

E-fi ling and e-payment help on average to reduce 
the time it takes businesses to prepare and pay taxes, 
as measured by the assessments of experts in the 
Doing Business data for 75 countries that introduced 
these systems between 2005 and 2014 (fi gure 3.9). 
Overall the time taken declined by roughly 25 percent 
in the fi ve years after the system was introduced 
across the sample, with the time dropping by more 

countries, show that the impact of e-government is 
mixed and varies considerably across countries.19

Filing of taxes electronically (e-fi ling) is meant to 
reduce the administrative burden to businesses and 
citizens by minimizing interactions with tax offi cials 
and reducing opportunities for rent-seeking—and 
by lowering the time it takes businesses to fi le tax 
returns, make payments, and receive refunds. Indeed, 
advanced e-fi ling systems in a country (e-fi ling of tax 
forms and e-payment of taxes) lowered the likelihood 
of being inspected by tax offi cials by an average 13 per-
cent in select countries in Europe and Central Asia.20 
But shifting only to the simpler e-fi ling system that 
did not enable online payment of taxes had no effect 
(fi gure 3.8, panel a). Nor did e-fi ling on average reduce 
the number of visits by tax offi cials (fi gure 3.8, panel 
b). These effects vary considerably across countries, 

Box 3.4 Streamlining services through one-stop service centers

With committed political leadership, one-stop computer-
ized service centers can provide citizens with access to a 
broad range of public services from multiple government 
departments at one location quickly and easily—expand-
ing options, saving time, speeding delivery, and reducing 
opportunities for corruption. 

In rural Karnataka, India, for instance, the more than 800 
Nemmadi Centers operating since 2006 provide birth and 
death certifi cates, caste certifi cates, income certifi cates, 
ration cards, land records, and pensions, among other ser-
vices. Compared with typical government offi  ces, citizens 
get these services in the centers with 3.4 fewer visits, 58 
fewer minutes spent in the visits, 23 days faster processing, 
and 50 percent less chance of being asked for a bribe.a 
But this experience of Karnataka is not replicated in many 
other states of India. One study found that the scope and 
impact of service centers vary considerably across states. 
The greater the prevalence of petty corruption, the fewer 
services off ered, particularly services for which bribes can 
be extracted. 

The integrated citizen assistance units (unidades de 
atendimento integrado, or UAI) in Minas Gerais, Brazil, 
provide another model. With 30 shops and 1,800 employ-
ees, the UAI off er access to services from 15 government 
agencies. In 2012, they handled more than 6.2 million citi-
zen transactions, up sevenfold in three years. Employment 

and ID services are most popular, with the majority of users 
from lower-income groups. 

The UAI were designed to overcome institutional con-
straints that plagued the state’s prior attempt at service 
integration. The earlier generation of service centers was 
staff ed by low-performing civil servants seconded by par-
ticipating agencies and lacked standard operating proce-
dures. Long wait times could be abused by citizens willing 
to pay to advance in the queue. 

The new system strengthened oversight from the 
Secretariat for Planning and Management, which reports 
directly to the governor. It introduced a fi rst-come, fi rst-
served ticketing system. And citizen complaints submitted 
online must be resolved within two days. Coordinators at 
the UAI “situation room” monitor the average wait time, 
the number of citizens served, and the number of atten-
dants on duty at each service center to reallocate resources 
to manage demand in real time. A private contractor staff s 
the service centers, thus bypassing restrictions for civil 
servants and allowing the centers to off er extended hours 
to citizens. Each participating agency provides an on-site 
supervisor to oversee its programs. Confl icts occasionally 
arise between UAI coordinators and the agency-employed 
supervisors. As one government offi  cial noted, “When you 
tell a police offi  cer he is no longer the authority in that 
place, it doesn’t go down very well.”b

of taxpayers and tax offi cials to use these systems. 
The importance of complementary reforms is illus-
trated by the contrasts of South Africa and Belarus 
with Tajikistan and Uganda. South Africa’s tax mod-
ernization reforms, which began in 2007, coupled the 
technology initiatives with simplifying the tax code 
and reforming business processes in the tax authority. 
For example, revenue targets became a compulsory 
feature of the performance scorecards of managers. 
Online tax fi ling increased from 40,000 individual tax 
returns in 2006 to more than 2 million in 2009, with 
signifi cant reductions in tax compliance costs.22 In 
Belarus, e-fi ling was similarly part of a broader reform 
to lower compliance costs for citizens, including sim-
plifying the tax code, setting up taxpayer facilitation 
services, and reaching out to the business community. 
But in Tajikistan, e-fi ling was not mandatory, use was 
low, and most businesses continued to submit paper 
returns, in part because they did not trust that online 
submissions would be secure but also because tax 
inspectors continued to pester fi rms.23 And in Uganda, 
the electronic forms were more complicated than the 
manual ones, and taxpayers had to fi le paper returns 
in addition to the e-fi ling.24 As a result, the time to 
prepare and pay taxes increased in Uganda, and tax 
inspections increased in Tajikistan. 

Effective service delivery requires effi cient and 
transparent government procurement of goods and 
services. Procurement is particularly vulnerable to 
collusion and corruption; e-procurement, through 
greater transparency and less discretion, can result 
in signifi cant budgetary savings and better-quality 
infrastructure. In India and Indonesia, e-procurement 
increased competition by making information on gov-
ernment contracts widely available and by encourag-
ing more fi rms, particularly those outside the region 
where the project was located, to bid. It also improved 
the quality of the infrastructure projects through 
shorter delays and better construction.25 

Firms’ perceptions of the impact of e-procurement 
in Europe and Central Asia, however, are quite mixed. 
Systems that provide only information on govern-
ment contracts online or that also enable fi rms to bid 
for these contracts online had no effect on average 
on fi rm perceptions of the competitiveness of public 
procurement (fi gure 3.10, panel a). In Belarus, Georgia, 
and the Slovak Republic, fi rms were more likely to 
bid for government contracts after an e-procurement 
system was introduced, but in Armenia, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, and Tajikistan they were less likely. 
Transactional e-procurement systems increased the 
competitiveness of procurement only in the higher- 
income countries in the sample, suggesting that 
nontechnological factors correlated with a country’s 

than half in Belarus (from 987 hours to 183 hours), 
Costa Rica (from 402 hours to 163 hours), and Kenya 
(from 432 hours to 202 hours).21 

To have impact, e-government systems need to 
be accompanied by regulatory and administrative 
reforms—changing laws and management practices, 
simplifying tax procedures, and increasing the ability

level of development determine their impact. Sur-
prisingly, e-procurement was not associated with 
any reduction on average in fi rm perceptions of cor-
ruption in government contracting, but again with 
considerable variation (fi gure 3.10, panel b). Nor were 
there signifi cant average differences across types 
of fi rms or in the functionality of the systems. This 
negative fi nding is striking because one of the main 
reasons for investing in these systems is reducing 
corruption in contracting and increasing the value-
for-money of government capital spending.

E-procurement is also conditional on regulatory, 
institutional, and human resource factors for impact. 
In one of India’s leading reformers in e-procurement, 
Karnataka state, reform was underpinned by an 
amended procurement law that made it mandatory 
to use the government e-procurement portal for all 
state departments and agencies. Run from the chief 
minister’s offi ce to give it authority, the system was 
implemented under a public-private partnership to 
bring in skills from the market.26

provide feedback, and the service provider must have 
the incentive and capacity to respond and resolve the 
complaint. Citizens are more likely to complain if they 
use the service frequently, if it is a private good (so 
there are no problems of free-riding), and if it is easy 
to identify the service failure. Governments are more 
likely to respond if the information provided by citi-
zens on the service failure is specifi c and actionable, 
if it is clear who in government needs to resolve the 
complaint, and if the complaint also integrates with 
document management systems within the agency 
so that both the complaint and the response can be 
prioritized and tracked. Government responsiveness 
can further incentivize citizens to complain, creating 
a virtuous circle of feedback and responsiveness. For 
example, users of FixMyStreet—the platform in the 
United Kingdom that citizens use to report local road 
problems, which are then routed to the relevant local 
authorities—are 54 percent more likely to submit a 
second report if their fi rst complaint was resolved.28

Household water supply and electricity are exam-
ples of private goods that citizens use daily and have 
an incentive to monitor. The responsibility for deliver-
ing these services lies clearly with a particular utility, 
and it is easy for citizens to know when the service is 
failing. MajiVoice is a complaint mechanism in the 
water and sewerage company in Nairobi, and there is 
a similar one in use in EDE Este, the electricity supply 
company for the eastern Dominican Republic. Given 
the limited internet use in the country, consumers 
initiate complaints mostly in person at the service 
desk in the utility or through phone calls, generating a 
ticket number as a tracking tool for both the customer 
and the utility. The customer receives an SMS message 
from the utility when the complaint is entered and 
another when the complaint is resolved. This tracking 
is possible because each complaint is registered on a 
dashboard that enables management to categorize 
the complaint, delegate the issue to a specifi c staff 
member on duty, and track resolution. The dashboard 
enables the utility regulator to track performance, and 
customers of EDE Este are also randomly contacted 
after the complaint is resolved to gauge their satisfac-
tion with the service.

Initial results are impressive. Before MajiVoice 
was initiated, the Nairobi water company received on 
average 400 complaints a month. Since 2013, when 
MajiVoice was launched, the utility has been getting 
about 3,000 complaints a month, resolution rates 
climbed from 46 percent to 94 percent, and time to 
resolution dropped by 90 percent (fi gure 3.11).29 Since 
its implementation in 2011, the feedback channel in 
EDE Este has also recorded rising resolution rates for 

The varied impact of e-fi ling, e-procurement, and 
one-stop centers reveals a broader, sobering trend: 
Many government digital technology projects are 
unsuccessful. They are either abandoned before 
completion or underused, wasting substantial public 
funds (box 3.5). A widely accepted explanation for 
this poor record is the big gap between the techno-
logical capability and the institutional capacity of the 
government, as measured by processes, objectives, 
values, staffi ng numbers, skills, and management 
systems and structures.27

Receiving user feedback
One potential catalyst for service improvements is 
user feedback on service quality. More than a decade 
ago, the private sector discovered customer relation-
ship management—the use of digital technologies 
to integrate all aspects of a fi rm’s interaction with a 
customer to improve personalized communication 
and provide real-time information so that customers 
can track the status of their service requests. Gov-
ernments have only recently discovered this man-
agement approach, with most innovation in cities 
in the developed countries. Mobile phone apps like 
SeeClickFix and FixMyStreet, active in many munici-
palities in the United States and the United Kingdom, 
and internet call centers allow users to report service 
issues and enable governments to report back to 
citizens on fi x requests through integrated back-end 
systems. They are now standard in Barcelona, Boston, 
Chicago, London, New York, Seoul, and Singapore.

Developing countries are following suit. Given the 
considerable ineffi ciencies in public sector delivery 
systems, the gains from embedding digitally enabled 
citizen feedback in management are potentially 
greater than in developed countries. These feedback 
channels come in many varieties. They can be for a 
limited set of services tied to particular agencies or 
for multiple services and issues, usually housed in a 
center-of-government entity, either local or national. 
They can be complaint portals that invite citizens 
to report service issues, or government-initiated 
(“proactive”) feedback mechanisms through which 
government offi cials contact citizens to inquire about 
their service experience. Complaint portals and call 
centers for citizen feedback are spreading rapidly 
across developing countries, particularly in cities—
Buenos Aires, Muscat, Rio de Janeiro, and Ulaanbaa-
tar, to name a few. Proactive feedback mechanisms 
are more recent and thus limited in number—those in 
Albania and Pakistan are examples. 

Two conditions are required for user feedback 
to have impact: Citizens must have an incentive to

Box 3.5 The high failure rate of e-government projects

Despite spending more than $600 billion on IT over the past decade, the federal government has achieved 
little of the productivity improvements that private industry has realized from IT. Too often, federal IT projects 

run over budget, run behind schedule, or fail to deliver promised functionality. 

—U.S. Offi  ce of Management and Budget 2010

Many public sector digital technology projects fail. 
Although the evidence is limited, various estimates from 
surveys of government offi  cials, audit reports, and coun-
try cases suggest that about 30 percent of these projects 
are total failures, with the project abandoned before 
completion. Another 50 to 60 percent are partial failures, 
with signifi cant budget and time overruns and only a 
limited number of the project objectives achieved. Fewer than 
20 percent are successes.a In some cases, even if e-govern-
ment projects are successfully implemented they may actually 
worsen outcomes as, without proper regulatory safeguards in 
place, automation makes it easier to perpetrate fraud and cor-
rupt practices, and to erase records or avoid capturing them 
altogether, thereby eroding transparency mechanisms.b  

Risky for the private sector, these projects do worse in 
governments. One survey of U.S. information technology 
projects found success rates of 59 percent in retail, 27 
percent in manufacturing, and 18 percent in government.c 
Larger projects are more likely to fail than smaller ones, 
with success rates of only 13 percent on average (fi gure 
B3.5.1) and a skewed distribution, with a small proportion 
of projects accounting for a major chunk of budget and 

time overruns. One comprehensive review of more than 
1,400 public sector information and communication tech-
nology (ICT) projects found that a sixth went over budget 
by 200 percent, posing “systemic” fi scal risks.d 

World Bank–funded projects have not fared much bet-
ter: 27 percent of the roughly 530 information technology 
projects from 1995 to 2015 were self-evaluated by the 
World Bank as moderately unsatisfactory or worse, in line 
with all projects (fi gure B3.5.2). But far fewer were rated 
“satisfactory” or above, with 35 percent for ICT projects and 
56 percent for all projects.

e-government scholars provide numerous explanations 
for these stark numbers. A widely quoted study blames a 
large gap between the regulatory, political, management, 
process, and skill realities in government and the ambitions

salary increases) based on worker performance. In 
the Nairobi utility, data from monthly management 
reports are also used as a basis for performance incen-
tives for staff. 

Property registrations, welfare payments, and 
licensing services are also private goods that are easy 
to monitor, and citizens have an incentive to give 
feedback on them. With multiple agencies usually 
delivering these services, citizen-initiated feedback is 
more likely to have impact if the services are consol-
idated in one-stop service centers that make it easier 
for citizens to provide feedback and for governments 
to integrate the feedback in administrative systems 
and to monitor the responsiveness of agencies. One-
stop centers in Azerbaijan, in Brazil’s Minas Gerais 
state, and in Moldova show how automating the 
service delivery chain with citizen feedback can drive 
service improvements.31

By contrast, it is much more diffi cult for citizens 
to determine the quality of education or curative 
health care and to attribute poor outcomes to the pre-
cise cause—whether, for example, their child’s poor 
learning (to the extent that it is assessed through 
standardized tests) or their poor health is due to poor 
service providers, their own negligence, or environ-
mental factors. Beyond issues like provider absentee-
ism, complaints are less likely to be actionable. And 
citizens have fewer incentives to complain about the 
weak provision of public goods like roads and munic-
ipal services because of free-riding.

reported problems, improvements in customer satis-
faction, and a reduction in reported corruption.30 This 
improved tracking is also triggering improvements in 
human resource management. In EDE Este, the feed-
back is systematically used to inform sanctions (such 
as administrative procedures) and rewards (such as 

of e-government projects.e Another points to the “danger-
ous enthusiasms” of technological infatuation and faddism 
in large IT projects.f Many studies also point to the rigidi-
ties in government procurement rules, IT vendors’ lack of 
understanding of government processes, and a failure to 
understand the country context.g In the private sector, exec-
utives can choose vendors based on personal experience 
and jointly determined guidelines that are deliberately kept 

vague to allow fl exibility during implementation. Ministers 
and senior offi  cials, by contrast, are explicitly forbidden by 
government rules to exercise this level of discretion and 
instead must purchase on the basis of detailed specifi ca-
tions. Surveys of technology professionals and executives 
in both the public and private sectors underline user 
involvement, leadership support, and a clear statement of 
project requirements as critical factors for success.h

on acquiring actionable information. In Pakistan, 
under the Punjab Citizen Feedback Model, service 
providers record citizens’ mobile numbers. A gov-
ernment call center sends SMS messages and voice 
calls to public service users to make targeted inqui-
ries about satisfaction with 16 services, ranging from 
property registration to primary health care and 
potential incidents of corruption. The data are logged 
and tracked on dashboards.35 This system has been 
deployed at a very large scale, with more than 7 mil-
lion citizens contacted since 2012—250,000 a month 
on average—and about 1 million having provided 
feedback from across the province.36 But the impact of 
the feedback on service delivery is unclear. Many offi -
cials have tried to subvert the initiative, as refl ected 
in the high and steady proportion of invalid phone 
numbers recorded by service providers—40 percent 
for citizens registering property, a service particularly 
prone to petty corruption. The government has taken 
more than 6,000 administrative actions against offi -
cials based on the feedback. But given the protections 
afforded staff under civil service rules, the actions 
have been mostly warnings and formal apologies 
from the concerned offi cial to the citizen, and only a 
handful have been suspensions or dismissals. 

Governments in high-income countries are 
moving beyond user feedback to engage citizens in 
collaborative policy making. The northern European 
countries are on the vanguard in these moves to more 
direct democracy, as exemplifi ed by Iceland’s crowd-
sourced constitution, Estonia’s e-legislation portal, 

These problems are evident in general citizen 
feedback portals recently introduced in Botswana, 
Indonesia, and the Philippines. The government of 
Indonesia’s complaint-handling system (LAPOR) 
allows citizens to submit reports on many issues, 
ranging from delays in welfare payments to damaged 
roads. It has received about 800 complaints a day 
on average from all over Indonesia since the portal’s 
launch in 2012. Of these complaints, only 10 percent 
are specifi c and actionable (fi gure 3.12, panel a) and 
are forwarded to the relevant agency for resolution. 
Of these actionable complaints, 28 percent and 18 per-
cent, respectively, are for private benefi ts like welfare 
payments or fuel subsidies; less than 5 percent are for 
public goods like roads and public works (fi gure 3.12, 
panel b).32 The complaint portals of the governments 
of Botswana and the Philippines have similarly pro-
vided limited actionable information to the govern-
ment, particularly on public goods.33

Citizen feedback portals are also likely to be dispro-
portionately used by better-off, more educated, and 
more digitally savvy individuals, potentially biasing 
government responses. For example, most users of 
FixMyStreet in the United Kingdom are male, older, 
more educated, and less likely to be from an ethnic 
minority than the general population.34 Similarly, the 
users of LAPOR are disproportionately from Jakarta, 
the largest city and the capital, than from the poorer 
and more remote regions in eastern Indonesia.

Government-initiated feedback can overcome 
these biases in citizen reporting and be more focused

absenteeism among government providers, who are 
diffi cult to dismiss and discipline.40 Technology must 
be accompanied by good management. In India, the 
monitoring of health workers did improve attendance, 
but many local governments did not use the data to 
sanction absent workers because of cumbersome 
civil service rules or for political reasons. In Uganda, 
absenteeism was reduced only by combining teacher 
incentive pay with monitoring technology. In Paki-
stan, smartphone-based monitoring of district health 
supervisors in rural clinics doubled inspections of 
health facilities and reduced medical worker absen-
teeism, but the results were highly contingent on the 
severity of patronage politics in a locality. In Haiti, the 
experiment failed because government teachers had 
not been paid for months and resented the additional 
unfairness imposed on them by digital monitoring. 
In Niger, by contrast, the experiment was conducted 
with contract teachers hired by a nongovernmental 
organization, and mobile phone–based monitoring 
by itself was suffi cient to improve teacher effort and 
motivation as well as student learning outcomes.

Reducing absenteeism, while necessary, is not suf-
fi cient to ensure that doctors, teachers, and managers, 
once they show up to work, actually are motivated to 
perform well and to serve the public. Recent innova-
tions in the private sector have extended these teacher 
monitoring technologies to the actual practice of 
teaching, through standard lesson plans and system-
atic monitoring of teacher activities by management. 
The initial results are promising, again conditional 
on the strong relationships of accountability that can 
exist in private schools (box 3.6). But applying these 
lessons to a government bureaucracy will be chal-
lenging. The typical developing country government 
bureaucracy is unable to recruit the best and brightest 
workers because of low pay and excessive infl uence 
by politicians. It promotes staff on the basis of senior-
ity and not performance—in part because measuring 
performance is diffi cult and seniority is the only cred-
ible standard—and is unable to motivate workers to 
work hard and serve the public. For many providers, 
the reason for joining the public sector is job security, 
not promoting student learning or public health. 

These weaknesses are evident from perception 
surveys of government workers in Indonesia and the 
Philippines. Many staff believe that the best univer-
sity graduates prefer working in the private sector, 
that their coworkers are often not productive, that 
promotions are based on politics rather than merit, 
and that their coworkers in other government agen-
cies cannot be trusted (fi gure 3.13). Anecdotal evidence 

and Reykjavik’s digital participatory budgeting.37 
But even in these digitally and socioeconomically 
advanced countries, e-participatory policy making 
has engaged only a small, nonrepresentative subset 
of the population, has elicited limited government 
responsiveness, and is diffi cult to sustain. In Estonia, 
a global leader in e-services and e-voting, with high 
citizen use across all socioeconomic groups, only 
8 percent of people polled had heard of http://www
.osale.ee, the government’s e-legislation and policy 
making portal.

Improving service provider management

Technology can improve systems that 
are already working . . . but it doesn’t fi x 

systems that are broken. There is no knowledge 
management without management.

School of Information 

User feedback is effective when providers and man-
agers have the incentive and the ability to respond to 
citizens, which depends on strong relationships of 
accountability between policy makers and providers. 
By better monitoring of workers and facilities and 
through better organization and performance man-
agement in bureaucracies, digital technologies can 
strengthen accountability within the government by 
reducing information asymmetries between policy 
makers and service providers. 

The absenteeism of teachers, doctors, nurses, and 
agricultural extension workers is pervasive in Africa 
and South Asia.38 Estimates suggest that in India 
roughly one-quarter of government teachers and over 
one-third of government doctors in primary health 
centers are absent without a legitimate reason on any 
given day, with similarly alarming numbers in several 
African countries.39 Physical monitoring of providers 
is costly, particularly in rural areas, and the monitors 
are just as likely to shirk as the providers or to collude 
with providers. Using mobile phones to record atten-
dance—either with the photographs or thumbprints 
of the providers as evidence—and transmit data to a 
central database to generate monitoring reports can 
be a cost-effective solution to this seemingly intrac-
table problem. 

Evidence from impact evaluations in Haiti, India, 
Niger, Pakistan, and Uganda shows that digital mon-
itoring can reduce absenteeism in general, but that 
technology on its own is not suffi cient for curbing

ers reported that they had never had a meeting with 
the head teacher to discuss their performance, and 
two-thirds of the head teachers had themselves been 
absent from school at least once in the last fi ve days.42

The low productivity of some government bureau-
cracies refl ects fundamental structural constraints 
that cannot easily be substituted for by technology. 
Where digital technologies can help is in monitoring 
goals and performance targets for organizational units 
and workers. For the private sector, fi rms that adopt 

suggests that these problems are even more severe in 
low-income countries. Studies of teacher and health 
worker management in South Asia and Africa reveal 
a fundamentally broken system, with pervasive prob-
lems of politicization, weak school management, low 
provider motivation, and shirking.41 A recent survey of 
public schools in Tanzania revealed that 67 percent of 
the teachers who were present in the school did not 
show up in classrooms to teach. Nor did school princi-
pals hold them accountable: Three-quarters of teach-

Box 3.6 Digitally enabled teacher management in private schools

Private schools targeted to the world’s poorest have 
become a new model for education in developing countries 
with low-quality public education. Bridge International 
Academies (BIA) is an innovative for-profi t private model 
operating in underserved communities in Kenya and 
Uganda that leverages standardization and technology to 
educate more than 118,000 children.

The BIA business and educational model is driven by 
a standardized set of curricular and managerial materials 
to keep classes consistent, students on task, and schools 
running smoothly. The core of these materials is an 
internet-enabled tablet computer, which downloads more 
than 3,400 lesson plans and teacher scripts at the beginning 
of each term. These plans include step-by-step instructions 
on how to prepare and present each lesson, homework 
assignments, and tests. BIA management tracks class-
room progress—such as the speed of lessons and teacher 
attendance—with the tablet through automatic syncing. If 
a teacher falls behind in lessons, BIA managers in Nairobi 
and BIA’s U.S. headquarters know immediately and can 
follow up with the teacher hundreds or thousands of miles 
away. In addition to teacher monitoring, student progress 
is tracked by teacher-inputted student test scores and 
progress measures. This automation gives BIA headquarters 
instant access to school data and helps BIA manage their 
academies. 

In addition to classroom management, standardization 
and technology are leveraged to improve school adminis-
tration. Each “academy manager”—akin to a head teacher 
or principal—receives a smartphone to use for communi-
cation and monitoring, and as a modem for the tablets. 
Academy managers follow standardized instructions on 
managing fi nances, personnel, and student and parent 
relationships, as well as on how to use a central payroll 

system, expense-processing system, standardized assess-
ments, and evaluation tools. Even paying school fees is 
standardized and technology-enabled; tuition payments 
are made electronically with M-Pesa or through Equity 
Bank Kenya. The standardized instruction, school man-
agement, and assessment ensure that each student in a 
Bridge Academy receives the same education, regardless 
of location or instructor. 

Initial evaluations show that this educational style 
may be eff ective. In 2013, a self-evaluation found that 
BIA students scored 0.32 standard deviations higher than 
peer students in public schools in reading fl uency and 
comprehension, translating into an additional 16 words per 
minute and 252 additional learning days. In math skills, BIA 
students scored 0.51 standard deviations higher, equivalent 
to an additional 288 learning days. These fi ndings need to 
be viewed cautiously, however, as the diff erences in out-
comes may be entirely explained by diff erences in students 
between BIA and public schools.

This type of private education is not unequivocally 
embraced. The scripted lesson plans are particularly con-
troversial, with questions about the eff ectiveness of a script 
to create a dynamic learning environment for children to 
develop higher-order thinking skills. In addition, Bridge 
Academies rely on large class sizes and teachers with only 
a secondary education to keep costs low. Low-cost private 
education is also criticized because of the potential to 
undermine public education systems. Countries that rely 
on private education may not invest as heavily in their 
public systems, and private schools often attract the best 
students, further diminishing the public education system. 
Even so, in contexts where public schools are failing, a stan-
dardized private sector model may be a viable option for 
improving learning outcomes.

ment and level of trust in an organization—which can 
take years to build. There is little evidence, even in the 
OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development) countries, that digital technologies 
have made any fundamental differences in the way 
government bureaucracies are managed, particularly 
for the better integration of policy making and service 
delivery across government. Even in New Zealand, 
known for its highly competent and innovative public 
administration, two-thirds of public offi cials surveyed 
were skeptical that digital technologies would induce 
greater collaboration and integration across govern-
ment departments because the notion of a “joined-up 
government” confl icted with the annual agency-based 
budget appropriation process.45

In sum, these digitally enabled management 
improvements are isolated examples. Either they are 
pilots and experiments limited to a subset of activities, 
such as addressing absenteeism, that form the basic 
minimum required to improve teaching or health care, 
or they are limited to a few locales, sectors, or agencies 
and not taken to scale in the government as a whole. 
Developing country government bureaucracies now 
have a digital veneer over a largely unchanged struc-
ture, culture, and performance orientation.

more structured performance management practices 
are more profi table, and digital technologies com-
plement performance monitoring and performance 
incentives.43 Goal-setting and performance incentives 
are diffi cult—but not impossible—in government 
bureaucracies. The multiple demands on a public orga-
nization, and the multiple interests it needs to serve, 
make it diffi cult to defi ne goals, and performance 
incentives can trigger a host of perverse incentives. 
The key variable is the extent to which the tasks and 
outputs of agencies can be routinized and monitored.44 

As MajiVoice and the EDE Este feedback systems 
show, eliciting citizen feedback on service quality, 
tracking complaint resolution, producing audit trails 
of worker effort, and offering performance incentives 
for staff can be a powerful combination for trans-
forming government bureaucracies. This combina-
tion is also being used in one-stop service centers in 
many countries. 

Digitally enabled performance monitoring is much 
more diffi cult for services that are highly discretion-
ary and hard to monitor, such as teaching and curative 
health care, and for policy and regulatory functions. 
Assessing performance is necessarily more subjective 
and therefore conditional on the quality of manage-

Emerging evidence suggests that digital technolo-
gies have made elections freer and fairer by improv-
ing voter registration and reducing errors in voting, 
and by better monitoring them to curb electoral fraud 
and violence. These technologies have also helped cit-
izens vote out corrupt politicians, if the information 
comes from a credible source. But signifi cant barriers 
to more informed voting remain, and digital tech-
nologies, by giving elites new ways of manipulating 
information to their advantage in election campaigns, 
can also disempower the poor. These disparities can 
be countered if traditional media bridge the digital 
divide, but such a role may be limited to providing 
information that is more salient and newsworthy, 
such as corruption scandals, rather than service deliv-
ery failures. Digital technologies, particularly social 
media, have galvanized citizen protests, but except 
where governments are willing and able, they have 
not sustained collective action and citizen voice to 
improve service delivery (table 3.2). 

Freer and fairer elections
Is the growth of digital technologies spreading demo-
cratic ideals around the world, as many believe?46 
Democracy has indeed spread across the world, but 
so have election irregularities.47 As the number of 
developing country democracies more than doubled 
from 1990 to 2012, the proportion of elections that 
were “free and fair” halved from almost 80 percent 
to under 40 percent over the same period (fi gure 3.14, 
panel a). In a free election, the electoral rules and their 
implementation leading up to an election enable all 
adult citizens to be registered, to exercise their right 
to vote, and to join political parties and to campaign 

Digital technologies too 
often fail to empower 
citizens
As discussed, digital technologies can be effective even 
in weak government bureaucracies in some areas—
notably through digital identifi cation, streamlining 
routine tasks, and citizen feedback for certain services 
that citizens have the incentive and capacity to moni-
tor. But in general, to have an impact, e-government 
requires effective leadership by politicians and policy 
makers—to make the necessary changes to govern-
ment rules and management practices, to overcome 
resistance from vested interests, and to respond to cit-
izen feedback on service quality. Strengthening gov-
ernment capability requires a willing government. The 
question, then, is whether digital technologies can 
encourage good leadership by empowering citizens to 
hold policy makers and providers accountable.

Mechanisms for empowering citizens include

•  Free and fair elections in government systems in 
which leaders are chosen in elections—ensuring 
that all legitimate votes can be cast and counted so 
that the poor in particular are not excluded from 
participating

•  More informed voting—informing voters to increase 
electoral participation and reducing information 
asymmetries so that votes can be more accurately 
based on the performance of politicians

•  Citizen voice and collective action—empowering citizens 
to individually and collectively mobilize to pressure 
policy makers and providers to improve services.

More informed voting
Improving the mechanical aspects of voting is a min-
imum requirement for electoral accountability. The 
more fundamental problem is that citizens are often 
uninterested and unengaged in politics, face signifi -
cant informational barriers in assessing politician 
performance, or base their votes on tribal, ethnic, or 
clientelist factors and not the ability and performance 
of politicians.53 This lack of engagement is under-
standable. Acquiring political information is costly, 
the sources of the information, like political parties, 
are often not credible, and the impact of an individual 
citizen’s more informed vote is negligible to the out-
come of an election. The question, then, is whether 
digital technologies change this calculus to result in 
a more engaged and informed citizenry—and more 
effective elections.

There is no shortage of popular opinion that the 
internet—by exponentially increasing transparency 
and forging connections among voters, particularly 
through social media—will strengthen accountability 
through greater voter engagement and participation.54 
These sentiments echo those of earlier generations 
about television, which was also viewed as nothing 
short of revolutionary for enhancing accountability. 
But television’s impact has turned out to be much 
more mixed. In Sweden, the rollout of commercial 
television indeed improved citizen knowledge of 

freely. In a fair election, all voters and all votes are 
treated equally on the day of the election.48 Electoral 
irregularities can affect poor voters disproportion-
ately. They may not be able to cast their votes because 
they lack proper identifying documents, or their votes 
may not be counted because of error or manipulation. 

Digital technologies are helping make elections 
freer and fairer. Across nations, perceptions of the 
integrity of elections in developing countries are posi-
tively correlated with internet use (fi gure 3.14, panel b). 
Rigorous studies reinforce this cross-national correla-
tion and demonstrate the powerful impact of digital 
technology in increasing electoral participation, par-
ticularly for the poor. In Brazil, pre-internet electronic 
voting machines signifi cantly reduced voting errors 
in the 1990s, leading to the de facto enfranchisement 
of poor and less educated citizens, which in turn led to 
more pro-poor spending.49 In Afghanistan, the moni-
toring of votes cast through cellphone photographs of 
vote totals in polling stations reduced electoral fraud 
in the vote aggregation process.50 In Mozambique, 
SMS messages allowing citizens to report electoral 
irregularities increased voter turnout by 5 percentage 
points.51 And although not evaluated, the use of crowd-
sourcing by Ushahidi and its successor Uchaguzi, 
combined with civil society monitoring, advocacy, 
and partnerships with government, has helped curtail 
election violence in Kenya (box 3.7).52

news media landscape, as internet political opinion is 
dominated by a small group of bloggers and outlets 
that receive the bulk of search engine hits.60 Finally, 
the internet can give voice to extreme opinions by 
enabling highly partisan media outlets to get suf-
fi cient readership and encouraging clustering of 
extreme views, particularly among the more polit-
ically organized and aware, potentially increasing 
polarization in politics.61 

Given that the internet is the main source of news 
for less than 2 percent of the population in South Asia 
and Sub-Saharan Africa,62 the informational effects of 
digital technologies are likely to be mediated through 
traditional media in those regions, as well as else-
where in the developing world. A growing number 
of advocacy organizations in developing countries 
partner with media to provide voters with easy-to-
understand information about politicians. For exam-
ple, Mumbai Votes tracks legislators from Mumbai at 
all levels of government in India, reporting on their 
legislative activity and any court cases fi led against 
them. The Fair Play Alliance of the Slovak Republic 
tracks campaign fi nance and procurement contracts 
to uncover corrupt relationships between businesses 
and politicians.63 

 politics and government policy and increased voter 
turnout.55 In the United States, however, it reduced 
voter turnout and knowledge of policy issues by 
crowding out local radio and newspapers, previously 
the main source of political information.56 

Digital technologies can certainly provide a vari-
ety of tools to improve the informational content of 
voting. For example, Voting Advice Applications are 
websites that enable citizens in several European 
countries to compare the platforms of competing 
political parties with their own preferences on salient 
issues; these increased voter turnout among youth 
in the Netherlands.57 But the internet also offers a 
variety of other entertainment options that compete 
for people’s time and can disengage them from poli-
tics. In Germany and Italy, the internet reduced voter 
turnout by crowding out television, a greater source 
of political information.58 

The internet also provides political parties, blog-
gers, and opinion leaders with resources to shape 
public opinion. For example, a simple “I Voted” 
message on individuals’ Facebook pages increased 
voter turnout by more than 300,000 in the 2010 U.S. 
midterm elections.59 The “winner take all” feature of 
the internet economy is also replicated in the online 

Box 3.7 Improving the integrity of elections through crowdsourcing and 
collaboration 

Improving electoral integrity requires eff ective media, 
nongovernmental organizations, and partnerships between 
technologists, advocacy groups, and government watch-
dogs to gather, analyze, disseminate, and act upon rele-
vant information. Consider the contrasting experiences of 
Ushahidi and Uchaguzi, two digital election-monitoring 
initiatives in Kenya. Ushahidi, one of the best-known digital 
platforms in the world, was launched in the aftermath of 
Kenya’s tumultuous 2007 election and used “citizen report-
ers” to crowdsource and map incidents of violence after 
the election. While the platform galvanized considerable 
interest initially—with more 45,000 users in its fi rst few 
months—many of the reports were not actionable, and there 
was limited response from the authorities. 

Learning from this experience, Ushahidi and a group 
of journalists and civil society organizations launched 
its successor, Uchaguzi, to monitor Kenya’s 2010 consti-
tutional referendum. But this time, the eff ort combined 

citizen crowdsourcing with analysis by specialized civil 
society organizations with experience monitoring elections 
to provide actionable information to local and national 
government offi  cials, in particular the Interim Independent 
Electoral Commission. This partnership was a success, with 
the government responding to a majority of the reports. 

Ushahidi’s implicit belief was that the platform would 
by itself be the agent of change. Uchaguzi—or “Ushahidi 
2.0”—recognizes that the platform can work only if it 
amplifi es existing institutions. The main lesson is that 
governments may be dysfunctional, but can only rarely 
be bypassed. As one of the founders of the initiative 
commented after the local police—infamous in Kenya for 
their venality and brutality—successfully responded to an 
online citizen report of a machete-armed mob gathering 
outside a local polling station, “We can’t compel organi-
zations to act. We can support institutions, but we can’t 
replace them.”

countries by lowering the cost of voting, since votes 
can be cast from the convenience of one’s home. In 
Estonia, where about one-third of voting is online, 
the share of internet voters has increased by more 
than 4 percentage points in almost every election 
since 2005, contributing to an overall increase in 
voter turnout (fi gure 3.15, panel a). Studies show no 
differences in the demographic characteristics of 
internet versus offl ine voters.71 In Brazil, by contrast, 
internet voting on municipal budget proposals in the 
state of Rio Grande do Sul increased voter turnout 
by 8 percent (and these were new voters), but the 
online voters were more likely to be male, university 
educated, and higher-income (fi gure 3.15, panel b).72 

These changes in the demographic profi le of voters 
have not yet changed policy preferences, perhaps 
because the offl ine participatory mechanisms to 
determine the budget proposals that are then voted 
on limit the range of options subject to the vote. But 
they show how the internet can be biased against 
certain groups. 

Overall, then, the evidence suggests that digital 
technologies have helped curtail blatant abuses of 
political offi ce, conditional on supportive institutions 
of accountability (such as independent audit or anti-
corruption bodies) and free media (to generate and 
help disseminate the relevant information to voters). 
Service delivery failures have not been salient enough 
to command the attention of even digitally enabled 
media to infl uence voting decisions by the poor. 

Citizen voice and collective action

“Home run” cases in which a technological 
intervention almost by itself produces dramatic 

increases in accountability . . . are exceedingly 
rare . . . The greatest opportunities [for technology 

are in] amplifying NGO and governmental 
strategies of accountability. 

—Archon Fung, Kennedy School of Government, 
and colleagues

 
One of the more widely held beliefs about the trans-
formative power of digital technologies, particularly 
social media, is its ability to catalyze citizen voice and 
collective action to hold governments accountable. 
The internet promotes transparency by increasing 
the richness and customizability of the information 
for citizens. Less obvious—and unique to these tech-
nologies—is that they also enable citizens to generate 
their own information (user-generated content), 
which can be aggregated at low cost to provide col-

For this digitally enabled political information to 
have impact, it must be easy to understand, be clearly 
attributable to a particular politician, and be credi-
ble. A good example is the uncovering of corruption 
by public offi cials if the information comes from a 
trusted source, such as an independent anticorrup-
tion commission or reliable media outlet. In 2003, 
the federal government of Brazil launched a national 
anticorruption program based on random audits of 
municipal governments by the national audit author-
ity (the municipalities to be audited in a given month 
were chosen by lottery), with results publicly dissem-
inated over radio, television, and print media. Voters 
punished incumbents who were found to be corrupt 
by not reelecting them. The effects were stronger in 
municipalities with local radio stations, pointing to 
the role of local media in informing voters.64 These 
fi ndings have been replicated in studies of municipal 
audits in Mexico, again pointing to the importance 
of a credible source for information on corruption 
(a national audit by an independent and competent 
institution) and local television and radio to dissem-
inate that information for electoral accountability.65 

By contrast, provision of information about fail-
ures in service delivery such as poor education or 
health care, or weak performance of legislatures—
which is more complex and diffi cult to attribute 
to particular politicians—has been less effective.66 
Information campaigns over local radio on public 
health and primary education in rural Benin had no 
effect on the incentives of politicians to provide better 
health and education services or on provider respon-
siveness.67 Informing Indian voters about the perfor-
mance of their legislators in legislative activity had 
no effect on voting behavior; but informing them on 
spending by parliamentarians on physical infrastruc-
ture from funds allotted to them to spend on their 
constituencies did affect voting behavior, since this 
information was more salient to voters.68 Similarly, 
providing information on legislator performance to 
voters in Uganda had no effect on parliamentarians’ 
reelection rates.69 The experience of Open Data Ini-
tiatives is also quite sobering. The mainstream media 
in Kenya, the Philippines, and Uganda have not been 
deeply engaged with the Open Data Initiatives, either 
in using data as a source of evidence in their report-
ing or in reporting on efforts surrounding open data. 
Journalists interviewed said there was no “scoop” in 
the open data story.70 

Digital technologies can also reinforce socioeco-
nomic disparities in voter participation and knowl-
edge, particularly in developing countries. Internet 
voting has increased participation in some European

technology-enabled effects hold for collective action 
around the more mundane service delivery failures. 
Identifying the precise government failure is much 
more diffi cult for services—these after all are hidden 
from the public eye in classrooms, rural health cen-
ters, and in the substandard materials used to con-
struct roads—just as is clearly attributing the failure 
itself to the actions of a particular individual or group 
of individuals. These failures only rarely become 
salient in fl ashpoint events like scandals or egregious 
abuses of public authority, such as the excessive use 
of force by the police or a patient dying because of 
poor care. And they cannot be addressed by the sim-
ple “stroke of the pen” actions that protests tend to 
mobilize around, such as jailing a corrupt politician. 
Instead, they require sustained reforms to improve 
government capability, which in turn requires sus-
tained citizen voice and collective action. 

Given these diffi culties in monitoring service 
failures, it is not surprising that the large academic 
empirical literature on nondigital instruments of col-
lective action—citizen and community report cards, 
complaint mechanisms, community monitoring of 
service providers—presents frustratingly mixed evi-
dence of impact.79 The main lesson is that the success 
of citizen collective action around service delivery 
failures depends on contextual factors, and each of 

lective voice through crowdsourcing or community 
mapping. Social media can facilitate collective action 
by generating peer pressure as individuals observe 
the behavior and actions of others, improving within- 
group monitoring, reducing free-riding, and enabling 
groups to better coordinate their actions around 
specifi c events such as protests.73 These technologies 
also provide new platforms for citizens to engage 
with the government, lowering the costs to citizens 
of providing information, and enabling policy makers 
and service providers to seek information and track 
the feedback loop. 

As a growing empirical literature shows, cell- 
phones and the use of Twitter and Facebook aided 
protests during the Arab Spring in the Arab Republic 
of Egypt,74 widespread demonstrations on social 
issues in Chile in 2011,75 antiwar demonstrations in 
the United States,76 and citizen mobilization across 
Africa, with the effect more pronounced in nondemo-
cratic political systems where traditional channels for 
articulating interest were limited.77 The same mecha-
nisms also imply that digital technologies can trigger 
harmful collective action, like ethnic confl ict.78 

Social media have the unique ability to make 
scandals and highly emotive government abuses 
of authority “go viral” and trigger parallel physical 
citizen mobilization. But it is less clear that similar

what is likely to work and under what conditions.82 
The focus here is on digital channels that are initiated 
by civil society organizations (CSOs) and donors to 
pressure governments, and that publicize the inputs 
provided by citizens so as to expose the behavior of 
service providers to public scrutiny. This analysis 
excludes government-initiated portals, which are 
more accurately characterized as user feedback 
mechanisms to improve service quality, and not as 
citizen empowerment or accountability initiatives, 
and which were discussed earlier. 

The analysis distinguishes 17 cases in 12 countries 
by whether the mechanism for expressing citizen 
preferences and views is individual or collective; 
whether the CSO or donor that led the initiative also 
had explicit partnerships with the concerned gov-
ernment; and whether there was also parallel offl ine 
mobilization accompanying the digital voice channel 
(table 3.3). Impact is measured in two ways: citizen 

the links in the causal chain between transparency, 
citizen action, and state action can break down if these 
factors are not aligned. How credible, salient, and 
comprehensible is the information to citizens?80 How 
willing and able are citizens to act on the information 
individually or collectively? How effective are inter-
mediary organizations—civil society, media, interest 
groups—to organize citizens or to lobby governments 
on their behalf? And most important, do state actors 
have the incentive and capacity for action, thereby 
“closing the loop”? Action and impact are more likely 
if the social accountability initiative is embedded in 
a citizen-state interface and synchronized with top-
down government accountability initiatives.81 

Digital citizen voice initiatives for improving ser-
vice delivery have multiplied rapidly, but no rigorous 
studies have evaluated their impact. An organizing 
framework is needed to classify these examples and 
draw the necessarily tentative conclusions about

result: The Supreme Court declared these funds 
unconstitutional.85 

What stands out, though, is the high proportion of 
cases that have both low citizen uptake and low gov-
ernment response. Most of the cases that lacked part-
nerships between CSOs and governments were unsuc-
cessful. Maji Matone (Tanzania), for example, received 
only 53 SMS messages during its fi rst six months of 
operation, against an initial target of 3,000, and the 
mobile platform was abandoned. Other disappoint-
ments are Huduma (Kenya),86 I Paid a Bribe (India), and 
Check My School (the Philippines). Despite high expec-
tations, they have not generated much citizen uptake 
or government resolution of the reported problem—in 
some cases, despite government collaboration. 

Uganda’s U-report, perhaps the highest profi le 
initiative, is an SMS-based platform that runs weekly 
polls with registered users (U-reporters) on issues 
ranging from child marriage to access to education, 
which are then both broadly disseminated and tar-
geted to members of parliament for action. The plat-
form has had considerable citizen uptake, but mostly 
by the more privileged groups. Of close to 300,000 
U-reporters, nearly half have some university edu-
cation, and one-quarter are government employees, 
raising questions about whose voices are being pro-
jected.87 This high uptake has not led to any noticeable 
government action. Surveys of online political partic-
ipation in the United States also fi nd that better-off 
and more-educated citizens are more likely to partic-
ipate in both online and offl ine political activities.88

In sum, the success of digital citizen voice is con-
ditional on willing and able policy makers, a collab-
orative approach with government, and signifi cant 
offl ine activism by strong civil society organizations 
so that the collective voice of citizens can pressure 
governments. However, digital platforms can also 
enhance unaccountable governments’ capacity for 
surveillance and control (box 3.8). 

The gap between 
technology and institutions
The internet largely, but not entirely, reinforces 
rather than replaces preexisting relationships of 
accountability between governments and citizens, 
and it complements rather than substitutes for exist-
ing government capabilities. The main explanation 
for the varying impact of digital technologies lies 
in the mismatch—or gap—between rapidly chang-
ing technology and slowly changing political and 
administrative institutions. Political institutions can 

uptake, given that uptake can be considered a neces-
sary condition for government responsiveness; and 
government action to resolve the service issue, which 
is the ultimate objective of the citizen voice initiative. 
The criterion for selecting the cases is simple avail-
ability of information. The examples have received 
media and donor attention, and some data are avail-
able on citizen use of the channel and on government 
response.

Of the 17 cases, 3 had high impact in terms of 
government responsiveness, 3 had medium impact, 
and 11 had low impact. All the high-impact examples 
involve partnerships between CSOs and government, 
suggesting that platforms that both channel citizen 
voice and link them to the government’s internal work 
order systems to effi ciently address the complaints 
are more likely to succeed. For example, Por Mi Barrio 
in Uruguay and I Change My City in India, two suc-
cessful CSO platforms, are connected to existing gov-
ernment complaint systems. That enables urban resi-
dents to report problems using both the CSO and the 
government channel, with the complaints and gov-
ernment responses displayed on a map, thus inform-
ing and validating the citizen action and naming and 
shaming the nonperforming government units. But 
not all initiatives involving government-CSO partner-
ships led to high responsiveness. For instance, I Paid a 
Bribe (India) and Check My School (Philippines) both 
had low impact. Seen together, these fi ndings seem to 
suggest that while collaboration with government is 
not a suffi cient condition for success, it may well be 
a necessary one.

Another ingredient for success is effective offl ine 
mobilization, particularly because citizen uptake of 
the digital channels was low in most of the cases.83 
Online petitions on Change.org are more likely to be 
successful when sponsored by an organization, and 
citizen campaigns through Pressure Pan (Brazil) are 
three times more likely to succeed when supported 
by Pressure Pan staff.84 Lungisa, a platform for Cape 
Town residents to report service delivery problems, 
involves signifi cant follow-up by the CSO staff to 
ensure that the responsible government agency acts 
on the complaints. Rappler, a media and advocacy 
organization in the Philippines, combines media, 
technology, and the power of crowdsourcing to iden-
tify and amplify governance issues, with traditional 
citizen mobilization strategies using investigative 
journalists and social mobilizers. Rappler orga-
nizes community protests, the most dramatic one 
being the Philippines’s fi rst protests organized with 
social media against a corruption scandal involving 
congressional discretionary funds. The eventual

and policy makers need to have the incentives to 
make these investments. 

Bureaucracies can have a disincentive to reor-
ganize their work to take full advantage of digital 
technologies. In the private sector, market competi-
tion forces fi rms to change and rewards them with 
higher profi ts for their investments. In contrast, in 

be distinguished by whether they are clientelist or pro-
poor, and bureaucracies can be classifi ed by whether 
they are patronage-based or performance-oriented.89 
These institutions, and their characteristics, matter 
because effective adoption of technology in organi-
zations requires signifi cant investments in skills and 
changes in working arrangements, and politicians 

Box 3.8 Digital technologies can strengthen control 

The internet presents a “dictator’s dilemma” for autocra-
cies. Restricting the internet can hurt economic develop-
ment, but leaving it unfettered can threaten the govern-
ment by increasing citizens’ access to political information 
and facilitating collective action. Autocratic governments 
have responded to this dilemma in sophisticated ways, 
taking advantage of the tools that the internet itself off ers 
to improve services while strengthening control. 

Autocracies have invested in e-government, particularly 
in e-services. The relationship between online services and 
government type is U-shaped, with both more democratic 
and more autocratic governments scoring high on the 

United Nations’ online service index compared to the ones 
in the middle (fi gure B3.8.1). This pattern suggests that 
improvements in basic service delivery can be independent 
of a country’s political system.a Autocracies are, however, 
becoming more adept at monitoring the internet to censor 
criticism entirely or circumvent protests, to spread pro-
paganda, or to learn about public grievances to improve 
government responsiveness while also intervening to pre-
vent specifi c instances of collective action that challenge 
the government’s power.b Digital technologies therefore 
provide opportunities for autocracies to improve service 
delivery while maintaining control.

importance of these complementarities of skills, orga-
nizational changes, and issues specifi c to the public 
sector, such as procurement rules, as conditioning the 
impact of e-government. 

The extent of the institutional dependence of dig-
ital technologies in achieving impacts varies by the 
type of service and activity, based on three factors: the 
degree to which citizens have an incentive to monitor 
the service and provide feedback; the extent to which 
the processes for the production and delivery of the 
service or activity are based on tasks that can be made 
routine and standardized; and the measurability and 
extent to which the outputs and outcomes from the 
task can be attributed to particular public actors 
or actions (fi gure 3.17). Services and activities that 
citizens have an incentive to monitor, and that are 
measurable and attributable to the efforts of specifi c 
government offi cials, are compatible with political 
incentives. Improving them yields immediate politi-
cal benefi ts, as citizens care about these services, can 
assess the service improvement, and can attribute 
this improvement to actions by policy makers and 
providers. If their delivery is based on repeatable, rou-
tine tasks, these are more amenable to automation or 
digitally enabled monitoring. These services are less 

government, effi ciency improvements can reduce an 
agency’s budget and staff.90 Adopting new technolo-
gies also requires learning new skills and changing 
processes, which can add to the workload, at least ini-
tially, with unclear career rewards in patronage-based 
civil service systems, particularly given the diffi culties 
in measuring the productivity of government agen-
cies. Ministries and departments compete against one 
another for scarce budgetary resources, leading to a 
silo mentality and resistance to horizontal collabora-
tion. Most important, the automation of business pro-
cesses and improved monitoring reduce bureaucratic 
discretion and opportunities for petty corruption in 
patronage-based systems. 

In the absence of market competition, overcom-
ing bureaucratic resistance to digital technologies 
requires strong political leadership. But political 
incentives may also not be aligned with digital tech-
nologies. Many e-government projects take a long 
time to implement and thus elicit little interest from 
political leaders whose preferences are governed by 
short election cycles. In clientelist political institu-
tions, politicians are accountable largely to a narrow 
group of elites. Digital technologies, by promoting 
transparency and enhanced tracking and monitoring 
of resources, can curtail avenues for rent-seeking—
“grand corruption,” in contrast to the petty corruption 
of service providers—that underpin these informal 
political institutions. And citizens continue to face 
signifi cant barriers to voice and collective action 
that digital technologies have not signifi cantly ame-
liorated. Lifting these barriers depends more on the 
strength of an independent media, supreme audit and 
anticorruption agencies, and civil CSOs as sources of 
credible information and as intermediaries between 
the citizen and the state. 

E-government projects funded by the World Bank 
are more successful in countries with stronger insti-
tutions (fi gure 3.16). While project performance var-
ies considerably within countries, project outcomes 
across countries, as self-evaluated by the World Bank, 
are strongly positively linked to the quality of gov-
ernment institutions, as measured by the Worldwide 
Governance Indicators. 

There is considerable evidence of the comple-
mentarity between technology and the organization 
of work in attaining productivity improvements in 
the private sector.91 The few empirical studies that 
investigate these complementarities for government 
have similar fi ndings. For example, investments in 
information technology by police departments in 
the United States lowered crime rates only when 
accompanied by signifi cant organizational changes.92 

The mixed record of automation also underlines the

 utility services like household water and electricity. 
The tasks to deliver some of these services, like cash 
transfers or fi ling taxes, are largely rule-based and 
clerical, or follow a standardized set of procedures, 
and ensuring the timely processing of work orders 
is enough to deliver the service. These features help 
explain the successful uses of digital technologies for 
welfare payments, water provision, property and busi-
ness registration discussed earlier, including through 
citizen feedback on service quality. It also explains the 
success of various m-health initiatives. Automating 
these tasks does require breaking down departmental 
silos and changing administrative processes, but the 
quick, easily visible, and easily attributable service 
improvements to citizens can yield political benefi ts 
that even clientelist politicians might have an interest 
in supporting, though the political economy consid-
erations vary by activity. The mixed impact of e-fi ling 
systems for example, refl ects how these reforms can 
often confl ict with elite interests and are likely more 
dependent on institutional complements. 

By contrast, teaching, policing, and management 
are tasks for which no “user manual” can be written, 
since providers are confronted daily with unique 
circumstances and must exercise signifi cant judg-
ment on how to respond.93 As a result, these tasks are 
particularly susceptible to problems of asymmetric 

conditional on the strength of the initial institutions 
and relatively amenable to improvements through 
digital technology.

By contrast, services that citizens do not have an 
incentive to monitor and that are less measurable 
and attributable do not yield political benefi ts to 
politicians. If the delivery of these services is based 
on tasks that are highly discretionary, policy makers 
have less infl uence over the providers responsible 
for these services. These services and activities are 
much more dependent on the quality of existing 
institutions; improvements through the application 
of digital technologies are only incremental. This 
variation helps explain the differential impact of dig-
ital technologies across the elements of government 
capability and citizen empowerment summarized 
in the table 3.1 and 3.2 scorecards, and why digital 
technologies can substitute for poor institutions for 
certain activities and can only complement existing 
institutions for others.

Citizens and businesses have an incentive to 
monitor private goods or services that they use very 
frequently. These include the variety of registration 
and licensing services offered in one-stop centers; 
fi ling taxes; welfare payments; family-oriented 
health services and self-care such as neonatal health 
and patients’ adherence to treatment schedules; and

institutions, technology can substitute for weak ini-
tial institutions for certain services, and in the process 
also help improve those institutions. That has been 
evident in the example of MajiVoice in Kenya, where 
automation quickly transformed a patronage-based 
water utility to a performance-oriented one, and in 
the examples of institutional transformation trig-
gered by digital identifi cation. Moreover, the consid-
erable heterogeneity of institutions within countries, 
varying by sector and locale, creates many openings 
for innovations that are specifi c to a given context.94 

How should this institutional heterogeneity be 
classifi ed to help guide policies? Under clientelism, 
policies are more likely to be adopted if they generate 
immediate and highly visible service improvements 
to citizens without reducing the rents of vested inter-
ests. In patronage-based bureaucracies, reforms are 
more likely to succeed if they do not require signifi -
cant changes in administrative processes or much 
collaboration across agencies, or threaten the bureau-
cracy with staffi ng and budgetary reductions. Under 
pro-poor political institutions, there can be greater 
political ownership in reforming bureaucracies to 
strengthen government capability, and in transpar-
ency and accountability initiatives. Performance-
oriented bureaucracies have the incentive to engage 
with ambitious initiatives, including the long-
duration and less visible administrative automation 
that often elicits little enthusiasm from politicians. 

More generally, the variation in institutional 
dependency by the nature of the service and activ-
ity opens reform possibilities and can be a guide for 
policies in different country contexts, as discussed in 
chapter 5.

Notes
 1.  The 2004 World Development Report, Making Ser-

vices Work for Poor People, underlined that service 
delivery failures are largely about failures of account-
ability and weak government implementation 
capacity, not about poor policies or lack of resources. 
It showed how relationships of accountability—
between citizens and policy makers, between policy 
makers and service providers, and between citizens 
and providers—determine outcomes. Unaccount-
able politicians target policies and public spending 
to a narrow set of elites rather than providing public 
goods to benefi t the general population. Managers 
and providers are unresponsive to policy makers 
and to citizens, often using their positions to extract 
rents. And poor citizens are unable to organize col-
lectively to pressure policy makers and providers to 
address service delivery failures. See also Pritchett, 
Woolcock, and Andrews 2010.

information. As discussed, it is diffi cult for digital 
technologies to make a difference beyond addressing 
basic problems of provider absenteeism. Citizens also 
often lack the incentive or capacity to monitor these 
services, either because they are public goods (for 
example, security), or are less visible (classroom teach-
ing or government administration). These diffi culties 
in measurability, and therefore “attributability,” also 
make it hard for citizens to hold providers and pol-
iticians accountable for performance through elec-
tions—beyond deterring electoral fraud and voting 
out corrupt politicians. They also make it diffi cult for 
citizen collective action to be effective in the absence 
of a strong civil society or willing governments to 
partner with. These are services and activities where 
institutions matter much more for outcomes. Digital 
technologies cannot replace weak institutions.

Between these two extremes are the mixed cases 
where digital technologies can improve some aspects 
of the service or activity. Roads and other public infra-
structure, fi nancial management, and government 
procurement are activities with low incentives for cit-
izens to monitor because the service is a public good, 
or not visible to citizens; however, the measurability 
and attributability of outcomes may be high, and the 
delivery process may have some elements that can 
be automated (such as construction). E-procurement 
of complex goods, such as e-government systems, 
cannot entirely remove discretion in the evaluation 
of different bids, but it does establish audit trails and 
performance indicators. Curative and preventive 
health care are private and public goods, respectively, 
and so differ in the citizens’ incentive to monitor 
(although vaccinating children is a preventive mea-
sure that parents are likely to have an incentive to 
monitor). But the highly discretionary nature of 
clinical services and the diffi culties in measuring the 
outcomes of treatment render curative health care 
more diffi cult to improve through the application of 
technology than preventive health campaigns that 
follow more relatively standardized procedures (such 
as control of communicable diseases). 

The future of public services 
This varying interaction between institutions and 
digital technology provides entry points for reform 
in different country contexts to improve public ser-
vice delivery. This institutional perspective does not 
imply that digitally enabled reforms must wait for 
a country’s institutions to improve to have impact. 
Digital technologies can also strengthen institutions. 
In countries with clientelist and patronage-based

 2.  Based on the Online Service Index (OSI), published 
by the United Nations Department of Economic 
and Social Affairs. The OSI assesses the range and 
functionality of government-to-citizen (G2C) and 
government-to-business (G2B) services offered 
on the national website of each of the UN’s 193 
member states, from simple one-way provision of 
information, to two-way interaction, to integrated 
“one-stop” portals. This functionality is based on the 
standard three-stage classifi cation of e-services in 
the literature. Informational services are basic web-
sites where citizens can obtain information on gov-
ernment ministries and agencies, access archives, 
and download forms to apply for public services. 
Transactional services are chiefl y two-way online 
communications for governments to share informa-
tion and solicit feedback, and often on government 
websites that process fi nancial transactions, such as 
electronic tax fi ling. Connected services are citizen-
centric, whole-of-government services. Institutional 
reform and advanced technologies enable citizens to 
automatically receive benefi ts based on life-cycle or 
economic characteristics. They also allow agencies 
to easily share data to facilitate service delivery. And 
they encourage accountability through monitor-
ing and feedback mechanisms. Depending on the 
intended benefi ciary, these services can be classifi ed 
as government-to-government (G2G), G2C, or G2B 
(UN 2014).

 3.  For this Report, the World Bank has developed 
two indexes to measure e-government. The Core 
Systems index measures the automation and inte-
gration of core G2G fi nancial and human resource 
management systems, as well as revenue-related 
G2B and G2C systems, in 198 countries, drawing 
on a global dataset of e-government systems devel-
oped by the World Bank. The Digital Identifi cation 
Systems index measures the presence and scope of 
digital identifi cation systems in government that 
can serve as a foundational platform technology for 
myriad G2G, G2C, and G2B services, also drawing 
on a global dataset of these systems developed by 
the World Bank. These datasets were prepared by a 
World Bank team comprising Cem Dener, Sophiko 
Skhirtladze, Irene H. Zhang, and Doruk Yarin 
Kiroglu.

 48.  Based on data from Bishop and Hoeffl er 2014. Six 
indicators relate to the freeness of the electoral 
process before election day: the legal framework, 
electoral management bodies, electoral rights, voter 
register, ballot access, and campaign process. Four 
indicators relate to the fairness of voting and events 
on or immediately after election day: media access, 
voting process, role of offi cials, and counting of 
votes. Each indicator has several criteria that must 
be met for it to be coded as “1” for the given election. 
If there is a suffi cient body of data to conclude that 
the conditions are not met, the indicator is coded 
as “0.” An election is considered free when at least 
four of the six relevant indicators are coded as “1.” An 
election is considered “fair” when at least two of the 
four relevant indicators are coded as “1.”

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

Providing rural health care is a major challenge in 
countries with large rural populations. For example, 
in Ethiopia, more than 80 percent of the population 
lives outside of urban areas and more than 30 per-
cent of the rural population is poor. Since 2003, the 
Ethiopian government has trained and deployed over 
40,000 Health Extension Workers (HEWs) to serve 
rural and other hard-to-reach populations. However, 
HEWs are often isolated and lack the capacity to pri-
oritize urgent but unpredictable antenatal and post-
natal care. 

To improve information fl ows, the World Bank, the 
African Development Bank, and Addis Ababa Univer-
sity developed the FrontlineSMS platform.1 HEWs can 
register pregnant women and newborns and receive 
automated short message service (SMS) reminders 
to notify them of key appointments and to track the 
stock of essential medicines. An evaluation showed 
that by using existing mobile networks and low-cost 
feature phones, the system improved the ability 
of health workers to deliver services and improve 
health outcomes. More women had skilled assistance 
with their delivery, more women delivered in health 
centers, and more women received antenatal care. 
The system improved HEWs’ capacity to respond in 
a timely manner and shows that in a context where 
internet coverage is low, mobile phones can be an 
effective way to improve health system performance.2 

The internet and associated technologies have 
the potential to expand health services in developing 
countries, increase health system effi ciency, and lead 
to better patient outcomes. E-health encompasses the 

full range of uses of information and communication 
technologies (ICTs)—from traditional administrative 
reporting systems to broader Health Management 
Information Systems (HMIS) to telemedicine, elec-
tronic medical records, clinical decision support, and 
patient portals—and a full range of technologies, 
including internet and mobile applications.3 

Public health and clinical care cannot be delivered 
safely, with high quality and in a cost-effective man-
ner, without seamless, sustainable, and secure data 
and information exchange at all levels of the health 
system. By 2011, 93 of 112 health systems in countries 
surveyed by the World Health Organization (WHO) 
had already adopted some form of an e-health or 
m-health (mobile phone–based) approach, mostly for 
information programs, emergencies, and telemedi-
cine. Yet overall, deployment has been slow. Too often 
data are captured in a way that cannot be shared as 
needed because of interoperability issues or a lack of 
standards regarding the exchange of health informa-
tion. Sometimes data are captured multiple times in 
multiple ways, leading to duplication, inaccuracies, 
and delays. Often they are not captured at all. 

Low- and middle-income countries can do better. 
First, they can build on the emerging experience of 
developed countries and adapt systems to local con-
ditions to benefi t from e-health without repeating 
others’ mistakes. For example, Montenegro chose 
“strategic interoperability” as a leading principle 
in developing its e-health system (fi gure F3.1). This 
includes integrative and long-term investment 
planning and phased implementation; central devel-
opment for common resources such as shared code-
books and key registries of insured persons, drugs, 
health professionals, and health institutions; shared 

e-health

information system infrastructure; and central devel-
opment of key applications, including electronic 
health records, e-prescriptions, and e-referrals. Imple-
mentation sequencing “starts where the money is” 
(the Health Insurance Fund Information System) and 
progresses along the elements of e-health develop-
ment, taking effi ciency and monetary incentives into 
account. Most business processes are now computer-
ized, serving 340 locations and 4,600 users, including 
general practitioners and nurses in primary and 
emergency care, hospitals, pharmacies, and private 
dentists. Systems are integrated and optimized by use 
of shared resources. Routine reporting systems pro-
vide complete and reliable data. Information is used 
to make policy-making and management decisions, 
and effi ciency has improved throughout the system.4

Second, the absence of “legacy systems” can be 
an advantage. Countries can now make use of cloud 
computing to lower system costs and mobile tech-
nology to expand services to even the poorest and 
most remote locations. The potential value of e-health 
can arguably be greater in poorer countries, since it 

expands the reach and impact of the often very small 
number of highly trained physicians, assists clinical 
staff in rural and remote areas in making better diag-
noses and treatment decisions, and helps make the 
best use of limited health care funding.

There is early evidence to suggest that e-health solu-
tions, while costly to implement, can bring signifi cant 
cost savings. This is because the implementation of 
human resources information systems, logistics man-
agement information systems, clinical decision sup-
port tools, digital payments, fi nancial management 
information systems, and SMS reminder systems can 
address a variety of health system problems, including 
system ineffi ciencies, overuse of procedures, inappro-
priate hospital admissions, corruption and fraud, and 
missed appointments.

Effective country ownership, good governance, 
and strong institutional and human capacity are 
core to e-health planning and implementation. This 
includes a strong legal basis for managing health-
related data with appropriate safeguards.5 In addition 
to ensuring that health workers are able to effectively

use such systems, this also implies the need for strong 
health informatics training programs in order to 
develop a qualifi ed e-health workforce. National plan-
ning, enterprise architecture, standardization, and 
interoperability are essential for successful e-health 
implementation.

User-centered health care systems should leverage 
the unique capacity of citizens to contribute infor-
mation and feedback. This enables health systems 
to connect with clients when and where needed, but 
clients can also access information and care, at their 
convenience. 

Replacing paper-based patient registers with 
electronic registers should help improve local health 
care quality and inform management decision mak-
ing. Similarly, increasing the use of e-health and 
m-health approaches and tools can support improved 
decision making by frontline providers, including 
GPS-enabled tools and harnessing the revolution that 
smartphone access to broadband content will bring 
about in developing countries. In this regard, more 
emphasis is needed to expand and improve the use 
and functionality of open-source software platforms 
(for example, OpenMRS, OpenLMIS, and iHRIS); 
develop new open-source platforms (for example, for 
health insurance and training); and support open-
source frameworks (for example, OpenHIE).6 

Information and communication technology 
platforms (web, social media, SMS campaigns, direct 
access to personal data in electronic health records) 
can be leveraged to enhance accountability, trans-
parency, and empowerment of citizens to be active 
contributors to governance in health and central to 
health care delivery.

194 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

Individuals need mechanisms to identify one another 
and to identify themselves to their communities and 
governments. While this point may be obvious, it 
is profoundly important for people’s welfare. Sim-
ple mechanisms—familiarity, appearance, perhaps 
vouching by an elder—are sufficient in small, intimate 
communities. Wider societies and economies require 
more formal systems—traditionally physical tokens, 
such as a paper-based identification (ID) card that 
includes the signatures or representations of their 
holders, and is verified against documents stored in 
a central registry. But these formal systems are fail-
ing in the developing world. Nearly 2.4 billion people 
are not registered. They are usually the poorest and 
most marginalized members of society; about one- 
quarter are children.1 They are excluded from a range 
of rights and services, such as health care, enrollment 
in school, social welfare, and financial services.

Identity should be a public good. Its importance is 
now recognized in the post-2015 development agenda, 
specifically as a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 
target to “promote peaceful and inclusive societies for 
sustainable development, provide access to justice 
for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive 
institutions at all levels.” 2 One of the indicators is to 
“provide legal identity for all, including birth regis-
tration, by 2030.” The best way to achieve this goal 
is through digital identity (digital ID) systems, central 
registries storing personal data in digital form and 
credentials that rely on digital, rather than physical, 
mechanisms to authenticate the identity of their 
holder.  India’s massive Aadhaar program, which has 
enrolled over 950 million people, has dispensed with 
the physical ID card altogether. Estonia has created 

an electronic legal representation of an individual. 
Through the use of personal identification numbers 
(PINs) to authenticate the holder against a digital card 
credential, people can access public services remotely 
and even sign legal documents and contracts with the 
same legal validity as if they were signed in person.

Country-specific use of 
digital identity
Most developing countries have some form of digital 
ID scheme tied to specific functions and serving a 
subset of the population, but only a few have a multi-
purpose scheme that covers the entire population. 
Eighteen percent of developing countries have a 
scheme that is used for identification purposes only; 
55 percent have digital IDs that are used for specific 
functions and services like voting, cash transfers, 
or health; and only 3 percent have foundational ID 
schemes that can be used to access an array of online 
and offline services (figure S4.1). Twenty-four percent 
of developing countries have no digital ID system.

Although the concept of digital ID is universal, 
it plays somewhat different roles depending on the 
country context. In high-income countries, digital ID 
represents an upgrade from well-established, robust 
legacy physical ID systems that have worked reason-
ably well in the past. Belgium, Estonia, Finland, France, 
the Republic of Korea, and Singapore are some of the  
countries leveraging existing physical identity infra-
structure to create digital ID ecosystems, enabling 
them to deliver public services more efficiently.

Low-income countries, by contrast, often lack 
robust civil registration systems and physical IDs 
and are building their ID systems on a digital basis, 
leapfrogging the more traditional physically based

 system. Identification, rather than e-services, is the 
main immediate goal. Such systems are being devel-
oped in Bangladesh, Guinea, and Kenya. One potential 
risk associated with leapfrogging to civil identifica-
tion systems without a solid civil registration system 
is that in many cases the 0–18 population is excluded, 
and continues to be unregistered.

In middle-income countries, digital ID is strength-
ening and progressively replacing physical identity 
services while supporting the emergence of some 
e-services. Successful examples are found in Albania, 
India, Moldova, and Pakistan.

Evidence of impact
Evidence of the impact of digital ID is still largely 
anecdotal, but there is a growing body of research 
in at least three key areas—efficient management of 
social welfare programs, removing ghost workers 
from the government payroll, and improving the 
sanctity of elections. 

Efficient management of social programs 
and welfare distribution
Digital IDs enable targeted cash transfers to bank 
accounts linked to a unique identifier. This ensures 
that those who are entitled to receive subsidies or 
benefits are actually getting them. For example, in 
India’s fuel subsidy program, implementing cash 
transfers to Aadhaar-linked bank accounts to buy liq-
uefied petroleum gas cylinders saved about US$1 bil-
lion per year when applied throughout the country.3 

This is just one of many subsidy programs in India 
that are being converted to direct transfers using digi-
tal ID, potentially saving over US$11 billion per year in 
government expenditures through reduced leakage 
and efficiency gains.4 Other examples of the benefits 
of digital ID in reducing leakages for social protection 
or security programs, health insurance, and pension 
schemes due to duplicates, “ghost” beneficiaries, and 
corruption are occurring in Chile, the Arab Republic 
of Egypt, Ghana, Indonesia, Pakistan, South Africa, 
and Turkey. 

Removing ghost employees from the 
government payroll
The budgets of many developing countries suffer 
from bloated civil service wages that leave little room 
for capital investments. For example, the public 
payroll occupies the bulk of the national budgets of 
Ghana, Uganda, and Zimbabwe, but weak systems 
imply that many individuals paid from the payroll do 
not actually work for the government, and may not 
even be alive.5 Nigeria recently implemented a digital 
ID system for civil servants that enabled it to remove 
about 62,000 such ghost workers, saving US$1 billion 
annually, and providing a return on investment of 
nearly 20,000 percent in one year.6 The impact of 
ghost workers is even worse in many other countries, 
ranging from 10 percent to as high as an estimated 
40 percent in Zimbabwe, pointing to the substantial 
fiscal savings and efficiency gains from digital ID.7

Improving electoral integrity 
Nigeria used digital IDs to prevent vote rigging in its 
2015 elections.8 The system enrolled about 68 million 
voters using biometrics (issuing voter cards that 
encoded the fingerprints of the rightful holder on a 
chip) and used card readers to authenticate voters, 
thus preventing 4 million duplicate votes. Although 
there were some operational challenges at the polls, 
the election was conducted successfully: all votes 
were cast, and it was difficult to rig or contest the 
results in the face of the transparency brought about 
by digital identity. However, other countries, such as 
Kenya and Somalia, have not reaped the same benefits 
from the biometric voter IDs.9 Therefore, this remains 
an area of further research.

Developing effective digital 
ID schemes
Digital ID schemes rely on a backbone of connected 
systems, databases, and civil or population registries. 
These in turn have been established through a thor-
ough enrollment process of the targeted population.

Many programs now include the use of both biomet-
ric data and traditional biographical data, as well as 
programs to eliminate duplicate enrollments to help 
ensure that each individual has only one registered 
identity and one unique identifying number.

The digital record is the basis for issuance of 
 credentials, which may be cards equipped with bar 
codes or more advanced chip-based smart cards; they 
can also be single-function (and provide evidence 
only of identity) or multifunctional, with the card 
able to act as a bank card, driving license, and so on. 
India’s Aadhaar program dispenses with the card 
altogether, providing remote authentication based 
on the holder’s fingerprints or iris scan.10 Online and 
mobile environments require enhanced authentica-
tion features—such as electronic trust services, which 
include e-signatures, e-seals, and time stamps—to add 
confidence in electronic transactions.

Mobile devices offer a compelling proposition for 
governments seeking to provide identity credentials 
and widespread access to digital services. In Sub- 
Saharan Africa, for example, more than half of the 
population in some countries is without official 
ID, but more than two-thirds of the residents in the 
region have a mobile phone subscription. The devel-
oping world is home to more than 6 billion of the 
world’s 7 billion mobile subscriptions, making this a 
technology with considerable potential for registra-
tion, storage, and management of digital identity. 

For a digital ID system to be effective, it must be 
rooted in an upgraded legal framework that consid-
ers the accessibility and protective measures of the 
system; clear definitions for the interconnectivity 
and interoperability with other (administrative or 
functional) registries; and coordinated investments 
throughout the country in information and commu-
nication technology (ICT) to develop a reliable and 
secure platform. 

Digital identification systems may be developed in 
response to a specific application (elections, tax, social 
protection or security, pensions, health insurance, 
and the like), referred to as functional schemes.11 Or they 
may be developed as universal multipurpose systems 
capable of supporting the entire range of needs for 
legal identity across all applications, known as founda-
tional identity schemes. This distinction between func-
tional and foundational systems is not immutable 
over time; often functional ones evolve to become 
foundational (in Bangladesh, Haiti, and Mexico, voter 
ID has become de facto national ID). No matter what 
the country context is, the priority should be to confer 
identity for all, either through a universal founda-
tional scheme or through harmonization of the mul-

titude of existing functional systems, so that in their 
totality they achieve full coverage. 

Risks and mitigation
Digital ID schemes tend to be complex, are often 
politicized, and are subject to failure to deliver on 
high expectations. Risks associated with unsuccess-
ful implementation can be mitigated by adopting 
guidelines that have emerged from the collective 
experience of digital ID schemes’ rollouts around the 
world.12 In this respect, several areas of focus emerge 
as critical:

•  Legal and regulatory concerns about how to best deter-
mine the types, extent, and use of information col-
lected under digital ID schemes; how to safeguard 
the privacy of personal data; and how to craft new 
primary legislation or rules to avoid unintended 
consequences such as inadvertent exclusions, 
onerous mandates that could deter individuals 
from accessing services, or increased rent-seeking 
involving registration or certificates.

•  Institutional and administrative concerns about the 
institutional location of the civil and identification 
registries, and their interaction with functional 
registries or line ministries that need to verify or 
authenticate identities of beneficiaries or clients. 
The legal or foundational registries are traditionally 
located in the ministry of interior, justice, or home 
affairs; and more recently in special-purpose agen-
cies independent of any line ministry (or loosely 
affiliated with one), and reporting to the center of 
government. Without effective coordination, there 
is a risk of a patchwork of competing schemes that 
would lack interoperability and consistency. The 
risk of exclusion would also be higher, as partic-
ipation in functional IDs is a matter of program 
eligibility and not a birthright, as in foundational 
schemes.13

•  Technological concerns about working with the pri-
vate sector to develop a sustainable digital infra-
structure that can reach remote areas and prevent 
exclusion; ensure interoperability and trusted 
authentication protocols for data exchange among 
different services and solution providers; and 
ensure data security, particularly in the use of bio-
metrics, as well as the long-term accessibility and 
security of identity records.   

•  Business models and procurement concerns engendered 
by technology solutions that are tied to specific ven-
dors; lack of open architecture anchored on modu-
larity and open standards; lack of costing guidance

of various IT components; and absence of viable 
business models and digital ID–enabled services’ 
uptake.

•  Country-specific and cross-border concerns about what 
constitutes acceptable unique identifying creden-
tials. This can differ across countries and applica-
tions, even as the world has taken steps to define 
standards for the mutual recognition of foreign 
citizens’ credentials. Uses of digital ID schemes 
for tracking of ethnic groups and other nefarious 
purposes may be enabled by the recent advances 
in “big data” analytics that allow information to  
be collected and analyzed on an unprecedented 
scale.

Overcoming these challenges and barriers requires 
strong leadership, a supportive legal framework, 
interagency cooperation, mobilization of financial 
and human resources, and, critically, the trust of 
users. Incentives, technology, foreign assistance, 
and reforms will all be critical in achieving tangible 
results. Equally important is donor coordination at 
the global, regional, and national levels to ensure 
inclusive oversight and concerted global action.

staff projections, drawing on the findings of 
Muralidharan, Niehaus, and Sukhtankar (2014)  
and Barnwal (2015). Specifically, Muralidharan and  
others (2014) estimated that biometric registration, 
authentication, and payments led to a 10.8 percent-
age point reduction in the leakage of funds (the dif-
ference between the wage payment outlays reported 
by government officials and those reported by 
households) in the National Rural Employment 
Guarantee Scheme. Barnwal (2015) estimated the 
Aadhaar-based transfer policy reduced fuel pur-
chases in the domestic fuel sector by 11–14 percent, 
suggesting a reduction in subsidy diversion. Extra-
polating these leakage reduction rates to all govern-
ment of India welfare programs—amounting to 
roughly $70 billion to $100 billion in government 
expenditures—yields savings in the range of $8 bil-
lion to $14 billion, or an average of $11 billion poten-
tial less spending. It should be noted that realizing 

these potential savings for all government transfers 
is conditional on accountable institutions to comple-
ment the investments in digital technology—the key 
message of this Report.

followed by private participation, and added mobile 
and internet networks later. But developing countries 
are jumping straight to mobile networks, built by the 
private sector. This may leave gaps in the backbone 
infrastructure, especially in rural areas, possibly 
requiring investment through public-private part-
nerships (PPPs) for the full benefi ts of high-speed 
networks to be enjoyed by all.

While availability, accessibility, and affordability 
remain concerns, the challenges facing internet stake-
holders today are as much about how networks are 
used (demand) as how they are built (supply). Global 
interconnectedness introduces new vulnerabilities 
in areas where coordination mechanisms are weak, 
still evolving, or based on nongovernment models. 
Threats to cybersecurity are undermining confi dence 
in the internet and increasing the costs to businesses 
and governments, resulting in economic losses as 
well as higher security spending. For privacy and 
data protection, different countries are taking quite 
different approaches, making it harder to develop 
global services. Ensuring safe and secure access will 
require greater international collaboration based on a 
multistakeholder model. 

Converting connectivity into digital dividends 
will work best where an open access internet ecosys-
tem allows content creation and applications devel-
opment to thrive. ICT clusters tend to form naturally, 
and governments do not need to intervene to create 
them. But they can help clusters along and avoid sti-
fl ing growth unintentionally through high tariffs or 
restrictions on openness. Most countries have found 
it useful to develop national ICT sector strategies for 
broadband, for e-government, and for local content. 
The process of developing these strategies, through 
multistakeholder consultations, can be just as useful 
as the strategies themselves—and ensures that tar-
gets are realistic and actionable. Policy challenges are 
summarized in box 4.1.

Making the internet 
universal, aff ordable, open, 
and safe
Access to mobile phones is close to universal, and 
prices are falling in most countries, thanks to policies 
based on market competition, private participation, 
and light-touch regulation. But today’s digital econ-
omy also requires universal access to the internet—at 
broadband speeds. First-generation policies for the 
information and communication technology (ICT) 
sector, aimed at universal access and affordability, 
have proved successful for phone service, and sup-
ply-side policies should also work well for the internet. 
But with more than half the world still offl ine, the ben-
efi ts of the internet are unevenly distributed. Next-
generation policies must also focus on demand-side 
issues of digital literacy, as well as privacy, cybersecu-
rity, and internet governance, where a global consen-
sus has yet to emerge. 

In the last decade, all countries have benefi ted 
from the rapid spread of mobile communication 
networks. But only 15 percent of the world’s citizens 
have access to affordable high-speed internet,1 and 
the prices for service vary enormously. This refl ects 
policy failures in some countries, such as regulatory 
capture, troubled privatizations, ineffi cient spec-
trum management, excessive taxation of the sector, 
or monopoly control of international gateways. To 
achieve better development outcomes, governments 
need to address these failures through open consulta-
tive policy-making processes involving the industry 
and users.

Developing countries are following a different 
route from developed ones. Most member-countries 
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) benefi ted from initial state-led 
investment in their fi xed telephone infrastructure,

Offl  ine, and missing out
Only around 15 percent of the world’s population currently 
has aff ordable high-speed access to the internet (fi gure 
B4.1.1). Use of mobile phones, reaching almost three-
quarters of the world’s population, provides the main form 
of internet access in developing countries. But the lives of

2 billion people remain largely untouched by information and 
communication technologies (ICTs), and half a billion live 
outside areas with a mobile signal. The world’s offl  ine popu-
lation is mainly in India and China, but more than 100 million 
people are also offl  ine in North America, mainly in Mexico.

Connected, but in the slow lane
Developed and developing countries are following dif-
ferent routes to the information society (fi gure B4.1.2). In 
the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development) countries, fi xed-line networks came fi rst, 
and now form the backbone for internet access. But most 
developing countries jumped straight to mobile networks 
without investing fi rst in connectivity. The consequence for 
many users in developing countries is a second-class inter-
net: slow, expensive, and rarely “always on.” 

Megabucks for megabytes
ICT prices are falling globally, but large diff erences remain 
(map B4.1.1). Although Europe has some of the highest 
prices in the world for mobile calls and texts, prices are 
generally cheaper for data. North, South, and Central 
America have high prices for mobile data, in part due to 
bundling, but cheaper prices for fi xed data. Northern Asia 
is generally cheaper than southern Asia. In Africa, prices are 
generally cheaper for mobile than for fi xed-line data. Price 
diff erences refl ect policy failures as much as market failures. 
Governments need to go further in liberalizing market entry, 
making available more spectrum, and encouraging invest-
ment to achieve more aff ordable prices.

owner and operator. That role is now pared back to 
policy maker and regulator, establishing an enabling 
environment for the private sector to do most of the 
work. For mobile networks and the internet, govern-
ments have been less directly involved, but many of 
them are seeking a more active role in shaping the 
digital economy. Broadband internet, in particular, is 
seen as a general-purpose technology,2 essential for 
the competitiveness of nations,3 and governments 
have invested more than US$50 billion in broadband 
networks since 2009 as part of stimulus packages.4 
Most also have national broadband plans.5 

The internet has transformed telecommunication 
networks. In the same way that containerization rev-
olutionized physical trade,6 so the “packetization” of 
data has commoditized digital trade.7 Networks have

Shaping the digital economy
Government policies and regulation of the internet 
help shape the digital economy. Particularly through 
their policies for the ICT sector, governments and 
regulatory agencies create an enabling environment 
for the private sector to build networks, develop ser-
vices, and provide content and applications for users. 
Increasingly, governments seek to cooperate across 
borders on issues such as cybersecurity, privacy, and 
cross-border data fl ows. 

Internet-enabling policies have evolved over 
time, especially those for the ICT sector (chapter 5 
looks at complementary policies such as those for 
skills, regulations, and institutions). In the past, the 
government’s main role was in building the fi xed-
line telecommunication network and acting as both

and the latter on content. Internet regulation has 
some characteristics of both, but with generally a 
much lighter touch than either telecom or TV regula-
tion. Indeed, some would argue that internet regula-
tion by government is neither helpful nor necessary, 
particularly if older models of regulation are applied.11 
But the trend is toward greater government control, 
not less—even in the United States, where the regu-
latory body recently proposed to regulate the internet 
as a common carrier telecommunication service—to 
preserve the concept of net neutrality, or treating all 
“bits” of information alike, irrespective of their con-
tent or value.12 As this chapter shows, all governments 
have been obliged to consider which policies are most 
appropriate for the internet, and their answers vary 
widely (box 4.2).

Supply-side policies: 
Availability, accessibility, 
and aff ordability
The supply side of the internet is conditioned by 
rules on market competition, shaped by the respec-
tive roles of the public and private sector, and medi-
ated by the degree to which regulation of the sector 

now providing a wide array of multimedia applica-
tions, with internet protocol (IP) as the shared lan-
guage.8 Fixed-line networks continue to be important 
in the developed countries, but in the developing 
world, especially in Africa, mobile networks are now 
the main means of delivering services. As the uptake 
of ICTs grows around the world, the policy focus is 
shifting from solving supply-side challenges (basic 
access and affordability) to addressing demand-side 
dilemmas (how to ensure that networks are open 
and safe).9 Policy decisions intended to facilitate the 
take-up and safe use of ICT products and services will 
shape the digital economy and wider developmental 
outcomes.

In broad terms, services in sectors regulated by 
governments account for just under half of the US$4.2 
trillion in revenues generated by the global ICT sector 
(telecom services, TV services, and internet), with 
the rest (hardware, software, and computer services) 
largely unregulated. Services delivered directly over 
the internet account only for just over 7.5 percent, 
but they are the fastest growing segment, having 
more than doubled since 2010 to reach an estimated 
US$309 billion in 2014.10 Separate regulations have 
been traditionally applied to telecom and TV services, 
with the former focused on carriage (transmission) 

Box 4.2 Is the internet a public good?

In considering what policies to apply to the internet, a key 
question is whether it is a public good. If it is, government 
intervention would be easier to justify. The internet does not 
have all the characteristics that economists conventionally 
associate with a public good—such as being nonexcludable 
(people can be prevented from using it) or nonrivalrous 
(a user who hogs bandwidth may impair the quality of ser-
vice for other users). Even so, the internet provides public 
access to a vast library of useful information, it uses shared 
resources such as the spectrum, and it relies on network 
security; all of which may be considered public goods. 
Moreover, government intervention in promoting the inter-
net may be justifi ed because it has the characteristics of a 
general-purpose technology, like electricity. 

A more accurate way of expressing the characteristics 
of the internet is that it is a private good with positive 

externalities (a club good). While the private sector can 
and should take the lead in providing internet networks 
and services, achieving universal and accessible internet is 
a legitimate public policy goal. The bulk of the investment 
required to achieve such a goal can come from the private 
sector, though many countries have invested public money 
to improve internet access by poor households and those 
living in remote areas. In a recent global survey, some 
83 percent of users said they believe that aff ordable inter-
net access should be a basic human right.a Several govern-
ments have followed Finland’s lead in defi ning access to the 
internet at broadband speeds as a legal right and a goal of 
universal access policy.b High-speed, aff ordable broadband 
has been described as a foundation stone of modern soci-
ety.c But it is something that more than fi ve-sixths of the 
global population still lacks.d

205SECTORAL POLICIES

From these different market opening moves, a 
policy consensus emerged around three basic ingre-
dients—market competition, private participation, 
and independent regulation of the ICT sector.21 In 
developing countries, the main push toward market 
growth came in the 1990s with the arrival of digital 
(second-generation, or 2G) mobile communication 
services, which allowed for competition, often for the 
fi rst time. Worldwide, only a handful of countries, 
including Djibouti, Eritrea, and Ethiopia in the Horn 
of Africa region, still maintain state-run monopolies in 
the provision of mobile services and the internet, and 
they have generally not fared as well as their neighbors. 
Mobile penetration is only half the level in the coun-
tries that have retained monopolies than in Kenya, 
which has had mobile competition since 2000, or in 
Sudan, since 2005. The cover photo of this report shows 
migrants in Djibouti straining to receive cellphone sig-
nals from Somalia, where competition in the telecom 
sector is fi erce and prices are much lower (box 4.3).22 A 
study of Sub-Saharan Africa showed that telecom rev-
enue averaged 5.6 percent of GDP in liberalized econo-
mies, but only 3.5 percent in nonliberalized ones, and 
was growing twice as fast in liberalized economies.23

The recipe of competition, private participation, 
and independent regulation worked so well for 
mobile telephony that, as of June 2015, there were 
more than 7.5 billion subscriptions worldwide—more 
than the human population.24 The same recipe should 
also largely work well for internet services, to extend 
access to the 4 billion or so people now without 
affordable service. But there is a wrinkle. For network 
operators, extending internet access may cannibalize 
revenues from existing voice and text services, at 
least in the short term. This is one outcome of mar-
ket entry by third-party content and service provid-
ers that ride “over-the-top” (OTT) of the operator’s 
IP-based networks:

•  For telephony, voice over internet protocol services, 
such as Skype and Viber, substitute paid voice calls 
with calls made “free of charge” over the internet.25

•  For text (short message service, or SMS), which 
had been highly profi table for mobile operators,26 
instant messaging OTT services such as WhatsApp 
and WeChat provide a more attractive substitute 
for a fraction of the price. 

•  For video (such as cable or satellite TV), streaming 
services like Netfl ix and YouTube—which together 
account for almost half the traffi c delivered to users 
in the United States27—offer low-priced content and 
give more freedom to consumers to watch content 
when and where they like, on multiple devices. 

is independent of government and the operators. A 
useful framework for analyzing supply-side policies 
is to consider the value chain that stretches from the 
point where the internet enters a country (the fi rst 
mile), and passes through that country (middle mile), 
to reach the end user (last mile). As a general rule, 
the market works best closest to the end user (last 
mile). Public-private partnership is more likely to be 
needed in the fi rst and middle miles, or where cus-
tomers live in areas that are diffi cult to serve. In addi-
tion to the visible elements of the network, certain 
hidden elements are vital to ensuring the integrity of 
the value chain—call them the “invisible mile” (table 
4.1). (This framework is used a bit later in this chap-
ter.) The goals of supply-side policies differ between 
countries, but the general objective is to ensure that 
the internet is universally available, accessible, and 
affordable.

Market competition
Today’s internet runs on yesterday’s legacy networks. 
In the OECD countries, and some others, the same 
copper networks built in the 1960s and 1970s to carry 
voice telephone calls and cable TV (the last mile) 
have now been upgraded and repurposed to stream 
movies and social media, carried over IP-based net-
works. Farther away from the user (the middle mile), 
the networks are more likely to be newer, and based 
on fi ber, but the wired access networks that connect 
users were largely built in an era of government-run 
monopolies. All but a handful of countries had state-
owned public telephone and telegraph companies 
(known as PTTs) when they were building out their 
networks.13 

Outside the United States, which followed a 
different path of private investment, market com-
petition in telecommunications began in the 1980s, 
with new market entrants arriving in the United 
Kingdom (1981),14 the Republic of Korea (1982),15 and 
Japan (1985).16 In the European Union (EU), a coordi-
nated process was set in motion by a Green Paper on 
telecommunications liberalization in 1987 and a Full 
Competition Directive in 1996, setting a timetable for 
full liberalization of the telecommunications sector 
by January 1, 1998.17 The EU is now committed to 
achieving a single digital market by 2020.18 Globally, 
some 69 countries19 made commitments to liberalize 
telecommunication markets and allow foreign invest-
ment in their telecommunication sectors as part of 
the World Trade Organization (WTO) Basic Telecom-
munications Agreement in February 1997, when these 
countries accounted for some 93 percent of global 
telecommunications revenue.20

Box 4.3 Fragile states, resilient digital economies

Somalia is emerging from 20 years of civil war, during which 
time its fi xed telecom infrastructure was destroyed. Yet infor-
mation and communication technologies (ICTs) are one of 
the bright spots in its economy. With seven mobile operators 
and multiple internet service providers (ISPs), Somalia has a 
higher rate of penetration than its monopolistic neighbors, 
despite the fact that it has the lowest gross domestic product 
per capita in the East Africa region (fi gure B4.3.1, panel a).

Telecommunications can play an important role in post-
confl ict reconstruction.a Not only does the sector generate 
jobs, entrepreneurship opportunities, and foreign currency 
from incoming phone calls, but using mobile phones to 
make payments or trade airtime also provides an attractive 
alternative to the local currency. In Somalia, few citizens 
have faith in the Somali shilling, and prefer U.S. dollars, but 
dollars are frequently in short supply. The World Bank’s 2014 
Findex survey showed that some 38 percent of wage-earning 

Somalis were paid via a mobile phone, compared with just 
25 percent of Kenyans (fi gure B4.3.1, panel b), despite the 
popularity of M-Pesa, Safaricom’s mobile money service, 
there.b Some 55 percent of Somalis used mobile phones to 
receive remittances; this has become indispensable recently 
as other fi nancial channels, such as Hawalas, have been 
blacklisted as part of a crackdown on their suspected links 
with terror. Furthermore, telecom operators contribute to 
the national treasury, unlike the banking sector, which con-
tributed nothing in 2014. Somalia has benefi ted since early 
2014 from a fast connection to the global internet, following 
the completion of the EASSy undersea cable to Mogadishu, 
in which the International Finance Corporation is a stake-
holder. The Shabaab terrorist organization has succeeded 
in blocking the use of mobile broadband in much of the 
country, because of traceability, but it still uses social media 
for recruitment and spreading its message.

countries, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo 
or South Sudan, may never get a fi xed-line access net-
work, even in urban areas. An optimistic assessment 
is that developing countries are leapfrogging a whole 
stage of network development, but more realistically 
they may be missing an essential stage. Available evi-
dence suggests that access to the internet from big-
screen devices (PCs), with always-on fl at-rate access, 
provides a bigger boost to economic activities than 
access from small-screen devices (mobile phones), 
which generally have use-based pricing.31 As long as 
mobile operators dominate the provision of voice and 
internet services in developing countries, compa-
nies whose business models are based on long-term 
investment in fi xed assets, without revenues from 
mobile services, will fi nd it diffi cult to survive. That 
is why some degree of government intervention, 
through public-private investment, may be necessary 
in smaller developing countries to build up resilient 
international connectivity, and an open access back-
bone network, in order to retrofi t the missing stages 
of network development.

Public-private partnership
After market competition, the next essential ingre-
dient in the ICT policy recipe is private investment. 
Private companies have driven network investment 
throughout the world, especially in mobile networks. 
The biggest network operator of them all, China 
Mobile, which had over 800 million subscriptions at 
the end of 2014, is still majority state-owned.32 But it 
is the partial exception, and its public shareholding 
is listed on the stock exchanges of Hong Kong SAR, 
China and New York. Network operators dominate the 
ICT sector in revenues and customer connections. But 
stock markets appear to prize internet companies that 
sell content and OTT services more highly than tele-
com operators that build networks. Alibaba, a Chinese 
e-commerce company that went public in September 
2014, is valued at more than US$200 billion—a level 
similar to China Mobile, although it has only one-
tenth the network operator’s revenue.33 Low market 
valuations for network operators, and the cannibaliza-
tion of their voice and text revenues, make it harder 
for them to invest in network capacity, particularly in 
fi ber backbone networks or fourth-generation (4G) 
mobile networks. Private investment in telecommuni-
cation networks in 2013 had fallen by almost one-third 
since its peak in 2008, suggesting that operators are 
fi nding it harder to justify capital expenditure at a 
time when future revenues are uncertain.34

One response is to revive public investment in the 
internet backbone. In the United States, the internet 

are having to spend on average one-quarter of their 
annual revenue on capital expenditure as they build 
out their networks, while in North America, where 
network buildout took place much earlier, the capital 
expenditure burden is just 15 percent of revenue.29 But 
network operators in developing countries may fi nd 
it a challenge to persuade users with low incomes to 
pay for higher data use, which has a lower perceived 
value than voice calls. Their users may employ OTT 
services primarily for reducing, rather than increas-
ing, their monthly phone credit use. According to 
reports from the Global System for Mobile commu-
nications Association (GSMA), while average revenue 
per user in North America has remained steady at 
above US$65 per month since 2010, it has fallen in 
Africa from US$14 to below US$10.30 So, African net-
work operators are caught in a triple bind of rising 
user expectations (due to higher data usage) requir-
ing higher capital expenditures, but declining user 
spending (due to OTT services).

For developing countries, the threat of diluting 
traditional revenue streams is particularly worrying 
because they are following a trajectory in their net-
work buildout different from the one most developed 
countries follow. Figure B4.1.2 shows network build-
out in developed (OECD) and developing countries 
(low- and middle-income). Both sets of countries 
show a similar pattern of mobile networks growing to 
overtake fi xed-line networks in subscriber numbers, 
since 2001 and 2003, respectively, and fi xed-line sub-
scriptions declining thereafter. But the big difference 
is that OECD countries had already achieved univer-
sal fi xed-line access (roughly, more than 90 percent 
household penetration) before 2001. 

In developing countries, the decline in fi xed-line 
access occurred before it had reached even one-
quarter of the universal service level, and is now well 
below that. This is signifi cant because wireless net-
works (using spectrum) are not fully substitutable 
for fi xed networks (using copper or fi ber), either in 
usage (which rarely offers fl at-rate pricing, without 
data limits) or in performance (where speeds are 
generally lower). So, despite procompetitive policies 
that have encouraged infrastructure competition and 
allowed for the development of OTT services, many 
developing countries are stuck with a second-class 
internet that may fail to deliver the expected benefi ts, 
especially for business users. 

Indeed, most developing countries are unlikely 
ever to attract, or generate, suffi cient investment to 
extend a nationwide backbone (the middle mile) or 
create fi xed-line networks in rural areas without some 
kind of public-private partnership. Some  developing

role for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names 
and Numbers (ICANN) to the global multistakeholder 
community.36 In other countries, too, the government 
took an early role in building out the national back-
bone infrastructure for the internet, as in the Republic 
of Korea (box 4.4). This role continues, for instance, in 
National Research and Education Networks (NRENs), 
where many governments subsidize the higher edu-

benefi ted from public funding from the 1960s until 
1993, when the government began “privatizing” the 
internet by transitioning the role of the National 
Science Foundation to the private sector, including 
responsibility for registering domain names and 
managing network access points.35 This process is due 
to be completed in September 2016, when the Depart-
ment of Commerce is expected to transfer its oversight 

Box 4.4 How public-private partnership helped build the internet 
backbone in the Republic of Korea

Until other developed countries caught up around mid-
2006, the Republic of Korea’s fi xed broadband penetration 
was well ahead of its competitors (fi gure B4.4.1 and table 
B4.4.1). In fi ber-based ultrafast broadband, it is still ahead 
of the game. It has the highest percentage of fi ber among 
fi xed broadband connections (66 percent) of any country 
except Japan. Korea also leads in the “internet of things” 
and sensor technology (see spotlight 6). 

One secret to Korea’s success was a public-private 
partnership (PPP) that combined government funding 
and policy direction with private infrastructure investment 
and management. The Korea Information Infrastructure 
program, which ran from 1995 to 2005, and the Broadband 

Convergence Network that followed it from 2005 to 2014 
saw government investment of just under US$1 billion in each 
phase. Private investment dominated in the initial phase, as 
the backbone network was established and larger cities were 
served. During this phase, government money was used 
mainly to purchase bandwidth for government’s own needs. 
Since 2005, government spending has been proportionately 
greater, as network investment reached out to rural areas, 
where there was less incentive for the private sector to take 
the lead. The government of Korea has followed up with a 
program to upgrade network performance, through the Ultra 
Broadband Convergence Network, with around one-third of 
total investment coming from the government.

Box 4.4 How public-private partnership helped build the internet 
backbone in the Republic of Korea (continued)

governments. But even in the best of circumstances, 
regulatory agencies may lack suffi cient high-caliber 
staff, or they may be captured by commercial or gov-
ernmental interests. In the many countries where 
governments still hold a stake in the incumbent oper-
ator, true regulatory independence is rare. The worst 
case is where commercial and governmental interests 
coincide, in what is sometimes called “crony capi-
talism.” In Tunisia during the Ben Ali regime, three 
telecom companies with ownership related directly to 
the Ben Ali family generated revenues of US$86.8 mil-
lion, or 8.8 percent of total turnover from the sector in 
2010, but they accounted for some 42.7 percent of total 
gross profi t generated by the sector.41 High demand 
for scarce spectrum also creates incentives for cor-
ruption. In India, the sale of 2G cellular licenses in 
2007–08 was rigged to create an artifi cial scarcity 
that favored some companies over others, ending up 
in a scandal and a jailed minister.42 Regulators bear 
a responsibility to protect consumers against such 
vested interests. They must also work closely with 
competition authorities to ensure that consolidation 
in the number of operators does not reduce true com-
petition in the sector.

Where markets fail
By almost every measure, the policy recipe for pro-
moting the supply side of the ICT industry, based 
on market competition, private investment, and 
independent regulation, has been tremendously 
effective in extending coverage, at least for mobile 
communications. The estimated 7.5 billion mobile 

cation community, such as Internet2 in the United 
States, SURFNet in the Netherlands, and KENET in 
Kenya.37 Governments can also aggregate demand to 
negotiate lower bandwidth rates for universities and 
government departments, for example. 

Eff ective regulation
After market competition and private participation, 
the third key policy ingredient is independent regu-
lation: establishing ICT regulatory agencies that are 
independent of leading operators and of government 
departments. The International Telecommunica-
tion Union (ITU) records that some 159 of its 194 
member-states (82 percent) had separate ICT regu-
latory agencies by the end of 2013, a doubling since 
1998.38 Effective regulation creates a level playing 
fi eld for operators and helps promote market entry. 
Governance structures and mandates for regulators 
differ, but most have responsibility for spectrum 
management and for issuing and overseeing licenses 
for network operators. Most regulators are run on a 
cost-recovery basis, and some generate a signifi cant 
surplus from license fees and spectrum auctions.39 

Telecom sector regulation should work primarily 
in favor of the consumer—addressing market failure, 
fostering effective competition, protecting consumer 
interests, and increasing access to technology and 
services.40 In particular, the regulator should seek to 
ensure that the benefi ts from technological change, 
greater effi ciency and reduced costs, are passed on 
to consumers rather than appropriated in higher 
profi ts for private fi rms or extortionate taxes to

phones. Public telecom operators use geographical 
averaging of tariffs to offer the same price to users 
in both urban and rural areas. Historically, they have 
also used profi ts from lucrative international and 
long-distance services to cross-subsidize loss-making 
local services. But with privatization and the shift to 
more competitive markets and IP-based networks, 
this became unsustainable.50 

An alternative, followed by more than 70 countries, 
is a Universal Service Fund (USF) to channel payments 
by operators to fund infrastructure in rural areas or 
to provide access to libraries, schools, and hospitals. 
Some USFs have performed well, notably those that 
use competitive mechanisms to distribute funds, 
such as least-cost subsidies in Pakistan or reverse 
auctions in rural Chile.51 But USFs generate funds that 
often remain unspent or go for unintended purposes. 
Unspent USFs amounted to more than US$11 billion in 
2012, and in Côte d’Ivoire and Paraguay more than 0.6 
percent of GDP. In several countries, USFs continue to 
fund basic fi xed-line telephony long after user demand 
had shifted to mobile and broadband internet.52 

By far the most successful measure to extend 
access is to license competing mobile service provid-
ers and internet service providers. Governments often 
include specifi c network rollout obligations in the 
license conditions of mobile operators, and these are 
frequently exceeded thanks to strong demand, at least 
for basic mobile telephony. But for advanced mobile 
networks, suitable for carrying data services such as 
high-speed internet, rollout into areas of sparse popu-
lation density has been slower. For voice services, pro-
vision of coverage to rural areas by private investors 
could sometimes be justifi ed by the volume of incom-
ing calls. But for data services, although the direction 
of traffi c might be similarly asymmetric, only the 
ability of the local population to pay for service justi-
fi es investment in network upgrading, as there is no 
payment for incoming traffi c.

Given the increasing importance of broadband 
for modern life, better provision in rural areas could 
help revitalize the local economy in secondary towns 
and rural areas.53 Here are some possible solutions for 
rural broadband: 54

•  USFs can be repurposed to focus on broadband. In the 
United States, since a 2011 decision by the regula-
tory body, the Federal Communications Commis-
sion (FCC), universal service subsidies have been 
channeled to the Connect America Fund, to the 
tune of around US$4.5 billion a year.55 A similar 
initiative in Europe, using regional development 
funds, is the Connecting Europe Facility.56 Already, 

subscriptions in use worldwide generate revenues 
of US$1.13 trillion a year, as of May 2015.43 And some 
95 percent of the world’s inhabitants live within range 
of a mobile signal,44 with two-thirds of them served 
by a 3G signal with theoretical access to the internet if 
they have a suitably equipped device.45 Even in Africa, 
the region where mobile coverage is lowest, at just 
88 percent in 2012, more-effi cient markets could 
close all but 4.4 percent of the remaining gap, without 
needing a cross-subsidy.46 

But that is not the whole story. Markets fail where 
the private sector underinvests—for instance, because 
the private return may be less than the social return. 
This appears to be happening in the ICT sector in at 
least three areas.

•  Remote areas. Although only less than 5 percent of 
the global population remains unserved with cellu-
lar mobile coverage, that still represents almost half 
a billion people worldwide. Even where it is techni-
cally viable to serve these people, there may be little 
commercial incentive to do so. The costs of reaching 
them are high in relation to the commercial return, 
as they live mainly in rural locations with low pop-
ulation density, or in geographically remote areas 
(box 4.5). But the social costs of remaining unserved 
are high and growing, so universal service policies 
may be required.

•  Unattractive markets. Competitive market entry may 
not take place even in markets that are nominally 
open to competition, especially in fragile or con-
fl ict-affl icted states, or in small island developing 
states.47 A lack of scale and the failure to use com-
petitive tendering for infrastructure investment, 
for instance, may also result in prices that are unaf-
fordable for users.

•  Uneconomic services. More worrying, even if basic 
services can be delivered, delivering more advanced 
networks suitable for carrying data services, such 
as high-speed internet, may not be economic. On 
mobile broadband networks, this requires third- 
(3G) or preferably fourth-generation (Long Term 
Evolution, LTE) networks, which need higher levels 
of investment and generally a denser network of 
base stations and masts.48 Some developing coun-
tries have yet to launch mobile broadband. Even 
where services are launched, coverage can be low, 
reaching just 1 percent of the rural population in 
Zambia or 11 percent in Namibia, for example.49 

To extend affordable access, governments have 
tried price controls, regulated prices, public facili-
ties (such as telecenters), and mandated public pay

Box 4.5 The last (1,000) mile(s) 

The “last mile” problem is a term commonly used in com-
munications and transport economics to describe the rela-
tively high cost of building the infrastructure to link to end 
users: the access network. Technological change, particu-
larly the development of cellular mobile communications 
and data compression techniques, has greatly reduced 
infrastructure investment costs and is helping to solve the 
last mile problem, at least in urban areas. But a diff erent 
problem, perhaps better described as the “last 1,000 

miles,” plagues remote rural communities. Specifi cally, 
what is the best way to bring the internet to areas “land-
locked,” far from the cable landing stations on the coast, 
or “sealocked,” small islands with small populations that 
cannot justify an investment in undersea cable?

Where undersea fi ber-optic cable is available, it will 
generally trump all other solutions in speed, performance, 
and cost. But for low-density, dispersed populations or 
remote islands, satellite off ers a quick and easy alternative.

also share infrastructure from other sectors, such 
as electricity or transport. Mutualization is slightly 
different, with a wholesale operator created to sell 
only to other operators and not directly to users. 
Increasingly, specialist wireless mast companies, 
like Indus or Reliance Infratel, two Indian com-
panies, are emerging for wireless infrastructure, 
while cable backbone companies include Botswana’s 
BoFiNet and the Burundi Backbone System. Sharing 
assets can improve management effi ciency, though 
it may also lead to disputes.

from 2007 to 2014, some €14.7 billion (US$16.5 bil-
lion) had been committed to broadband networks 
under PPP funding, using EU structural funds, in 
more than 100 different projects in the European 
Union.57 But few developing countries have this 
level of resources to commit.

•  Infrastructure sharing and mutualization58 can also 
reduce costs for operators. Infrastructure sharing 
refers to the operators sharing one another’s net-
work infrastructure, or at least some elements of 
it, such as wireless masts or cable ducts. They may 

Usage costs have come down, with the entry of new 
players, such as Avanti Communicationsa and O3B.b The 
Cook Islands, with fewer than 14,000 people spread over 
15 inhabited islands across 2.2 million square kilometers 
of ocean, recently opted for a satellite network from O3B.c 
But satellite has the disadvantage of being more expensive 
than fi ber-optic cable per unit of data, and, with older 
generations of satellite, suff ers from higher latency (delay), 
which makes them unsuitable for real-time uses like video 
gaming. Even the Cook Islands are now considering an 
undersea cable. 

Although satellite off ers distributional advantages, it 
makes it hard to aggregate demand and therefore to nego-
tiate lower bandwidth costs. South Sudan, for instance, 
has an estimated 3,000 very small aperture terminals 

(VSATs) serving its population of just over 10 million, who 
pay expensive retail rather than wholesale rates for the 
limited capacity provided. Geography matters. Landlocked 
countries generally pay higher prices for bandwidth than 
coastal countries. In Africa, for instance, being landlocked 
adds an average of US$232 to the monthly price for fi xed 
broadband access (map B4.5.1). But history matters, too. 
In the Pacifi c, countries fi rst reached by cable, such as 
Fiji, tend to have lower internet prices than those reached 
more recently (fi gure B4.5.1). Once served with fi ber, small 
island states may fi nd that they use only a tiny amount 
of the capacity available; Tonga, for instance, barely uses 
10 percent. Moving to fl at-rate pricing (“all you can eat”) 
for bandwidth may be the best way to recoup the initial 
investment.d

is a complex matter, involving contract rights with 
private parties and not administrative fi at. But the 
natural shortage of attractive, or easy to remember, 
domain names creates opportunities for profi teering.

ICT prices are falling . . .
The trend toward declining prices in the ICT sec-
tor has been a long-term and predictable driver of 
growth. For hardware, it is encapsulated in the pre-
diction made by Gordon Moore, the cofounder of 
Intel, in a 1965 paper that the number of transistors 
in an integrated circuit would double about every two 
years, with consequent improvement in price and 
performance.61 For memory storage, this means that, 
in 2014, a typical price to store a gigabyte of data was 
just 3 U.S. cents, whereas 20 years earlier it was more 
than US$500.62 Similar rates of progress are observ-
able in the unit price of computer processing power 
and in the availability and price of bandwidth63 (fi gure 
4.1). Manufacturers have, to some extent, compen-
sated for this by building greater functionality into 
devices for the same price. But as they have started to 
chase mass markets, device prices have also started to 
fall—since 2011 for smartphones, and earlier for older 
technologies such as laptops and televisions. Smart-
phones, with more computing power than NASA had 
at the time of the moonshots, can now be purchased 
for less than US$40 (although the typical cost is much 
higher), and it is forecast that, by 2020, 80 percent of 
adults around the world will own one.64

Predictable, rapid price declines create an interest-
ing dynamic: it is possible to foresee, with reasonable 
accuracy, at what point services and devices will fl ip 
from narrow to mass markets, as the price of owner-
ship and use falls. But there is a tendency to overesti-
mate the effect of a technology in the short term and 
to underestimate its effects in the long.65 This may 
in part explain why the initial impact of the internet 
caused a catastrophic swing in the markets, starting 
around 1997 and peaking in March 2000, since known 
as the dot-com bubble. The aspirations of many of the 
startups of the time—like Broadcast.com, an internet 
radio company, or Pets.com, an e-commerce supplier—
simply could not be met by the slow-speed dial-up 
internet access available, and their business models 
were often unrealistic. The value of stock markets 
worldwide fell by some US$5 trillion in the 18 months 
that followed.66 But that period of creative destruction 
also saw the birth of many of the giants that dominate 
the internet today, including Google and Tencent 
(both founded in 1998) and Alibaba (in 1999).

Perhaps the most sustained example of how 
falling prices drive market expansion comes with 

•  Technological solutions are emerging that promise a fresh 
approach to rural broadband. From drones to balloons 
to nanosats, there is no shortage of inventive solu-
tions to providing wide area coverage. But these 
new technologies will need to leverage the physical 
and market infrastructure that the cellular mobile 
industry has built in order to become commercially 
viable and achieve scale. And efforts to bring new 
technology will have to be complemented by more 
effi cient use of spectrum, such as spread spectrum 
and digital dividend spectrum, which releases for 
cellular commercial use the highly valuable spec-
trum (for instance, in the 700 MHz band previously 
used for terrestrial TV broadcasts), and in the “white 
spaces” between digital channels. These spectrum 
bands have wider coverage and are therefore ideal 
for rural areas.

Managing spectrum and other scarce 
resources
Managing scarce resources—such as numbers, rights-
of-way, and especially spectrum—presents regulatory 
challenges. Policy makers are turning to market 
mechanisms, such as auctions, to deliver the best out-
comes, and this can result in lower prices and higher 
growth, as in Guatemala (see box 4.6). More fl exible 
approaches to spectrum sharing between services, use 
of spectrum-hopping technologies, and refarming of 
spectrum will also help. But demand for bandwidth, 
and thus also for spectrum, continues to grow rapidly, 
especially as video entertainment shifts from tele-
vision sets to mobile devices. By 2020, around 2 GHz 
of total spectrum will be needed in major markets 
for cellular services.59 Today, most developing coun-
tries have only around 500 MHz allocated, and some 
have less than 300 MHz.60 Spectrum availability and 
allocation is one of the factors determining the future 
wealth of nations, and governments will have a vital 
role in maximizing the benefi ts from this resource. 

The internet brings new challenges for allocating 
scarce resources, including domain names and the 
transition to longer (IPv6) addresses. While spectrum 
and numbers are regulated primarily by the public 
sector—internationally by the ITU and nationally by 
government ministries or regulators—domain names 
and IP addresses are controlled almost entirely by the 
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Num-
bers (ICANN), a California not-for-profi t corporation, 
and the entities to which it subcontracts. The man-
agement of top-level domain names, such as .org and 
.com, IP addresses, and even country code domains, 
such as .za (South Africa), generally is not the prov-
enance of government regulation. Their regulation

In most countries, the management of the civil radio fre-

countries separated the functions of operator and regulator, 
starting in the 1980s, spectrum management moved toward 

newly created regulatory agencies. But growing demand 
for using the airwaves for providing mobile communication

entry costs, and extensive use of discounts. Six of the 
ten cheapest countries to use a mobile phone are in 
South Asia, where the cost of ownership is typically 
below US$5 a month (fi gure 4.2). Seven of the top ten 
most expensive countries are in Western Europe. On 
affordability, measured by the monthly price of a bas-
ket of services as a percentage of income, developed 
countries still do better, as might be expected, though 
the gap is narrowing.

. . . but ICT prices still vary widely
Why do prices for ICT services vary so widely, by a 
factor of more than 40 for mobile cellular prices? 
Economies of scale seem to matter, with both India 
and China having prices below US$5 a month, while 
small island states, such as Vanuatu or the Marshall 
Islands, are generally more expensive than the global 
average, although there are many exceptions. But 
geography and population density appear to matter 
less than might be expected, with mountainous 
Bhutan and Nepal among the cheapest countries for 
mobile service, and the fl at and densely populated 
Netherlands one of the more expensive. The practice 
of geographical averaging of pricing, applying the 
same price throughout a country, is still the norm—
suggesting that, once basic coverage is established, 
rural areas are not necessarily more expensive to 
serve than urban ones. Mobile prices appear to be 
demand-driven rather than cost-based, with some of 
the cheapest prices in countries where the ability to 
pay is lowest.

Instead, to understand differences in ICT prices, it 
is necessary to look at policy and regulatory explana-
tions. For mobile cellular services in Western Europe, 
larger operators found it profi table to set high rates 
for terminating each other’s calls, and especially those 
from fi xed-line operators. Higher prices for off-net 
calls locked in users, while high roaming charges 
drove profi ts. Regulatory interventions, to oblige 
operators to reduce termination and roaming rates, 
were only partially effective because operators simply 
absorbed lower interconnection payments by raising 
prices for outgoing calls in a “waterbed” effect.68 In 
Canada and the United States, the unusual system 
of “both parties pay” pricing, where users pay both 
to receive and make calls with their mobile phones, 
should in theory obviate the problem of high mobile 
termination rates, in that “sender keeps all” is used 
(there are no payments between operators), which 
means there are no interconnection payments.69 

But in practice, both appear among the most 
expensive countries for mobile calls, based on the 

mobile phone services. When the dot-com bubble 
burst in March 2000, there were fewer than 700 mil-
lion mobile phone subscriptions (SIM cards)—but 
now, there are more than 7 billion, with over three-
quarters in developing countries. That success story 
has come about, in part, because of the falling price of 
ownership and usage of mobile phones, particularly 
in South Asia, where it has been labelled the “budget 
telecom model,”67 based on prepaid billing, very low 

General Telecommunications Law, recognized the 
economic value of the spectrum.a The law gave opera-
tors the right to request that any unallocated portions 
of spectrum be off ered for sale, through auctions, and 
once awarded, it gave operators the right to use, lease, 
and resell the spectrum, creating a tradable market. 
Guatemala benefi ted from a faster reduction in prices 
for mobile services than the rest of the region (see fi g-
ure B4.6.1). Other countries adopted similar policies, 
following Guatemala’s early lead,b and indeed have 
now overtaken Guatemala in the spectrum allocated 
to mobile communications (see map B4.6.1).

more than 100-fold between Pakistan (US$1.48 for a 
GB of data a month, downloaded to a mobile handset) 
and São Tomé and Príncipe (US$169.38).71 In contrast 
to mobile voice services, European countries, particu-
larly in Scandinavia and Eastern Europe, are generally 
among the cheapest in the world, thanks to vibrant 
competition (see map B4.1.1). Mobile broadband in 
Europe does not suffer from the termination rates 
that keep prices high for voice calls and SMS.

What policy and regulatory options are 
available?
What can regulators do to address the shortfalls in 
availability and the wide price differences for internet 

OECD low-user basket. Excessive bundling of dif-
ferent services, notably in North, South, and Central 
America, keeps prices for individual services high, 
and “locked” SIM (subscriber identifi cation module) 
cards limit consumers’ ability to choose among oper-
ators. Again, it is hard to escape the conclusion that 
operators are using demand-based, rather than cost-
based, pricing, as operators in these countries have 
largely saturated markets. One more positive devel-
opment is the dropping of mobile roaming charges in 
East Africa in October 2014, which led, for instance, 
to a 950-percent increase in traffi c from Rwanda to 
Kenya compared with the previous month.70

Price differences between countries are even more 
evident for the internet. The range between countries 
for fi xed-line broadband is almost 200-fold between

is very wide—between 6.4  Mbit/s in Luxembourg 
to just 146 bit/s in the Central African Republic.74 
Governments can encourage a higher availability 
of international bandwidth, for instance, by liberal-
izing the market for satellite dishes, including very 
small aperture terminals, and allowing open access 
to submarine cables, satellite consortia, and landing 
stations. Government procurement can also lead 
in bringing down prices by aggregating demand 
among different services—all the universities in a 
region, for example—to negotiate better prices for 
bandwidth with international providers. 

•  The international gateway is the point at which a 
country connects to the global internet, and this 
can often become a bottleneck. Although the Arab 
Republic of Egypt liberalized its market for internet 
service providers in 1996, the incumbent, Telecom 
Egypt through its subsidiary TE Data, still has a legal 
monopoly over the international gateway and cable 
landing station, in Alexandria, at least until June 
2016. Competitors pay as much for interconnection 
in Alexandria and backhaul to Cairo as they pay for 
international connectivity, resulting in some of the 
highest prices for internet in the region.75 In such 
cases, regulating wholesale prices for connectivity, 

prices worldwide? Table 4.1 offers some suggestions, 
based on applying the principles of market compe-
tition, public-private partnership, and independent 
regulation to the different phases of the internet 
supply value chain. The fi rst step is benchmarking, 
to gather up-to-date price data to allow for compari-
sons, both within the country (between operators and 
over time) and between countries, using appropriate 
comparators. Price comparisons are tricky and gen-
erally require using a predefi ned basket of services 
and methodology, such as those used by the OECD72 
or ITU.73 Operators often resist price comparisons, 
so it is essential to give the ICT regulatory agency a 
legal mandate for collecting, and publishing, relevant 
pricing and quality of service data (box 4.7). 

Armed with data, the next step is to work out in 
which part of the value chain for the supply of inter-
net the market may be failing. Table 4.1 suggests sev-
eral distinct submarkets:

to liberalize the market for building and operating 
backbone networks, and to encourage open access to 
the incumbent’s network at the wholesale level. The 
risk is that the most popular routes—say, between 
the two main cities—are “superserved,” while 
the rest of the country is underserved. So, many 
governments favor public-private partner ships to 
“direct” private investment, as in the Republic of 
Korea (see box 4.4). Governments can also help by 
making rights-of-way available to investors—and 
by requiring that all major infrastructure programs 
(such as roads, railways, pipelines, and energy 

or structurally separating the supply of wholesale 
from retail services, could help.

The middle mile. This refers to the national, intercity 
internet backbone of a country.

•  The national backbone network. The internet back-
bone network in a country provides backhaul from 
cable stations or satellite stations to major cities and 
towns. Ideally, it should include fi ber-optic cables, 
but microwave and even copper links can also be 
used. The simplest step a government can take is 

Box 4.7 How better ICT data can lead to cheaper services 

Better data on how information and communication tech-
nologies (ICTs) are used in developing countries can spur 
policy changes that benefi t the poor and increase their dig-
ital access. In some parts of the world, one of the best ways 
to spur policy reform is to shame governments into action 
by comparing them to countries with better records. When 
a report from Research ICT Africa revealed that prepaid 
mobile prices were higher in South Africa than in 34 other 
African countries, pressure from the Parliament obliged the 
regulator to cut mobile termination rates, resulting in a wave 
of price cuts by mobile operators.a But such examples are 
rare, and there is an alarming lack of accurate and timely 
data on ICT use in the developing world. This makes it hard 
to understand the mechanisms by which greater informa-
tion access among the poor drives economic opportunity. It 
also leaves important policy questions unanswered, such as 
whether new “free” internet services (or “zero-rated” ser-
vices like “Facebook zero”) drive the take-up of broadband 
or whether they deny access to the “free and open” internet. 

In general, supply-side indicators (such as subscriptions, 
or domain name registrations) are better reported than 
demand-side use and applications data. The International 
Telecommunication Union has collected such data from its 
membership since the 19th century. But gaps in its database 
are increasing, as operators in more competitive environ-
ments have become more wary of releasing commercially 
sensitive data. National Statistical Offi  ces could collect data 

on ICT use, but in developing countries they often lack the 
resources to carry out household surveys or do not have 
the know-how to collect policy-relevant data. A few donor 
agencies provide support, such as the funding of Research 
ICT Africa’s household surveys by Canada’s International 
Development Research Centre (IDRC)b or the funding of 
LIRNEasia’s research on mobile phone usage at the base 
of the pyramid by the United Kingdom’s Department for 
International Development (DFID).c The latter helped to 
persuade the government of Sri Lanka to forgo new mobile 
taxation policy.d But more should be done. Key areas for 
future action include:

•  At the national level, ensuring that service licenses require 
operators to report data to regulators, and encouraging 
National Statistical Offi  ces to include questions in their 
household surveys regarding ICT access and use

•  At the global level, reigniting global coordination 
bodies, such as the Partnership for Measuring ICT for 
Development,e to compile, coordinate, and improve ICT 
data gathering

•  Exploring the use of new data sources such as “big data,” 
crowdsourced data, and social media to complement ICT 
access and usage statistics

•  Creating mechanisms for telecommunications compa-
nies to share data, such as anonymized call records, for 
public research, policy, and planning purposes.

220 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

while cable modems offered the same facility for 
cable TV networks. In developing countries, where 
copper-based local access networks serve only a 
few areas, wireless-based access networks offer the 
most popular alternatives. Just over half the world’s 
inhabitants live within coverage of advanced, third- 
(3G) or fourth-generation (4G) networks, but even 
second-generation (2G) networks can be adapted 
for slow-speed internet use. 

•  Government policies to encourage the spread of fi xed-line 
broadband networks include permitting competing 
facilities, especially for intermodal competition 
(between cable, DSL, and wireless), and local loop 
unbundling (LLU), or mandating the incumbent 
to make local access lines available to competitors 
at wholesale prices. The widespread enforcement 
of LLU in Europe since 2000, following EU direc-
tives,81 is one reason its average broadband prices 
are among the lowest in the world. LLU is most 
effective once a minimum level of penetration has 
been achieved; below that, it can act as a deterrent 
for investment.82 LLU also offers a foothold for new 
entrants that can quickly offer nationwide service 
and then later develop their own infrastructure, 
as has been the case for free.fr, a new entrant in 
France.

The invisible mile. This refers to the other, less vis-
ible network components and potential bottlenecks.

•  Effi  cient spectrum management. Critical at all stages 
of the internet supply chain but especially in the 
local access network, effi cient management of the 
civil radio frequency spectrum includes increasing 
the amount of spectrum available, ensuring com-
petitive access, encouraging sharing of essential 
facilities such as radio masts, and liberalizing the 
market for spectrum resale and leasing to allow the 
creation of mobile virtual network operators. In 
this sense, spectrum resale in the wireless world is 
the equivalent of LLU in the fi xed-line world. Policy 
makers can also help by making more unlicensed 
spectrum available, especially for innovative uses 
such as cognitive radio (which hops between 
frequency bands to avoid interference), and by 
opening up underused government spectrum for 
commercial applications. 

•  Over-the-top services. Policies to encourage a wide 
range and diversity of OTT services can provide 
a wider choice to consumers at lower cost. Poli-
cies to encourage OTT growth include removing 
regulatory barriers to providing voice over IP and 

distribution) include provision for an optical fi ber 
link,76 and follow the principle of “dig once, dig 
smart,” by obliging contractors to anticipate future 
demand for fi ber when digging trenches.77 

•  The internet exchange point (IXP). The IXP is where 
IP-based traffi c is exchanged within a country. As 
of May 2015, there were some 446 IXPs around the 
world, but 87 countries still lacked a single one.78 
Average traffi c handled by each exchange ranges 
from some 4.47 terabits a second on the Amsterdam 
Internet Exchange, founded in 1997, to just 21 kbit/s 
on the BurundiX IXP, founded in 2014. Setting up 
an IXP is one of the most cost-effective steps a 
country can take to enhance local connectivity. 
Research by the Internet Society shows that the 
Kenya IXP (KIXP), operating since November 2001 
despite being initially declared illegal by the regu-
lator, saves local internet service providers (ISPs) 
some US$1.5 million a year in reduced costs for 
international connectivity. And it reduces latency 
from 200–600 milliseconds to 2–10 milliseconds, 
on average, by exchanging traffi c locally.79 

•  Local hosting of content. Promoting local hosting of 
content and creating a local cache for frequently 
used content from elsewhere can also enhance 
the effi ciency of the network and reduce latency, 
increasing usage as users experienced shorter wait-
ing times for websites to load. In Rwanda, 14 of the 
top 20 sites with Rwandese content were commer-
cial sites, and all were  hosted outside the country 
so that a typical website could save around US$100 
a year and enjoyed a more reliable service. But this 
imposed additional costs of US$13,500 a year for 
local ISPs that had to bring the content back in 
over expensive international links—costs which are 
then passed on to users. Promoting local hosting, 
already required for government sites in Rwanda, 
could avoid this, and help improve service quality.80

The last mile. This refers to the connection between 
the user and their nearest internet point of presence 
(POP).

•  The local access network. The most costly part of the 
network, and the hardest to duplicate, is the local 
access network, which connects the user to the 
nearest internet POP. In the early days, this was 
typically achieved through dial-up, using a modem, 
over ordinary copper telephone lines. Starting in 
the late 1990s, a technology called digital subscriber 
line (DSL) allowed that same telephone network 
to be used for always-on broadband connections, 



221SECTORAL POLICIES

Innovation also depends on the ability to protect 
and monetize intellectual property. Avoiding piracy 
will rely on striking the right balance between provid-
ing access to information and protecting intellectual 
property rights. Generally, the illegal distribution of 
copyright material tends to lessen when legitimate 
ways exist to access that material, for a fair price. 
Thus, contrary to expectations, peer-to-peer fi le shar-
ing systems that blossomed in the early 2000s for free 
sharing of music, such as Napster and Kazaa, started 
to decline once legal alternatives, such as iTunes or 
Google Play, became available, without any noticeable 
impact on the quantity or quality of artistic output.90 
The action has now shifted to fi lm and TV fi le shar-
ing, but again the availability of legitimate commer-
cial services, such as Netfl ix or Hulu, is progressively 
displacing illegal services as they are extended to 
more territories and have greater content coverage. 
But there remain large parts of the world where 
content is not available for download legally, because 
content licensing and copyright are so complex and 
fragmented that small markets are too often ignored 
(chapter 6).91

An issue that is more diffi cult to resolve surrounds 
the restriction, or fi ltering, of certain types of online 
content. Every country has different redlines on con-
tent it regards as dangerous or offensive. Germany has 
restrictions on hate speech, while Thailand monitors 
comments about its king. There are also certain abso-
lute values, such as restrictions on child pornography. 
Such restrictions are understandable and justifi ed 
where they represent a societal consensus adopted 
by an accountable government. The Supreme Court 
of India, for example, recently reconsidered its posi-
tion on free speech issues, potentially lifting existing 
restrictions on online speech.92 But few governments 
have the capability to enforce such content moni-
toring on their own. Instead, they must cooperate 
with the major websites and search engines, which 
then have to apply their own judgment. Google, for 
instance, publishes a transparency report that pro-
vides statistics on government requests to remove 
content, which have grown signifi cantly since 2011.93 
In the six months ending December 31, 2013, Turkey 
submitted the most removal requests (895), followed 
by the United States (481). 

Some governments try to block access to content 
directly, for instance by imposing national fi rewalls 
or restricting the use of certain internet applications, 
such as virtual private networks or voice over IP ser-
vices. Google reports that, in the fi rst nine months 
of 2015, six countries had experienced disruptions of 

mandating that operators provide access to essen-
tial facilities such as billing and app stores. Of 
course, OTT services introduce many regulatory 
issues of their own, not least the concept of “net 
neutrality.” A recent consultation on net neutrality83 
by the Federal Communications Commission, the 
U.S. regulatory agency, attracted a record number 
of comments, around 4 million.84 Ultimately, with 
support for net neutrality from the U.S. president, 
the FCC ruled in February 2015 in favor of regulat-
ing broadband internet as a public utility, although 
legal challenges could continue for years.85

•  Mobile money. For developing countries, one of the 
most signifi cant OTT services is mobile money, 
which is also fraught with regulatory challenges 
(see spotlight 2, “Digital fi nance”). 

Demand-side policies: 
Open and safe internet use
The internet is at once unique, complex, and one of 
the most used global communications media. It has 
different layers of infrastructure and applications, 
and different stakeholders are involved in its opera-
tion, use, and governance. What features affect the 
stability and security of the global internet to engen-
der trust and therefore encourage use of the internet? 
What is the best way to balance stakeholder interests 
in these areas? This section addresses the creation of 
an enabling environment of “trust” for the internet to 
achieve its full potential.

Censorship and content fi ltering threaten 
the internet’s utility as an engine of growth
The internet thrives on open information exchange 
and freedom of expression.86 One global view shows 
the range of internet fi ltering of political speech, from 
none to pervasive fi ltering (map 4.1).87 Another shows, 
perhaps paradoxically, that concerns over freedom of 
expression are actually greater among users in coun-
tries that have more recently come online than among 
users from countries with a longer history of internet 
access.88 One account of fi ltering blames fi ltering 
policies and software for poor internet performance 
(slow access speeds).89 This is an example of a direct 
cost associated with fi ltering, but such fi ltering also 
leads to indirect costs from the drag on innovation 
that comes from self-censorship, and the resulting

includes “cybercrime.” The more common threats 
to cybersecurity are malware, denial of service, and 
phishing attacks (attempts to acquire sensitive infor-
mation online by someone who is masquerading as 
a trusted entity), but cyberincidents are increasingly 
perpetrated by disaffected insiders. So, cybersecurity 
usually refers to securing data and infrastructure in a 
civilian context; but acts that might previously have 
been considered civilian attacks are now being uncov-
ered as acts of states against states via nonstate actor 
proxies, blurring the lines between acts of cybercrime 
and cyberwar or cyberterrorism. Threats to personal 
security online, such as online identity theft, are 
also growing. This may erode public confi dence in 
e-commerce and e-government applications, and 
make internet use less attractive, thus suppressing its 
use for certain applications. Likewise, cybersecurity 
can include securing critical information infrastruc-
ture from acts of nature, such as developing backup 
facilities in alternative locations. 

However defi ned, weak cybersecurity is a sig-
nifi cant problem worldwide, with both the scale of 
fi nancial losses, and the costs of preventing them, 
growing (box 4.8). New breaches of security over 

traffi c to its products—China, the Democratic Repub-
lic of Congo, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, 
Tajikistan, and Turkey.94 Excessive restrictions on use 
can increase the costs of doing business, particularly 
for international businesses, which may be dissuaded 
from investing.95 In addition, inconsistent and com-
plex content fi ltering requirements can make it dif-
fi cult to offer internet services and applications that 
are global in nature. Policy makers in governments 
that impose such restrictions have to choose between 
the relative perceived advantages of controlling cer-
tain kinds of information and the economic costs, 
including lost opportunities, of maintaining such 
systems.

Cybersecurity: Trust in the internet

The term “cybersecurity” is a convenient shorthand 
for a very complex set of issues. It commonly refers 
to systems and actions aimed at securing data and 
communications over the internet and even the infra-
structure of the internet itself.96 It also sometimes

223SECTORAL POLICIES

both developed and developing economies are taking 
action at the national level to address cybersecurity 
concerns. But because of the global nature of the 
internet and the cross-border nature of cyberinci-
dents, governments should be encouraged to do more 
to protect themselves and their citizens through 
cooperation at the international level, for instance by 
exchanging information on threats. Because of the 
role of nonstate actors in the provision of infrastruc-
ture and services, governmental efforts will have to 
involve public-private partnerships (working with a 
variety of nonstate actors beyond the private sector) 
and fi nd ways of addressing and even overcoming 
jurisdictional boundaries and barriers. Technical 
solutions will help, as in combating spam, but these 
need to be backed by legal measures and enforce-
ment. Collaboration and openness are key.

In the areas of cybersecurity, there are few obvi-
ous policy recommendations, and in these areas—

the internet are reported almost weekly. Reliable 
estimates of the size of the problem are hard to come 
by because of the defi nitional problem that com-
pounds a lack of common indicators—and because 
fi rms and governments suffering cyberincidents are 
unwilling to disclose losses and thus to reveal vul-
nerabilities. Some of the published sources are based 
on fl awed assumptions, and all reports raise as many 
questions as they answer. The growing centrality of 
the internet in daily lives around the world, and the 
increasing use of mobile devices, combined with the 
“internet of things” (see spotlight 6), appear to have 
increased exposure to cyberrisks.  

Equally important, the incentives to deal with 
cyberrisks need realignment. For example, individ-
uals sometimes do not take proper precautions to 
secure their devices or data, passing on the cost of 
security to society at large. Vendors of hardware and 
software are in a highly competitive environment 
and may push products to market at the expense of 
ensuring proper security features. Cybersecurity is 
expensive and complex (whether through incurring 
up-front costs of “prevention” or dealing with costs 
of restoring security in “recovery and resilience” 
regimes). It may be economically rational to accept 
some degree of insecurity for the convenience to 
transact online.97

That said, there are also various ways of identify-
ing the costs involved, including direct and indirect 
costs, and two types of costs to be considered. First are 
the costs of the breach (actual loss) and of the remedi-
ation efforts to fi x it. Second are costs associated with 
prevention and providing an environment of “trust,” 
as well as understanding the incentives of actors to 
provide security. The methodology encapsulated in 
table 4.2 provides a systematic framework for more 
precisely evaluating “cybercosts” and identifying 
which stakeholders are most likely affected by partic-
ular costs. Aggregating the cumulative costs across all 
players and cost categories yields an estimate of the 
total direct, the total indirect, and the total implicit 
costs. This kind of assessment will be key for policy 
planning. 

Public safety and security in the analog world is a 
public good, ensured by governments. In the cyber-
world, governments also have an obligation, through 
their policies, laws, and institutions, to ensure the 
protection of data, communications, and critical 
infrastructure. One particularly vexing problem in 
government attempts to address cybersecurity is that 
much of the infrastructure, and most of the commu-
nications, are controlled by the private sector or other 
nonstate actors. Around the world, governments of 

Box 4.8 The costs of cybercrime
 
Estimates of the costs of cybercrime abound, but 
many reports are based on weak evidence or overly 
simplifi ed assumptions. Often the methodology is 
not disclosed, complicating an assessment of its 
validity. Damage, typically assessed at a highly aggre-
gated level, is diffi  cult to link to specifi c incidents. 
Furthermore, most estimates are developed by com-
panies directly involved in the sector, which may have 
an interest to overestimate the risks. Nevertheless, the 
cost estimates are both high and growing:

•  A 2014 study put the global costs of cybercrime 
at between US$375 billion and $US575 billion, or 
about 0.6 percent of global GDP.a

•  A 2014 study showed the average per person cost of 
data breaches ranged from US$51 in India to US$201 
in the United States, and had risen 15 percent in a 
year.b 

•  A 2013 study estimated that the global costs to 
consumers (excluding businesses) were around 
US$113 billion, and had risen by half in one year.c 

•  A 2008 study estimated that the global eff ects of 
malware were around 0.5 percent of global GDP.d

Protecting personal privacy and data 
online is essential in building trust in the 
internet
The other side of the “balance” is protecting privacy 
and data online.99 One of the key drivers in the digital 
economy is the fl ow of personal data, of which an 
estimated 90 percent has been added in the last two 
years. Collecting and analyzing data about individu-
als is integral to how some of the largest companies 
in the world do business. For example, Facebook is a 
company with a US$230 billion capitalization largely 
through its sales of ads that reach Facebook users.100 
But data also allow small and medium companies to 
monetize their services. 

The World Economic Forum (WEF) has identi-
fi ed data-driven enterprises as part of a strategy for 
economic development in developing countries.101 

perhaps more than others—governments can play a 
role in developing effective policies. The “perimeter 
security” paradigm that pervades today, born in an 
era of a few centralized mainframe computers, needs 
revisiting, putting users—not devices—at the center 
of the discussion, and thus implying a great role for 
capacity building.98 Public policy could be used to 
change misaligned incentives to achieve security. 
Given the pace of technological change, these policies 
should be guidelines or principles, not prescriptive, 
and be technology neutral. They should encourage 
interoperability among regimes and legal systems 
to investigate and prosecute cybercriminals across 
jurisdictions and to avoid the creation of safe havens 
for cybercriminals. Finally, work could be done to 
develop a common set of indicators to measure the 
economic impact of cybercrime and other cyberrisks.

Like big data, the internet of things also poses 
new privacy challenges, notably in the ability it 
offers to develop detailed user profi les.111 The number 
of connected devices in use worldwide is set to rise 
signifi cantly as consumer goods companies, auto 
manufacturers, health care providers, and other busi-
nesses continue to invest in connected devices.112 Data 
collected are generally anonymized, but users may be 
unwittingly relinquishing control of their personal 
data. Open data initiatives by governments raise sim-
ilar concerns about “anonymization,” data breaches, 
and unauthorized or unintended re-use.

Privacy concerns need to be balanced against 
other important issues such as transparency, freedom 
of expression, proportionality, and security.113 There is 
tension between protecting the privacy of individuals 
and keeping them safe from terrorism or criminals. 
Law enforcement and national security agencies 
need access to CDRs, and legal call interception, to 
track criminals, but they should do this by having 
appropriate safeguards in place to seek authorization, 
and not by using blanket surveillance measures. The 
exposure of indiscriminate snooping by governments 
has, ironically, encouraged large internet content 
providers to make far wider use of encryption, and 
operating system manufacturers are following suit.114 
Outside the domain of law enforcement, legislation 
should give users more control of their data at the 
point of use (if not at the point of collection). Con-
sider the Electronic Health Record System in Estonia, 
which is based on the principle that citizens own their 
own health records and can easily access them and 
transfer them between doctors.115

Privacy policy concerns also need to be balanced 
against countervailing public policy issues such as 
freedom of expression and government transpar-
ency in the internet context. A recent decision from 
the European Court of Justice,116 popularly known 
as the right to be forgotten, highlights this debate. 
Users in Europe now have greater control of the 
data about them on the internet.117 This right can be 
exercised against search engines, such as Google or 
Bing, and would include seeking to remove search 
results pointing to documents held elsewhere in the 
cloud. But the decision does not offer clear guidelines 
for applying the right. Beyond that, once something 
is online, it is virtually impossible to ensure that all 
copies are deleted. Complying with user demands to 
delete personal data will impose additional costs on 
businesses and governments.

One sign of the growing awareness of public policy 
concerns is the surge in new privacy laws, even while 
there has been divergence among countries (such as 

Protecting personal data online is key for the data-
driven economy, since it will increase trust in the 
internet, and greater trust will foster more use. And 
privacy is not just a developed-country issue. Some 
studies show how concerns over maintaining privacy 
online have more to do with “awareness” of threats to 
privacy posed by the internet, rather than with relative 
economic development, debunking the notion that 
privacy is mainly a western preoccupation.102 But the 
issue is not as simple as having and enforcing national 
laws that protect personal data. Data fl ows nowadays 
are global, and privacy regimes need to be interopera-
ble with one another to really enable the internet to be 
an engine of innovation and economic growth. 

Privacy concerns range from the personally sensi-
tive (personal health information or precise locational 
information) to the seemingly trivial (search or brows-
ing history). But even the most innocuous data can 
become harmful when used by third parties in unau-
thorized or unexpected ways.103 Most internet users 
are willing to surrender personal data—or control 
over it—for more convenience (gift suggestions based 
on their past purchases), for possible gain (the chance 
to win a holiday), and to avoid payment (notably, 
when downloading and using free mobile apps). But 
few users have the means to challenge data use poli-
cies or even make the effort to read the small print.104 
Privacy online is also a balance. It may be economi-
cally rational to relinquish some degree of privacy for 
the convenience of transacting online. But beyond 
respecting users’ choice in how they transact online, 
public policy choices involve determining what other 
measures are necessary to afford appropriate privacy 
protections. The key is to ensure that users are made 
aware of the risks of diminished privacy.

One of these privacy challenges105 is the growing 
use of “big data.”106 Data mining has been routinely 
used, especially by social media and e-commerce 
companies, to create value. The business model of 
Twitter or Facebook, for instance, is to grant users 
free storage, communication, and functionality in 
return for privileged access to the content they cre-
ate. Such companies then aggregate and analyze 
user-generated content to sell value to advertisers 
wishing to reach targeted audiences. This classic two-
sided market approach can make for a more intelli-
gent and convenient user interface, but at the risk of 
alienating users if they fi nd the use of their data too 
intrusive.107 Mobile call data records (CDRs), which 
record basic data like the time, duration, location, and 
direction of calls, can also be mined to extract trend 
information.108And many applications are potentially 
valuable, as in traffi c analysis109 or epidemiology.110 



226 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

a long-standing concern in the United States about 
which Europe had been more hesitant. The U.S. 
administration unveiled a blueprint for a consumer 
privacy bill of rights that would address consumer 
privacy more comprehensively. At the same time, 
in reaction to the Edward Snowden revelations (dis-
cussed below), the European Court of Justice issued 
its opinion in the Schrems case effectively invalidating 
the “Safe Harbor” agreement reached between the 
European Union and the United States permitting the 
handling of European data in the United States.126

Different approaches, however, are making it 
diffi cult to develop truly global internet services and 
applications because local adaptations are required to 
comply with differing national privacy laws, impos-
ing additional compliance burdens and costs on busi-
nesses (see chapter 6).127 Diverging rules also stifl e 
trade and innovation. In addition, the threat of “data 
nationalism”128—the idea that a country’s data should 
be stored within its borders, recently embodied in a 
new Russian law, for example, that requires the local 
storage of the personal data of Russian citizens—has 

in the European Union and the United States) in their 
approach.118 According to the United Nations Confer-
ence on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), 107 coun-
tries had privacy laws or bills in place as of 2014, but 
only 51 of them were developing countries (map 4.2).119 

At the international level the United Nations Gen-
eral Assembly has adopted a Resolution, introduced 
by Brazil and Germany, on the Right to Privacy in the 
Digital Age.120 The Africa Union Convention on Cyber-
security includes data protection.121 The OECD, in 2013, 
published its updated Privacy Guidelines, revising work 
originally carried out in the 1980s.122 The Asia-Pacifi c 
Economic Cooperation followed up on its Privacy 
Framework with a cross-border privacy arrangement 
in 2010.123 The European Union is conducting an over-
haul of its data protection framework.124 while the 
United States is also considering options.125 

The data protection story is becoming more 
complex. There is some evidence of convergence: 
the newly proposed EU data protection framework 
includes a directive looking closely at the protection 
of data as they relate to security and defense issues,

So, depending on where one sits, the issue can be 
taken up as an issue of scarce bandwidth or of free 
speech. As with other resources where capacity is 
scarce, as on mobile networks, carriers attempt to use 
price discrimination to manage traffi c. Network pro-
viders argue that regulators should grant them more 
fl exibility to manage their traffi c fl ows. But others 
argue that traffi c management should not become 
an excuse to block certain traffi c streams, content, or 
expression, to give preference to others, or to impede 
competition. The recent trend to develop services in 
which some basic content can be accessed free of data 
charges (such as Facebook’s Free Basics or Internet.
org), while other content is subject to data charges, 
would appear to be the antithesis of net neutrality 
and a distortion of markets.133 Nevertheless, some 
defend the practice as a means of extending internet 
use in low-income countries.134 In India, following 
protests, some participating organizations withdrew 
support to Airtel Zero and Internet.org, as the regu-
lator indicated that these platforms do not provide 
equal treatment to all online services.135 

An open and free internet is also a key contrib-
uting factor to innovation in the digital economy, 
making it critical to protect this openness. Care 
should be taken to ensure that users have the 
greatest possible access to internet-based content, 
applications, and services of their choice. But traffi c 
management measures, while legitimate, should not 
reduce the enjoyment of fundamental rights and 
freedoms, particularly freedom of expression. The 
balance here should be carefully calibrated so that 
network operators continue to have incentives to 
build out and continuously improve networks and 
network capacity. Recognizing the balance to be 
sought in this debate, the Council of Europe in 2010 
announced its policy on “net neutrality” (without 
calling it such), emphasizing the rights-based aspect 
of the issue.136 

Much of the early debate on net neutrality in 
the United States was focused on the classifi cation 
of the internet under the 1996 Telecommunications 
Act; in the rest of the world, the issues argued under 
the same moniker look at the impact of traffi c man-
agement techniques, such as deliberately slowing 
(or “throttling”) data streams, on human rights, and 
the continuing impact of the internet as a driver of 
innovation. Access to information is not solely a 
“developed” or “developing” country preoccupation. 
Not only is it a fundamental human right, inherent 
in Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil 

grown since the revelations by Edward Snowden 
about the U.S. government’s surveillance of foreign 
internet traffi c, which was subsequently declared to 
have been illegal.129 That puts an additional burden 
on companies seeking to build services that rely on 
cloud-based networks.130 

What is clear, however, is that getting the data 
protection and privacy piece of the puzzle right is, 
together with cybersecurity, a key element in engen-
dering trust in and confi dence in use of the internet. 
Even before “Snowden,” users in countries of all 
regions were concerned that they should be careful 
about what they say online, as more and more per-
ceived that their actions would be monitored.131 While 
data protection and privacy are essentially matters 
of local law, a preponderance of privacy laws around 
the world are based on a common set of international, 
durable, and recognized principles. Moreover, inter-
operability of data protection regimes will encourage 
cross-border data fl ows and decrease the propensity 
for data nationalism. As discussed, data protection is 
not solely a preoccupation of advanced economies. 
Unlike investments in infrastructure, ensuring that 
good practice in data protection is part of the overall 
internet enabling environment makes sense for a 
country interested in the internet as a means of eco-
nomic development.  

Does net neutrality matter?
One of the more confounding issues around the 
internet today is “net neutrality.” The term, euphemis-
tically derived out of debates in the United States, has 
become a shorthand for a debate about the manage-
ment and prioritization of scarce resources—notably 
bandwidth—over the internet. Thus the debate has pit-
ted users and content providers against network pro-
viders.132 In oversimplifi ed terms, content providers 
want an “open” and “free” internet where every data 
bit, or IP packet, is treated equally, while network pro-
viders seek to charge higher rates for services chewing 
up more bandwidth. In the United States, the debate 
over net neutrality was mainly about the bandwidth 
consumed by video downloads. After announcing 
new rules in February 2015, opponents of the rules 
in the United States (mainly network providers) have 
claimed that compelling the openness of the internet 
imposes on their rights as a corporation to determine 
which content to make available. In other parts of the 
world, the debate over net neutrality is recognized as a 
matter of freedom of expression or access to informa-
tion for individuals—a human rights issue. 



228 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

and golf courses.142 Specifi cally, the serendipitous 
“collisions” between like-minded individuals that 
create innovative ideas are more likely to occur in 
high-density urban environments than in lower-
density locales where high-technology industry has 
traditionally fl ourished.143

Governments are generally not very good at pick-
ing technology winners. Nor can they easily create 
technology clusters, which tend to grow organically, 
where the right conditions are in place, as fi rms draw 
upon the same talent pool and startups spin off from 
established enterprises. From the recent development 
of tech hubs and FabLabs—for instance, there are now 
more than 555 FabLabs across 77 countries144—it is 
unclear if all of them would have come up organically, 
though government involvement in most of them has 
been minimal (box 4.9 and map 4.3). But government 
policy can help to sustain an emerging technology 
cluster, for instance by instituting favorable tax 
regimes or liberal policies on awarding employment 
permits to skilled workers (“tech visas”). Israel shows 
how government can stimulate the growth of an ICT 
cluster once it becomes established (box 4.10). Govern-
ment procurement can also help create opportunities 
for local companies to fl ourish without infringing 
commitments to free trade, for instance by unbun-
dling large ICT projects into smaller components. But 
governments also can unwittingly undermine a local 
ICT sector, with lax rules on intellectual property 
protection or burdensome taxes on the import of ICT 
goods and components.

National ICT strategies 
In recent years, it seems to have become ever more 
complicated to develop a coherent set of policies to 
regulate and promote a nation’s ICT sector. Rapid 
technological change, coupled with disruptive 
changes in the supply side of the industry and grow-
ing challenges on the demand side, requires fl exi-
bility. But industry players demand predictability in 
policy setting and a level playing fi eld. ICT users are 
becoming ever more vocal, and expertise that may 
once have been centralized is now dispersed through-
out government. So, coordination becomes all the 
more important.

When countries take a conscious decision to 
develop a national strategy for broadband, or their 
ICT sector more generally, they are rewarded with 

and Political Rights,137 it is also an essential element 
in the online innovation ecosystem, and therefore 
an economic development issue. In whatever form a 
country would wish to use the internet for develop-
ment purposes, its public policies should ensure that 
technical management of internet traffi c is not used 
to suppress a tool of innovation.

Promoting the digital 
economy

The internet as an open access ecosystem
Once the internet is widely available and affordable in 
a country, and public trust that the internet is a safe 
and open platform for doing business or storing per-
sonal information has been established, it can become 
an unrivaled platform for promoting entrepreneurial 
opportunity. Indeed, 9 of the top 20 people in the 
Forbes 2015 billionaires list made their money from 
the sector.138 Initially, internet entrepreneurship was 
associated with the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, 
but the networks of the day lagged behind the aspi-
rations of entrepreneurs. As one subsequently said, 
“A lot of the business plans were deeply fl awed, but 
a lot of the ideas would have worked had there been 
broadband.”139 Since 2008, when broadband crossed 
the threshold of 10-percent penetration worldwide, a 
new and more sustained period of internet entrepre-
neurship has developed. 

The U.S. economy has so far been the main bene-
fi ciary of the internet as a source of innovation and 
entrepreneurship.140 This success is exemplifi ed by 
the Silicon Valley technology cluster. Many coun-
tries have tried to imitate it.141 Few have succeeded. 
The ingredients of success for ICT clusters have 
traditionally included close collaboration between 
academia and industry, easy access to venture capital, 
high levels of government research spending, and 
a physical environment and climate that is attrac-
tive to footloose, highly paid workers. However, in 
recent years, certain cities with doubtful climates 
have also developed a vibrant tech entrepreneur-
ship scene, notably Bangalore, Berlin, Hangzhou, 
London, Nairobi, and New York. This suggests that 
the internet is creating a new set of geographical 
preconditions for innovation districts that are more 
about density and bandwidth than about sunshine

oping them and whether they can be easily imple-
mented. In the same way that international internet 
governance has evolved toward a multistakeholder 
model, so too national strategies can benefi t from 
ensuring that there is an opportunity for all stake-
holders to express their views and that those views 
are refl ected in policy making and regulation. In 
an era in which mobile subscriptions exceed the 
world’s population, and with each internet user hav-
ing within easy reach a vast library of global knowl-
edge, ICT policy is too important to be left to the 
bureaucrats. Broad multistakeholder collaboration 
is the key. Equally important is the fact that digital 
development strategies need to be broader than they 
are today, strengthening the country’s ICT infra-
structure, but also the foundation underpinning 
its digital economy—an issue explored in the next 
chapter.

higher rates of service take-up.145 As of mid-2013, 
some 134 countries had already developed national 
broadband plans, and a further 12 planned to do so. 
Once developed, plans need to be regularly refreshed 
and updated, ideally on a cycle of three to fi ve years, 
according to the United Nations Broadband Commis-
sion, which has set a target that all countries should 
have a national broadband plan by 2015, with at least 
40 percent of households in developing countries 
served with broadband.146 National broadband plans 
are also more effective when they include specifi c 
benchmarks, or targets, that are relevant, measurable, 
realistic, and actionable. For example, Estonia has set 
a target that at least 100 Mbit/s broadband service 
should be available to each citizen by 2015.

What seems to be important is not so much the 
plans themselves, which vary enormously in quality 
and scope, but the consultation process for devel-

Box 4.9 Tech hubs in Africa

The recent development of tech hubs across Africa (see 
map 4.3) exemplifi es how technology clusters create a 
snowball eff ect whereby initial preconditions for success 
generate additional, mutually reinforcing innovation 
drivers. Though nowhere similar in scale to Silicon Valley, 
technology clusters in Africa nevertheless demonstrate 
that close collaboration between academia, government, 
and the private sector can help develop a vibrant eco-
system that facilitates ongoing innovation and market 
entry. Tech hub clusters, such as in Cape Town, Lagos, 
and Nairobi, show that once a certain threshold is passed, 
new hubs and ongoing entrepreneurial activity can be 
stimulated through enhanced access to fi nance, services to 
entrepreneurs, and the demonstration eff ects of successful 
“fi rst mover” startups. The development of Nairobi’s tech 
cluster dates to the founding of iHub in March 2010. Growth 
has spread, fi rst to the rest of the Bishop Magua Centre 
where it is located (including Nailab, m:lab East Africa, 

and the longer-established Ushahidi), and then to nearby 
Strathmore University (where iBiz and iLab are located) 
and along Ngong Road to the GreenHouse and 88 mph/
Startup Garage.a 

As with the creative destruction of the original dot-com 
bubble, many new startups, including some of the hubs 
themselves, have overestimated market demand for their 
products and services and ended up with short lifespans. 
Thus the turnover of hubs and incubators in Africa has been 
relatively rapid over the last fi ve years,b but the growth 
path is still upward, with a net increase of around 15 percent 
since the start of 2014. Tech hub performance also depends 
on context-specifi c dynamics, and the situation of the local 
business community. However, the comparative success of 
certain clusters, while others remain stagnant, suggests 
that organic, multistakeholder ecosystems work better 
than initiatives led by government, the private sector, or 
academia alone.

231SECTORAL POLICIES

Box 4.10 Israel as a startup nation

The term “startup nation” was used to describe Israel in 
a 2011 best-selling book.a It takes as its starting point the 
6,000 startups created between 2000 and 2010, more than 
twice the rate of the previous decade. In 2013, the informa-
tion and communication technology (ICT) sector in Israel 
made up 16 percent of GDP and 26 percent of exports and 
employed 8.5 percent of its workforce.b It was also the fi fth 
largest exporter of computer software and services in 2012, 
according to the World Trade Organization,c as ICT exports 
have increased almost tenfold since 1990 to over US$20 
billion (fi gure B4.10.1, panel a).d A key ingredient in the 
success of the startup nation has been the role of the Israeli 
government, which designed its interventions so as not to 
hamper the emergence of the private sector. 

Many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) governments play an active role in 
funding innovation but Israel’s program, from the very 
start in the late 1960s, has been particularly geared toward 
“sector-neutrality”—meaning that the government did not 
try to “pick winners.” The program’s design avoided crowd-
ing out private investment and stimulated additionality.e 
Recent programs have included the Tnufa program (since 

2000), supporting entrepreneurs in the very fi rst stages of 
development; Magneton (since 2001), supporting industrial/
academic cooperation; the Public Technology Incubator 
Program set up in the early 1990s to help assimilate a wave 
of immigrants from the former Soviet Union; and the Yozma 
Fund, a venture capital fund set up in 1993 for technology 
companies. As a result, Israel consistently scores the highest 
level of gross domestic expenditures on research and devel-
opment among OECD economies, although the Republic of 
Korea is catching up (fi gure B4.10.1, panel b). 

But government support for fi rms in the ICT sector is not 
the whole story. Israel’s government has promoted a high 
level of investment in education, and the sector has bene-
fi ted from the innovativeness of the fi rm’s themselves, which 
have been particularly successful in fi elds such as cyberse-
curity, mobile phone apps, and voice over internet protocol. 
Recent tech startups include Taboola (a content distribution 
and discovery platform), Silverbyte Systems (providing hotel 
management software), and Ceragon Networks (a wireless 
backhaul provider), while longer-established ones include 
Waze, which provides a location-based navigation app, and 
Wix, off ering a cloud-based web development platform.

Notes
 1.  “High-speed internet” in this chapter is equated 

with fi xed-line broadband service (such as digital 
subscriber line, cable modem, and fi ber optics) and 
fourth-generation (4G) mobile services. Internet 
usage is much higher, at around 40 percent, but this 
is generally at slower speeds and is not necessarily 
affordable or “always on.”

 7.  Internet protocol (IP)–based networks used packet- 

switching, a technology developed in the 1960s, that 
packages information into uniform chunks of dig-
ital data, or “packets,” that can be used to transmit 
voice, text, video, or data. IP-based networks thus 
combine into a single network those functions that 
were previously handled by separate and distinct 
networks (Mathison, Roberts, and Walker 2012).

of AT&T initially prevailed, as this was considered 
essential to achieving “universal service,” a tele-

1974 eventually broke up AT&T into seven separate 
regional operators and a national long-distance and 
international carrier a decade later, opening the 
door for competition (Crandall 1991).

Telecom is fully state-owned and enjoys monopoly

mobile service. But neighboring Somalia currently 
lacks a national communications act and sector 
regulator, which means that local operators func-

population lived within range of a mobile signal in 
2015 (ITU 2015).

 45.  This aggregate statistic (68 percent) is derived from 
GSMA (http://www.gsmaintelligence.com), which 
estimates that, as of Q4 2014, some 98 percent of the 
citizens of developed economies and 62 percent of 
developing ones lived within range of a 3G signal. 
The equivalent fi gures for 4G/LTE were 88 percent 
and 15 percent, giving an aggregate of 26 percent.

 47.  As an example, the Comoros opened its mobile 

market to competition in 2007, but the incumbent 
operator, Comoros Telecoms, was successfully able 
to resist interconnection due to weak regulation, 
and the market entrant, Twama Telecom, never 
started service (World Bank 2014). The Comoros 
announced a license award for a new second opera-
tor, won by Telma, in October 2015. 

 48.  Third-generation (3G) and fourth-generation (LTE) 
operate in multiple spectrum bands, but mainly at 
1,800, 2,300, and 2,600 MHz. In countries where the 
transition to digital broadcasting is complete, the 
more valuable spectrum of 700 MHz can be released 
for mobile communications. This is more attractive 
to investors as fewer cells are needed to cover the 
same territory (Dahlman and others 2007).

[AEPD] and Mario Costeja González [Case No. 131/12,

links to data upon request if they are inadequate

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

Cities are where problems and solutions meet. They 
are our centers of commerce and innovation—and 
the gateways to the global economy. With the world 
rapidly urbanizing, cities will only grow in impor-
tance; the urban population of the developing world 
is expected to double between 2000 and 2030, adding 
2 billion city dwellers. This creates urgency to get our 
cities “right” because the global response to our most 
pressing challenges—from climate change to rising 
inequality—will likely succeed or fail in cities. 

Innovative urban leaders have begun to tap into 
new streams of data on the state and performance 
of their cities, often in real time, to realize a forward- 
looking vision of a “smart city”—a city that leverages 
the latest in technology and connectivity to make 
better decisions and achieve the urban aspirations 
of its residents.1 Specifi cally, smart cities collect lots 
of data through instrumentation, bring these data 
together through integration, and then analyze the 
integrated data for intelligence on how to improve the 
city’s services and quality of life (fi gure F4.1). Smart 
cities use this three-step approach to tackle everything 
from reducing traffi c congestion to fi ghting crime to 
improving air quality. 

Despite widespread enthusiasm, however, dis-
cussions held under the World Bank’s Urbanization 
Knowledge Partnership indicate that most city 
leaders struggle to understand how to best invest in 
intelligent infrastructure and connectivity to deliver 
long-term value. In addition, the concept of a smart 
city has grown somewhat controversial. Proponents 
argue that smart city innovations offer a genuine rev-
olution in city management. Skeptics see empty hype 
that risks wastefully distorting the investments of 
resource-constrained governments as they prioritize 

“fancy” technology over less exciting but more impor-
tant foundational investments. 

While evidence of sustained impact remains elu-
sive, governments allocate signifi cant sums on smart 
city projects, including in the developing world. 
China has launched a reported US$70 billion “smart 
city” credit line and a US$8 billion investment fund.2 
India is seeking to leverage its homegrown informa-
tion technology (IT) industry to construct 100 smart 
cities, with a fi rst-year budget of US$1.2 billion. 3 Rio 
de Janeiro implemented a fi rst-of-a-kind Intelligent 
Operations Center, bringing together data from 
over 30 agencies and services in a command center 
like that of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA). Even resource-constrained 
cities in Africa are embarking on the smart city jour-
ney, such as in Konza Techno City near Nairobi.

Pragmatically, old and new cities alike have begun 
to incorporate smart technologies into the everyday 
fabric and complexities of their existing urban cen-
ters to drive greater effi ciencies in city operations; 
provide a platform for innovation at a citywide scale; 
and promote social inclusion through heightened 
accountability, citizen empowerment, and smarter 
decision making.

Effi  ciency—to do “more 
with less”
By collecting large amounts of data and then trans-
lating these data into insights, cities are able to boost 
the effi ciency and responsiveness of their operations. 
Data help cities better match the supply of public 
services with real-time needs and uncover emerging 
problems before they turn into crises. Smart city tech-
nologies make this possible in several ways. Automated

optimization translates data from cameras, sensors, 
and anonymized cellphone records into intelligence 
to, for example, help optimize traffi c fl ows in real 
time. Predictive analytics uses such data to track and 
predict everything from rainfall to crime hot spots to 
possible landslide areas. Evidence-based decision making 
and planning can continuously monitor milestones 
and targets to ensure cities can quickly take corrective 
actions as needed to achieve their goals.

Innovation—through 
collaboration at city scale
Most smart city innovations have their origins in the 
private sector. Engineers argue that a city is essen-
tially a complex system of systems, and each of these 
systems generates data that can be analyzed to make 
cities smarter. But for individual “smart systems” to 
add up to a “smart city,” innovations must be on a 
citywide scale. That requires contributions and ideas 
not just from commercial fi rms but also from gov-
ernments and citizens through public-private-people 
partnerships.

Open data, social media, and cellphones enable 
governments, fi rms, and citizens to exchange vast 
amounts of information at virtually no cost—making 
it far easier to share knowledge and ideas that are dis-
tributed throughout society. These tools also enable 
real-time collaboration, enabling governments to view 
their citizens and fi rms not just as passive customers 
of public services, but as key partners in innovative 
problem solving. Amsterdam and Singapore have 
begun to use this collaborative approach to bring 
together citizens, businesses, and government to 
experiment with innovations to lower their city’s envi-
ronmental footprint, one neighborhood at a time.

Governments can facilitate collaboration through 
three platforms. Through local open data, cities share 
local data with the public, promoting transparency, 
accountability, and collaborative problem solving. 
Through “living labs,” governments designate parts 
of the city as test beds to collaboratively pilot new 
ideas. Through urban analytics centers, cities partner 
with local universities and industry to seed cross-
disciplinary research centers with systematic access 
to local urban data. 

Inclusion—to ensure 
everyone benefi ts
City leaders should focus smart city efforts on the 
needs of all residents. Three valuable urban practices 
in the developing world are worth noting. First, use data 
to target the most vulnerable, as São Paulo did by devel-
oping a comprehensive geographic database of socio-
economic and physical indicators to prioritize housing 
and slum upgrading investments. Second, open up data 
to promote accountability, including grassroots initia-
tives such as the mapping of facilities, pollution, and 
community needs in Kibera, Nairobi’s largest informal 
settlement. Third, tap mobile connectivity to expand civic 
participation, as cities in the Philippines have done for 
participatory budgeting and for crowdsourcing the 
identifi cation of smoke-belching vehicles. 

The road ahead—the city as 
a laboratory
The explosion of urban data will slowly give rise to 
a “science of cities.” City leaders can speed up this 
process by turning their cities into laboratories for 
smart innovations that translate local experiments

into global knowledge, and global knowledge into 
local solutions.

This exchange of ideas will no longer fl ow only 
from the West to the rest, since rapid urbanization 
enables cities in the developing world to leapfrog 
their global peers by incorporating smart from the 
start in ways that are cheaper and easier than retrofi t-
ting legacy infrastructure. Cities in the “global south,” 
from Rio to Shanghai, often push the boundaries of 
innovation as aggressively as their peers in the “global 
north.” In fact, smart cities may be the fi rst instance 
of a large-scale urban transformation that is truly 
global in origin, with innovations and ideas fl owing 
in all directions simultaneously—and with pockets of 
innovation appearing in unexpected places.

Accelerating this progress will require actions at 
all levels. Global institutions like the World Bank can 
facilitate the sharing of experiences. Cities can work 
together to establish open standards to avoid vendor 
“lock-in” and to make it easier to share solutions—a 
community-developed app in, say, Chicago, can then 
be rapidly deployed in Chengdu and Caracas. Local 
governments can address the often fragmented struc-
ture of their bureaucracies and outdated procurement 
systems that are incompatible with the design and 
implementation of integrated IT systems. And city 

halls everywhere should bring together governments, 
fi rms, and the public to jointly design a vision for the 
future of their city with long-term goals and short-
term priorities to guide the development of smart city 
projects that deliver value for all the city’s residents.

244 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

A report commissioned by the United Nations, A 
World That Counts, proclaims, “Data are the lifeblood 
of decision-making and the raw material for account-
ability. Without high-quality data providing the right 
information on the right things at the right time, 
designing, monitoring and evaluating effective poli-
cies becomes almost impossible.”1 

Recognizing the potential for harnessing the ongo-
ing explosion of data, but mindful of gaps between 
the developing and developed world, the report calls 
for a data revolution that would aid in the achieve-
ment of the Sustainable Development Goals.

The world is witnessing an unprecedented explo-
sion of data. Digital data overtook analog around 1998, 
and in 2013 amounted to 46 billion trillion bytes. That’s 
equivalent to about 400 trillion printed copies of this 
Report, which when stacked would reach from Earth 
to well beyond Pluto. Figure S5.1 shows the ongoing 
upsurge of data, as measured by total storage capacity. 
Figure S5.2 shows the evolution of telecommunica-
tions capacity. Although the absolute gap between 
higher- and lower-income countries is increasing, 
growth in the latter has been faster since 2008.

In harnessing this data explosion for development, 
attention focuses on two overlapping innovations: 
“big data” and open data. Big data are voluminous 
or fast. They come, for instance, from satellite and 
ground sensors and as by-products (“data exhaust”) 
from electronic transactions and from mobile phone 
calls. The promise of big data is to provide informa-
tion of unprecedented scope, detail, or rapidity. For 
instance, Global Forest Watch crunches massive 
amounts of open satellite data in order to generate 
near real-time, global maps of tropical deforestation.2

Open data are those that are freely and easily acces-
sible, machine-readable, and explicitly unrestricted 
in use. Open data aren’t necessarily big, and big data 
aren’t necessarily open. Governments are, or could 
be, important sources of data on population, public 
budgets, education and health facility usage and sta-
tus, weather, and trade. When opened, these data can 
be combined and recombined in ways that directly 
benefi t the public (for instance, by increasing the 
transparency and accountability of government) and 
provide the basis for commercial, value-added services 
(such as apps for navigating public transit). Box S5.1 
presents some examples of both big and open data.

Exuberant estimates of the current and potential 
economic value of big data and open data range from 
the hundreds of billions to the trillions of dollars per 
year. The clearest benefi ts so far have been for map 
and weather data. Openly available global positioning 
system (GPS) data supported markets for geospatial 
data and services worth US$56 billion in 2013 in the 
United States alone.3 At least four companies valued 
at over US$1 billion—Zillow, Zoopla, Waze, and the 
Climate Corporation—process and resell open data 
about real estate, traffi c conditions, and weather.

Yet sustained, impactful, scaled-up examples of 
big and open data in the developing world are still rel-
atively rare. Open data has far to go. Figure S5.3 shows 
that readiness, implementation, and impact of open 
data are all highly correlated with GDP per capita, but 
that there are shortcomings in high-income coun-
tries, as well.

Data impact requires willing suppliers and eager 
demanders. On the supply side, private holders of 
data may be reluctant to share it for fear of jeopardiz-
ing customers’ privacy or corporate competitiveness. 
Yet some of these data, if pooled and shared, could

generate public benefi ts. There are emerging models 
that seek to create a symbiotic relationship among 
public, private, and academic actors that incorporates 
benefi ts for all.

For instance, taxi companies may justifi ably be 
unwilling to share detailed data on vehicle move-
ments. Data on average vehicle speed by road seg-
ment is valuable for the companies—it helps them

Informing relief eff orts in the wake of the Nepal 
earthquake. A critical need in disaster relief is to track 
displaced populations for effi  cient logistics planning. 
Cellphone location data can provide comprehensive, 
real-time information on population, but cellphone 
operators are often reluctant to share this data for techni-
cal, confi dentiality, or competitive reasons.  Flowminder, 
a Swedish nongovernmental organization (NGO), has 
worked out procedures for accessing this data and has 
used it to estimate population movements following 
the 2015 earthquake to aid in relief eff orts. http://www

Real-time independent measures of infl ation. PriceStats 
computes daily infl ation data for 22 economies by scrap-

Accountability for subsidies in Mexico. Fundar Center for

and other fi nancial fl ows, and allows data to be visual-

with dispatching—and for city managers it provides 
a useful gauge of congestion. The World Bank is 
exploring ways to provide companies with software 
that distills their data down to average vehicle speed. 
This summarized data could then be shared between 
companies and with the public, yielding more accu-
rate and comprehensive estimates of travel speeds.

In Australia, a tech startup called The Yield is work-
ing with public sector regulators to test ways to help 
farmers share data for the common good. The $A 100 
million Australian oyster industry loses nearly $A 34 
million a year due to harvesting closures by regulators 
to protect human health when runoff is contaminated. 
The idea is to equip the oyster farms with real-time 
sensors on water quality. The data will help individual 
farmers with farm management, while allowing regu-
lators to optimize decisions, avoiding costly, unneces-
sary closures and still maintaining safety.

Public agencies are also reluctant to share data, 
even when it has large public benefi ts. For example, 
of the 86 countries surveyed by the Open Data Barom-
eter, one-third of the high-income countries and 85 

percent of the remainder had made little or no prog-
ress in opening map data. One reason is that cash-
strapped agencies support themselves by selling data. 
This shuts out many potential users, even though the 
additional cost of providing the data to them would 
be negligible. A dramatic example of reversing this 
trade-off is the decision of the U.S. government to 
reduce the cost of a digital Landsat satellite image 
from US$600 to zero in 2008. The annual number of 
downloads increased from fewer than 25,000 to 3 mil-
lion. The direct benefi ts are estimated at US$1.8 billion 
a year for U.S. users and US$400 million for interna-
tional users;4 there are substantial indirect benefi ts as 
well. The loss of government revenue from selling the 
25,000 images was miniscule by comparison. So if the 
fi xed costs of data maintenance can be fi nanced, the 
benefi ts from free distribution can be large.

There are other reasons for public agencies to be 
reluctant to share. Agencies may lack technical skills 
to share data. They may be unwilling to expose the 
data to scrutiny because of quality concerns. They 
may value the political leverage afforded by monop-
olizing data. Nonetheless, both the G-8 countries and 
the African Union’s High-Level Conference on the 
Data Revolution have endorsed the concept of mak-
ing offi cial data open by default. 

Effective demand for data may also be weak, even 
if there is underlying interest. Of course, accessibility 
to the internet is a prerequisite. Outdated or poor-
quality data will discourage demand. Because data lit-
eracy is critical, intermediaries can play a key role in 
interpreting, analyzing, and disseminating open data. 
But capacity or incentive to do this is often lacking. 
There has not been as much uptake by journalists as 
some have hoped. And while a benefi t of open data 
is enhanced sharing among government agencies, 
relatively few governments are making optimal use 
of existing statistics for planning purposes, according 
to PARIS21. However, Bangladesh, Cambodia, and 
Niger scored high on statistical capacity (according to 
PARIS21’s IDR Metadatabase), showing that it is pos-
sible for low-income countries to excel at generating 
and using statistics.5

The pioneering Kenyan Open Data Initiative 
shows both the promise and challenges of open data. 
A champion, Permanent Secretary Bitange Ndemo, 
persuaded ministries to open their data, and the 
program was inaugurated in 2011. The World Bank, 
Google, and Ushahidi provided technical and fi nan-
cial support. Drawing on Nairobi’s vibrant tech scene, 
the ancillary Code4Kenya initiative spurred the 
development of apps that presented health, safety, 
and other information in engaging and useful ways.

A journalist, Irene Choge, attended a Data Journalism 
Boot Camp. She then used the Open Data Platform to 
trace a chain of links: funding for school toilets had 
gone missing, so the student-to-toilet ratio for many 
schools was intolerably high, leading to open defe-
cation; consequently students were suffering from 
illnesses associated with poor sanitation, and female 
students, especially, were discouraged from attend-
ing school; the end result was poor performance on 
tests. The fi ndings prompted government action.6 

Despite this promising beginning, the Open Data 
Initiative lost steam. Data were not updated, the apps 
struggled to fi nd users, and a legal framework for 
open data was not in place by mid-2015. Kenya’s score 
on the Open Data Barometer dropped from 43 to 26 
between 2013 and 2014.

This example underscores the global need for sus-
tained commitment to openness and for investment 
in high-quality data if the dream of a data revolution 
is to be realized. Countries can seek ways to discour-
age data hoarding, by adequately funding data hold-
ers and showing them that they can attain a higher 
profi le by opening their data.  Donors and the interna-
tional community can support these actions through 
funding, capacity building, and ensuring that their 
own data are open.

parts: one that can be automated, and one that cannot. 
The automatable part of the task consists of repeat-
able, routine activities that produce measurable 
outputs and outcomes, and therefore are amenable 
to automation. Tasks performed by, say, bank tellers, 
bookkeepers, or clerks—and services such as regis-
tration and licensing—can to a large extent be done 
with digital technologies. In contrast, many tasks per-
formed by teachers, researchers, or managers—and 
services such as policing or those performed in health 
care—involve activities where the providers must 
exercise considerable judgment in deciding what to 
do or how to respond. ICT projects often fail when 
they focus solely on technology without also address-
ing shortcomings in the complements that cannot be 
automated. The line that divides automatable activi-
ties from those that are not is, of course, continuously 
shifting. But solving the most diffi cult development 
problems will almost always require more than just 
technology. 

Chapters 1−3 of this Report presented evidence of 
the problems that can arise from greater use of tech-
nology and identifi ed the main risks that countries 
face as a consequence. To mitigate these risks, invest-
ments in digital technologies must be accompanied 
by improvements of their analog complements 
(fi gure 5.1):

•  Lower-than-expected internet adoption means that 
many fi rms in low- and middle-income countries 
forgo considerable productivity benefi ts. The rea-
sons include a poor business climate and vested 
interests that hinder market entry and reduce the 
pressure to innovate. Without improved regula-
tions, especially those governing competition, econo-
mies of scale brought by the internet could well lead 
to harmful concentration and monopolies—and thus 
to greater divergence between and within countries, 
rather than convergence and catching-up.

Estonia is one of a handful of countries closest to 
becoming a digital society. After regaining its indepen-
dence in 1991, it decided to promote the use of digital 
technologies in all areas of society and the economy. 
The nation was not rich by European standards, so one 
objective was to take advantage of effi ciency gains. 
While investing in information and communication 
technologies (ICTs), Estonia also greatly improved its 
business climate, human capital, and governance. The 
greater ease of doing businesses spawned a host of 
technology-intensive startups, including Skype and 
TranferWise, a company disrupting the money trans-
fer industry. The country today ranks high in the PISA 
(Programme for International Student Assessment) 
educational rankings and invests in digital literacy for 
its older citizens. The greater accountability in gov-
ernment boosted it from 78th to 40th between 1996 
and 2010 on a ranking of 144 countries on their control 
of corruption. Today, Estonians have access to 3,000 
e-government, e-banking, and other services, saving 
each of them an average of 5.4 work days a year.1

Estonia demonstrates that even small and devel-
oping or transitioning countries can seize the oppor-
tunities the internet offers by implementing a smart 
and comprehensive digital development strategy. 
Many other countries have also eagerly invested 
in digital technologies but have failed to create the 
environment for it to support development. So, while 
the internet has spread rapidly, development has 
advanced much more slowly. Chapter 4 discussed 
policies that ensure universal, affordable, safe, and 
open access to the internet. These supply-side policies 
are critically important, but are not enough. 

Why is technology by itself unlikely to solve 
persistent development problems? The key insight 
is that a typical task in development has two broad

more inclusive. The internet thus tends to amplify 
existing strengths and weaknesses, and progress 
in these areas therefore becomes even more urgent. 
Otherwise, there is a risk of falling further behind 
for those who do not make the necessary reforms. As 
the following sections will show, technology does not 
just increase the value of complements. It can also 
often raise their quality—for instance, through online 
business registration programs, online education, or 
better monitoring.

So how can businesses, people, and governments 
reap the greatest digital dividends? The Report 
suggests many detailed steps to strengthen analog 
complements, but policy makers should also keep in 
mind a set of overarching principles concerning the 
interaction of technology and complements.

Guiding premises

The inability to scale up is one of the most 
commonly cited reasons for failed digital 
interventions
The popular media is fi lled with inspiring stories 
involving technology: digital marketplaces are 
helping artisans in remote hillsides to access global 
markets; the on-demand economy is creating new 
startups and digital entrepreneurs; and social media 
tools are helping citizens organize and rally around 
issues of common concern. But after a promising 
start, many initiatives seem to fl ounder. For every 
successful online commerce platform, nearly four 
fail to achieve scale. Despite the growing popularity 
of the on-demand economy, the fi rm startup rate in 

•  Rising shifts of income from labor to capital and 
the drop in mid-level jobs in many countries sug-
gest that the gains from greater use of technology 
may not be equitably shared. Without complemen-
tary investments in the skills that workers need to 
leverage the internet, automation could exacerbate 
inequality rather than promote greater opportunity 
and shared prosperity. 

•  E-government projects have a poor record in 
many countries; governments have too often been 
unable, and sometimes unwilling, to use the inter-
net to improve service delivery and increase public 
participation. Without more capable and more 
accountable public sector institutions, technology 
investments could lead to more control and not to 
greater empowerment of citizens.

Business regulations that ensure a high degree 
of competition, skills that prepare workers for the 
21st-century workplace, and accountable public insti-
tutions that use the internet to improve services—
together these constitute the analog foundation that 
supports an inclusive, effi cient, and innovative digi-
tal transformation. 

The idea that technology alone is not enough to 
have a widespread impact on development is sup-
ported by a growing academic literature. Research-
ers focus on different angles, but come to similar 
conclusions (box 5.1). In a growth context, the level 
of analysis is a country or sector, and what matters 
is how technology interacts with rules—that is, with 
regulations and similar endowments. In a labor mar-
ket context, the level of analysis is occupations or 
specifi c tasks, and what matters is the interaction of 
automation and worker skills. And in a government 
context, the level of analysis is a public service, and 
what matters for delivery is the accountability of 
institutions.

The interdependence 
between technology and 
complements
Technology and its complements feed on one another. 
Improvements in the business climate, human capi-
tal, and public sector governance are already high on 
the reform agenda in most countries. With greater 
use of technology, the complements also become 
more valuable because they interact. Thanks to tech-
nology, fi rms operating in a well-regulated business 
environment are more innovative. Skilled workers 
are more effi cient. And accountable institutions are

250 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

The internet is no shortcut to development, 
but it can be an accelerator
For policy makers, using technology to solve a prob-
lem is often more tempting than fi xing an ailing 
institution. A manifestation of this is the popularity 
of distributing laptops to schoolchildren as an elec-
tion pledge. There is also growing demand to wire 

the United States continues to decline, with the larg-
est decline in the retail and service sectors.2 And as 
the Arab Spring showed, citizen mobilizations based 
on social media are as easily crushed by governments 
as they were stitched together by citizen activists. All 
this because it is easy to scale up the technology, but 
diffi cult to improve its complements. 

Box 5.1 Three ideas about the interaction between technology and its 
complements

The relationship between technology and complements 
that is at the core of this Report is also the topic of recent 
work by a number of prominent researchers. 

Technology and rules (competition). Paul Romer develops 
a simple growth model in which technology interacts with 
“rules”—including, importantly, regulations shaping the 
business climate. Technology is tradable and can spread 
to new places quickly. Rules are established locally. Even if 
they are negotiated internationally, they will not be simply 
imported like, say, capital goods. So there will always be 
a complex, context-specifi c political process that leads to 
their adoption and determines how eff ectively technology 
is deployed. Together, technology and rules enable the cre-
ation or adoption of new “ideas”—new or improved ways of 
producing, working, or serving citizens. The quality of rules 
varies across countries. Romer cites the municipal water 
sector privatization to a French company in Argentina to 
illustrate his argument. The program was initially success-
ful, but—like in many other countries—eventually ran into 
popular opposition, which prompted renationalization. 
The technology required and the rules and preferences 
about regulating utility monopolies were present in France 
but not in Argentina. Technologies and rules were thus 
poorly matched. In contrast, ideas about setting up and 
operating mobile phone systems spread quickly to many 
countries—even to fragile states like Somalia. Mobile phone 
technology, in contrast to landlines or municipal water, 
easily allows competition among providers even in places 
with low regulatory capacity. For mobile, local conditions 
(or rules) have accommodated the new technology.

Technology and skills. David Autor is most concerned 
with eff ects of technology on labor markets. Looking at 
occupations and even individual tasks, he considers how 
much of a person’s job is routine and could be done by a 
machine—and how much is nonroutine and not easily auto-
mated. Those tasks that follow easily codifi able procedures 

can be done by computers faster, better, and more cheaply. 
With increasing computing power and better software, 
the rule of thumb is that if you can fairly easily explain a 
job to someone, it can probably be automated. Tasks that 
require problem solving, adaptability, and creativity, in 
contrast, are very hard to automate. Again, the diffi  culty in 
automating a job tends to match the diffi  culty in describing 
it. Autor stresses the interaction of technology with non-
routine tasks. Nonroutine jobs cannot easily be automated, 
but they can benefi t from automation because technology 
tends to complement skills. Workers in nonroutine jobs get 
more productive as the automation of other tasks increases. 

Technology and discretion (accountability). Lant Pritchett, 
Michael Woolcock, and Salimah Samji focus on public ser-
vices and develop a typology of organizational capabilities 
for specifi c public sector tasks. They do not specifi cally look 
at the role of technology, but their framework provides 
insights about when technology could improve services. 
Informed by the accountability framework in the 2004 
World Development Report, Making Services Work for Poor 
People, their main criterion is whether a task involves local 
discretion and therefore some judgment by a civil servant. 
Others are whether a task is transaction-intensive, and thus 
involves many people; whether it is a service (education) or 
an obligation (policing); and whether it can draw on existing 
knowledge or requires innovation. Categorizing public ser-
vice tasks in this framework helps explain why e-government 
eff orts often fail—when organizational capabilities are poorly 
matched to technology and the requirements of the task. 

These studies make very similar arguments. First, tech-
nology alone will not be enough. Second, increasing the 
use of technology needs to be matched by complementary 
reforms. And third, knowing the best combination of tech-
nology and complements for diff erent tasks, occupations, 
and services is the key to translating technological progress 
into development.

251NATIONAL PRIORITIES

A digital strategy is more about the 
adoption of ICTs than their production 
Many policy makers wish to have a Silicon Valley in 
their country, dotted with large ICT fi rms like Apple, 
Facebook, Google, Huawei, and Samsung. But the 
widespread adoption of ICTs, not their production, 
is responsible for most of the growth and job cre-
ation.3 The ICT sector in developing countries is fairly 
small, accounting for only 3–4 percent of GDP and 
1 percent of the total labor force. But when ICT fi rms 
enter traditional sectors such as retail, banking, man-
ufacturing, and transport, they spur competition, 
raise productivity, and expand opportunities. For 
example, Alibaba has 30,000 employees, but provides 
a platform for more than 10 million ancillary jobs. 
Uber has a few hundred coders, but it supports the 
livelihoods of around 1 million on-demand drivers. 
The online outsourcing industry creates millions of 
freelancing opportunities in professional services. 
And in Mexico, manufacturing fi rms subject to com-
petition from Chinese imports invest more in digital 
technologies, thus boosting productivity and creating 
more employment opportunities.

A digital strategy needs to be broader than 
an ICT strategy 
The digital economy transcends the ICT sector, 
encompassing most sectors of the economy and 
society.4 Yet many governments continue to treat the 
digital economy as a sector, with exclusive emphasis 
on developing ICT infrastructure and creating an 
information technology (IT) workforce. Our analy sis 
shows that a successful digital strategy needs to stand 

schools, hospitals, and all government buildings. 
Connectivity is important, but it is not enough. 
Technology can rarely bypass or substitute for other 
shortcomings. When technology is deployed in an 
environment of weak complements, the gains will be 
limited. But when technology and its complements 
work together, the impacts can be profound and 
lasting. While the internet is no shortcut, it can be an 
accelerator because many digital tools improve the 
complements.

Understanding the interaction between 
technology and human complements 
should guide how much to invest in each 
Some sectors, occupations, and services are more 
amenable to technology than others (fi gure 5.2). Gains 
from technology will be larger in public services such 
as cash transfer programs and utility services—where 
outcomes can be easily monitored by citizens—than 
in services that require a lot of discretion, such as 
policing and management. Similarly, occupations 
involving routine tasks will be more affected by tech-
nology than those requiring a high degree of judg-
ment and intuition. With technological advances, 
more tasks could become easier to automate, so the 
relative roles of technology and complements could 
change over time. Since outcomes are easier to mon-
itor for private businesses, as a rule of thumb, fi rms 
are likely to be more successful than governments in 
using technology to solve problems. Thus in a weak 
institutional environment, the priority should be 
to encourage greater adoption of technology by the 
private sector, while continuing to strengthen the 
complements in the public sector.

monitor service providers.

•  Transitioning countries. Countries transitioning 
toward universal internet use need to address 
harder problems: Build effective competition regula-
tion and enforcement capacity. Teach advanced cog-
nitive and socioemotional skills that complement 
technology. Move toward effective e-government 
systems.

•  Transforming countries. Countries transforming 
into digital societies need to tackle complex prob-
lems: Regulate platform competition and privacy. 
Advance ICT and science, technology, engineer-
ing, and mathematics (STEM) skills and lifelong 
learning. Move toward ubiquitous e-government 
services and participatory policy making.

Classifying countries into various groups is neces-
sarily somewhat ad hoc (fi gure 5.3). The labels applied 
in the following sections should therefore be treated 
with considerable discretion. Technology adoption 
and the quality of complements vary not only across 
countries but also across sectors and across fi rms in 
the same sector. So a country classifi ed as emerging 
for its government institutions could be categorized 
as transitioning for its skills and as transforming for 
its regulations. Some sectors in a country could be 
transforming while the rest of the economy is emerg-
ing. So the boundary lines across country groups and 
complementary factors are more indicative than fi xed.

on two pillars—one digital and the other analog. The 
digital pillar deals with the supply-side issues, focus-
ing on policies to make the internet universally acces-
sible, affordable, open, and safe (chapter 4). The ana-
log pillar aims to strengthen the demand-side policies 
by creating regulations that encourage competition, 
basic modern skills for all, and public institutions 
that are accountable. Countries such as Rwanda, 
whose vision is to become an information-rich, 
knowledge-based society, have gradually tried to 
broaden their digital strategy to include both the digi-
tal and the analog foundations.5,6

A country typology for digital 
development
As digital development proceeds from emerging 
to transitioning and then to transforming, policy 
reforms become more complex. There are no hard- 
and-fast rules, but it is useful to consider a sequence 
of policy priorities in line with technology’s increas-
ing penetration (table 5.1):

•  Emerging countries. In countries where the digital 
economy is still emerging and internet use is low, 
the priority is to lay the foundations: Remove bar-
riers to internet adoption such as high duties on 
ICT capital imports. Improve the business climate, 
including physical infrastructure critical for online 
businesses with an offl ine footprint. Promote digi-
tal literacy and basic cognitive and socioemotional

normalized indicators measuring the adoption rate for the relevant groups. Similarly, complements is the average of three subindicators: starting a business; 
years of education adjusted for skills; and quality of institutions. See fi gures 5.4, 5.8, and 5.10 for more details on the construction of sectoral subindexes.

able and capable governments that provide good 
physical infrastructure and enforce business reg-
ulations that promote competition. But they face 
two distinct sets of problems. First, because they 
are early adopters of digital technologies, many 
of their fi rms have well-functioning but perhaps 
less productive and nonscalable “legacy systems.” 
These countries would benefi t from relaxing their 
regulatory constraints to level the playing fi eld 
between incumbent fi rms and (internet) startups in 
all sectors, but especially in the legacy sectors. Sec-
ond, given the universality of digital technologies, 
these countries have witnessed rapid growth of 
digital platforms in selected sectors, some of which 
have achieved a dominant position in their mar-
kets. They need to fi nd ways to encourage greater 
competition across platforms: say, by eliminating 
exclusivity conditions and introducing portability 
and seamless transfers of data and information 
across platforms. 

Emerging countries: Invest in infrastructure 
and enforce product market competition
For many lower-income countries, creating basic 
business-sustaining infrastructure is a priority, 

of the internet. It is not uncommon for incumbent 
fi rms to secure profi ts by seeking protection through 
regulatory means rather than by competing in the 
open market. The problem arises when policy mak-
ers oblige. There are also instances when regulations 
are genuinely outdated or refl ect risk aversion to 
technological change and the consequent disruption. 
For example, regulators around the world seem to be 
confl icted on whether ride sharing services should be 
regulated as transport service companies or as soft-
ware companies. Is mobile money a banking or a tele-
com product? And in highly connected markets, could 
the absence of competition across various digital plat-
forms inhibit future innovation? In some low-income 
countries, the lack of supporting infrastructure—such 
as electricity, roads, ports, warehouses, distribution, 
and a well-functioning postal system—could hinder 
fi rms from investing in digital technologies. 

Appropriate regulation at various levels of 
digital adoption
Policy reform priorities are likely to vary across coun-
tries depending on their level of digital adoption. 
Matching the country typology with appropriate 
regulatory reforms leads to the following taxonomy 
(fi gure 5.4): 

•  Emerging countries are characterized by low dig-
ital adoption and protected markets. They are 
also likely to suffer from poor infrastructure and 
weakly accountable institutions. Investing in basic 
physical and digital infrastructure (chapter 4); 
lowering tariffs on digital products; encouraging 
adoption of low-tech, disruptive applications such 
as mobile money and social media; and reducing 
product market regulations are some of the policy 
priorities these countries should consider.

•  Transitioning countries have mixed regulations, with 
some sectors open to competition. Many of their 
business regulations are codifi ed, easily available, 
and increasingly carried out online. These countries 
also have fairly good physical infrastructure. Tran-
sitioning countries thus need to remove regulatory 
barriers across major sectors to incentivize fi rms to 
invest in more effi cient digital solutions and encour-
age the entry of startups that can put competitive 
pressure on incumbent fi rms. When required, they 
should establish regulatory clarity between online 
and offl ine businesses within the same sector. A 
majority of developing countries and some devel-
oped countries fall into this category. 

•  Transforming countries are open to competition in 
most economic sectors and generally have account-

Another infrastructure constraint to a digital 
economy in emerging countries is the absence of 
domestic delivery systems. There were 38 countries 
in 2012 where less than 50 percent of the population 
had access to home postal delivery (see chapter 1). And 
several countries had no “last mile” domestic delivery 
system in place at all: Botswana, Burkina Faso, the 
Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of 
Congo, Gabon, Kenya, Rwanda, Swaziland, Togo, and 

 requiring fi nance, local expertise, and innovative 
solutions. Digital technologies can help overcome 
some of these problems. Revenues from telecoms— 
customs duties on hardware, auctioning and man-
aging spectrums, and value added tax (VAT) or 
sales taxes on services—have been one of the fastest 
growing sources of revenue in many developing 
countries. But regulatory capture by powerful tele-
com fi rms could undermine this effort, as in Somalia. 
Many other countries in Africa, however, have the 
opposite problem—they have used the telecom sector 
as a “cash cow,” taxing it so heavily as to impede its 
growth prospects. Even so, there are private sector 
solutions to fi nancing and managing infrastructure 
services using digital technologies that hold the most 
promise. For example, Mobisol, a German company, 
is supplying off-grid energy to villagers in Rwanda 
by combining solar energy technology with mobile 
phone–based loan payments.7

Countries need to look at the digital economy as a 
source of growth and jobs and not just as a source of 
revenue. Some countries impose signifi cant import 
tariffs on computers, laptops, and mobile phones to 
meet short-term revenue objectives (fi gure 5.5). For 
example, the most favored nation (MFN) tariff rate 
on computers in Djibouti is as high as 26 percent. Fiji 
charges MFN tariff rates of more than 30 percent for 
mobile phones. The tariffs on using digital technolo-
gies raise the costs of using digital technologies for 
fi rms and households, thus delaying the emergence 
of the digital economy and its attendant positive 
effect on growth and jobs. In general, the higher 
revenue buoyancy in the medium term can more 
than make up for short-term revenue shortfall from 
reduced tariffs. 

In addition to electricity, countries need to invest 
in trade infrastructure and customs administration 
to improve physical connectivity and facilitate the 
growth of the digital economy. Several countries 
still have ineffi cient ports and other trade infra-
structure. Among the weak performers on trade 
logistics in 2007, only a few signifi cantly improved 
their trade logistics infrastructure between 2007 and 
2014, including Afghanistan, Nepal, Nigeria, Rwanda, 
Serbia, and Tanzania (fi gure 5.6). Countries can also 
improve their overall logistics performance by low-
ering their nontariff barriers and tackling behind-
the-border issues. Firms with improved logistics are 
better positioned to export their products and ser-
vices using online marketplaces once these platforms 
gain in importance in their region. But several coun-
tries continue to lag behind, including Cameroon, the 
Comoros, Eritrea, Somalia, and Sri Lanka.

MFN tariff  rates for mobile phones. For some countries, the MFN tariff  rates may exaggerate the level 
of taxation, especially if they source a large part of their digital imports from Free Trade Agreement 
partners, as is the case with Chile.

common anticompetitive practices, even though 
most countries have competition laws in place.9 

Emerging countries should thus focus fi rst on 
reducing the implementation gap in enforcing exist-
ing laws. Required changes for implementation could 
be handled through secondary legislation or guide-
lines. Such changes include transparently defi ning 
appropriate fi nes for anticompetitive behavior, grant-
ing suffi cient authority and investigating power 
to implementing agencies to fi ght anticompetitive 
regulations in all economic sectors, reducing anti-
competitive practices by government agencies that 
facilitate cartel behavior, and measuring and commu-
nicating the harmful effects of cartel agreements to 
encourage support for competition policy.

Transitioning countries: Enhance 
competition by removing regulatory 
barriers and encouraging entry of internet 
startups in traditional sectors

Competition law and competition 
authorities
Anticompetitive regulations, while designed with 
good intentions, can be misused. Vested interests 
and privileged fi rms can use them to limit entry into 
domestic markets; to access government subsidies, 
contracts, or land; and to insulate them from foreign 
competition. Such anticompetitive regulations seem 
to discourage fi rms in some developing countries—
including Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo, 
Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Morocco, Tanzania, Uganda, 
Vietnam, and Zambia—from using digital technolo-
gies more intensively (chapter 1).

Most countries have a competition authority, 
though many were set up fairly recently, and enforce-
ment varies, especially when the state or privileged 
fi rms benefi t from market restrictions. Limited capac-
ity and the diffi culty of proving harm to consumers 
are further barriers. A priority for transitioning coun-
tries is to institute strong competition laws and boost 
the capacity of implementing institutions to enforce 
the law transparently and effectively. Policy measures 
include leniency programs allowing participants 
of cartels to cooperate with government bodies in 
exchange for lower sanctions—and ex post investiga-
tion of potential collusive practices in procurement. 

Disruption as a strategy to create 
competition 
Transitioning countries should encourage the entry 
of internet fi rms offering traditional services in order 
to disrupt protected sectors. The internet has created 
a new wave of entrepreneurship and innovation 

Tanzania. Online retailers in these countries thus 
struggle to deliver parcels to their customers and are 
forced to invest in their own logistics solution.

Reliable online payment systems are also not 
available in many African and Central Asian coun-
tries, limiting the potential for e-commerce. While 
most individuals in developing countries do not 
have access to a credit card, online payment systems 
for businesses, such as the PayPal business account, 
provide reliable alternative solutions. In several Latin 
American countries, small businesses that do not have 
a bank account can use PagosOnline for payments. 
Without reliable and legal online payment systems, 
fi rms have been resorting to riskier solutions, such 
as Bitcoin, as in Ghana. Not only are such activities 
illegal in some countries, but when undertaken on 
a large scale and in a weak regulatory environment, 
they could have a destabilizing effect on the fi nancial 
sector.

Emerging countries should focus on enforcing 
existing business regulations and competition and 
antitrust laws. Most countries have laws that defi ne 
some degree of competition or antitrust regulation 
but that are seldom enforced.8 Moreover, business 
regulations are sometimes implemented in a way 
that discriminates between fi rms, increasing regu-
latory uncertainty. Agreements among competitors 
on setting prices, sharing markets, and bidding for 
public procurement, for instance, are one of the most

highlights the tight-rope walk for regulators in the 
digital economy (box 5.2).

The internet fi rms operating in the fi nancial 
sector are often not subject to the same level of reg-
ulations, enabling Yu’E Bao, an online trust fund in 
China, to enroll 150 million depositors and collect 
Y 700 billion in deposits in less than two years. It 
offered higher yields on the deposits by making use 
of underregulation of the fi nancial sector outside the 
formal banking system. The ongoing reforms in the 
fi nancial sector in China have narrowed this regula-
tory arbitrage. 

Transforming countries: Encourage 
digital innovation but also regulate the 
digital economy to level the playing fi eld 
between incumbent and internet fi rms

Critical “new economy” regulations
While most of the internet’s impact will be in tradi-
tional sectors that use technology to boost effi ciency, 
“pure” internet fi rms raise new challenges that 
regulatory authorities even in advanced economies 

around the world. Internet fi rms now compete with 
offl ine incumbents in banking, insurance, retail trade, 
transport, logistics, international currency transfers, 
accommodation, tourism, media, publishing, adver-
tising, programming, design, and other professional 
service tasks.

Governments may consider abstaining from 
imposing regulatory barriers on new internet fi rms 
before they achieve a certain scale. Eliminating 
protection, often against the interests of infl uential 
elites benefi ting from the status quo, is diffi cult and 
takes time. But internet fi rms can do the work of 
the regulators and introduce competition in a sec-
tor overnight. The mobile money service M-Pesa in 
Kenya was able to achieve scale because of the regu-
lator’s initial decision to regulate it as a telecom and 
not as a banking sector product. The mobile-money 
schemes in other countries have often been held up 
by opposition from traditional banks. At the same 
time, lack of adequate regulation on the telecom side 
meant that M-Pesa enjoyed dominant market power 
in Kenya for a fairly long time, which ultimately 
had to be curbed by the competition authorities. This 

Box 5.2 Mobile money: A success story and yet a regulatory minefi eld

Mobile money started informally, with users making pay-
ments of airtime credit to each other (see also spotlight 
2). This system is still operating in many countries, such as 
Somalia, where users exhibit more faith in storable and trans-
ferable credit than in the local currency, the Somali shilling. 
But elsewhere, notably in Kenya, a more formal system of 
mobile money developed, using a separate store of credit 
on the user’s SIM (subscriber identifi cation module) card. 
Safaricom introduced its M-Pesa mobile payment service in 
2007, and other operators developed rival services. By 2013, 
transactions of US$21.9 billion—equivalent to just under half 
of Kenya’s GDP—were transacted on mobile devices. M-Pesa 
was introduced two years later in Tanzania. Although initially 
slow to take off , it now equates to a higher percentage of 
GDP (53.2 percent) and will soon overtake Kenya in volume.

Safaricom had a monopoly in the Kenyan market 
for almost seven years. It had established exclusivity 
arrangements with M-Pesa agents, meaning the agents 
could only off er products and services within the M-Pesa 
network. Agents were thus locked in to a single operator, 
and so were most users. Since Safaricom controlled more 
than two-fi fths of the mobile money transfer business, the 

exclusivity contracts with the agents posed an entry barrier 
for other telecom operators. One reason Safaricom justifi ed 
keeping its network closed was that it had incurred high 
costs to develop the existing infrastructure.

Recently, the Competition Authority of Kenya ruled: 
“(a) that all restrictive clauses in the agreements between 
Safaricom Limited and its Mobile Money Transfer Agents be 
expunged immediately, but in any event not later than July 
18, 2014; (b) that the Mobile Money Agents be at liberty to 
transact the Mobile Money Transfer Businesses of any other 
mobile money transfer service providers; (c) that oversight 
by Safaricom Limited be thereafter limited to its business 
with the Agents; and (d) that each Mobile Money Service 
Provider be responsible for ensuring compliance with 
Central Bank of Kenya Regulations.”a

This ruling came weeks after M-Pesa permitted its 
agents to work with other mobile operators. Eliminating its 
exclusivity agreements reduced the cost of sending money 
from M-Pesa users to other unregistered users. For exam-
ple, the cost of transfers of between K Sh 101 and K Sh 500 
fell from K Sh 66 to K Sh 44 within six months after the end 
of the exclusivity agreement.

Skills: Making the internet 
work for everyone

If you compared our world today with the world one 
hundred years ago, you would encounter amazing 

advances in science, commerce, health care, transportation, 
and other areas. But if you were to compare the classroom 
of a hundred years ago with an average classroom today, 
you would recognize it immediately: students lined up in 

rows, paper and pencil in hand; a teacher at the blackboard 
jotting down facts; students furiously copying all that 

is written and said, expecting to memorize the facts 
and spit them out on an exam.

—Robert Hawkins (2002)

Technological changes are disrupting the employ-
ment landscape. Occupations are becoming more 
technology intensive, and “old economy” jobs are 
giving way to “new economy” careers. In many coun-
tries, this transformation is just starting and will 
take time. But even in these countries, the time for 
action is now. Changes in education and training take 
a generation to have an effect, and reforms need to 
start early so that skills do not become a bottleneck 
as countries advance in their digital transformation. 

A changed world with unchanged 
classrooms
The skills mix needed to succeed in the labor market 
is changing, and today’s education and training sys-
tems are often failing to keep up. The use of digital 
technologies requires basic cognitive skills, such as 
literacy and numeracy. But a well-educated worker 
in the 21st century also needs skills that are easily 
transferable across jobs and occupations and that 
help respond to changing labor market demands: 
higher-order cognitive, socioemotional, and technical 
skills (fi gure 5.7). This multiplicity of skills has always 
been important, but it is now essential. From Lebanon 
to Peru to Vietnam, employers are looking for work-
ers who work well in teams and can solve problems, 
think critically, and present their work well to oth-
ers.12 Yet in many countries, education systems fail 
to provide even basic literacy and numeracy. More 
than half of 15-year-olds are functionally illiterate in 
middle-income countries such as Albania, Indonesia, 
Jordan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, and Peru.13 

struggle with. Sharing economy fi rms like Uber 
and Airbnb scaled up traditional ride sharing and 
subletting to a global scale. But regulators struggle 
to determine whether these companies are taxi and 
hotel companies or simply software providers. Off-
line competitors complain that they do not follow 
the same regulations. Where these industries tend 
to be overregulated—often the case in the traditional 
taxi business, for example—this new competition 
can encourage a general regulatory overhaul of the 
industry. 

Once internet fi rms offering traditional services 
achieve a certain scale, regulators need to modernize 
and impose sector-specifi c regulations to level the 
playing fi eld between online fi rms and their offl ine 
competitors. New York City regulators started to 
require Uber drivers to be licensed, to drive vehicles 
with livery plates, and to have commercial insurance 
to create fairer competition between the sharing 
economy and taxi drivers. In other cases, require-
ments that taxi drivers have full knowledge of local 
streets have become obsolete with global positioning 
systems (GPS) and should be scrapped. Airbnb is 
required to pay local sales tax in several cities where 
its services compete with those of the hotel industry.

Creating competition across platforms 
Concentration in the digital economy paired with 
network effects or switching costs can lead to anti-
competitive behavior. But internet fi rms confound 
traditional competition law because they do not act 
as traditional monopolies. Their services are often 
free or more convenient for consumers. It is also 
less than straightforward to establish their real line 
of business. Google, known as a search engine com-
pany, is better described as an advertising fi rm. It 
accounts for nearly 90 percent of the online search 
market in some countries, and around 25 percent of 
the display-ad market, while Yahoo and Facebook 
account for about 10 percent each.10 But given their 
dominance in the markets for online ads or books, 
some internet companies have considerable leverage 
over marketers and booksellers. This is similar to 
credit card companies’ position with respect to retail-
ers. Since many internet fi rms operate in two-sided 
markets, where an online platform brings together 
buyers and sellers, these internet intermediaries 
could blur price signals in either of the two markets. 
Research by economists such as Jean Tirole shows 
that regulations in such industries must be carefully 
tailored to ensure competition and not harm consum-
ers.11 These are very challenging problems. Countries

manage some of the labor market disruptions that 
technology creates, and to ensure that the benefi ts 
of digital technologies are widely shared. In emerg-
ing digital countries, such as Nepal or Senegal, the 
skill base remains weak, with gaps in foundational 
cognitive and socioemotional skills, as well as in 
basic digital literacy. Transitioning countries, includ-
ing Armenia, Sri Lanka, and Ukraine, have done 
fairly well on foundational skills, but they face the 
challenge of keeping up with some of the new skill 
demands arising from digital technologies, especially 
higher-order skills. Transforming countries, such as 
the Czech Republic and the Republic of Korea, are 
best positioned to think about more advanced techni-
cal skills (both in ICT and in STEM), and, since many 
of their citizens are also rapidly aging, also need to 
prioritize lifelong learning (fi gure 5.8).

Every country has multiple skill development 
systems. As international tests make clear, individ-
uals who perform best in less advanced economies 
are often at par with peers in more advanced coun-
tries, and there is a lot of inequality in outcomes 
within countries.15 So a simple sequencing of policy 
reforms oversimplifi es what is needed in any coun-
try. Even transforming countries need to strengthen 
foundational skills, and emerging countries need to 
strengthen their provision of more advanced skills. 
But skill development is a cumulative process: it is 
hard to develop technical and high-order cognitive 
skills without basic literacy or a strong foundation 
of socioemotional skills. Similarly, foundational and 
more complex cognitive and socioemotional skills 

Digital technologies accelerate the pace of labor 
market changes, opening new opportunities but also 
making skills obsolete more quickly. This calls for 
more adaptability from individuals and institutions, 
a stronger link between educational and training 
institutions and the private sector, and policies that 
promote lifelong learning. Since skill development 
starts at birth and is lifelong, a life-cycle approach to 
learning is necessary.14 

These two labor market transformations—chang-
ing skill mix and rapid skill obsolescence—have pro-
found implications for the skill development agenda. 
While digital technologies affect the whole skill for-
mation process by changing the role of teachers, how 
students learn, and the mechanisms to strengthen 
accountability in education and training (see sector 
focus 2), priorities for skill development in the 21st 
century hinge on three questions:

•  What are the policies and interventions needed to 
provide current and future workers with skills for 
a digital economy? 

•  How do these priorities vary by each country’s 
labor market challenges and skill base?

•  How can digital technologies complement this 
“analog” policy agenda?

and socialization, especially among young children, 
these technologies are here to stay (box 5.3). “Before 
a child even starts primary school, she will be able to 
use her parents’ smartphone to learn her numbers 
and letters, giving her a big head start,” the Gates 
Foundation notes.18 Online educational games for 
young children, with appropriate adult supervision, 
are increasingly used to develop foundational skills. 
ScratchJr, for example, is an application aimed at 
teaching algorithm thinking and coding principles to 
kids aged 5−7 years through a simple drag and drop 
interface.

Access to the internet, laptops, tablets, mobile 
phones, digital whiteboards, and video-based instruc-
tion are increasingly common in primary and second-
ary education. Programs like One Laptop per Child 
(OLPC) are operating around the world (box 5.4). In 
most cases, however, there is no solid evidence base 
of their effects on learning outcomes, and much more 
careful evaluation of ICT initiatives in education 
is needed. But fi ve uses of technology in building 
foundational skills are promising: connecting teach-
ers to content; making learning more personalized; 
reinforcing content learned in school; fostering col-
laboration and increasing students’ engagement; and 
promoting adult literacy (table 5.2).

Digital technologies can complement teachers and 
connect them to content. The BridgeIT model, started 
in 2004 and now used in around 10 countries, allows 
teachers using mobile phones to download video 
content, which is then connected to televisions in 
their classrooms. The videos are paired with learner-
centered lesson plans, accompanied by teacher train-
ing in how to use the technology and incorporate it 
in the class.19 A separate initiative, the Bridge Interna-
tional Academies, goes even further. The largest chain 
of preprimary and primary schools in the world, with 
more than 110,000 students in Kenya and Uganda, it 
uses technology and data analysis to standardize and 
scale education delivery. While the standardization 
of teaching remains controversial and is being rigor-
ously evaluated, it is an alternative way to make basic 
education more affordable. The average family of a 
student in the Bridge Academy lives on US$1.60 a day 
per person.20

Digital technologies can offer access to high-
quality material where there are no teachers with 
the needed skills. In Uruguay, through video, English 
is taught to fi rst graders by teachers from the Philip-
pines. A pilot study found that videoconferencing and 
laptops raised the children’s scores in English signifi -
cantly, as well as the English-language profi ciency of 
the Uruguayan teachers.21 

built early in life and throughout general education 
are the base for the building and updating of techni-
cal skills in postsecondary education and training. 

Priorities for emerging countries: Build 
foundational cognitive and socioemotional 
skills and ensure basic ICT literacy
The analog agenda for building foundational skills 
starts early, as early as 0–3 years of age, and goes 
beyond investment in education to that in health.16 
These are the years when children become school-
ready, their brains are the most sensitive to learning, 
and the basis for future learning is laid. Families, indi-
viduals, school and training systems, and employers 
will all play a role in building these skills throughout 
the life cycle. It is also important to build these skills 
before specializing too narrowly. Countries like 
Poland have delayed tracking of students into voca-
tional education, with positive results.17 

Digital technologies can help build these foun-
dational skills. While there are concerns about the 
impact of digital technologies on cognitive capacities

Box 5.3 The impact of digital technologies on cognitive capacities and 
socialization

There are concerns about the impact of digital technolo-
gies on cognitive capacities and socialization, especially 
among young children and adolescents, and some evi-
dence backs these concerns. For example, studies show 
that using search engines decreases our memory. When 
faced with diffi  cult questions, people are primed to turn to 
their computers, and, when people expect to have future 
access to information, they have lower rates of recall of 
the information and enhanced recall of where to access it.a 
There are also concerns about internet addiction. A survey 
of nearly 12,000 adolescents in 11 European countries found 
a 4.4 percent prevalence of pathological internet use. An 
additional 14 percent had a milder addiction. People who 
exhibited problematic use were more likely to suff er from 
psychological problems, such as depression or anxiety.b

Yet the fear that new technologies lessen our ability to 
function is nothing new; in Plato’s dialogue, The Phaedrus, 
Socrates worried that writing would diminish the ability 
to engage in conversation. Parents and schools can do 
things to lessen these risks. Strengthening self-regulation 
in young children can mediate potentially negative eff ects 
of internet use.c While it is true that using technology to 
do things for us that we no longer are doing for ourselves 
means that certain abilities can degenerate, it also means 
that we are freeing up cognitive energy for other things. 
More research on the impact of digital technologies on 
cognitive abilities, and how they can be managed, is an 
important agenda for the future.

Box 5.4 One Laptop per Child: Strengthening analog foundations and 
careful evaluation

Of all the educational initiatives that involve digital tech-
nologies, the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) program (or 
more  generally, 1 to 1 computing initiatives) is arguably the 
most ambitious. Its main objective—empowering children 
by providing them with digital devices at an aff ordable 
price—has captured the attention of world leaders, media, 
and academia.a Since the fi rst laptop distribution started in 
Uruguay in 2007, OLPC programs have distributed more than 
2.4 million laptops around the globe.b In Uruguay, the program 
was widely supported by children, parents, and school direc-
tors, providing internet access to many low-income children.c 

Although all OLPC programs increased access to digital 
technologies, their implementation and impacts on learning 
outcomes vary greatly. In a meta-analysis of 15 studies of 
OLPC programs in fi ve countries (China, Colombia, Ecuador, 
India, and Peru), only the programs that accompanied the 

distribution of laptops with some level of guidance, from 
providing training courses to using adaptive software for 
weekly sessions, improved learning. These guided-use pro-
grams had a positive, albeit small, impact of 0.17 standard 
deviations on average scores, against an insignifi cant eff ect 
for programs where use was not guided.d

The success of digital devices in the classroom in 
improving academic performance hinges on complement-
ing access to digital technologies with investments in 
teachers, and on embedding the technology with relevant 
content that can be integrated with traditional classroom 
activities. More careful evaluations of pilot programs before 
they go to scale are also important to better understand 
whether the programs can produce positive results and are 
cost-eff ective, as well as the specifi c changes needed to 
improve their eff ectiveness.

rooms in seven Latin American countries, between 
one-fi fth and one-quarter of total class time, a large 
group of students (six or more in classrooms with 
average size of 25) is visibly not engaged in the class-
room. This is partly because most classes are boring: 
for about one-third of all time spent on teaching 
activities, teachers use the blackboard and nothing 
else.25 Using digital technologies for collaboration 
(box 5.6) or for game-based learning could improve 
engagement and learning. At its simplest, textbook 
material could be made more engaging: eLimu, 
which has embedded the primary education curricula 
of Kenya in tablets, enriched the content with videos 
and other animations.

Yet introducing technology alone, without 
improved teacher training and links to changes in 
pedagogy, will not improve the learning process. 
Digital technologies are most likely to have an impact 
when the focus is not on hardware and software but 
on how they contribute to learning.26 In Colombia, 
Computers for Education had little effect on student 
test scores and other outcomes. Although students in 
the program schools were 30 percentage points more 
likely to report using a computer at school, they used 
it only for computer science.27 Similarly, in Ireland, 
teachers were positive about the usefulness of ICT 
in secondary schools, yet most uses were outside the 
classroom for preparing lessons, rather than exploit-
ing the potential of ICT to introduce innovative teach-
ing and learning practices.28 As with One Laptop per 
Child (see box 5.4), annual evaluations of Text2teach, 
the local version of BridgeIT, in the Philippines have 

Digital tools also make it easier to tailor learning 
to each student and rapidly assess student progress. 
Impact evaluations suggest that the successful appli-
cations of technology help introduce an appropriate 
curriculum or enable students to move through 
material at their own pace.22 Khan Academy is a good 
example (box 5.5). These types of tools can be particu-
larly helpful in developing countries, where students 
often need to develop skills that their teachers lack or 
do not teach.23

Digital technologies can reinforce learning. In 
Mumbai and Vadodara in India, a math reinforce-
ment program, delivered through computer games, 
had large positive effects on children’s academic 
achievement.24 Children were offered two hours of 
shared computer time per week, during which they 
played games that involved solving math problems. 
The program increased math scores by 0.35 standard 
deviations the fi rst year, and 0.47 the second year. 
Similar uses of technology to reinforce learning are 
being applied around the world, often using sim-
ple mobile phones. Eneza Education, in Kenya, is a 
virtual tutor that provides practice questions and 
answers open questions via SMS (short message 
service) from students on low-cost mobile phones. It 
has 39,000 active users, and more than 380,000 peo-
ple have used it at least once. 

A fourth promising technology is facilitating col-
laboration among teachers and students and making 
learning more fun and effective through games and 
game-based learning. More often than not, students 
are not engaged in school. In more than 15,000 class-

identifi ed the need to invest even more in teacher 
training for further improvement.29

Even when used, technology does not substitute 
for teachers. High-quality education continues to 
hinge on high-quality and motivated teachers. In 
India, the computer-assisted learning (CAL) program 
for math had very different impacts depending on 
how it was used. When the program supplemented 
regular classes with one additional hour of CAL 
instruction every day after school, it raised math 
scores by 0.28 standard deviation. But when it was a 
substitute for regular instruction, scores fell by 0.57 
standard deviation.30 

Governments can play an important role in build-
ing complementary investments to leverage educa-
tional technology. This is primarily about preparing 

and training teachers in the use of the technology and 
in how to incorporate it in the classroom. Training 
programs in developing countries often focus only 
on basic computer literacy. In Singapore, by contrast, 
both pre-service and in-service teacher training curric-
ula integrate pedagogy and ICT.31 With these invest-
ments, technologies can amplify teacher productivity 
and improve the quality of teaching. In systematic 
reviews of education interventions, technology-as-
sisted learning, together with teacher training pro-
grams, have among the largest positive effects on 
learning outcomes.32 

Outside formal education, digital technologies can 
also boost adult literacy. In Afghanistan, Chad, and 
Mali, more than 60 percent of adults remain illiterate; 
in Niger, close to 85 percent.33 Digital technologies, 

Box 5.5 Khan Academy: A supplemental educational resource in and 
outside the classroom

Khan Academy is an online learning platform that provides 
free tutorial videos on disciplines ranging from elementary 
mathematics to computer programming. It attracts more 
than 10 million unique users a month (35 percent from 
outside the United States), who have viewed 365 million 
videos and solved more than 1.8 billion math problems.a It 
is an example of tools for the “fl ipped classroom,” in which 
videos substitute for classroom instruction, and class hours 
are used for practice and discussion.

Khan Academy is built on free lecture videos, adaptive 
learning practice problems, and personalized data. Lectures 
are divided by subject, but users can select what to focus 
on, advance at their own pace, and receive instant feed-
back. Following the video lectures, students can practice, 
and the system adjusts the diffi  culty of practice problems 
based on a student’s performance on the fi rst few prob-
lems. Students’ online performance is recorded, and stu-
dents, teachers, and parents can follow progress through 
the personalized learning dashboards. 

While Khan Academy is still used predominantly by 
individuals for informal study outside schools, its use in 
schools and other institutional settings is growing. There is 
not enough evidence to claim that it has been an unqual-
ifi ed success, but the evidence points to its considerable 
potential. SRI International studied the implementation of 

Khan Academy in nine schools in the United States from 
2011 to 2013.b Khan Academy mainly supplemented teach-
ers’ own core instruction rather than replacing it. Forms of 
use varied: additional practice or remediation for students 
who fell behind, enrichment activities for advanced stu-
dents, and monitoring student progress. Khan Academy 
increased engagement of students and the capacity of 
teachers to support their students, but teachers found it 
diffi  cult to fully integrate it with the core curriculum. 

A pilot in fi ve schools in Chile had similar results.c Khan 
Academy improved student math skills, but was not “fl ip-
ping the classroom.” Moreover, the teachers believe that 
while Khan Academy improved the procedural skills, it was 
not best for promoting deeper mathematics learning. 

Integrating tools like Khan Academy into education 
systems shares some of the challenges that other technol-
ogies in education face. Translation and adaptation to local 
contexts is costly. Khan Academy is partnering with other 
organizations in several countries to do this. And stream-
ing videos requires high-speed connectivity, which is still 
limited in many developing countries. Since the success of 
the program is a function of teacher skills and engagement, 
school and government administrations should support 
teachers throughout the period of implementation.d

skills, including the ability of students to search for 
information and separate high-quality sources from 
low-quality ones. International experience offers 
some important lessons (box 5.7).

In many developing countries, the greater chal-
lenge is to reach adults, often in low-literacy environ-
ments. Lack of awareness of the potential usefulness 
of digital technologies remains an obstacle to adop-
tion.37 In some cases, digital technologies, especially 
mobile phones, are adapted for the illiterate or those 
with little education through the use of graphics, 
symbols, and audio or video tutorials. In addition to 
technical training, which can be costly and which 
many adults would not use, countries can raise 
awareness and demonstrate some of the potential 
benefi ts of digital technologies—as in Turkey, where 
a mobile unit goes to lagging regions and shows how 
to use government services online. 

Among youth and adults, digital literacy training 
can be combined with e-entrepreneurship training and 
seed funding to conduct business over the internet. 
Two areas of focus could be e-commerce and online 
work. For e-commerce, the focus could be on how to 

especially mobile phones, can promote basic numer-
acy and literacy for these adults. In Niger, including 
instruction on using simple mobile phones with voice 
and SMS capacity in a basic adult education curric-
ulum substantially improved learning outcomes.34 
Similar programs in advanced settings, like Los Ange-
les, have had similar effects, with technology actually 
improving literacy without the need for teachers.35 In 
only four months, basic reading scores went up about 
fi ve years, and more advanced reading scores, about 
two and a half years. 

Digital literacy is a new foundational skill
In a world where digital technologies are at the center 
of people’s personal and professional lives, digital lit-
eracy—just like reading and writing—is a new foun-
dational skill. Among children and youth, just giving 
access to these technologies can be enough for them 
to learn the basic use of devices. The evidence from 
One Laptop per Child (see box 5.4) and from Hole-in-
the-Wall in India indicates as much.36 The main chal-
lenge is to broaden the digital literacy agenda beyond 
the basic use of devices to focus more on information 

Box 5.6 Using digital technologies to foster collaboration and learning: 
Rio de Janeiro’s Educopedia

In 2010, the Rio de Janeiro municipality launched Educo-
pedia, a collaborative online platform of lessons open to 
students and teachers from public schools. By off ering stim-
ulating multimedia resources in the classroom, Educopedia’s 
goals are to support teachers in creating and sharing teach-
ing materials online and to increase students’ motivation to 
learn. The lessons online cover math, Portuguese, science, 
history, geography, English, music, and physical education, 
organized by grade and week of the curriculum. 

The modules generally blend videos and interactive 
exercises for students with a clear structure and repeated 
reinforcement questions. Each Educopedia module con-
sists of a lesson plan to help teachers structure the class; 
supporting content such as PowerPoint presentations on 
new material and texts, videos, and games; and interactive 
resources such as a chat system, a digital library, quizzes, 
summaries, and sets of test questions. The materials are 
projected on digital whiteboards. 

When the program was piloted, teacher take-up was 
low. The secretariat responded by asking the network 

of teachers that produces and assesses the adequacy 
and quality of online materials to reach out to colleague 
teachers and provide hands-on support in using the 
new resources. In 2010, Rio municipality teachers used 
information and communication technology (ICT) only 
1 percent of the time in the classroom; a year later, use had 
quadrupled.

Today, Educopedia operates in all 700 Rio de Janeiro 
municipal schools and serves 680,000 students; 50 per-
cent of teachers report that they use the tool more than 
once a week. The impact of Educopedia on student learning 
has not been evaluated yet, but the secretariat believes its 
eff ects on the motivation of both teachers and students are 
positive. Educopedia was one of the pillars of education 
reforms in Rio de Janeiro, which between 2009 and 2012 
saw a 22 percent increase in its score in the Basic Education 
Development Index for middle schools. In a recent survey, 
80 percent of Rio de Janeiro municipal students agreed 
that Educopedia contributes to their learning, particularly 
through the interactive exercises and educational games.

apply it to the world around them in meaningful 
ways?

A fi rst step is to modernize general education 
curricula and teaching methods, shifting toward 
student-centered curricula that emphasize new 
economy skills. Which qualities school systems 
need in order to develop these skills is debated, but 
there is agreement that it needs to start early. One 
model is Montessori schools. Teachers trained in a 
Montessori perspective emphasize, from early child-
hood onward, attention to the individual interests of 
students. Classrooms are less hierarchical. Students 
have substantial unstructured time to collaborate 
around shared interests and freedom to research a 
topic of interest and present it to the class.39 While 
rigorous evidence on this is limited, students in fi ve 
Montessori middle schools in the United States were 
more intrinsically motivated and interested in their 
academic activities at school.40 Similarly, the Perry 
Preschool Program in the United States teaches kids 
reading and math, but also to plan tasks, execute their 
plans, and review their work in groups. Although 
based on a small sample, the program has been found 
to boost socioemotional skills and to determine life 
outcomes of former students well into their 40s.41

Modern curricula should balance competency- 
based and content-based learning, and be combined 

market yourself and be able to sell online. Countries 
could explore partnerships with e-commerce plat-
forms. Alibaba, for example, offers training on how to 
sell on its platform, and has signed agreements with 
governments (such as the Republic of Korea) to do so. 
For online work, the training could focus on intro-
ducing participants to online work, setting up their 
profi les, and establishing payment accounts. Nigeria 
is starting to provide this type of training.38

Priorities for transitioning countries: 
Build new economy skills for careers, 
not just for the fi rst job

Improving advanced cognitive and 
socioemotional skills requires rethinking 
curricula and teaching methods
In addition to foundational skills, workers are being 
required to use more critical thinking and problem 
solving, communication, teamwork, and creativity. 
These are general skills, which many traditional 
education systems fail to impart, and can be applied 
across occupations and jobs (fi gure 5.9 and table 5.3). 
How can teachers, administrators, and policy makers 
create an environment that goes beyond rote learning 
and memorization, and where students really learn—
where they think critically about  information—and 

Box 5.7 Emerging lessons from digital literacy programs 

Digital literacy programs considered most successful have 
some principles in common: 

•  They are mainstreamed into the non-ICT (information and 
communication technology) curriculum. They emphasize 
ICT as a tool rather than a subject. Students learn how to 
use digital technologies not in specialized and isolated 
labs but as part of their learning other subjects. Finland 
has gone for mainstreaming, which makes the digital 
skills learned more useful in real life, but requires train-
ing for all teachers. Training also aims at using internet 
search eff ectively and safely, and understanding privacy 
rules.

•  They focus on teachers’ digital literacy. Evaluations 
of Khan Academy, the rollout in schools of broadband 
in Ireland, eLimu and Eneza in Kenya, and the One 
Laptop per Child programs in Latin America show that 

a lack of digital literacy or fear of using new methods 
is a constraint for teachers. As a result, programs are 
increasingly being combined with intense teacher train-
ing. eLimu—which has embedded the Kenya primary 
education curricula in tablets and enriched the content 
with animations to make learning more engaging—had 
to extend teacher training from 15 minutes to a full day.

•  They go beyond ICT, into the beginnings of “computa-
tional thinking.” Such thinking refers to the problem-
solving skills and techniques software engineers use to 
write programs, especially those related to breaking a 
problem into parts, pattern recognition, abstraction, and 
algorithm design.a 

•  They are embedded in local content (chapter 4). This can 
motivate learners by connecting them to information on 
issues relevant to them but also by reducing language 
barriers.

performer in international student assessments, Fin-
land recently concluded a large reform of its preprimary 
and basic education curricula. The aims are to develop 
schools as learning communities and to emphasize 
the joy of learning and a collaborative atmosphere, as 
well as promoting student autonomy in studying and 
in school life. In particular, there will be much focus 
on general transversal competencies and work across 
school subjects. The competencies will also be assessed 
as a part of subject assessment. The emphasis set on 
collaborative classroom practices will be brought about 
in multidisciplinary, phenomenon- and project-based 
studies where several teachers may work with any 
given number of students simultaneously.44 

with teaching methods that stimulate and build in 
critical thinking, problem solving, communication, 
teamwork, and creativity. The New School model in 
Colombia (Escuela Nueva, in Spanish) has taken this 
approach, putting stronger emphasis on group learn-
ing and problem solving than on memorization and 
copying. This model has informed the modernization 
of the curriculum in many countries: so far, it has 
been piloted or has been already extended to around 
17 countries (box 5.8).42

Countries like Brazil, Finland, the Republic of Korea, 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Mex-
ico, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam are taking actions 
to foster new economy skills.43 Despite being a top

is an open debate. Even if taught separately, it is 
important to reinforce learning these modern skills 
across subjects. A teacher could give a lecture on 
history with little class interaction, or could break 
the class into small groups that would refl ect on the 
reading material, prepare takeaways, and present 
to the whole class, thus teaching history as well as 
teamwork, empathy, communication skills, problem 
solving, self-regulation, and self-esteem.47 Changes 
can also include introducing more open-ended ques-
tions in home assignments and in tests, more fl exible 
classroom seating arrangements that allow work in 
groups, having discussions involving the full class-
room, and creating spaces in classrooms and schools 
for collaborative projects. The increased demands on 
teachers need to be accompanied by modernizing 
teacher training, both in- and pre-service. Teacher 
training needs to focus on how to teach curriculum 
content and on how to impart socioemotional skills. 

Countries are making progress in improving stu-
dent assessments, critical for identifying strengths 
and weaknesses in the education system, designing 
policy, and strengthening accountability. Yet current 
assessments typically focus on testing information, 
facts, or the ability to read or perform math opera-
tions. While important foundational skills, these skills 
are often fairly routine and easily programmable, so 

Singapore has also made large changes to its 
education system to adapt to the knowledge-based 
economy. The main change was in 1997, with a move 
from an effi ciency-driven model to an ability-driven 
model.45 The effi ciency-driven model, an engineer’s 
vision to education, had a top-down approach in 
designing, disseminating, and enforcing the national 
curriculum; streaming students by competency lev-
els to ensure that teachers were dealing with students 
of similar levels; and creating clear but rigid paths to 
vocational and tertiary education. While this model 
produced students who scored high on international 
math and science tests, it produced students who 
were not critical thinkers and teachers who were not 
motivated.46 Under the new ability-driven model, 
schools have more autonomy over their curriculum 
and develop programs to suit their students. More 
emphasis is placed on project work, introduced from 
primary education onward, with a move from high-
stakes examinations to smaller assessments. The 
government has also emphasized the use of ICT in 
the curriculum. 

Whether to streamline teaching new economy 
skills into the traditional curricula, as in Finland or 
Peru, or whether to teach them in targeted classes 
or interventions, as with grit (that is, perseverance 
in pursuing long-term goals) in FYR Macedonia, 

Box 5.8 Building new economy skills: Escuela Nueva in Colombia and 
Vietnam

The Escuela Nueva model started in Colombia in 1976 as 
an innovation in multigrade teaching, promoting active, 
participatory, and cooperative learning among primary 
school students. Today it serves 5 million students in 16 
countries, including Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, 
the Philippines, Uganda, and Vietnam.

The model is based on several innovations for improving 
teamwork and developing critical thinking. The curriculum 
is focused on a self-paced and self-directed learning guide. 
Group learning is facilitated through the use of learning 
guides that contain interactive exercises. Teachers are 
trained in group management. Group learning is also fos-
tered by class arrangements and a modifi ed role of teach-
ers as facilitators. Students are seated in clusters of four or 
fi ve, with teachers guiding, supervising, and evaluating the 

children in these groups. The school calendar and evalua-
tions are fl exible, so that children can meet learning goals 
at their own pace. 

Evaluations of the model in Colombia and elsewhere 
indicate that the program is fostering both cognitive and 
socioemotional skills. The model improves levels of Spanish 
and math in the third and fi fth grades, as well as self-
esteem and the abilities to lead others in group tasks and 
to work peacefully with others in a team. A recent impact 
evaluation of Escuela Nueva’s fi rst two years in Vietnam 
shows that the model helps children learn to work with 
each other and develop communication and interpersonal 
skills. Improved cooperative learning skills also enable a 
student to obtain better results in math.

tance barrier. The World Links for Development 
Program has worked with ministries of education 
in more than 20 middle- and low-income countries 
to link classrooms to the internet but also to one 
another. European Schoolnet has fostered long-
term online connections among classrooms across 
borders.52 Social media can also be used to connect 
classrooms.

Priorities for transforming countries: 
Focus on advanced technical skills and 
lifelong learning

ICT skills and training in computational 
thinking
As in other countries, the skills agenda for transform-
ing countries needs to also strengthen foundational 
skills, and develop new economy skills, such as 
higher-order cognitive and socioemotional skills. 
Because the skill base in transforming countries is 
stronger than in the emerging and transitioning 
countries, they also have to focus on more advanced 
technical skills (table 5.4). 

To address shortages in advanced ICT skills and 
improve competitiveness in a growing industry, 
countries are paying more attention to providing 
advanced ICT skills training in their education sys-
tem. Many fi rms report diffi culties in fi nding work-
ers with advanced ICT skills (chapter 2). Partly in 
response, coding, as a subject, has been introduced in 
the general education curriculum in Estonia and the 
United Kingdom. 

Incorporating advanced ICT skills in the general 
curriculum can teach computational thinking in 
transforming countries. But not everyone needs to 
become a professional coder. Incorporating coding in 
general education can strengthen not only ICT skills 
but also critical thinking, especially if it is a vehicle to 
teach logic and learning strategies for solving prob-
lems, designing projects, and communicating ideas. 
Done well, it can be not only about “learning to code” 
but about “coding to learn.”53 

Training in advanced ICT skills can also be pro-
vided less systematically, and outside of the formal 
education system. This could be the route for coun-
tries with less mature education systems. For exam-
ple, advanced ICT skills could be offered in middle or 
high schools through accredited massive open online 
courses (MOOCs). Individuals can also learn coding 
through specialized online platforms. Codecademy, 
an online interactive platform that offers free coding 
classes in seven programming languages, has more 
than 24 million users who have completed over 100 
million exercises.54 

student assessments can be further strengthened by 
broadening their scope to better incorporate higher- 
order skills. 

Open-ended questions in tests can put greater 
emphasis on critical thinking and problem solving. 
New economy skills can be monitored, as is tradi-
tional academic learning, through mechanisms such 
as the KIPP Report card, where socioemotional skills 
are identifi ed, measured, and discussed with parents 
and students at evaluation time.48 At the international 
level, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD) and the World Bank have 
recently implemented new skill measurement assess-
ments that aim at measuring, among adults, problem 
solving in technological environments, and socio-
emotional skills, respectively.49 L’Oréal, the French 
cosmetics company, asks job candidates in China 
to answer three open-ended questions on mobile 
phones, and then uses “big data” and an algorithm to 
mine the responses for cues on critical thinking and 
socioemotional skills.50 

Digital technologies can also foster higher-order 
cognitive and socioemotional skills—in at least three 
ways:

•   Directly promoting critical thinking, teamwork, problem 
solving, and creativity. This could be done through 
digital activities, such as programming. Scratch, a 
simple programming language for kids, can help 
develop abstract and critical thinking from an early 
age. Digital tools, such as wikis—online content- 
management systems that allow for collaborative 
modifi cation, extension, or deletion of its content 
and structure—can promote discussion and com-
munication inside and outside the classroom. Many 
schools are now using hackathons, events where 
teams collaboratively work on software projects, 
and which can provide a creative space that also 
fosters problem solving. Incorporating learning 
games into classrooms (game-based learning) and 
applying the principles of gaming to education 
(gamifi cation) could also foster higher-order cogni-
tive and socioemotional skills, such as abstraction, 
reasoning, and teamwork, while bringing the power 
of play to education and engaging, inspiring, and 
immersing students in learning (box 5.9).

•   Developing and delivering training in socioemotional 
skills. Grit (that is, perseverance in pursuing long-
term goals) and growth mind-set lessons,51 for exam-
ple, can be delivered via videos and over the internet. 
Additional online modules that target other socioe-
motional skills could be part of teachers’ toolkits.

•   Supporting teamwork and communication skills by 
bringing together diverse teams and breaking the dis-

job placement rate of 90 percent.55 Similarly, iHub, one 
of the innovation and hacker spaces in Kenya, holds 
hacker labs for children and youth aged 10 to 16. 

Many developing countries are partnering with 
the private sector to develop technical training in 
advanced ICT skills after general education. Mexico 
First, a partnership with Cisco and Microsoft, targets 
professionals and university students to facilitate 
training and certifi cation in ICT. 

Countries with a local technology industry 
or where online work is common, already teach 
advanced ICT skills outside the education system. 
In Kenya, NairoBits equips youth with knowledge 
in web design, IT skills, creative multimedia, and 
entrepreneurship. This technical training is combined 
with training in socioemotional skills to build self-con-
fi dence. NairoBits-trained youth have secured employ-
ment in both formal and informal sectors and report a 

Box 5.9 Building modern skills: Game-based learning and “gamifying” 
education 

Learning can be fun. Play can be a great conduit for learn-
ing and creativity because it taps into people’s intrinsic 
motivation, satisfying needs of autonomy, competence, 
and relatedness. When playing, many people achieve a 
state of “fl ow”—a state of concentration that activates the 
brain and is considered optimal for new learning.a Applying 
the principles of gaming—rules, goal achievement, pro-
gressive diffi  culty, interaction and student control, uncer-
tain outcomes, and immediate feedback—to classroom 
activities can teach both cognitive and socioemotional 
skills. Some games apply these principles to teach basic 
skills, such as math and vocabulary in games like King of 
Math and FunEnglish, while others integrate learning into 
the game. Dragonbox, Freddi Fish, and Guild Wars require 
creative thinking, problem solving, and building on existing 
knowledge to succeed.b Requiring inference and problem 
solving, rather than direct questioning for learning, they are 
more engaging and can lead to sustained learning.c

Games can not only increase engagement but also 
improve learning outcomes. A unique English program in 
India can be implemented with diff erent technologies (a 
specially designed machine or games and activities based 
on special fl ash cards). New methods yielded gains of about 
0.3 standard deviation in test scores.d A 2006 study of fi fth 
graders found that playing math games was more eff ective 
than basic math drills at building math skills, as measured 
by performance on a standardized math exam.e And two 
science games, RiverCity, which emphasizes ecology and 
biology, and Supercharged!, a program on electrostatics, 
improved learning outcomes over a traditional lecture by 15 
to 18 percent and 8 percent, respectively.f

But most of today’s teachers are not equipped with 
the skills to make games eff ective learning tools, such as 
designing materials and environments for game-based 
learning, partly because they are not familiar with many 
tools of the digital age.g Teachers need to be trained so 
that they understand both the potential and the limits of 
games for learning and fully understand the game, how 
to play, and how to use it as a teaching tool. Teachers can 
work with parents in fi nding appropriate games and defi n-
ing parameters for usage. Updated curricula, reformed 
assessments, and resources for learning games can all 
help to shift classrooms to be focused on learning. Policy 
makers could also encourage more research and develop-
ment to create successful learning games that are engag-
ing, thoughtful, and immersing, and facilitate effi  cient 
learning. 

The future of games and game-based learning extends 
beyond the classroom. Evoke, developed by the World 
Bank, uses social media tools and narrative approaches 
commonly found in video games to empower young 
people to start solving urgent social, real-world problems. 
Food Force, created by the United Nations, teaches strategy 
and networking by simulating aid agencies working in food 
insecurity. The Facebook game Half the Sky highlights gen-
der equality and raises money for female empowerment. 
Games can also be tools for job training, especially when 
real on-the-job training is dangerous; the U.S. military has 
used video games to teach strategy, skills such as fi rst aid, 
and military rules and ethics.h

with 18 percent of boys.57 Addressing gender stereo-
types in school and at home can encourage girls to 
believe that they have the required ability for STEM 
and that signifi cant opportunities will emerge for 
them. Other actions include providing girls with rele-
vant role models; targeting girls for recruitment into 
the STEM fi elds early in their education, as Finland 
does; clearly establishing targets and incentives for 
recruitment, retention, and graduation of women in 
STEM fi elds; and working with employers to make 
work settings gender-friendly.

Promoting lifelong learning in rapidly 
aging societies
In rapidly changing labor markets, the skills learned 
in formal education risk becoming obsolete. Contin-
ued (re)training and upskilling can help workers stay 
current, and ensure that their skills are complemen-
tary to new technological developments. 

A fi rst part of a lifelong learning agenda is 
ensuring that the skills students learn are useful for 
entering the labor market and provide a strong base 
for continuing to learn on the job. Given the pace 
at which digital technologies are changing and how 
they are changing the labor market, students and 
adults must learn how to learn. 

Governments can:

•  Provide students with practical training and exposure to 
the world of work prior to their graduation. In addition 
to traditional apprenticeships, technology can be 
useful. Virtual labs and simulation games for sci-
ence education and machine operations are spread-
ing and moving ever closer to the brick-and-mortar 
experience.58 Online work can also expose young 
students and trainees to the world of work.

Strengthening education in science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics 
(STEM)
Improving STEM education has become a major goal 
not only in transforming countries but also in most 
other countries. But good intentions are not always 
paired with concrete and effective actions. Address-
ing shortages and defi ciencies in the teaching of 
STEM requires preparing and equipping teachers 
properly and including STEM across the educational 
system—not just in tertiary education. It also requires 
creatively involving the employers, more effectively 
connecting the teaching and research activities, and 
establishing fi nancial incentives or compensatory 
mechanisms to make STEM education viable and 
affordable to underrepresented groups. And it 
requires enabling institutions and governments to 
share experiences and lessons in addressing the 
STEM education defi cits. The World Bank–funded 
Partnership for Skills in Applied Sciences, Engineer-
ing and Technology brings together the expertise in 
several Sub-Saharan countries with that in Brazil, 
China, India, and the Republic of Korea. 

Women are much less likely than men to choose 
a STEM fi eld in tertiary education, in both advanced 
and developing countries, and this is partly refl ected 
in occupational choices. In the United States, although 
women fi ll close to half of all jobs nationwide, they 
hold fewer than 25 percent of STEM jobs, and for 
every dollar a man earns in STEM, a woman earns 86 
cents.56 Women with a STEM degree are more likely 
to work in education or health care. 

The gender gap in STEM fi elds starts early, both 
in the education system and at home. In OECD econ-
omies, at age 15, fewer than 5 percent of girls consider 
careers in engineering and technology, compared

least parts of their courses. The Dominican Repub-
lic training institute offers a wide range of online 
courses, including teacher training and inventory 
management, and reports particular interest from 
youth and individuals who are already working or 
who have family responsibilities.62 MOOCs can also 
be a tool for lifelong learning (box 5.10).

•  Promote on-the-job training. Traditional market fail-
ures limit on-the-job training63 so one common 
mechanism for promoting on-the-job training is to 
have institutional arrangements between employ-
ers and employees. “Payback clauses” commit the 
worker to stay at the fi rm for a specifi c amount of 
time if training is provided. In apprenticeships, the 
worker shares the costs of training through lower 
wages. The German apprenticeship system is a 
well-defi ned program that relies on a dual system 
of classroom training in vocational institutions and 
training at the workplace. 

A second common mechanism for on-the-job 
training relies on fi nancial arrangements that 
internalize some of the externalities related to 
employer-provided training. In developing coun-
tries, this typically takes the form of training 
funds, usually through payroll taxes, as in Brazil, 
Chile, Malaysia, and Mexico. Other schemes 
compensate fi rms for the cost of training through 
levy exemptions, tax rebates, and cost reimburse-
ments. But as with other subsidies, these can be 
ineffi cient and crowd out private expenditures on 
training. It is, therefore, important to target the 
subsidies carefully, trying to go beyond fi rm size, 
as in Malaysia’s Human Resources Development 
Fund.64 In OECD countries, different cofi nancing 
savings and loan schemes match individual con-
tributions to contributions from employers and 
governments. Individual learning accounts, learn-
ing vouchers, and income-contingent repayment 
loans are just some of the possible instruments 
that could be used.65

•  Explore modular approaches to learning so that stu-
dents can move between education and work, as 
in Denmark or in College to Careers in the United 
States in postsecondary education. In the latter, 
students complete modules with clear accredita-
tion and competencies acquired (often equivalent 
to “expertise” levels), which allow them to mone-
tize the newly acquired skills in the labor market, 
even before completing the full degree. Students 
can then return to the community college and con-
tinue to the next level of expertise. Nanodegrees or 
microdegrees, offered by MOOC platforms Uda-
city and Coursera in partnership with the private 
sector, take the modular approach to online-based 
education.

•  Strengthen links between the private sector and higher 
education and vocational systems. Ensuring that 
graduates from the education system acquire job-
relevant cognitive, socioemotional, and technical 
skills requires that fi rms, universities, and voca-
tional schools, and current and future students, 
become better connected. The German dual system 
is a very formal and institutionalized way of fos-
tering these links, but there are other approaches. 
Chicago’s reforms of the city’s community colleges 
targeted curricula more explicitly to sectors with a 
large presence in the region, including manufactur-
ing and insurance. Specifi c components of these cur-
ricula were discussed with major employers in these 
sectors to ensure relevance for the job market.59 

•  Focus publicly fi nanced training on new economy skills 
and ICT skills. New economy skills are likely to be 
underprovided by fi rms because the benefi ts do not 
accrue solely to the fi rm.60 Several youth employ-
ment programs, such as Jovenes in Latin America, 
combine technical training with socioemotional 
skills for disadvantaged groups, and many have 
had an impact on employment and earnings.61 

Vocational training institutes in developing 
countries are starting to use the internet to deliver at

Technology mixes appropriate to 
institutions
The policy agenda needs to be guided by the country 
context, classifi ed here as emerging, transitioning, or 
transforming depending on the extent to which gov-
ernment uses digital technology and the quality of 
political and administrative institutions (fi gure 5.10).

Emerging countries are characterized by weak 
institutions and, in fragile contexts, the institutions 
may be failing. Politicians are often kept in power by a 
narrow set of elites who are largely unaccountable to 
the poor. The bureaucracy is largely patronage-based, 
with little incentive to deliver services. These reform 
contexts are the most diffi cult, as the state is failing 
not only to deliver services but also to perform the 
most basic functions of maintaining security. The 
priority in these countries is to lay the institutional 
foundations so that governments can start perform-
ing basic functions. They should ensure that teachers 
and doctors show up to work and are paid on time. 
They should curtail the outright theft of public funds 

Institutions: Connecting for 
a capable and accountable 
government
Digital technologies have had limited impact on 
strengthening government capability and account-
ability because of the misaligned incentives of policy 
makers and service providers—a gap between institu-
tions and technology. They have helped willing and 
able governments serve their citizens better, but they 
have not yet empowered citizens to make unwilling 
governments more accountable. The policy agenda is 
thus to use digital technologies to strengthen insti-
tutions by tailoring policies that are compatible with 
the incentives of politicians and providers. The policy 
choices for different country contexts are informed 
by the fi ndings in chapter 3 that for some services, 
digital technologies can substitute for weak institu-
tions and be transformative—while for other services, 
digital technologies are only complementary and 
require strong institutions to have an impact. 

following its introduction in summer 2012, open courses 
off ered by HarvardX and MITx, and hosted by edX, attracted 
an average of 1,300 new participants per course per day.a 

MOOCs are promising. People from anywhere around 
the world can access postsecondary education from pres-
tigious institutions with only a gadget and access to the 
internet. Among adults who work and who have a certain 
level of skills, online education can be a powerful force for 
lifelong learning. These are individuals who would appre-
ciate the fl exibility (since they can combine it with work, 
which is one of the usual barriers for retraining). These are 
also workers who are likely to be best prepared for self-
guided learning. In addition, the courses provide access 
to specialized topics that may not be available in the local 
economy. At the very least, MOOCs can complement offl  ine 
learning. 

Coursera and edX have started to evaluate their pro-
grams. One study fi nds that a slight majority of MOOC 
students are seeking certifi cation, and those opting for 
fee-based, ID-verifi ed certifi cates have higher rates of com-
pletion. The study also fi nds that literacy and motivation 

to self-study are necessary characteristics to access and 
complete MOOCs, but so are more basic elements such as 
high-speed internet and digital skills.

Yet, while their potential is large, there are questions 
about fi nancial sustainability, the value of online educa-
tion, and the evaluation methods. Another study argues 
that MOOCs are an improvement on noninteractive, online 
courses, but that the current model is unsustainable. 
Eventually, content will no longer be free, and star instruc-
tors will have to be paid like stars. And although they can 
be an effi  cient way for transferring content and reinforcing 
learning, especially in basic courses, the lack of face-to-
face interactions, the absence of individualized feedback 
from faculty, and the lack of access to complex infrastruc-
ture such as labs, make MOOCs an unlikely competitor to 
existing postsecondary education institutions, especially 
in the developed world.b Finally, in terms of evaluation, 
MOOCs are complementing multiple-choice and short-
answer questions with peer-grading and peer-commenting 
systems, in which students help each other with assign-
ments and comment on each other’s work.

among them such fragile and confl ict-affected states 
as Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, 
Haiti, Somalia, the Republic of Yemen, and Zimbabwe. 

Transitioning countries have mixed institutions 
characterized by pockets of pro-poor politicians and 
performance-oriented agencies. The priority for these 
countries should be to take advantage of this institu-
tional heterogeneity and to use digital technologies 
to strengthen government capability in the “islands 
of excellence” that exist, and through demonstration, 
scale them up. The emphasis should also be on tar-
geted transparency initiatives, those likely to be rele-
vant to the daily lives of citizens and able to mobilize 
a broad coalition of supporters among businesses 
and other elites to align their incentives with those 
of willing politicians. Most developing countries fall 
into this category.

In transforming contexts, governments are gener-
ally accountable and capable, internet access is close 
to universal, many services are online, and many 
back-offi ce systems are automated. One big challenge 
in taking e-government to the next level is the rela-
tively low use of online services by citizens, especially 
poor households. Within-government collaboration 
across ministerial lines is weak, pushing up the trans-
action costs for citizens to interact with government. 
Another challenge is that government-citizen collabo-
ration in policy making and service delivery is limited. 
Policies should focus on deepening collaborative insti-
tutions, both within government, through whole-of-
government service delivery—and between govern-
ment and citizens, through participatory approaches, 
while instituting digital safeguards to protect privacy. 

Digital technologies can help in implementing 
policies more effectively. The key is to align the 
choice of digital technologies with their availability, 
skill requirements, and political incentives (table 
5.5). While the focus here is on what to do, aligning 

through transparency and accountability measures. 
And they should strengthen alternative channels 
of service delivery through nonstate providers. The 
focus, from the perspective of this Report, should be 
in areas where digital technologies can be effective 
substitutes for these weak initial institutional condi-
tions. Around 15 to 20 countries fall into this category,

lack is an offi cial identity, which excludes them from 
accessing many services, both public and private. So, 
a priority should be to build digital civil-identity sys-
tems to establish citizenship and become a platform 
for nonstate provision of services. 

The underlying policies can be grouped in fi ve cat-
egories: improving informational services; strength-
ening the monitoring and management of service 
providers and facilities; developing robust digital 
population registers for citizen identity; strengthen-
ing nonstate provision of services through for-profi t 
and not-for-profi t providers; and improving electoral 
accountability through better monitoring.

Improve informational services to citizens
Mobile phones are delivering information to poor 
citizens in a variety of low-income countries with 
positive outcomes, and health applications are among 
the most promising uses of digital technology (see 
sector focus 3). In Malawi, governments and non-
governmental organizations send daily reminders 
to HIV-positive patients on their treatment schedule. 
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, health call 
centers enable mothers to get answers to questions 
about their children’s health. And in Benin, Uganda, 
and Zambia, mobile apps raise health awareness and 
monitor disease outbreaks.66 Mobile phones have also 
improved communication between governments and 
citizens for natural disasters and relief efforts—and 
promoted literacy through daily text message stories 
and teaching tips for teachers, with promising initial 
results (see sector focus 2).

Strengthen the monitoring and 
management of service providers and 
facilities
Ghana, Niger, Pakistan, and Uganda have demon-
strated the effi cacy of mobile phones as a cost-
effective monitoring technology to address absentee-
ism among teachers and health workers. In principle, 
similar monitoring approaches can be applied to 
address missing textbooks, drug stock-outs, and petty 
corruption. Scaling up from pilots to national pro-
grams will, however, face bureaucratic resistance—to 
be mitigated by focusing on rewards instead of sanc-
tions, such as fi nancial incentives and recognition 
in the local community. A basic reward—or right—is 
getting regularly paid for work, a problem in many 
low-income countries due to ineffi cient budget exe-
cution. In Haiti, three-quarters of school teachers sur-
veyed had gone unpaid for months at a time.67 Mobile 
payment platforms provide a low-cost solution, as 
in the Bridge International Academies in Kenya. If 
linked to digital population registers, they can also 

policies to institutions should also guide what not 
to do. For example, the misalignment of policies and 
political and administrative incentives is one of the 
most common reasons for failed ICT interventions in 
government. As chapter 3 showed, many low-income 
countries have overinvested in low-impact adminis-
trative systems, resulting in fi scal waste. So, to use 
the popular metaphor, investing in “toilets, not the 
internet” may indeed be advisable. Similarly, political 
elites will have little interest in collaborative service 
delivery or citizen engagement in clientelist systems, 
suggesting that an across-the-board push for open 
data in emerging contexts is unlikely to be successful.

Given the persistent failure of many governments 
to deliver adequate services, the priority in emerging 
contexts is to use digital technologies to begin build-
ing the foundations of government institutions and, 
where possible, to support alternative institutional 
channels for delivering services. The digital solutions 
should be relatively simple and low cost and should 
not require signifi cant business process reengineer-
ing in government bureaucracies or interagency col-
laboration. Where possible, they should substitute for 
ineffi cient government institutions. And to be incen-
tive compatible, they should deliver immediate and 
visible benefi ts for politicians without threatening the 
elites who keep them in power. Examples of appropri-
ate technologies and complements appear in table 5.6. 

Although institutions are failing, mobile phones 
are ubiquitous, and many poor people in even the 
poorest countries have a cellphone. This almost 
universal access opens many possibilities for mobile-
phone applications to improve services and outcomes, 
substituting for ineffective institutions in some 
services and functions. However, what poor people

monitoring capacity in government, and the collec-
tion and verifi cation of data to hold nonstate provid-
ers accountable. 

Digital technologies can improve the impact of 
these schemes through better data collection, moni-
toring, and dissemination of information on provider 
quality. Parents can make more informed decisions, 
fi xing the market failures in private provision. Non-
digital school report cards in Pakistan’s rural Punjab 
for example, improved parental information, lowered 
private school prices, and boosted school quality.71 
Digital technologies can make these choices easier 
through simpler versions of the school and health 
care provider rating systems that are now common-
place in the high-income countries. And govern-
ments, in the absence of parental choice, can better 
hold the private providers to account.  

Improve electoral accountability
Digital technologies are improving both the sanctity 
of elections and providing citizens with meaningful 
and actionable information on government perfor-
mance. Although the number of electoral democ-
racies in poor countries has increased over the past 
two decades, the integrity of elections in these new 
democracies is low. Over half of the elections over 
the past decade had irregularities either in the run-up 
to the election or on election day.72 Elections are 
well-suited for digitally enabled monitoring. As high- 
profi le events that attract signifi cant international 
attention and scrutiny, improving electoral integrity 
may be possible even in politically diffi cult emerging 
country contexts. 

Digital technologies can reduce election violence, 
as in Kenya and Mozambique, and uncover fraud in 
vote-counting, as in Afghanistan. Digital identifi ca-
tion is being increasingly used to register voters. In 
Pakistan for example, ahead of the 2013 parliamen-
tary elections, the digital identity database was used 
to clean the electoral rolls, leading to the removal of 
37 million voters with either no, invalid, or duplicate 
identities, and the addition of 36 million new voters, 
mostly young and poor, who had valid identifi cation.73 
Similarly, in the 2015 presidential election in Nigeria, 
biometric identifi cation was used for the fi rst time 
to enroll 68 million voters and to eliminate 4 million 
duplicate identities (see spotlight 4). Despite these suc-
cesses though, biometric identifi cation is not without 
its risks in emerging countries. Simpler, lower-cost 
monitoring technologies like cellphones that require 
fewer institutional complements may be preferable.74

Digital technologies can also improve electoral 
accountability by exposing corruption and abuse 
of offi ce, thereby better enabling voters to sanction 

identify ghost workers, as in Nigeria, where a digi-
tal identifi cation scheme for civil servants removed 
about 60,000 fi ctitious workers from the government 
payroll, saving US$1 billion annually.68 

Establish population registers 
Digital population registers can establish citizen 
identity and be leveraged later for a variety of applica-
tions through appropriate credential verifi cation (see 
spotlight 4). The focus should be on developing the 
identity database and on the systems to ensure com-
pleteness and high quality. Only after the country has 
developed harmonized identity registers can it legiti-
mately begin to tie e-services and issue the right cre-
dentials to support them. In many cases, countries, 
under vendor pressure, have prematurely procured 
costly smart cards, which then remained unused as 
the identity registers had not been developed fi rst. 
India focused on enrollment and unique identity and 
launched the program without any smart cards or 
credentials, just an Aadhaar number communicated 
to individuals. Now, more than fi ve years later, differ-
ent programs are issuing application-specifi c creden-
tials linked to the Aadhaar framework and database.

Scale up nonstate provision of services 
Citizens in many low-income countries send their 
children to nonstate schools (for-profi t or not-for-
profi t) and seek care from private health providers. 
Nonstate provision raises questions of equity and 
quality. These risks can be mitigated through regu-
lations, disclosures, and public-private partnerships, 
such as voucher programs and contracting out. 
These programs, if implemented well, can be highly 
effective. In an educational scheme for marginal 
communities in rural Pakistan, the government paid 
the private provider a per-child subsidy, increasing 
primary school enrollments and boosting test scores 
by 30 percentage points.69 These programs can also be 
compatible with the interests of even clientelist pol-
iticians, as they are likely to be supported by impor-
tant stakeholders like the business community and 
private service providers.

Nonstate provision theoretically relies on the 
power of the market to solve accountability failures 
in ways that public provision cannot. But in practice, 
parents may lack the choice of alternative providers 
or the information on provider quality to “vote with 
their feet” and hold nonstate providers accountable. 
The impact of low-cost private schools on student 
learning is generally positive, but in some cases they 
can be even worse than their public counterparts.70 
Performance agreements between governments and 
nonstate providers require some contracting and 



276 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

investments through complementary policies and 
strengthen performance orientation in bureaucracies.

Strengthen government delivery systems
These countries should continue to expand e-gov-
ernment, particularly digital identifi cation systems 
and the business and citizen-facing services like 
online registration of businesses, e-fi ling of taxes, 
e-procurement, and citizen service centers. But these 
investments should be conditional on enacting the 
complementary reforms of regulatory changes, 
improving interdepartmental and interagency coop-
eration, and streamlining procedures. Digital technol-
ogies can strengthen project management through 
better monitoring of the different stages of the proj-
ect cycle. By making procurement and contract mon-
itoring more transparent, they can also give agencies 
fl exibility in negotiating contracts with vendors, 
relaxing the procurement rigidities that cause many 
ICT projects to fail (box 5.11). Examples of appropriate 
technologies and complements appear in table 5.7.  

Institutionalize user feedback on service 
quality
Incorporating citizen feedback into policy maker- 
to-provider management routines can be a powerful 
mechanism for tackling petty corruption and improv-
ing services, as in the Dominican Republic, Kenya, 
Nigeria, and Pakistan (chapter 3). It works especially 
well for private goods and services that are easy to 

lawbreaking politicians. Municipal audits in Brazil 
and Mexico show that targeted digital transparency 
initiatives can provide salient and credible informa-
tion on corruption and on the quality of candidates 
that is easy to understand and attribute to individual 
politicians. Widely disseminated before an election, 
such information can infl uence voters’ decisions. But 
such initiatives are contingent on a supportive legal 
framework—such as right to information laws or 
disclosures of confl icts of interest and assets—or on 
independent supreme audit institutions that may be 
absent in these country settings. Civil society advo-
cacy, in partnership with traditional media, is neces-
sary to uncover abuse and to make this information 
available and understandable to voters.

Countries transitioning digitally have invested in 
the automation of core government administration, 
such as digital identifi cation, fi nancial and sector- 
specifi c management information systems, and on 
government-to-citizen and government-to-business 
services. They can increase the impact of these 

Box 5.11 Increasing the impact of e-government systems

Better project management: The U.S. Offi  ce of Management 
and Budget in 2009 introduced the IT [Information 
Technology] Dashboard, a public website that provides 
detailed performance information on major IT investments 
by the federal government. That information is then used 
to review problem projects at monthly TechStat meetings 
between the federal Chief Information Offi  cer and the 
respective agencies. The Government Accountability Offi  ce 
found that these reforms improved the transparency and 
oversight of government IT spending. 

Flexible and transparent IT procurement: E-government 
projects often fail because of rigid procurement rules. But 
making procurement transparent can ensure that discretion 

is not abused. The European Union allows agencies to negoti-
ate with multiple bidders and award the contract to the ven-
dor with the best revised bid. The greater discretion would 
not be possible without the greater monitoring, accountabil-
ity, and trust aff orded through the e-procurement system.

Public-private partnerships: A number of middle-income 
countries have implemented e-government projects 
through public-private partnerships, minimizing the 
risks of failure associated with misaligned incentives and 
limited government capacity. Such partnerships are fea-
sible for revenue-raising services, for managing citizen 
service centers, as in Brazil and India, and for government 
e-procurement systems, as in the Indian state of Karnataka.

monitoring technologies can assure citizens that their 
contributions are going to their chosen causes. Give-
Directly, a Silicon Valley–based philanthropy, enables 
well-off individuals all over the world to contribute 
funds directly to poor benefi ciaries in developing 
countries. The private sector has also been much more 
successful in getting citizens to create internet con-
tent for public causes. Wikipedia, Yelp, Trip Advisor, 
and Amazon product reviews provide lessons for solv-
ing collective action problems and engaging citizens 
in public service delivery improvements. 

Strengthen provider management through 
regular small-stakes monitoring
Most services and functions in government—teach-
ing, curative health, policy making, and manage-
ment—require considerable discretion from workers 
and produce outputs and outcomes that are diffi cult 
to monitor. Improving these services requires strong 
institutions. Digital technologies can only augment 
and not substitute for institutions. Even though mea-
suring performance is diffi cult for these services and 
functions, the processes of setting goals, of regularly 
communicating and discussing them with staff, and 
of associating small rewards, such as public recogni-
tion, for teams and individuals in the achievement 
of even imprecisely measured goals can motivate 
workers to perform better (box 5.12). A survey of gov-
ernment workers in the Philippines found that a per-
formance incentive scheme triggered improvements 
in management practices through goal setting and 
improved teamwork.75 And a mobile phone–enabled 

monitor, like drivers’ licenses, property transfer and 
registration, and water and electricity connections, 
since users have both the incentive and the ability 
to provide feedback. Politicians are likely to support 
it because it yields immediate and visible service 
improvements without threatening elites and vested 
interests. Similar approaches can monitor service 
providers, facilities, assets, and public spending.

Digital platforms can also raise resources from citi-
zens to fund infrastructure, hire contract teachers, and 
purchase drugs and educational materials, and digital

Box 5.12 Regular, small-stakes monitoring

Regular monitoring with small rewards or sanctions can be 
more eff ective than irregular monitoring with large rewards 
or sanctions. The logic of this proposition is motivated by 
the economic theory of crime that postulates that the incen-
tives for criminals to commit a crime are a function of the 
probability (P) of getting caught multiplied by the severity 
of the punishment (C). While standard economic analysis 
presumes that what matters is only the product P x C, the 
evidence suggests that raising the severity of punishment 
in response to low probabilities of catching criminals is not 
credible because many law enforcement offi  cials are loathe 
to impose draconian punishments for smaller off enses. For 

example, in Hawaii, revoking probation when probationers 
failed a drug test was for years an ineff ective strategy, 
given the large numbers of violators and the impracticality 
of sending them to prison for several years. But raising P 
and lowering C—regular, randomized drug tests and jail 
sentences of two days—deterred parole violations because 
the punishment strategy became more credible. 

These fi ndings are generally applicable to other ser-
vices. Digital technologies reduce the cost of monitoring 
and thus make it more feasible to give regular rewards and 
sanctions. If the rewards and sanctions are small, they can 
be feasibly imposed, improving performance.

Transforming countries: Deepening 
collaborative institutions
Many transforming countries have improved service 
delivery, but only in some areas. Their services are 
not yet suffi ciently integrated, holding them back 
from more ambitious interventions such as greater 
government-citizen collaboration in policy making 
and service delivery. 

Increase citizen use of government services 
through integrated whole-of-government 
digital solutions
The gap between the provision of e-services and 
their use is wide—even in digitally advanced coun-
tries—and it is not closing. In Australia, Canada, 
and New Zealand, a majority of survey respondents 
prefer traditional channels like phones for routine 
transactions such as paying taxes or registering chil-
dren for day care.79 This low use reveals the waste in 
e-government investments. Part of the explanation 
lies in less friendly experiences. Federal government 
websites in the United States provide a poorer user 
experience than comparable private ones.80 Of more 
than 400 applications that the Korean government 
offers over smartphones, none meet the criteria of a 
seamless, cross-agency, or cross-functional one-stop 
service.81 

Increasing use will require better integration of 
e-government across government, which requires 
breaking down agency silos and improving data shar-
ing across government. In the private sector, digitally 
enabled improvements in customer service, a core 
differentiator in the service industry, are conditional 
on high levels of shared knowledge in the fi rm.82 Esto-
nia’s X-Road data-sharing protocol shows how data 
integration can work within the constraints of the 
ministry and agency structure of government (box 
5.13). Data integration is also essential for effective 
open data platforms that the private sector can use to 
develop applications that citizens want. Examples of 
appropriate technologies and complements appear in 
table 5.8.  

Expand participatory policy making and 
service delivery
Increasing use of digital technologies is also condi-
tional on a better understanding of citizens’ needs and 
thus on simplifi cation and customization. Behavioral 
research has shown that individuals are “cognitive 

monitoring scheme increased the motivation of rural 
teachers in part by showing that offi cials in the far-
away ministry of education cared about their work 
and were looking out for them.76 

Digital technologies can improve goal setting and 
within-government communication between policy 
makers, managers, and providers. Many private orga-
nizations are introducing short “pulse” staff surveys 
to get rapid responses from employees on particular 
issues, to gauge employee motivation, and to moti-
vate workers through “employee of the month” public 
recognition schemes, and “gamifi cation” techniques 
like assigning points, leaderboards, badges, and other 
small rewards for the achievement of particular activ-
ities.77 The ubiquity of mobile phones makes such 
within-government feedback channels quite feasible 
even in low-income countries, and can certainly be 
applied in the pockets of excellence in transitioning 
contexts. While the measurement of performance 
and the feedback is subjective and imprecise, it is 
the regular communication and monitoring tied 
to the small-stakes rewards that improve worker 
motivation.  

Reinforce targeted transparency initiatives
Digital technologies can provide a new lease on life 
for transparency initiatives such as the Open Govern-
ment Partnership, an international platform for com-
mitted domestic reformers. But the initiatives should 
be targeted and of value to citizens and of interest to 
the private sector and other important stakeholders. 
Consider the transparency of government contract-
ing. Governments annually spend over US$9 trillion 
on procurement, at high risk of corruption, both in bid-
ding and during contract execution.78 E-procurement 
is technically easy to implement, yet, as described in 
chapter 3, developing countries have invested less in 
such systems than in the more complex budget and 
treasury systems—or have done so without the com-
plementary reforms to deliver results. E-procurement 
also has the potential to galvanize substantial support 
from the business community by reducing barriers to 
entry—since it expands the market to new entrants, 
including international fi rms—and by opening politi-
cal space for reform.

Digital technologies can also expand the range 
of actors that generate information, breaking the 
state’s monopoly in information provision. Because 
such information can be skewed toward the digitally 
savvy, it should be used where representativeness is 
not a requirement and the risks of manipulation are 
small, as with real-time information on emergencies

simplifi cation and customization in their e-services to 
foster greater collaboration with citizens.

Digital safeguards
Reforms to strengthen the analog complements can 
ensure a high social and economic return from digital 
investments. But downside risks remain. Large-scale 
collection of identifi able information creates privacy 
and security concerns. Automation changes work in 
ways that challenge existing social protections and 
reveal the inadequacy of existing labor laws. And 
scale economies create antitrust concerns. Digital 
safeguards that mitigate these risks become more 
important as the digital transformation proceeds (fi g-
ure 5.11). Competition and cybersafety are discussed 
elsewhere in this Report. This section focuses on 
another important safeguard for the digital economy, 
namely changes to social protection, taxation policy, 
and labor market institutions.

Digital technologies are accelerating job cre-
ation and job destruction, requiring a more fl exible 

misers” who engage in motivated reasoning. Their 
decision making is often automatic, and they are 
more likely to search for and absorb information that 
confi rms their priors rather than process new infor-
mation that does not.83 The private sector understands 
this and simplifi es and customizes the user experi-
ence to engage customers. Amazon’s search tool not 
only displays results the customer is looking for but 
also recommends other products based on the cus-
tomer’s browsing history and the purchasing trends 
of other customers. Transforming countries can learn 
from the private sector and embed these principles of

Box 5.13 Estonia’s X-Road 

Estonia’s X-Road is an internet-based e-government 
system that enables participating institutions, including 
private business, to communicate and exchange data.a 
It serves as a platform for application development by 
providing numerous common services to users, including 
query design, query tracking, and data visualization. Its 
open design is protected by digital authentication, multi-
level authorization, log monitoring, and encrypted data 
transfers. This collective process improves the user expe-
rience and motivates state institutions to develop digital 
services and people to tap into digital government services. 
The common goal is to shift activities from the physical 
world to the much more effi  cient digital realm.

X-Road’s utility is evident in its exponential growth. The 
system launched in 2003 with 10 participating institutions. 
By 2013, almost 900 had joined—70 percent are national 
or local government agencies, and the remainder private 
fi rms. The annual number of queries through X-Road rose 
from half a million to 340 million. In 2014, two-thirds of 

queries were automated system-to-system exchanges. 
The remaining one-third, about 113 million human queries, 
refl ects enormous demand for e-services from a population 
of only 1.3 million. 

The system’s main strength is that it is decentralized. 
Participating institutions retain ownership of their data, 
but can share it or access other institutions’ data as neces-
sary. Estonia’s Public Information Act prohibits institutions 
from requesting user information already stored in a data 
repository connected to the X-Road.b Thus the system’s 
architecture—coupled with complementary policies—has 
reduced the need for repetitive data entry, increased gov-
ernment effi  ciency, and reduced costs to users. If e-services 
are assumed to yield 30 minutes in time saved per inter-
action (for the service provider and the citizen) relative to 
predigital physical interaction, the number of applications 
in 2014 implies a savings of more than 7 million work days 
a year—5.4 work days for each citizen.

stringent hiring and fi ring practices.87 There are 
also implications for minimum wages, especially 
their growth path, if workers who earn close to the 
minimum wage are also in routine occupations sus-
ceptible to automation. Tax systems that rely heavily 
on taxing labor also make labor more expensive in 
relation to capital and could become unsustainable 
if wage employment falls. In-work benefi ts, such as 
income tax credits in the United States and the United 
Kingdom, are one mechanism for policy makers to 
make labor taxes more progressive while improving 
incentives to work and hire.88 

Digital technologies themselves can reduce non-
wage labor costs related to enforcement. In Brazil, 
the Annual Social Information report (digital records 
from social security with information about all work-
ers, their wages, their occupations, and the types of 
fi rms they work for) monitors compliance with the 
Apprentice Law and, increasingly, other labor laws.89 
Oman has a Worker Protection Scheme that allows for 
monitoring wage payments. Digital technologies can 
further reduce enforcement costs by shifting from 
top-down to bottom-up accountability, empowering 
workers and unions to convey complaints and vio-
lations and to resolve confl icts. In the United States, 
workers can anonymously fi le online complaints and 
requests for inspections of their workplace if they 
believe there is a serious hazard or labor law violation; 
they can get information about their rights.90 They 
can also check online whether their employers have 
paid their social security contributions. These tools 
increasing worker agency have the potential to bal-
ance the loss of bargaining power for workers in non-
traditional work arrangements, such as independent 
contractors in the gig economy, where many workers 
are freelancers or work online.

Balance the relaxation of job protections 
with stronger workers’ protections 
independent of work contracts 
Independent contracting, casual work, freelancing, 
and other new forms of work in online labor markets 
and the sharing economy challenge the foundations 
of most social protection and tax systems. In most 
countries, social insurance schemes—for pensions, 
unemployment, and health—are tied to a (formal) job, 
fi nanced through payroll taxes levied in the formal 
sector. 

The evolving nature of work increases the need 
to delink social insurance from the labor contract. 
Bolivia, Chile, and Costa Rica have been grappling 
with providing social insurance to noncontributing, 
nonwage, informal workers for a long time. Their 

workforce that responds to changing labor market 
demands. They are also facilitating new forms of non-
wage employment and work arrangements which, 
while adding fl exibility to fi rms and workers, can also 
erode traditional employer-employee relationships 
(chapter 2). This transformation of the world of work 
requires a rethink of social protection, tax systems, 
and labor market institutions. In incipient and tran-
sitioning countries, this agenda is less urgent, but 
it will be important to build systems appropriate 
for the 21st century and not to blindly adopt models 
designed by advanced countries for an industrial 
era.

Support technology adoption and level 
the playing fi eld between workers and 
technology
Labor regulations, labor taxation and institutions 
need to support, rather than impede, technology 
adoption by fi rms. They should also avoid making 
labor unduly expensive, especially for workers who 
compete more directly with digital technologies. 
Technology, by accelerating the pace of change in the 
labor market, can make existing labor regulations 
obsolete and delay fi rms’ adjustments.84 And tight 
labor regulations often apply to low-skilled workers,85 
increasing the incentives for fi rms to substitute low-
skilled workers with labor-saving technology, accen-
tuating the skill-bias of technological change. This 
appears to be the case globally.86 

Countries with unduly protective labor markets 
could be slowing their digital transformation, and 
distorting fi rms’ decisions to automate work. This 
is likely to affect countries that have particularly

experiences suggest that all individuals should be 
registered in the same social insurance system, 
regardless of where they work, with subsidies for the 
poor or low-wage earners, and with fi nancing coming 
from general revenues.91 

The labor market disruptions that accompany 
technological change increase the demands on active 
labor market policies and social assistance systems. 
The disruptions are likely to be greatest for workers 
in routine occupations. Some of them are going to 
need intermediation and retraining services to fi nd 
new jobs. Others, if they have diffi culties transition-
ing, may need social assistance. Recent technological 
changes are bringing to the fore discussions of a guar-
anteed basic income, especially in more advanced 
countries. And giving workers a stake in digital cap-
ital could diversify workers’ assets and reduce their 
costs of displacements—through pension funds, 
mutual funds, or even more directly in fi rms active in 
the digital economy.92

A solution is to protect workers rather than jobs, 
and to level the playing fi eld for regulations and tax-
ation across work contracts. If workers are protected 
outside their labor contract, regulations and taxes can 
be more lax across the board. A fi rst step is to do away 
with regulations that almost prohibit fl exible work 
arrangements. In Montenegro contracts for part-
time employment cannot be less than 10 hours per 
week.93 Another step is to reform tax systems that tax 
part-time work at higher per hour rates than full-time 
work. In Serbia, the reference wage (determining 
a minimum social contribution) is not adjusted for 
hours worked, so that social contributions are dispro-
portionately high for part-time workers.94 Reforms 
are also necessary in working time arrangements.95

 5. The fi rst stage (2000–05) of Rwanda’s National 

Information and Communication Infrastructure 
policy prepared the groundwork for the ICT sec-
tor. The second phase (2006–10) concentrated on 
enhancing ICT infrastructure. The third phase 
(2011–15) focused on improving service delivery. 
The fi nal phase (2016–20) is expected to concentrate 
on the enhancement of skills and development of 
the private sector and community. Instead of fi rst 
dealing with the supply-side issues and then the 
demand-side issues, developing countries would be 
better off by working to simultaneously strengthen

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

Reliable and affordable access to electricity services 
is fundamental to achieving the World Bank Group’s 
twin goals: shared prosperity and elimination of 
extreme poverty by 2030. Efforts to meet the Agenda 
2030 Sustainable Development Goal to “ensure access 
to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy 
for all” will also require increased investment, new 
and refi ned technologies and systems, and institu-
tional reform. To help the world achieve this energy 
transformation, the effective use of information and 
communication technology (ICT), including data and 
advanced analytics, is already playing an essential role. 

Changing energy business 
models with ICT
Providing electricity to the approximately 1 billion 
people without access to affordable and sustainable 
electricity services presents an enormous challenge 
and opportunity.1 In Sub-Saharan Africa, only 14 per-
cent of people have access to grid electricity; however, 
nearly 70 percent now have access to mobile phones.2 
By the end of the decade, it is estimated that nearly 
930 million people in Africa will own a mobile phone,3 
creating not only a huge demand for phone charging, 
but facilitating a variety of energy and other services 
through the use of mobile phones.

A potential symbiotic relationship therefore exists 
between the development of information and commu-
nication technologies and increasing energy access 
in Africa and other low-access areas. As an example, 
cell towers require a local power supply, but in many 

rural areas the surrounding communities lack access 
to electricity. Energy service companies in many parts 
of Africa have been oversizing the energy generation 
unit of the tower and providing local consumers with 
access to electricity. The Mobile for Development 
program of the Groupe Speciale Mobile Association 
(GSMA) explores such opportunities.4

To address some of the fi nancing challenges of 
rural energy services, companies in Africa and South 
Asia are leveraging ICT and sensors utilizing cellular 
networks through various fi nancing models.5 For 
example, in the same value chain all the way from 
electricity distribution to maintenance, ICT is being 
deployed through short message service (SMS) or 
voice interaction with clients to collect and analyze 
mobile data, facilitate mobile payment systems, and 
utilize applications that are increasingly enabled by 
the internet. These innovative products and services 
are facilitating a signifi cant increase in energy access 
globally. In East Africa alone, they have reached 14 mil-
lion people in six years. The average annual market 
growth is 140 percent, according to market research 
by the World Bank Group’s Lighting Africa Initiative.6 

In East Africa, falling costs of ICT and effi cient 
appliances have enabled off-grid photovoltaic (PV) 
systems to provide more energy services at a lower 
price. Instead of relying on traditional means of col-
lecting payments (with high transaction costs and 
losses), electricity bills can now be paid by cellphone 
through mobile money services such as M-Pesa. This 
approach also generates large amounts of data on 
mobile money transfers, and has helped to establish 
credit histories for a previously underserved segment 
of the population. Energy supply companies combine 
fi nancial information with geographic and census

data to identify new markets and to differentiate 
customers based on varying levels of service, thus 
allowing them to tailor the service to the customer’s 
ability to pay.

ICTs have also been deployed to reduce risks for 
suppliers and to facilitate after-sales service by tag-
ging energy systems (such as solar PV panels and bat-
teries) with sensors so that they can be tracked as they 
pass through distributors and are sold and installed. 
The sensors capture remote real-time data about the 
equipment, enabling the provider to monitor perfor-
mance and offer maintenance support. Companies 
like M-Kopa and Off Grid Electric in East Africa 
have call center agents that resolve most payment or 
service-related queries, while remaining service 
issues are addressed by a fl eet of technicians on 
motorcycles who are radio-dispatched. 

ICT, the smart grid, and 
demand management
Improved real-time information and automated con-
trols are increasing the effi ciency of the electricity grid 
all over the world. The “smart grid”—which has come 
to defi ne a broad range of sensors, meters, and con-
trols enabled by information technology (IT), as well as 
large-scale and real-time data collection—can enhance 
the operational effi ciency of the electricity system by 
optimizing energy transactions.7 The integration of 
ICT into the grid can improve system security through 
more rapid analysis of service interruptions and pre-
diction of outages. Connected devices and software 
offer customers access to real-time data to help them 
manage their energy usage more effectively, while 
advanced meters and automatic controls provide 
opportunities for energy effi ciency, such as automatic 
dimming of street lights, or turning off lights or air 
conditioning in unoccupied rooms and buildings.

Potentially one of the most revolutionary internet- 
based innovations in the electricity sector is the ability 
to adjust consumer demand by providing new signals 
and transparency. “Demand response” allows electric-
ity consumption to be reduced during peak periods 
based on agreed-upon reductions in power supply. 
For example, consumers agree to minor reductions 
in air-conditioning demand during summer peaks in 
exchange for a rate cut. This helps increase system 
reliability, reduce energy supply costs, and lower gen-
eration investments due to the reduced need for oper-
ational reserves. The International Energy Agency 
(IEA) estimates the savings potential for demand 
response programs in competitive markets at 15 to 

20 percent of peak demand.8 So far, such systems 
have been introduced largely in advanced economies 
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) and emerging economies. But 
the development of low-cost sensors that will increas-
ingly be factory-installed in all electrical appliances 
(televisions, refrigerators, fans, air conditioners) will 
allow both the monitoring and control of electricity 
use by consumers and electricity suppliers.9

One of the biggest challenges for the power sector 
of the future is the need to “balance” electricity gen-
eration and load on a particular grid. The growth of 
variable renewable energy is creating new challenges 
for planners and power system operators, who must 
rely on other sources of supply when the sun goes 
down or the wind stops blowing. Predicting such 
variations in energy production is challenging. In 
combination with (more predictable) demand vari-
ations, it can lead to deviations in power frequency 
and power system reliability issues, and increase the 
need for grid balancing assets, such as fast-ramping 
gas power plants or electric storage.10 Research by 
the IEA shows that renewable energy costs can be 
reduced signifi cantly through new forecasting and 
digital technologies that can help balance generation 
and load by monitoring and predicting the supply of 
variable energy resources.11 In countries and regions 
with growing shares of renewable energy such as Cal-
ifornia, Denmark, and Germany, electricity markets 
are now designed to match supply and demand on a 
minute-by-minute basis through sophisticated auc-
tions, regulatory mechanisms, and control systems 
that rely on the internet.12

Energy, open data, and the 
internet
Having high-quality, easily accessible information 
on energy resources, demand, and usage is crucial to 
supporting the formulation of government policies, 
and can be a catalyst for commercial investment. 
Just as the existence of high-quality geological data 
is an imperative for fossil fuel licensing and explo-
ration, publicly available data on renewable energy 
resources is one of the fi rst steps a country can take 
to encourage investment. ICT facilitates this resource 
assessment and mapping through the use of super-
computers to analyze years of historical meteorologi-
cal and satellite data, by facilitating the transmission 
of measurement data from fi eld-based instruments, 
and by supporting the wide dissemination of outputs 
through open data platforms. 



290 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

A recent trend in the United States is the provision 
of anonymous energy use and performance data that 
can support energy effi ciency markets and services.13 
The industry-led Green Button Initiative in the United 
States is another voluntary industry data standard for 
utilities and companies; it allows consumers to make 
their energy consumption data available to service 
providers, which can help consumers lower their 
energy bills or “green” their energy supply through 
home energy effi ciency solutions or the design and 
fi nancing of renewable energy equipment. Since 
2012, more than 50 utilities and electricity suppliers 
have signed on to the initiative, providing over 60 mil-
lion homes access to their detailed energy use data.14 
In India, a pilot project launched by Prayas Energy 
Group, a nongovernment organization, has installed 
around 100 devices in volunteers’ homes to measure 
the availability and quality of electricity on a continu-
ous basis.15 The results provide a potentially powerful, 
crowdsourced fl ow of information that can help con-
sumers understand the causes and impacts of power 
shortages, and can help policy makers and utility 
companies prioritize power system investments. 

Given the rapid growth of the ICT industry, there 
has been an increased focus on how much energy the 
sector uses. Recent estimates of energy use by ICT—
split almost equally into energy use by communica-
tion networks, computers, and data centers—show 
that the sector accounts for between 3 and 4 percent 
of total global electricity consumption, and that 
energy consumption increased around 7 percent per 
year between 2007 and 2012.16 While a breakdown of 
how much of this increased demand came from devel-
oping countries is not readily available, this share is 
likely signifi cant, as more than 750 million new users 
have been added in China and India alone since 2000. 
There are many ways to reduce the energy use from 
the ICT industry, including moving to faster systems. 
For example, 2G networks (which are common in 
developing countries) require over 400 kilowatt-hours 
(kWh) of electricity per year to deliver 12 gigabytes 
(GB) of data (1 GB per month), while a 3G network con-
sumes less than one-tenth that amount (35 kWh), and 
a 4G network uses one-sixtieth (7 kWh).17 In addition, 
the industry is exploring new technologies, includ-
ing microtracing—a new, leaner technology for fi ber 
access that uses less energy. However, many of these 
gains are offset by ever rising volumes of data. 

While it is too early to judge the overall impact of 
digital technologies on the energy sector, especially 
in developing countries, it is clear that many of the 
trends described above will continue to affect energy 
consumers and suppliers. Ensuring that benefi ts and 

synergies are maximized will be critical to meeting 
the sustainable energy goals of the World Bank’s cli-
ent countries.

Third is providing global public goods—including

These are complex and diffi cult challenges requiring

more inclusive, more informed, and more effi cient?

Internet governance
We reject: kings, presidents, and voting. We believe in: 

rough consensus and running code.

—David Clark, computer scientist and internet pioneer1 

From its beginnings, the internet has always been 
different from the networks that preceded it—tele-
phone, radio, television, and cable. It was founded 
as a research network, explicitly noncommercial for 
the fi rst few decades of its existence, and designed as 
a radically decentralized network. As a result, it has 
been governed more like a federation of networks, 
in some respects like a Republic of Users.2 But the 
pragmatic libertarian ideology of the internet’s 
founders is under assault by the commercial and 
political interests of its other stakeholders, mainly 
large corporations and nation-states. The growing 
commercialization of user data by private businesses 
and mass surveillance by states, including many sov-
ereigns accustomed to greater state control over their 
citizens, have gradually eroded the trust the internet 
once enjoyed. This has given rise to widely disparate 
views on how to govern the internet.

The internet’s growing popularity has increased 
the need to manage its worldwide operation. 
Whereas less than 2 percent of phone calls cross 
borders, between 60 and 75 percent of internet traffi c 
is international (depending on the country). Despite 

Data, spam, disease, poverty, commerce, rivers, 
and polluted air—all cross borders and touch many 
people. And all can be better managed if people and 
nations cooperate. The internet is both a subject of 
cooperation and a new tool to facilitate cooperation 
in other realms. This chapter explores its potential for 
boosting three forms of cooperation.

First is governing the internet. The internet requires 
technical coordination and harmonized standards 
to ensure its smooth operation worldwide. Wher-
ever you are, when you click or tap on http://www
.worldbank.org/wdr2016, a message goes out from 
your device, initiating processes to discover which of 
the millions of servers on earth corresponds to that 
address. Information is handed off from network to 
network and perhaps from satellite to cable to Wi-Fi, 
ending up on your screen. That nanomiracle depends 
on the consensual and universal use of protocols for 
data transmission and on a legal system that deter-
mines who has the right to use the “worldbank.org” 
address. Less consensus exists about how to deal 
with cross-border issues such as suppressing viruses 
and spam, or defi ning and enforcing rights to pri-
vacy, while ensuring cybersecurity and combating 
cybercrime (see chapter 4). As technology and its uses 
evolve rapidly together, who decides how the internet 
is structured and run?

Second is facilitating cross-border exchanges of goods 
and services. During the last two decades or more, 
countries have worked out trade agreements to 
collect duties and taxes and to enforce intellectual 
property rights (IPRs): patents, copyrights, and trade-
marks. Many of these agreements are poorly adapted 
for the world of the internet because intellectual 
property can be duplicated and disseminated with 
little or no cost, and purely digital goods and services 
can now cross borders without customs inspections. 
The increasingly frictionless ease of transacting busi-
ness can be stymied by 19th-century procedures for

two phases in 2003 (Geneva) and 2005 (Tunis). The 
summit confi rmed that “management of the internet 
encompasses both technical and public policy issues 
and should involve all stakeholders.”7 As described 
in its agenda, the groups of stakeholders with an 
interest in internet governance include governments, 
private fi rms, civil society, intergovernmental and 
international organizations, academia, and the tech-
nical community (box 6.1). 

The MSM label refl ects the diverse actors that 
form the loose de facto framework for internet gover-
nance. For example, one of these stakeholders is the 
Internet Engineering Task Force, a loose affi liation of 
engineers that is in charge of the protocols that run the 
internet. Another is ICANN, the Internet Corporation 
for Assigned Names and Numbers, a California not-
for-profi t corporation that performs certain technical 
functions on the internet—such as running root serv-
ers (the computers that control traffi c on the internet) 
and administering the system of domain names (.com, 
.org, .gov). But not all stakeholders feel equally repre-
sented within the current governance framework.

The internet unites people; its governance 
divides nations
Politicians and regulators are increasingly concerned 
about their inputs into the future governance of the 
internet.8 Their concerns may be justifi ed (fi gure 6.1): 

•  The rapid and unprecedented growth of the inter-
net has meant that it has evolved from an American 
technology to a critical global infrastructure in a 
very short period. This has given rise to an unstated 
power struggle between its traditional stakeholders 
and many new ones, especially some developing 
country governments, which feel left out of the 
discussion.

•  The bulk of internet nonusers are in developing 
countries—4.2 billion people, more than half the 
world, have no internet access, and 5.1 billion are 
not on social media. Their interests, some argue, 
are best promoted by their national governments.

•  Mass collection of user data by private businesses 
and unwarranted surveillance by governments 
have eroded trust and fed growing skepticism 
about the current governance arrangement.

•  Increasing use of social media and unhindered 
access to all content, which is generally thought to 
be a positive development, can clash with local cul-
tural norms and social practices, prompting some 
governments to advocate a more activist approach 
to govern the internet.

its virtual qualities, it has an elaborate physical infra-
structure that spans the globe. As a global resource, it 
requires some degree of international coordination to 
function. Information fl owing through the internet 
has transboundary repercussions, raising other issues 
for international debate and discussion. To address 
these issues, the United Nations–authorized Work-
ing Group on Internet Governance defi ned internet 
governance as “the development and application by 
governments, the private sector, and civil society, in 
their respective roles, of shared principles, norms, 
rules, decision-making procedures, and programs 
that shape the evolution and use of the Internet.”3 

How is the internet governed?
The main attributes of the global internet are that it is 
distributed, decentralized, fl exible, multilayered, and 
end-to-end.4 Not a monolith, it is instead a mosaic of 
separate but interrelated infrastructure, applications, 
actors, and decisions. Consequently, its governance 
is likewise not unitary but consists of an ecology of 
decisions and decision makers. Internet governance 
features are different from those in telecommunica-
tions, characterized by a multilateral system. 

The governance framework for the internet is 
considerably more diverse than that of the telecom 
sector. The policy, legal, and regulatory framework for 
information and communication technologies (ICTs) 
has shifted since the start of the millennium. Then 
it was primarily about the technical and economic 
regulation of more liberalized and competitive tele-
communications infrastructure and services envi-
ronment—along an arc with the state at the center 
of the policy and regulatory piece and state-licensed 
operators orbiting around it. Now it is a much more 
complex, multifarious, and loose amalgam of policies, 
laws, and actors having their origins in constitutional 
rights, criminal justice, and technical and economic 
regulation. This new framework also involves non-
state actors, national, regional, and even multilateral 
agents—each with an interest in the wide-ranging 
and diverse aspects of what has come to be known as 
the internet governance framework.

The prevailing model of internet governance con-
tinues to evolve to include its key stakeholders. The 
multistakeholder model (MSM) refl ects the notion 
that better policies and outcomes can be achieved if 
those affected are part of a policy consultation pro-
cess;5 it also refers to the range of actors running, 
administering, and governing the internet.6 The 
term came into popular use as a result of the UN’s 
World Summit on the Information Society, held in

295GLOBAL COOPERATION

More recently, a new approach to revive the multi-
lateral model arose in an attempt by the membership 
of the International Telecommunication Union 
(ITU) to update the International Telecommunica-
tion Regulations (ITRs) at the World Conference on 
International Telecommunications (WCIT) in Dubai 
in 2012. Measures aimed at regulating privacy and 
free speech were introduced in a special codicil in 
the regulations. This resulted in a clear split between 
89 countries that approved the new draft and 80 that 
maintained reservations (map 6.1).12 Although it was 
expected that these issues might have been taken 
up at the ITU Plenipotentiary in Busan, Republic of 
Korea, in 2014, they were not and remain unresolved.

A key point of contention for countries favoring a 
multilateral approach is the U.S. government’s over-
sight of IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Author-
ity).13 The MLM would like to see an IANA transition 
to an intergovernmental body, like the ITU. The 
MSM, especially the United States, insists on further 
autonomy of ICANN and IANA. In March 2014, the 
U.S. Department of Commerce announced a process 
to relinquish its oversight over certain technical 
functions performed by IANA to the multistakeholder 
community—in shorthand, the IANA transition, orig-
inally scheduled to be completed by September 2015.14 
A key condition of the IANA transition is that over-
sight of the technical functions would not be ceded 
to a government or group of governments, but to the 
multistakeholder community.

•  More countries are asserting national policy and 
regulation over areas (mainly around content) that 
they feel the existing governance structure is not 
addressing.9

As a result, support for the MSM is not unani-
mous. Tension between the MSM and a multilateral 
model (MLM) that puts governance responsibility 
predominantly in the hands of nation-states has 
arisen many times since the World Summit embraced 
MSM. Some governments worry about surrendering 
sovereignty or asserting national jurisdiction over 
internet activities within their borders. In September 
2011, China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, and 
Uzbekistan jointly submitted a draft resolution to 
the UN General Assembly on an International Code 
of Conduct for Information Security outlining their 
vision of governing the internet.10 

The promoters of MSM argue that state control 
of the internet would not leave space for the range 
of players currently involved in internet governance 
and could pave the way to suppression of privacy 
and rights of free expression—say, in the name of 
national security (table 6.1). Without the checks and 
balances available through the MSM, abuses might 
increase. The UN has asserted that rights already 
protected in the real world—the right to privacy 
and the right to communicate (to receive and impart 
information)—are to be protected in the virtual 
world.11

 evolution.15 The MSM model is evolving, and that 
is one of its great strengths. However, care should 
be taken to ensure respect for principles of good 
governance (including transparency, accountability, 
inclusiveness, and representativeness); safeguard 
meaningful dialogue among stakeholders; empower 
stakeholders to participate effectively across groups; 
and prevent capture by special interests.16 According to 
one recent survey in 24 countries, the MSM is also the 
preferred governance model of end users (fi gure 6.2). 
It is therefore likely that a multistakeholder format—
one that addresses the concerns over the digital divide 
and trust and use of the internet; provides meaningful 
forums for “left out” stakeholders; and balances uni-
versal community acceptance with appropriate local 
fl exibility—could be the accepted way forward. 

Protecting the interests of users is 
paramount
This inability of internet stakeholders to reach a 
consensus on future governance mechanisms could 
be costly. The lingering uncertainty is likely to affect 
the private sector’s long-term investment planning. 
Delay in agreeing on new protocols and standards 
could slow the pace of innovation. Some have even 
suggested that the internet is at risk of being split, so 
that the world ends up with several local internets—
Google CEO Eric Schmidt calls it the splitnet—destroy-
ing the essential global character of the internet.

The new governance structure of the internet 
needs to accurately refl ect the plurality and the mul-
tifarious nature of internet actors and be fl exible 
enough to accommodate its rapid and continuous

their peers in the rest of the world. Digital transac-
tions will continue to increase as the number of goods 
and services offered online increases. For example, 
with the introduction of online music stores in many 
developed countries in 2004, digital music started to 
gain a share of global music sales—from 2 percent in 
2004 to 46 percent in 2014.17 Access to a global market 
can be particularly advantageous to fi rms in small, 
island, and landlocked countries, as well as for coun-
tries with small populations, where the size of the 
local market is often constraining growth. 

Digital trade is potentially global in scope, but bar-
riers to digital integration prevent fi rms from reach-
ing appropriate scale (box 6.2). Issues such as trade 
logistics and infrastructure, online payment systems, 
and trade barriers can be handled by national govern-
ments (chapter 5). But cross-border issues affecting 
digital trade need international coordination. Indeed, 
the internet’s ability to seamlessly deliver digital 
goods and services around the world is considerably 
impeded by various regulations that could be stream-
lined through greater international cooperation. The 
two main cross-border issues are barriers to data fl ows 
and uncoordinated intellectual property rights regime.

Box 6.2 European Union: A fragmented market for digital products

Despite being a single market with a free fl ow of goods, 
services, and people for many decades, the European Union 
(EU) still functions like a fragmented market for digital 
goods and services. Consumers and fi rms face diffi  culties 
in engaging in the digital economy. 

Consumers in the EU prefer to shop from online stores 
that are within their national borders. While 44 percent 
of consumers made an online purchase from a domestic 
business in 2014, only 15 percent did so from a business in 
another EU country.a The consumers may have concerns 
about payment security, product quality, or the reliability 
of the sellers located in another country (fi gure B6.2.1). 
Moreover, consumers in the EU face diff erent prices for the 
same online goods and services because of the practice 
of geoblocking, in which services and prices are limited 

to a geographic location. Consumers are directed to their 
local websites, where they face diff erent prices from online 
retailers based on their location. Content like video is also 
restricted within a single geographic location. 

Firms within the EU also face many diffi  culties in selling 
their goods and services online in other EU markets. Firms 
engaging in e-commerce face high and uneven cross- 
border delivery charges, which are passed on to consumers. 
For example, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Malmo, Sweden, 
are separated only by an 8-kilometer bridge, but a package 
sent from Copenhagen to Malmo costs €27 whereas a pack-
age sent from Malmo to Copenhagen costs €42.b Moreover, 
fi rms face large costs to adapt to various national laws, and 
believe that the costs outweigh the benefi ts of setting up a 
website (fi gure B6.2.2).

on data fl owing back and forth as users retrieve and 
update information directly on the servers. Barriers 
to data fl ows will force fi rms to relocate tasks and 
operations, change their information technology (IT) 
architecture, engage a different supplier, or discon-
tinue services to customers. These barriers disrupt 
two of the most important business trends facilitated 
by the internet: the fragmentation of production into 
global value chains, and the creation of offshore ser-
vice hubs like the business-processing operations in 
India or the Philippines. 

The estimated effects of barriers to cross-border 
data fl ows are signifi cant. An economic simulation 
conducted by the European Centre for International 
Political Economy (ECIPE) considers the proposed 
or enacted legislation on data fl ows in six develop-
ing countries and the EU and calculates the costs of 
regulations on businesses.19 The countries examined 
are proposing a mix of regulations in their legislative 
packages that will impose stricter privacy regula-
tions, such as the right to be forgotten and the con-
sent to transfer data to a third party (table 6.2). The 
study fi nds that these laws can reduce gross domestic 
product (GDP) by up to 1.7 percent, investments up to 
4.2 percent, and exports by 1.7 percent (fi gure 6.5).20 

The argument to remove all barriers to data fl ows, 
however, is not as clear-cut as the arguments to 
remove barriers to cross-border trade and investment. 
Government regulations to place data servers in the 
country or to prevent information from being shared 
across borders can stem from legitimate concerns 
about privacy and security for their citizens’ infor-
mation. Countries may believe that imposing data 
localization and privacy requirements will allow them 
to better protect the data in their country. But it is not 
always clear whether the data are more secure in a 
local data server or in a dedicated secure server over-
seas. Moreover, data localization requirements might 
threaten the progress of new technologies that depend 
on unhindered cross-border data fl ows such as the 
internet of things, “big data,” and cloud computing. 

While countries may have legitimate reasons to 
impose barriers to data fl ows, these barriers should 
not be a disguised method to impede trade and eco-
nomic activities. By imposing barriers on data fl ows, 
countries may mistakenly believe that they can 
encourage domestic data-driven sectors, like cloud 
service providers. Such policies are akin to import 
substitution strategies, which have had a mixed 
record. Moreover, the barriers should not treat fi rms 
differently according to their ownership, as that 
would reduce competition and slow down digital 
adoption in the rest of the economy (chapter 1).

requirements have emerged as substantial obstacles to 
trade (fi gure 6.3). Many of these fi rms operate globally 
and have business models that depend on free access 
to data about their users.

In contrast to industry preferences for open data 
fl ows, many countries are beginning to insist that data 
should reside within their national borders—often 
referred to as “data nationalism”—and are imposing 
barriers on cross-border fl ows of data. So-called data 
localization requirements require fi rms to locate data 
servers and data centers within the country to store 
and process the information. Other countries have 
strict regulations about data leaving their borders to 
protect privacy, refl ecting the preference of their citi-
zens, as users become more cautious and risk averse 
to how their data are being used for commercial gains 
(fi gure 6.4). Barriers to data fl ows can affect trade more 
than an increase in tariffs: they can prevent fi rms from 
entering or operating in a sector, while tariff rates 
merely impose an additional cost to operations that 
can be absorbed by the fi rm or passed on to customers.

Cross-border data fl ows, which are essential to 
international trade, are a substantial portion of data 
traffi c, comprising about 16–25 percent of U.S. data 
traffi c and 13–16 percent of European data traffi c.18 
Cross-border data fl ows are likely to increase with 
the increasing use of cloud computing, which relies

301GLOBAL COOPERATION

Setting global standards on data exchange 
Standard setting can be another tool to reap digital 
dividends. Data exchange standards, for instance, can 
greatly facilitate cross-border services and enable a 
seamless fl ow of information (see spotlight 5, “The 
data revolution”). Various ongoing initiatives look at 
setting data exchange standards in certain sectors at 
the international level. The standard should also be 
open, and use publicly available platforms and soft-
ware, so that it does not exclude fi rms. One example 
is the GS1 system of standards used in transport and 

While these barriers remain, developing coun-
tries participating in global markets should ensure 
that they are not excluded because of weak or absent 
regulations. At a minimum, countries should enact 
data protection regulations following internationally 
recognized principles so that multinational compa-
nies do not avoid the country because of uncertainty 
about compliance and trust in the handling of data.21 
For example, the EU allows personal data to leave its 
borders if countries have “adequate” protection for 
personal data. Australia allows data to leave its bor-
ders only to those jurisdictions with substantially 
similar levels of privacy protection. However, these 
regulations continue to evolve, and countries must 
constantly adapt to such changes to reduce the uncer-
tainty and compliance costs on companies.22

Recognizing the importance of cross-border data 
fl ows, many countries have agreed on basic princi-
ples to coordinate their data regulations, as with the 
recently revised Privacy Guidelines and Declaration 
on Cross-Border Data Flows by the Organisation of 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), or 
the Privacy Framework of the Asia-Pacifi c Economic 
Cooperation (APEC). Other efforts focus on ensuring 
that companies that move data across borders have 
rigorous internal policies to maintain the privacy and 
protection of the data. In the absence of international 
coordination on privacy rules, other solutions are 
being sought that rely on companies’ internal policies 
to protect privacy, such as the EU’s Binding Corporate 
Rules and APEC’s Cross-Border Privacy Rules. While 
these programs help facilitate cross-border data fl ows, 
the rules may be too cumbersome for most fi rms and 
implicitly benefi t larger fi rms.23

markets. Firms must seek recognition and enforce-
ment in each jurisdiction. Similarly, if a fi rm wants to 
use an IPR it does not own to produce a digital good 
or service, it must apply for licenses in each country 
in which it wants to sell. While there are international 
treaties governing recognition and protection across 
member countries, each jurisdiction has different 
rules and requirements, depending on the type of IPR. 
Navigating these IPR regimes is confusing and creates 
large administrative costs for fi rms. These costs can 
even prevent fi rms from entering new markets. 

Firms operating in the global market face huge 
costs to apply and use IPRs across borders. For exam-
ple, in order to protect an IPR, a separate patent appli-
cation is needed in each country where protection is 
sought. A patent application that is valid in the EU 
costs at least fi ve times more than an application in 
the United States.26 The scattered nature of the IPR 
regime can add complications for fi rms when they 
need to identify the rights holders and construct a 
new business model. In particular, the fi rm offering 
a digital good or service over the internet needs to 
apply for a copyright license, patent, or trademark 
in each market it serves, and then must be ready to 
enforce it under each national regime. The complex-
ity and costs of doing so can discourage new market 
entrants. Only larger fi rms will be able to bear those 
costs and reap the benefi ts from the internet. 

Countries should make it easier for fi rms to 
protect their intellectual property rights, thus stim-
ulating more innovation and creative sectors. The 
regulation process to apply for intellectual property 
licenses should also be harmonized and streamlined. 
The Patent Cooperation Treaty allows fi rms to fi le an 
international patent application, but this just creates 
a standardized application for the fi rm that must still 
be submitted to national authorities. Going one step 
further would be preferable. For instance, under the 
World Intellectual Property Organization’s Madrid 
Protocol, fi rms need only register their trademark in 
any signatory country and it will be protected across 
member countries. Similarly, it should be easier for 
fi rms to obtain licenses to certain IPRs that will allow 
them to operate globally. The availability of an online 
licensing system for intellectual property rights can 
reduce the administrative burden to fi rms.

National IPR regimes should extend beyond the 
laws defi ning and protecting the intellectual property 
(IP). Countries need a broader public sector IP strategy, 
which considers how policies and regulations in tax, 
education, science, technology, and industrial policies 
can not only make it easier for fi rms to protect their 
IPRs but also help to stimulate innovation and creative 

logistics. The GS1 assigns a global unique number 
so that any fi rm can identify and share product data 
with its trading partners. The number allows anyone 
to trace the origins of the product up the supply chain 
and track its movement downstream. 

Data exchange standards are being promoted in 
the context of Open Data by international organiza-
tions. Examples include the Comprehensive Knowl-
edge Archive Network’s (CKAN) standards—already 
adopted by more than 40 governments and organiza-
tions, such as the governments of the United Kingdom 
and Uruguay and the EU—and the Open Data portals 
for Africa and Bermuda. Progress has also been made 
in developing data exchange standards for geospatial 
information (such as the EU INSPIRE directive) in the 
electricity sector, particularly for smart grids, and in 
the health sector.

Countries should consider joining ongoing 
international efforts for standard setting for data 
exchange, and expanding them to other areas, at least 
for critical sectors. Data exchange standards, however, 
are not a silver bullet; they need to be accompanied by 
appropriate policies and actions to have some effect 
on the digital market. For e-freight, the International 
Air Transport Association (IATA) has been working on 
setting data exchange standards and has identifi ed 
actions that need to be in place for these initiatives to 
succeed.24 One is the requirement that public institu-
tions (such as customs for e-freight) accept electronic 
documentation as an alternative to paper-based docu-
mentation. Another is that all relevant actors need to 
be involved and act in a coordinated fashion (such as 
customs, security, and transportation). And third is an 
end-to-end supply chain vision and e-document, as 
well as common business processes that are aligned 
with international standard-setting bodies such as 
the World Customs Organization, the United Nations 
Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business, 
and the International Civil Aviation Organization. 

Better coordination of intellectual 
property rights regime
The internet allows people to purchase products and 
access vast amounts of content and information, 
whether protected by intellectual property rights (IPRs) 
or not, leading to allegations of IPR infringements. IPR 
infringement presents a risk to consumers who might 
purchase counterfeit goods, and a disincentive for 
fi rms and artists to create new products and content.25 
National IPR regimes allow fi rms to protect and use 
their intellectual property. But having different IPR 
regimes and multiple IPR registrations, in different 
countries creates problems for fi rms selling in global

succeed over the resistance of those who benefi t 
when information is tightly held? 

•  Mustering global information for global goods. Global 
weather and water data are costly to gather but 
now almost costless to distribute. They take on the 
character of a global public good. Information on 
weather affecting mountain headwaters helps peo-
ple prepare for fl oods or harvests half a continent 
away. New technologies make it easier to assemble 
and analyze this information. But who will pay for 
it? And can countries agree to share it with their 
downstream and downwind neighbors?

Table 6.3 and fi gure 6.6 map these information 
needs onto the landscape of development spending. 
Some projects are characterized by geographic dis-
persion, sensitivity to local environmental and social 
context, and an inherent need for adaptive implemen-
tation. These activities could benefi t greatly from rich 
and rapid feedback. Another class of funding involves 
investments in big infrastructure systems or sup-
port for government policies. Here, fi ne-grained and 
timely information—on everything from poverty to 
water consumption to service delivery—could sup-
port better decisions on system design and operation. 
This section explores the potential scope of these ben-
efi ts and the largely institutional challenges in attain-
ing them. The discussion is unavoidably speculative. 

Getting wired for feedback—more 
inclusive, better, faster data to guide 
development projects
Feedback on what is working and what is not enables 
more nimble and effective implementation. In the 
past, feedback has been thin, slow, and unreliable. 
Now the technical barriers to better feedback have 
been overcome. But often organizational inertia pre-
vents the benefi ts of innovative technologies from 
being achieved. Revamped structures and incentives 
point to possible ways forward. 

Lack of feedback hampers development 
eff orts
Development agencies committed US$6.8 trillion in 
project assistance from 1947 to 2012. One would not 
expect these projects to be universally successful. 
Development is inherently complex, and develop-
ment agencies venture into areas that others would 
not; a high success rate would indicate unambitious 
objectives. But there is room for improvement in the 
performance of international foundations, donors, and 
lenders, whether bilateral or multilateral. About one-
third of the recent projects of international fi nancial 

sectors and benefi t the public interest. The availability 
of an online licensing system for IPRs can reduce the 
administrative burden to fi rms. Such an online licens-
ing system requires international coordination and an 
agreement among many countries. Countries can also 
allow the concept of “fair use” in intellectual property 
regulations that permits an individual or business to 
use the IPR for purposes such as research and educa-
tion, journalism, and library activities. 

Leveraging information for 
sustainable development
Eliminating global poverty and heading off planetary 
environmental threats are two of the world’s great-
est challenges. The costs of action are in the trillions 
of dollars, making global cooperation essential. But 
development assistance represents only 0.6 percent of 
developing country income. How can donors, devel-
opment agencies, nongovernmental organizations 
(NGOs), and international organizations hope to make 
a difference? They can use digital technologies to 
deploy funds and knowledge more effi ciently and to 
include more people in the process. They can do so in 
three ways:

•  Getting wired for feedback. Development projects are 
often very sensitive to context and have no standard 
blueprints. They could be more relevant if their 
design and implementation drew on local knowl-
edge. Projects could be more successful if wired for 
rapid feedback, allowing continuous improvement 
by implementers and more effective supervision by 
funders. National-level policies could be fi ne-tuned 
with early information on whether poor people 
were benefi ting. Digital technologies can make 
these feedback processes much cheaper and easier. 
But can stodgy organizations and their partners 
become nimble users of feedback?

•  Taking information to scale: information as an input. 
Decision makers from villages to capitals lack the 
information they need to optimize their actions. 
Farmers could better manage their fi elds with 
timely information about weather, pests, and mar-
kets. Ministries could better fi ght poverty with 
up-to-date information about where poor people 
live and their constraints. Land markets and envi-
ronmental protection could be more effi cient with 
accessible information about the condition and 
ownership of land. New technologies make it pos-
sible to widely and cheaply distribute all this infor-
mation, supporting better outcomes. But can this

 outcome and the quality of its M&E is stunning. Fig-
ure 6.8 (based on data from the World Bank, the only 
offi cial donor agency that publishes this informa-
tion in this detail) shows that the few projects with 
high-quality M&E are almost all rated “satisfactory” 
or “highly satisfactory” in outcome; the larger number 
with “negligible” M&E are mostly rated “moderately 
unsatisfactory” or worse. Evaluations suggest a strong 
causal link: a good M&E system supports clear for-
mulation of objectives, and M&E detects and solves 
problems in implementation.29 Despite this, an OECD 
survey30 of 28 donors fi nds pervasive shortcomings in 
their M&E systems. A majority of the donors report 
incomplete results frameworks, diffi culty in tracking 
outcomes, and a view by partners that a results frame-
work is a formal requirement rather than a useful 
tool. Feedback loops are reportedly lacking. NGOs 
echo these views. Many donor staff and recipients see 
M&E as a burdensome “extractive industry,” generat-
ing information that satisfi es some distant funder’s 
accountability requirements but does not serve the 
needs of project managers or benefi ciaries. 

Worse: learning is slow. The multilateral develop-
ment banks have independent evaluation units for 
both accountability and for learning—an important 
source of objective feedback. But these units do not 

institutions are deemed unsuccessful by the institu-
tions themselves (fi gure 6.7). What goes wrong?

Critics paint development practice as infl exible, 
ineffective, and out of touch.27 Too much emphasis 
on spending rather than on results, they say. Project 
designs are cooked up by development experts and 
government offi cials, in this view, and often do not 
refl ect local preferences, insights, or political realities. 
They can be further hampered by lack of rigorous, 
systematic learning about the success or failure of 
prior projects. Without reliable information on proj-
ect effectiveness, fl ashy bad ideas go viral while subtle 
good ones languish. With such poor design, projects 
can go off the rails. And if they do, there is often no 
fast channel for feedback and course correction.

A combination of rigid design and poor feed-
back might be particularly lethal for “complex” and 
context- sensitive projects, where workable solutions 
require experimentation.28 Consider health services, 
where success depends on changing the culturally 
rooted behavior of clients and staff—or watershed 
management, where social and environmental condi-
tions vary from one valley to the next.

Yet there is a paradox: monitoring and evalua-
tion (M&E) improves performance, but agencies 
under invest in it. The correlation between a project’s

improvements, and helped shape the revised national 
watershed guidelines.

Computer-assisted surveying—by mobile phone 
or by tablet-wielding fi eld agents—now enables much 
faster and more reliable assembly and use of informa-
tion on the progress of projects. A nascent example is 
the Social Observatory, a pilot that embeds a variety of 
feedback systems into a multibillion dollar program 
on rural livelihoods—precisely the kind of complex 
program noted earlier. The Observatory fi elds rigor-
ous but slow randomized controlled trials to deter-
mine whether particular phases or elements of the 
program had the desired impact. It supports internet-
connected management information systems, wired 
from the village up, that allow program managers at 
the district or state level to detect and correct anom-
alies in performance. Perhaps most interesting, it 
supports a benefi ciary-designed survey, administered 

have resources to review every project in depth. They 
also focus on after-the-fact evaluations to avoid con-
fl icts of interest. This slows feedback: at the World 
Bank, the average lag between project approval and 
evaluation is 7.5 years.

Technology enables feedback for agile 
implementation and learning
New technology should make M&E even faster, 
cheaper, and more effective. A poster-child example 
is the World Bank–backed Sujala project in Karna-
taka, India, which employed a technology-intensive 
M&E system operated by the Indian Space Research 
Organisation.31 This combined remote-sensing imag-
ery with household surveys and sophisticated data 
systems for management and geographic informa-
tion. Detecting that benefi ts were not being focused 
on the poorest groups, the project fi xed the problem. 
It rigorously demonstrated a 24-percent increase

International Academy in Kenya monitors teacher 
and student performance, allowing management 
to intervene when teachers, students, or schools are 
underperforming (see chapter 3). Bus rapid transport 
systems can automatically monitor vehicle speed and 
ridership, tracking maintenance, capacity use, and 
responses to weather. Health systems can track use 
and outcomes if patients and providers use digital 
ID cards to log services. Remote sensing can track 
program impacts on agriculture, water use, deforesta-
tion reduction, or air pollution. Ground sensors can 
track the sustainability of infrastructure in remote 
and confl ict-affected areas, as in Afghanistan and 
Pakistan. These systems offer rich, representative, 
actionable real-time information.

Organizational inertia impedes agile, 
feedback-intensive approaches
 These techniques are technically feasible, but are they 
organizationally feasible? One obstacle is a skills gap, 
but this can be remedied through training. Obstacles 
posed by incentives are more formidable. First, donor 
agencies, their staff, and their recipients are often 
focused more on maximizing disbursements than on 
optimizing results. Disbursements are more imme-
diately linked to organizational power and survival, 
and have traditionally been much easier to track and 
manage. 

Second, organizations cling to procedures that 
assume that projects can be thoroughly planned in 
advance and in detail. According to an OECD survey, 
“Development practitioners report being constrained 
by rigid results frameworks that are not fl exible 
enough to include new sets of information to adapt to

learning. Many private companies, and some devel-
opment agencies such as the Bangladeshi-based 
development organization BRAC, already have cul-
tures that do this. For others, culture change will be 
a challenge. Traditional and nontraditional agencies 
are experimenting with ways to make their business 
more agile—ways that are untried and carry risks as 
well as promise.

One approach concentrates on inclusion—bring-
ing in feedback and ideas at the design stage so as 
to combine global technical expertise with profound 
local insights and knowledge. Amplify, an innovation 
of the U.K. Department for International Develop-
ment (DFID), tries to build collaborative networks of 
development practitioners to develop more inclusive 
proposals for grant funding. It uses online crowd-
sourcing to suggest and refi ne ideas, and facilitates 

changing contexts and emerging challenges.”32 Third, 
when funders—such as taxpayers—cannot directly 
observe results, there can be a confl ict between account-
ability and learning. The OECD survey notes that 
“results data for accountability purposes tend to 
emphasize the positive,” getting in the way of learning. 
Ninety percent of the agencies surveyed reported diffi -
culties in using results for accountability. In sum, as 
seen also in chapter 3, rapid feedback may be technically 
feasible, but it will have limited impact unless there 
is willingness to accept it and fl exibility to act on it.

A focus on results and learning can shift 
incentives toward demand for information
Thus the key to technology effectiveness is, once 
again, in the analog world—in institutional struc-
tures and incentives that elevate feedback and 

Box 6.3 The Social Observatory and P-tracking

“Do you decide on what types of clothes to wear based 
on your own preferences?” That’s a question on a survey 
instrument to assess whether Tamil Nadu’s Empowerment 
and Poverty Reduction Project (part of the Pudhu Vaazhvu 
Project, or PVP) is actually having an impact on women’s 
empowerment. For project benefi ciaries, it was a touch-
stone indicator of empowerment.

That may be because it was crafted by a group of the 
women the project is designed for. 

The Social Observatory seeks to build diagnostics and 
feedback loops into the implementation of PVP and similar 
livelihood projects in India. These are complex projects, 
operating in hundreds or thousands of locations. They have 
multiple objectives and lots of moving parts: job training, 
loans for small-scale income-generating activities ranging 
from dairy production to sanitary napkin manufacture, 
even self-defense classes. So it is hard to get a fi x on what 
is going on without a lot of information. To provide use-
ful feedback, the Observatory deploys a variety of tools, 
including randomized controlled trials, internet-connected 
management information systems, and “P-tracking,” the 
participatory approach to monitoring.

P-tracking builds on a few innovations. First, as the 
name suggests, the survey instrument was designed in 
a participatory fashion with a group of benefi ciaries to 
ensure that the information is seen as relevant. Indeed, the 
women report that the acts of administering and respond-
ing to the survey helped change perceptions. (The survey 
is not village-specifi c; after testing, it was standardized for 

statewide use.) Second, it is administered by local staff , not 
by some external contractor. Third, it informs higher-level 
project management but also provides actionable informa-
tion at the village level.

Digital technologies help. The surveys are administered 
using tablet-based software, and the data are pooled 
through village-based internet connections. (These, by the 
way, also allow villagers to buy train tickets, pay electric 
bills, and check school exam scores without hours-long 
queueing or travel.) Automating the survey makes it easier 
to train the local interviewers. It is diffi  cult to imagine how 
the Social Observatory could realize its goal of scaling up 
to 1 million respondents, and providing timely annual infor-
mation, using traditional paper-based surveys.

Most interesting, the Observatory tackled ways to make 
this massive information set digestible, a problem facing 
all producers of data, big or small—and a particularly 
challenging problem when many users are illiterate. The 
Observatory commissioned an interactive graphical dis-
play that allows a village to compare its performance with 
neighbors, catalyzing healthy competition. 

Like so many promising ideas covered in this report, 
P-tracking is still in a demonstration phase. About 40,000 
interviews have been completed in a pilot district, and it 
will be a big leap to cover the projected million. Another 
challenge will be to mainstream annual P-tracking data into 
project implementation at all levels. Information supply is 
just half the battle.

phase. Those with demonstrated impact can get large 
grants for scaling up. Although Development Innova-
tion Ventures is not restricted to digital technologies, 
many of the supported concepts are based on ICTs or 
use ICTs for monitoring in the demonstration phase. 
ICTs could thus speed the more reliable demonstra-
tion and dissemination of investment ideas.

To sum up, an alternative vision of development 
practice starts with incentives. Project or program 
staff get incentives and fl exibility to pursue results. 
So do benefi ciaries. Digital technologies facilitate 
rapid, real-time monitoring of outputs and outcome 
results that matter, and provide this information 
in a comprehensible form to those who can act on 
it—complemented by systems that assess impacts. 
Consistent with privacy considerations, these data 
streams would be made public, as open data. Any-
one—program managers, civil society, academics, or 
auditors—can have access to this information. With 
many eyes on the information and a profusion of 
analyses, accountability and learning are enhanced. 
In this system of open-source evaluation, it is important 
to have an independent group assure integrity of the 
data system.

Taking information to scale
How can emerging opportunities to build internet -
based services make development and environmen-
tal management more effi cient and inclusive? These 
services reduce the cost of information as an input, 
thereby reducing risks or improving decisions—for 
individuals, for managers of infrastructure net-
works, and for public authorities. The rationale for 
involvement by development or international agen-
cies is fourfold. First is a characteristic feature of 
information services: many of these interventions 
are expensive to set up and run, but can distribute 
information at very low marginal cost. So fi nancing 
becomes problematic. If the service is nearly costless 
to distribute, then it is effi cient to provide it to every-
one who might benefi t. But the fi xed costs must be 
fi nanced somehow. High fees might exclude poor 
people; low fees imperil sustainability; price discrim-
ination might be diffi cult. And if the information can 
be copied, it may be diffi cult to get anyone to pay for 
it. So there is often an argument for public or donor 
fi nance. Second, the information often underpins 
a public good, such as environmental protection or 
poverty reduction, reinforcing the rationale for pub-
lic fi nance. Third, development agencies—including 
NGOs and foundations—can play a distinctive role 
not only through fi nance, but also via capacity build-
ing, and support for complementary investments 

collaborations among distant groups—such as a New 
York design study and a Nepalese NGO. 

Another approach to changing institutional incen-
tives is by pursuing outcome-based aid. This shifts 
funder and client attention from disbursements to 
results. Disbursements are made only after achiev-
ing pre-agreed outcomes. This should motivate both 
funders and recipients to rapidly track processes, 
outputs, and results, introducing the possibility of 
fl exibility in getting those results; a downside is 
shifting implementation risk to the recipients. The 
World Bank’s new Program for Results (P4R) uses 
independent verifi cation of outputs and outcomes to 
motivate countries to beef up their own monitoring 
systems. In Vietnam, for instance, a P4R sanitation 
project links disbursements to installations of house-
hold toilets. The state audit agency sends out survey-
ors equipped with smartphones to independently 
verify, with GPS-stamped photos, a sample of health 
ministry–reported installations. Beyond simply 
incentivizing particular outcomes, this approach may 
catalyze a wholesale shift in P4R clients toward a cul-
ture of results, motivating them to invest in real-time 
monitoring. 

More disruptively, development impact bonds 
have been proposed as a way to use an outcome-based 
approach to solve agencies’ constraints of infl exi-
bility, risk aversion, and short time horizons. In this 
relatively untried approach, agencies contract with 
a private party or NGO for the achievement of spec-
ifi ed and verifi ed results, potentially over a period 
longer than most projects. The contractor has the 
fl exibility to decide how to achieve those results—
and could profi t or lose depending on performance. 
But the approach’s effectiveness will depend on how 
well specifi ed and reliably measured the indicators 
are for making disbursements. Poorly specifi ed 
proxies could produce perverse impacts, as could 
measurement systems subject to tampering. Digital 
technologies could make a difference by allowing 
better measurement and independent verifi cation 
of the desired outcomes. They could also monitor 
unexpected social or environmental impacts. And 
they can be used to collect rich qualitative data as a 
check against the potential bias of narrowly specifi ed 
quantitative targets.

Another way to motivate attention to results 
is by an evidence-based approach to fi nancing, as 
illustrated by the Development Innovation Ventures 
initiative of the U.S. Agency for International Devel-
opment (USAID). Small grants support proof-of- 
concept pilots. Ideas that have passed the fi rst stage 
are rigorously evaluated in a second-stage testing

For tropical maize in Africa, yields are typically 
only one- fi fth of the potential, and for other crops and 
places in the developing world, yields rarely exceed 
80 percent of the potential.33 Many factors account 
for this poor performance, but a lack of information—
about techniques, weather forecasts, and markets—is 
a part of the gap. Traditional agricultural extension 
agencies have tried to fi ll the information gap, but 
have depended on in-person farm visits and printed 
material. Extension agents are typically assigned to 
serve an impossibly large number of farmers spread 
over a logistically daunting stretch of countryside, 
so information fl ows are low, and do not include 
customized information based on seasonal and daily 
weather forecasts. 

Pilot programs are beginning to tap the poten-
tial of ICTs to reduce costs and increase the reach 
of extension efforts. Some initiatives in India show 

and policy reforms. Finally, there is a need for inter-
national coordination to face planetary issues such 
as climate change.

What follows are some concrete examples of how 
information and analytics might be able to boost effi -
ciency at the individual and system level, with impli-
cations for the role of development agencies (box 6.4).

Information as an input to individuals
Poor people are often poor in critical information: 
about the benefi ts of hand-washing, or tomorrow’s 
weather forecast, or the price their produce will 
fetch. When information becomes dramatically 
cheaper, there is a prospect for welfare gains. Some 
of the clearest and most relevant examples to poverty 
reduction are in agriculture, which will here serve 
as an illustration of the wider potential across many 
aspects of life and the economy. 

Box 6.4 ICTs and the Sustainable Development Goals

In the year 2000, when the international development 
community came together at the United Nations (UN) to 
approve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),a the 
digital revolution was just beginning. At that time, there 
were fewer than 1 billion mobile phones in use worldwide 
and just 400 million internet users. In the intervening years 
to 2015, when the MDGs were reviewed, both indicators 
have grown by more than sevenfold. Thus target 18—to 
make available the benefi ts of new technologies, including 
ICTs (information and communication technologies)—was 
one where progress was easy to show.

But with the new generation of Sustainable Develop-
ment Goals (SDGs), adopted by the UN in 2015, the bar has 
been raised. As part of a broader goal 9, on infrastructure, 
industrialization, and innovation, the SDGs commit to “sig-
nifi cantly increase access to ICTs and strive to provide uni-
versal and aff ordable access to the internet in LDCs [least 
developed countries] by 2020.” Given that many developed 
countries are already close to saturation in terms of mobile 
penetration, it is logical to focus on internet access, and 
specifi cally on the needs of the LDCs. The two key words in 
the new target are “universal” and “aff ordable.” 

Given the current low level of internet penetration 
in the LDCs—just over 10 per 100 inhabitants by the end 

of 2015b—achieving “universal” coverage would imply 
a required growth rate of 51 percent a year, much faster 
than the LDCs have achieved since 2000. Aff ordability 
is also likely to be a challenge as only 1 of the 48 LDCs, 
Bhutan, actually met the UN target in 2013.c Neverthe-
less, LDC mobile coverage currently stands at close to 
70 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants. As those mobile 
phones are upgraded to smartphones, and as coverage 
of 3G (third-generation) and 4G (fourth-generation) 
signal expands, this target will become more attainable—
although perhaps not by 2020.

The real signifi cance of the internet for the SDGs is 
likely to lie in helping to achieve other targets, such as 
target 3.9 on achieving universal health coverage, target 
5b on promoting women’s empowerment, or target 10c on 
reducing the transmission costs of migrant remittances to 
below 3 percent.d As noted, timely, fi ne-grained informa-
tion on households, the economy, and the environment can 
accelerate achievement of the SDGs. This information can 
provide actionable feedback on where and why progress 
is or is not being made. This is the essence of the “data 
revolution,” called for by the High-Level Panel of Eminent 
Persons in their 2013 report, which kick-started discussion 
of the post-2015 development agenda.e

developed by the national rice association with sup-
port from the International Center for Tropical 
Research. Colombian rice yields have been falling as 
increased climate variability invalidates traditional 
calendar-based rules of thumb on when to plant. The 
decision-support system merged historical data on 
climate and harvests with current weather forecasts 
to advise farmers on optimal planting decisions. In an 
early application, the model correctly foresaw that 
crops would fail due to drought and advised farmers 
not to waste time and money on planting. 

Donor funds (including NGO funds) and technical 
inputs have been important in most of these initia-
tives. Many fail to scale up. All face the challenge of 
fi nding a sustainable business model. This may entail 
a combination of subscription sales and recurrent 
public fi nancing. Assessment of the benefi ts of this 
information could help in pricing decisions and in 
determining the role of public fi nance. 

Information as an input to managing 
complex systems
Much of development involves managing complex 
systems, such as power networks and urban transpor-
tation. With better information and analysis, these 
systems can be designed and managed for greater 
effi ciency. 

Power utilities can be helped by information in a 
variety of ways (see sector focus 5, “Energy”). Devel-
oping countries, though short on power, nonetheless 
see much of their electricity production lost to poor 

mixed results.34 A program that sent voice advice to 
farmers was little used and had no impact. Another, 
targeted at cotton farmers, shifted them to less harm-
ful pesticides and more valuable crops. A program 
that put smartphone-equipped extension agents in 
contact with experts improved farmer awareness of 
extension services, but the impact on incomes was 
not measured. In Peru, however, a careful experiment 
showed that provision of market information via 
cellphones boosted farmers’ selling prices by 13 per-
cent and increased the participation of subsistence 
farmers in the markets.35 The effects were particularly 
marked for perishable goods and for risk-averse farm-
ers. A particularly interesting program—because its 
“how-to” video approach could be applied in domains 
outside agriculture—is Digital Green (box 6.5).

More ambitiously, a movement toward “precision 
agriculture” crunches big data to provide farming 
advice. At its most capital-intensive, an instrumented 
tractor gathers georeferenced data on fi eld condi-
tions and plant health. These data are combined with 
weather data and fed into a computer model of plant 
growth. The model then works through the tractor, 
fi ne-tuning the application of fertilizer and pesti-
cide as it traverses the fi eld. By curbing overuse of 
fertilizer, water, and pesticides, precision agriculture 
can improve the environment while boosting farm 
profi ts.

More affordable approaches are needed for the 
developing world. An emergent example is a system of 
decision support for rice agriculture in Colombia 

Box 6.5 Digital Green: “How-to” videos for agriculture and health

Digital Green uses video cameras, battery-operated projec-
tors, and the internet to get information into the hands of 
villagers in India and Africa. It works like this: Local peo-
ple fi lm local farmers demonstrating a useful agricultural 
technique or health practice. These include preparation 
of seeds, enhancements of milk yield in cattle, and oral 
rehydration therapy for children suff ering from diarrhea. 
The videos are pooled on the internet. Then local resource 
people download, show, and explain seasonally appropri-
ate videos to community assemblies. The premise is that 
the home-grown videos convey the technical details of 
the technique, and do it with the credibility of a neighbor 
speaking in a familiar dialect.

The system automatically keeps track of which videos 
are most likely to prompt adoption, so monitoring is an 
integral element of operations, not a burdensome add-on. 
An early self-evaluation reported a 90-percent reduction 
in the cost per adoption. A randomized controlled trial 
found that 16 percent of farmers exposed to Digital Green 
adopted a yield-increasing, water-conserving rice culti-
vation system, versus 10 percent in a control group. The 
program, in operation since 2008, reached 660,000 people 
in 7,645 villages by April 2015.

digital registration of land titles reduces the cost of 
verifying ownership and inhibits fraud and corrup-
tion. Thus land registration is a platform for building 
a variety of valuable services.

As an example of the potential, a pilot land 
regularization project in Rwanda used aerial pho-
tography and digital registration, and was found to 
double the rate of investment and maintenance of 
soil conservation structures.37 The effect was partic-
ularly marked for female-headed households. But 
the gender impacts were complicated because of 
the way tenure regularization interacted with laws 
and traditions. Married women improved their land 
access, but those in informal unions were worse off. 
Girls’ and boys’ planned land inheritance was equally 
boosted—except in female-headed households, where 
sons gained an edge. Contrary to expectations, there 
was no effect on access to credit. Overall, the pilot 
was suffi ciently successful that it is being expanded 
nationwide, to 10 million land parcels, at a cost of 
US$5 a parcel. 

Environmental management also depends on land 
data. Since the 1970s, Brazil has used satellites to 
monitor deforestation in the Amazon. In 2003 the 
government made a landmark decision to release the 
raw data. This enabled NGOs such as IMAZON to 
develop their own analyses, improving the informa-
tion base and raising public awareness and pressure 
for environmental action. Starting in 2004, the Brazil-
ian government began using monthly data to guide 
enforcement of forest and agricultural policy, with 
demonstrable impacts on reducing deforestation.38 
More recently, Brazil embarked on an ambitious 
program to precisely map every rural property and 
use satellite observations to monitor compliance 
with forest conservation regulations. By September 
2015, it had registered 2.1 million properties cover-
ing 2.6 million square kilometers.39 Registry in this 
environmental cadastre is a condition for credit and 
other services, motivating compliance. It also sets up 
a framework for trading forest conservation obliga-
tions, which reduces the cost and increases the ben-
efi ts of conservation. 

Disaster risk management inherently demands a 
great deal of timely and location-specifi c information. 
Over just the past few years, internet-enabled infor-
mation has begun to change the way in which donors 
respond to emergencies, and is helping to increase 
disaster preparedness and resilience (box 6.6).

For all these systems’ management challenges, 
big data offers plausible effi ciency gains. In many 
cases, realizing those gains involves overcoming 
not just technical obstacles, but also political ones. 

maintenance and to theft. Data analytics can opti-
mize schedules for transformer maintenance and 
replacement, and can pinpoint locations for attention 
to reduce theft. Big data can also be used to enable 
grids to assimilate the ebb and fl ow of power from 
wind turbines and solar panels, and to adjust prices in 
real time to shave off peaks in demand. Put together, 
these tweaks in system operation can reduce power 
outages, reduce the need to invest in expensive peak 
supply, improve the bankability of power, and reduce 
environmental damages. Many of the same principles 
can be applied to water utilities.

Urban transport is another complex system where 
newly cheap information unlocks possibilities for 
greater effi ciency. A good starting point is with the 
most basic foundation of planning: of the 25 largest 
low- and lower-middle-income cities, 92 percent do 
not have complete maps of their transit networks.36 
Compiling these maps used to be time-consuming and 
expensive. Recently, though, Manila developed and 
applied a mobile phone–based application to survey 
and map routes, using an open-source data standard. 
The map powers a consumer trip-planning app and 
is being used by city planners to reduce redundant 
routes and plan a new mass transit corridor. In Seoul, 
the transit agency used locational data from 3 billion 
nighttime phone messages to map travel patterns 
and design an optimal route for the immense city’s 
fi rst late-night bus service. Traditional household 
surveys would have been slower, more expensive, and 
less informative. Moving on from static mapping, an 
initiative in Cebu, the Philippines, was able to ingest 
real-time taxi data to generate speed and congestion 
maps for the entire city. This reduced the time to 
analyze travel time for a bus corridor from two weeks 
to two seconds. Ultimately cities may be able to use 
real-time data to design and implement policies that 
increase transit accessibility, decrease travel time, 
substitute for expensive road construction, and abate 
congestion and pollution.

Rural land management, to be effi cient, depends 
on accurate and accessible information about land 
plots. Land sales and rural credit markets function 
better when there is a comprehensive system of land 
registration. Secure, registered land tenure also gives 
farmers incentives to invest in their land and protects 
them from illegal expropriation. ICTs have revolu-
tionized the logistic burden of mapping, recording, 
and verifying landholdings—key elements of docu-
menting land tenure. They do so in two ways. First, 
mapping boundaries with GPS is much faster, less 
expensive, and less demanding of scarce skills than

Box 6.6 Disaster risk management

As climate becomes more volatile and populations swell in 
coastal, fl oodplain, and earthquake-prone areas, disaster risk 
management (DRM) becomes ever more important. Annual 
disaster losses now average US$200 billion globally, and large 
disasters can derail a country’s growth. Information and com-
munication technology (ICT) applications—especially those 
involving crowdsourced, open data and open-source soft-
ware—are rapidly being incorporated in each aspect of DRM:

Risk identifi cation and mitigation. The best way to deal 
with disasters is to build resilience in advance, so that when 
the storm or fl ood or earthquake hits, lives are not lost and 
damage to property is minimized. This requires extensive, 
geographically precise information and planning. What 
locations are subject to natural disasters, with what proba-
bility? How sturdy are the buildings in those locations, and 
who occupies them? Which ones need to be shored up and 
how much will that cost? Detailed answers have typically 
not been available. Map data have been inadequate, often 
inaccessible, and diffi  cult to handle. But with revolutions 
in geographic information systems, remote sensing, and 
crowdsourcing, that is changing.

In fl ood-prone Jakarta, Indonesia, for instance, the 
Disaster Management Agency asked the heads of the city’s 
267 wards to map the location of critical infrastructure 
using OpenStreetMaps, a tool that allows volunteers to cre-
ate detailed digital maps that can be used without restric-
tion. More than 1 million buildings have been mapped. 
InaSAFE, an open-source software program, was then used 
to analyze potential impacts of fl oods, and helped in the 
response to the 2013 and 2014 fl oods. More recently, peta-
jakarta.org exploited the city’s high rate of Twitter usage to 
crowd-map fl ood locations in real time during the 2014–15 
monsoon season, helping citizens navigate the fl ooded city 
and augmenting the DRM agency’s information base.

Early warning. Many lives have been lost for lack of 
adequate warning of impending disaster. Now, widespread 
access to mobile phones, combined with weather monitor-
ing systems, allows for timely and near-universal warnings. 
For instance, the Philippines’s Project NOAH (Nationwide 
Operational Assessment of Hazards) uses real-time data 
from rain gauges, water sensors, and radar to provide evac-
uation alarms.

Damage assessment and response. In the chaos following 
a disaster, it has been diffi  cult to match relief supplies with 
need, and then to inventory damage and prioritize recovery 

operations. Here again, crowdsourcing has revolutionized 
response. After the devastating 2010 Haiti earthquake, a 
spontaneous volunteer eff ort used the Ushahidi platform to 
aggregate and map status reports and requests for help from 
social media and text messages. Over 1,000 Haitian volun-
teers living abroad translated and geolocated the messages. 
And more than 700 volunteers used OpenStreetMaps to 
create new maps. These were subsequently updated, by 
more volunteers, with satellite and aerial imagery, to form the 
basis for the postdisaster needs assessment. Technological 
progress continues: after Vanuatu’s 2015 cyclone, drones 
were used to survey damage, providing much more detailed 
damage information than is possible with aerial photography. 

The move of these methods to open-source software 
and open data is noteworthy, and has implications beyond 
DRM. For capacity- and cash-constrained agencies in devel-
oping countries, open-source software is much cheaper to 
acquire than proprietary software, and avoids dependency 
on a single supplier. It allows high levels of customization 
and, because it often adheres to open standards, easier 
integration with other software. It encourages cross- 
fertilization, community building, and code sharing with 
others around the world; for an example, see geonode.org. 
These advantages need to be weighed against the poten-
tially (but not necessarily) higher level of support off ered 
by proprietary software. 

Similar considerations apply to open data. By opening 
data, it is easier to fi nd and assemble the multiple layers 
of information—land cover, topography, population, infra-
structure, hydrology—necessary for DRM. And, of course, 
open data can be distributed to users free of charge.

Crowdsourced data are not without diffi  culties. Accuracy 
and completeness are issues. Both Haiti and Jakarta 
developed systems for confi rming the accuracy of reports. 
Sustainability of volunteer engagement is a challenge, 
since DRM data need constant updating. Feeding back the 
information to communities is one way to encourage this.

Of course, crowds are just one data source. A key to DRM 
is the integration of many diff erent kinds of information. 
Rio de Janeiro’s Center of Operations prepares the city to 
deal with its many risks, including fl oods and landslides, by 
combining real-time information on rain, tides, transport, 
and city services with 560 video cameras. It also serves to 
coordinate the diverse government departments, and to 
feed information to the public and the media.

alone at the fi ne-grained level relevant to provinces 
or communities.

However, many countries lack the money to fund 
basic information systems, the organizational incen-
tives to share information, and the human skills to 
supply and use data. International actors can help on 
all counts. Donors have supported keystone house-
hold surveys, including the Living Standards Mea-
surement Surveys and the Demographic and Health 
Surveys. These have provided crucial information for 
decision making, with the added benefi t of facilitat-
ing international comparisons, thanks to standard-
ized defi nitions. Donors have also supported capacity 
building at national statistical organizations. But 
as noted, coverage is far from complete and timely. 
A comprehensive program of statistical gap-fi lling 
for the 77 low-income countries that belong to the 
World Bank’s International Development Association 
(IDA) is estimated to cost about US$1 billion a year.43 
Current offi cial development assistance runs around 
US$350 million, according to the report, while domes-
tic spending is not known. 

Costs may be reduced, or effectiveness improved, 
through new technologies. For instance, computer- 
aided surveying can reduce the cost of traditional 
household surveys by 60 percent.44 New opportuni-
ties are arising to complement traditional censuses 
and surveys with big data that can provide up-to-date 
information at a fi ne geographical level. For instance, 
cellphone call detail records are being used to impute 
real-time measures of poverty—and internet data, to 
construct real-time infl ation or even GDP measures. 
These techniques are not likely to replace traditional 
statistical sources. Quite the contrary: high-quality 
censuses and surveys become even more valuable 
because they can adjust for biases in big data (see 
box 6.7).

Mustering information for global public 
goods
Many problems—climate change, ozone depletion, 
air pollution, epidemics, fi nancial crises—are features 
of globally interconnected environmental, economic, 
and social systems. Addressing them requires coordi-
nated global actions. Setting priorities and targeting 
actions require global information. That information 
is itself a global public good. As such, it is subject to 
the scale effects described earlier in this Report.

Perhaps the quintessential example is the 
immensely valuable data on weather, water fl ows, 
and climate. One estimate of the benefi ts of upgrad-
ing developing country weather systems to devel-
oped country standards is between US$4 billion 

Powerful interest groups may stand to lose from sys-
tems effi ciency. These include consumers and utility 
employees who benefi t from electricity theft, oper-
ators of unregulated minibuses, land-grabbers, and 
fl outers of environmental regulations. Disaster risk 
management and climate adaptation require exten-
sive coordination among ministries used to working 
independently. Donors may be able to play a role in 
supporting the complementary reforms necessary to 
overcome these obstacles. 

Information as an input to poverty 
reduction eff orts
In fi ghting poverty, as in any strategic endeavor, it 
is useful to diagnose challenges and track progress. 
Timely, disaggregated poverty indicators could pro-
mote accountability, boost motivation, and provide 
the kind of relevant feedback described earlier in 
this chapter, at the policy level. For instance, many 
proposed policy reforms have potentially large and 
poorly understood distributional impacts, sometimes 
leading to contentious gridlock. The ability to predict 
those impacts and then to verify them in practice 
could help to accelerate reforms. Up-to-date informa-
tion on the location, health status, and consumption 
patterns of poor people could help design and target 
programs more effi ciently. For these reasons, a panel 
commissioned by the United Nations40 sees better data 
as an indispensable tool for achieving the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) (see spotlight 5, “The data 
revolution”).

To date, however, development decisions and 
priorities have often been made while fl ying blind. 
For instance, energy subsidy reform—a trillion-
dollar-a-year issue with huge poverty and environ-
mental implications—is contentious in many coun-
tries. Yet an authoritative global analysis of the pov-
erty impacts of reform was forced to use household 
data that were, on average, more than eight years old.41 
Consider this sobering picture of the state of knowl-
edge about African growth and poverty.42 Just half of 
African countries compute GDP using current stan-
dards; when Ghana adopted those standards, national 
income was found to be nearly two-thirds higher 
than previously thought. Only one-third of countries 
have two comparable measures of poverty over time, 
and even then the latest estimate is often years out 
of date. To make things worse, basic civil registra-
tion systems cover only 45 percent of births in Sub-
Saharan Africa, making it diffi cult to track child mor-
tality (one of the starkest measures of poverty) or to 
get an accurate measure of population. Thus it is dif-
fi cult to track progress even at the national level, let 



314 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

publishes monthly deforestation maps that can spot 
clearings of as little as 25 hectares.48 On the horizon 
are satellite data that might enable daily monitoring 
at a level well below a hectare. Similar advances are 
being made in transboundary air pollution (see sector 
focus 6, “Environmental management”) and surveil-
lance of emergent zoonotic diseases.

So there is a role for global fi nance in the supply 
of this kind of information, but that is only the begin-
ning. There is a need also to build the willingness to 
share information, and the capacity to use it.

The future of global development 
cooperation 
What’s the role of development agents and interna-
tional organizations in a world where their fi nancial 
heft is miniscule? The answer set forth here is three-
fold: in concentrated efforts in the poorest countries; 
in catalytic injections of ideas, backed with cash, 
everywhere; and in spearheading global collective 
action. The data and technology revolutions are arriv-
ing in time to bridge the gap between resources and 
ambition by amplifying the impacts of action and 
including more people in the formulation and execu-
tion of plans. But for this to work, development agents 
must tackle policy constraints, internal and external. 

Start with the how of development operations. 
With new technologies, development agencies can 

and US$36 billion a year.45 Data on river fl ows are 
essential for disaster risk planning and for planning 
and operating hydropower and irrigation systems. 
And detailed long-term data are essential for tracking 
and understanding climate change patterns. These 
data are sorely underprovided. Because weather is 
a global system, every observation of temperature 
and precipitation improves weather forecasts (and 
climate models) at the transnational and even global 
levels. But poor countries do not have a dense enough 
network of observation stations even for their own 
purposes, let alone to contribute to the global good 
(see map 6.2). Another 4,000 to 5,000 stations are 
needed in Africa alone.46 Part of the problem is a lack 
of funds and capacity to build and maintain stations. 
Another is that many state-run hydrometeorological 
agencies refrain from the free distribution of globally 
valuable data to garner modest revenues from selling 
data points, not just in poor African countries but also 
in the majority of European countries.47

Once again, technology is making it easier to 
gather and analyze data of global signifi cance. For 
instance, tropical deforestation is a global concern, 
a major source of carbon emissions and biodiversity 
loss and an issue related in complex ways to rural 
poverty. Yet until recently, data on tropical deforesta-
tion were spotty, inconsistent among countries, 
and woefully outdated. Now, Global Forest Watch 

Box 6.7 Can “big data” provide real-time, geographically detailed 
information on poverty?

Traditional surveys and newfangled big data sources have 
complementary strengths and weaknesses. Surveys work 
very hard at being accurate—for instance, precisely tallying 
the value of everything a household buys or produces—
and making sure that everyone in the target population, 
especially poor people, are covered. This makes it possible 
to accurately measure changes over time. But even with 
tablet-assisted surveying, traditional household survey data 
will be months old before they are published. And sample 
sizes of a few thousand do not allow much insight into what 
is happening with subgroups or at particular locations.

So researchers are trying to estimate income with 
cellphone use data, which cover a large proportion of the 
population, are literally up to the minute, and can provide a 
snapshot of activity at the level of a village or urban ward. 
The estimates use information such as how often the user 

buys airtime, in what denominations, and the frequency of 
international calls. Hurdles include fi nding ways to ensure 
data anonymity and convincing phone companies to share 
data. But the big disadvantage, from a monitoring per-
spective, is that the data do not accurately represent the 
population. Many poor people do not have phones. And the 
relationship between income and airtime purchases will 
change over time as prices of service and phones change.

One possible solution is to use repeated small “gold 
standard” surveys to calibrate the cellphone data. A hint 
of the possibilities is given by a study that successfully rep-
licated the results of a populationwide opinion poll based 
on a survey of Xbox gamers—a predominantly young, male 
group. The key was a sophisticated method of correcting 
for the skewed nature of the sample using information on 
the age and sex distribution of the general population.a

tion. These services have fi xed setup costs in software 
and data assembly, but can have near zero costs for 
distributing information. So the private sector will 
tend either to shy away from providing these services, 
or to price them at a level that shuts out poor people 
who could benefi t.

Donors can provide the funds and expertise to 
help get these services going. They can, for instance, 
support the assembly of critical data and the creation 
of broadly applicable open-source software. There 
is a real need, however, for coordination. A DFID 
study found 70 unrelated mobile-for-health pilots in 
Uganda, and over 1,800 mobile apps worldwide.49 

There’s another reason for development agents 
to get involved: to help address the policy issues that 
impede innovation, or to support complementary 
investments or capacity building. Thus, for instance, 
making progress on urban transit could require a 
combination of information systems, investments 
in infrastructure, and investments that address 
opposition to regulation of minibuses or reduction in 
on-street parking. 

be more inclusive by tapping the wisdom of benefi -
ciaries in designing interventions. They can crank 
up their effi ciency by using rapid feedback to refi ne 
and improve their actions through trial and error, 
and use open-source evaluation to align performance 
management with learning. But these approaches 
will not come easily in organizations that emphasize 
spending and outputs over results, have burdensome 
structures for accountability, and see any failures 
as damning rather than informative. If traditional 
agencies cannot adapt, some of their business may 
be taken up by disruptive newcomers, such as Global-
Giving, GiveDirectly, or development impact bonds 
(box 6.8).

Next, the what. Previous chapters have pointed to 
many areas where external agencies could catalyze 
development—for instance, in supporting policy 
reforms that would open up internet access or new 
approaches to service delivery in health. In this chap-
ter, the emphasis is on creating information services 
that help individuals and systems managers make 
better decisions in ways that promote poverty reduc-

could work with partners to expand the availability of 
open data. The principle would be that all supported 
activities should generate open data by default, with 
exceptions on the grounds of privacy and other 
defi ned concerns. So, support for health and educa-
tion systems should ensure that these systems track 
and disclose performance data to the extent possi-
ble, while preserving confi dentiality of individual 
records. This also holds for public-private partner-
ships (PPP), many of which currently do not furnish 
any data about their performance, and which may use 
client-generated data for commercial gain. Agencies 
that advise on or fi nance concessions in power, water, 
transit, telecom, and other services could demon-
strate to public authorities the advantages of making 
performance data open. Data could include public 
scrutiny of the concessionaire, informative new 
data “mash-ups,” and the capacity for open-source 
evaluation of options for improved equity and effi -
ciency. Agencies could then help governments craft 
PPP  contracts that recognize the rights of clients to 
their own information and of the public to ano-
nymized performance data. Donors, both traditional 

Finally, external agents and international organi-
zations can encourage the unlocking of existing data. 
Open data can be a powerful tool (see the discussion 
of open data in the context of disaster risk manage-
ment in box 6.6). But too often, socially benefi cial data 
are kept under wraps. Both the public and private sec-
tor are culprits. As noted, this is true of government-
collected data on weather and river fl ows. In some 
transboundary river basins, upstream countries do 
not share river fl ow data with downstream neighbors, 
crimping fl ood preparedness and irrigation man-
agement. Basic data on poverty also suffer. Among 
the Sub-Saharan household surveys that underpin 
poverty estimates and give insight into causes and 
correlates of income, education, and health out-
comes, fewer than half are available online and free of 
charge.50 For East Asia and the Pacifi c, the proportion 
is less than 20 percent. Private telecom companies 
closely hold, and use for commercial purposes, data 
on cellphone calling patterns useful for transport 
planning and poverty analysis.

Donors and development agencies can catalyze 
the potential for open data in several ways. They 

Box 6.8 Disruptive approaches to development

Some radical reimaginings of development assistance 
involve digital technologies to eliminate some of the over-
head costs and procedures of traditional approaches. Give-
Directly uses satellite imagery, crowdsourced assistance, 
and machine learning to identify poor villages in Kenya.a 
The trick: using thatched roofs as an indicator of poverty. 
Staff  are dispatched to the villages to enroll the residents 
of the thatched houses. GiveDirectly then sends US$300, 
by mobile phone, to the enrollees. Overhead costs are just 
8 percent (for staff  and the cost of foreign exchange and 
money transfers). A randomized controlled trial found a 
42-percent reduction in the number of days children go 
without food, a 58-percent increase in assets, and a 38-
percent increase in revenue from self-employment.b 

GlobalGiving’s internet platform allows nongovern-
mental organizations (NGOs) to post development project 
proposals for funding by donors, large and small. Thus 
it taps a more grassroots fi eld of ideas and implementers 
than traditional agencies. Its website keeps track of project 
performance and NGO credibility (such as whether NGOs 

regularly report audits), feeding this information back to 
donors. GlobalGiving uses its platform to provide online 
capacity building to the grantees, and allows them to build a 
reputation based on performance and investments in learn-
ing. It plans to assist the grantees in tracking their results, 
ultimately fostering benchmarking and mutual learning. 

GiveDirectly and GlobalGiving thus sidestep much 
of the traditional costly apparatus for project selection, 
appraisal, and supervision. GiveDirectly achieves these 
effi  ciencies by focusing on a logistically simple interven-
tion. This cannot substitute for interventions that involve 
externalities or require collective action or large invest-
ments. But it implicitly challenges interventions that have 
more “moving parts”—can they achieve equal impact at 
equal cost? Global-Giving achieves effi  ciencies by pushing 
project appraisal, quality assurance, fi nancial controls, and 
safeguards to the funders and to the wisdom of crowds, 
informed by a growing stream of data. Time will tell 
whether these are inherently niche operations, or the pio-
neers of a new way of doing development business.

 13. IANA, a subsidiary of ICANN, has traditionally per-
formed certain technical functions essential for the 
smooth and secure running of the internet, includ-
ing control of the internet protocol (IP) addressing 
system (numbering resources, including IPv4 and 
IPv6), managing IP protocols, and managing the 
root zone database for domain names (domain 
name management). The U.S. government, through 
the National Telecommunications and Informa-
tion Administration (NTIA), a branch of the U.S. 
Department of Commerce, has had oversight over 
these functions through a series of agreements 
with ICANN, fi rst formalized in 1998 under what 
was called a memorandum of understanding. The 
memorandum went through several iterations and 
morphed into what was then called the Joint Project 
Agreement, which itself underwent one amend-
ment. In 2009, it was replaced by a document called 
the Affi rmation of Commitments. In each iteration 
of the agreement between NTIA and ICANN, and 
over time, NTIA has “loosened” its oversight of the 
performance of these IANA functions by ICANN. 
This latest move by NTIA can be seen as part of a 
continuing evolution away from NTIA’s control and 
oversight of IANA functions.

benefi ts. They can support policy reforms in devel-
oping countries that fund data-producing agencies, 
allowing them to reduce fees. 

Agencies or international organizations could also 
explore the potential to create sectoral data standards. 
Open data are more useful when they can be consis-
tently compared and aggregated across units. Data 
standards also make it easier to develop apps and 
programs for use and analysis. The Group on Earth 
Observations, an international consortium, is doing 
this for remote sensing data. Development agencies 
could work together to create standards for data on 
development impact or results. A beginning would be 
to more thoroughly report results under the Interna-
tional Aid Transparency Initiative standards. Some 
agencies report fi nancial transactions, but only 5 out 
of 68 agencies publish machine-readable information 
on project targets and results—which would allow 
benchmarking and comparison across providers.51 

Finally, as noted, there are signifi cant fi nancing 
needs for building the data that could guide the 
pursuit of the SDGs, and the capacity to use those 
data. There could be opportunities to build reusable, 
customizable open-source software and systems for 
monitoring the SDGs, reducing duplication of efforts, 
saving costs—and improving lives.

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

The internet is transforming how policy makers and 
citizens meet the challenge of environmental man-
agement. New technologies have greatly improved 
monitoring of environmental quality and helped free 
data from the obscurity of closed government offi ces, 
instead making them instantly accessible. This is hav-
ing profound effects. Not only are these technologies 
improving the ability of public authorities to monitor 
pollution, but they are also pushing the boundaries for 
civic engagement. This is happening in many areas of 
environmental policy making, including forest mon-
itoring, water quality assessments, identifi cation of 
natural hazard risk, and air quality management—the 
emphasis of this sector focus. 

Air pollution is a growing threat to health the world 
over. Exposure to particulates with a diameter of less 
than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5 )—which are capable of 
penetrating deep into the lungs—increased in all 
regions between 1998 and 2012, with the exception of 
North America and Europe. Health risks include heart 
disease, stroke, lung cancer, and respiratory infec-
tions. Exposure to outdoor PM2.5 pollution was the 
ninth leading cause of death and disability worldwide 
in 2010, accounting for 3.2 million deaths (6 percent 
of global mortality). There is also growing evidence 
that PM2.5 pollution could harm cognitive functions 
and contribute to diseases such as Alzheimer’s and 
Parkinson’s. The economic costs of deaths and debili-
tating illnesses related to PM pollution, measured by 
reduced labor productivity, amount to 4 percent of 
GDP for some developing countries.1 

The benefi ts of the internet 
in managing air quality

Enabling comprehensive monitoring
Countries now have new tools to monitor the con-
centration of ambient pollutants, the fi rst critical 
step in devising an air quality management plan. 
Ground-level monitoring is common in high-income 
countries and some middle-income countries such 
as China, but there are large parts of the globe where 
monitoring of PM2.5 is rare. Barriers include the high 
cost of installing and maintaining monitoring net-
works and a shortage of technicians and experts with 
specialized skills.

New satellite-based sensors measure pollution 
concentrations from space.2 In combination with 
models of particulate movement through the atmo-
sphere, satellite data supplement information pro-
vided by sparse ground-level monitors to produce 
estimates of pollution concentrations over larger 
areas (map F6.1). In the United States, public agencies 
are investigating using satellite-based measurements 
to enhance air quality forecasts for areas where gaps 
exist in the monitoring network. Remotely sensed 
data will prove especially helpful for regions where 
there is currently very little on-the-ground monitor-
ing, such as in Africa.

Personal mobile technologies could also improve 
pollution monitoring. One California startup has 
created a wearable monitor primarily intended 
for developing countries such as China, India, and 
Mexico. The keychain-size device, called Clarity and 
costing between US$50 and US$75, uses an optical 
sensor to measure concentrations of PM2.5, nitrogen

oxides, ammonia, and volatile organic compounds. 
Data will be gathered and analyzed in the cloud so 
that users can view real-time, crowdsourced maps of 
pollution in their neighborhood or city.

Improving policy design
Singapore is one of the fi rst cities to pioneer the use 
of “big data” to help fi ght congestion and thus reduce 
pollution from idling vehicles. The city is testing 
new satellite positioning technologies to improve 
its existing Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) scheme. 
The system tracks the exact locations of vehicles and 
measures their distance traveled on congested road-
ways. By pinpointing traffi c congestion, ERP tariffs 
can be automatically adjusted to individual driving 
behavior, providing drivers with incentives to fi nd 
less congested routes.

Empowering regulators
New, lower-cost sensors and information technolo-
gies are reducing the cost to regulators of enforcing 
limits on emissions from sources such as factories, 
farms, and energy producers. Sensors can be placed 
within facilities, at fence lines, or in downwind 
communities to continuously monitor emissions 
and transmit data via the internet to regulators. This 
makes it possible to gauge actual pollution loads 
(such as kilograms of PM emitted) over time, instead 

of occasionally sampling gases in smokestacks. Such 
data support emissions trading schemes and other 
market-based policies to reduce pollution. An example 
is the successful sulfur dioxide (SO2) permit trading 
system in the United States, which nearly halved SO2 
emissions within a year and saved industries at least 
US$255 million in annual compliance costs. In India, 
regulators in the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, and 
Tamil Nadu are installing low-cost sensor technol-
ogies at industrial facilities for a new pilot trading 
scheme for PM pollution. 

Empowering citizens
Publicly accessible data on pollution concentration 
levels enable citizens to take preventive measures to 
reduce their personal risk of exposure and pressure 
governments to enforce existing emission standards. 
The AIRNow program of the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) provides hourly, real-
time maps and forecasts of air quality. The program 
illustrates recent changes in data policies. In the early 
1990s, local, state, and federal agencies collected air 
quality data from monitoring stations and sent the 
data to the U.S. EPA for processing. Concerns over data 
quality, potential misuse of data, and limited technical 
capabilities meant that data were released with long

automated data quality checks, and provides hourly 
maps and forecasts of local, regional, and national 
air quality. Cloud-based computing and mapping, 
combined with new mobile platforms, make local air 
quality reports and forecasts accessible to everyone, 
everywhere. And open data standards allow devel-
opers and public interest groups to pull information 
from AIRNow into their own web services.

Public information disclosure programs that mon-
itor and publicize the environmental performance of 
fi rms empower communities to pressure otherwise 
weak regulatory institutions to enforce environ-
mental standards. These programs now rely on the 
internet to improve the free fl ow of information and 
reduce the cost of data collection and dissemination. 
Online registries that compile information on pollut-
ant releases by industrial facilities and other sources 
have been set up in at least 20 nations, including in 
Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, the United 
States, and the countries of the European Union. Dis-
closure programs that rate the environmental perfor-
mance of fi rms have also been implemented in about 
60 countries. Ratings programs in countries such 
as India and Indonesia have had a signifi cant, mea-
surable impact in reducing pollution by the worst-
performing plants.

China offers an example of how information tech-
nologies can leverage mandatory public disclosure 
programs and expand citizen engagement.3 Public 
disclosure of environmental monitoring data in China 
has expanded rapidly in the last few years in what 
could be characterized as a virtuous cycle made pos-
sible by information technologies. The attention gen-
erated by Tweets of air quality data from unoffi cial 
monitoring sites in Beijing and other cities prompted 
programs by public agencies to build offi cial moni-
toring systems and make the data publicly available 
in real time. In 2013, the Ministry of Environmental 
Protection issued rules mandating the disclosure of 
real-time pollution data by key enterprises and local 
authorities.

The next year, the Institute of Public and Environ-
mental Affairs (IPE) in Beijing, a public advocacy group, 
released a free mobile app to put these data directly in 
the hands of the public. Users of the Pollution Map 
(wuran ditu) app can see current emission levels of 
local factories and other entities and ascertain whether 
the readings exceed legal limits. They can share this 
information on popular social media apps and submit 
reports and photos of companies that are violating 
emission limits. According to IPE’s founder, Ma Jun, 
the app gives citizens the hard data they need to put 
pressure on enterprises and local authorities when 

environmental standards are being violated. There are 
already some signs of success. On several occasions 
in 2014, authorities in the city of Yantai, Shandong 
Province, publicly responded to social media posts that 
enterprises in the area were violating emissions limits 
and resolved the complaints within a few days.

Smart public policy can help make the most of 
new technologies for monitoring and reducing 
pollution. Apart from stronger requirements for 
public disclosure of monitoring data, governments 
play an important role in setting standards for data 
collection, reporting, and sharing; offering guidance 
on best practices for use of technologies; and rating 
the performance of devices used by consumers. To 
keep up with the pace of technological change, it is 
vital for governments to regularly review policies and 
standards in recognition of new data services. Such 
policies for encouraging the innovative use of infor-
mation technology may form an important part of a 
broader air quality management strategy.

326 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016

This Report looks at what countries can do to get 
more out of the internet and other digital technolo-
gies. Although it looks ahead to a world in which the 
internet is universally available and affordable, the 
analysis largely takes the technology for granted. But 
technological change is continuous and frequently 
disruptive. This spotlight examines a range of tech-
nologies, identifi ed in the technology forecasting lit-
erature that promise to be far-reaching in their impact 
on development. 1 They are at different stages of the 
“hype” cycle (fi gure S6.1). Like the internet, they are 
likely to be encountered fi rst in the developed world, 
but will spread quickly to the developing world, where 
their impact may be even greater.2 

Fifth-generation (5G) 
mobile phones
The development of cellular mobile phones from the 
earliest incarnation of commercial service in the late 
1970s has proceeded in generations. First-generation 
(1G) analog cellphones were replaced with 2G digital 
phones, starting in Finland in 1991, while 3G phones, 
which provide faster internet access, were launched at 
the opening match of the 2002 FIFA World Cup in the 
Republic of Korea. By the end of June 2015, there were 
2.33 billion 3G mobile subscriptions worldwide, and a 
further 757 million subscribers to data-optimized 4G, 
or Long Term Evolution (LTE), technology.3

5G wireless networks are the next generation of 
mobile networks. 5G networks are expected to out-

perform current 4G networks by providing data at a 
speed several hundred gigabits per second (Gbit/s). 
In 2015, researchers at the University of Surrey’s 5G 
Innovation Centre (5GIC) managed one terabit per 
second (Tbit/s) during their speed tests—many thou-
sands of times faster than current data connections.4 

Accommodating 5G will require using parts of the 
spectrum that have not previously been considered 
commercially useful, in particular above 3 gigahertz 
(GHz), and in the millimeter band that stretches from 
30–300 GHz. It will also require new kinds of anten-
nae.5 Developments in smartphones have increased 
capabilities about 25 percent per year in the past 
fi ve years. Even though mobile itself is hardly a new 
technology, it is its combination with the internet 
that makes it a disruptive force and one of the tech-
nologies with potentially the greatest impact for the 
developing world.  Developing countries will need to 
closely follow developments taking place in 5G and 
start preparing for its eventual rollout. 

Artifi cial intelligence
Defi nitions of artifi cial intelligence (AI) differ 
widely, but generally refer to computer systems that 
can perform tasks that normally require human intel-
ligence—including visual and speech recognition, 
decision making, and language translation. Faster 
computing, “big data,” and better algorithms have 
helped propel recent breakthroughs in AI.6 Algo-
rithms are now better able to recognize language and 
images, for example, thanks to the availability of huge 
torrents of data from interconnected phones, tablets, 
and computers. Firms like Narrative Science have 
automated the writing of fi nancial reports using AI.

327SIX DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES TO WATCH 327

IBM’s Watson computer uses AI to provide diagnostic 
assistance to doctors, providing customized medical 
advice. Virtual assistants with voice recognition capa-
bilities like Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana are 
increasingly used in personal and business contexts. A 
venture capital fund based in Hong Kong SAR, China, 
Deep Knowledge Ventures, has even appointed an 
algorithm to its board of directors!7 

Rapid advances in AI have also resulted in con-
cerns about machine intelligence overtaking human 
intelligence, and becoming a threat to the future of 
humanity itself. An example is Nick Bostrom’s 2014 
book on superintelligence, which considers AI to be 
potentially an “existential risk” for mankind.8 Lumi-
naries like Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking, and Bill 
Gates have weighed in on the dangers of AI. While rec-
ognizing the potential risks of AI, such technologies 
can provide important insights and generate value in 
virtually every sector relevant to development. The 
benefi ts of AI are beginning to be seen in education, 
with personalized learning; in health, with deep diag-
nostics; in agriculture, with crop planning, precision 
farming, and optimized resource application; and in 
banking and insurance, in areas like customer service, 
risk management, and compliance. 

Advances in AI will prove to be disruptive, result-
ing in new opportunities for collaboration between 
humans and machines, as well as a loss of traditional 
jobs such as legal analysts, fi nancial and sports 

reporters, online marketers, anesthesiologists, diag-
nosticians, and fi nancial analysts.9 Similarly, a large 
number of call centers previously offshored to devel-
oping countries could be affected by increasingly 
sophisticated natural language processing systems 
that can substitute for human workers. The Span-
ish Bank BBVA, for example, has introduced Lola, a 
virtual assistant capable of handling many routine 
customer requests previously handled by call center 
agents.10

Robotics
Robotics, which refers to machines or mechanical 
systems that can automatically handle tasks, can be 
generally divided into industrial robots (automo-
tive, chemical, rubber, plastics, and food industries) 
and service robots (logistics, medicine, assisting the 
elderly, agriculture, fl oor-cleaning, civil construc-
tion, and exoskeletons). Robots can provide benefi ts 
through their computing power, precision, strength, 
and sensing capabilities. The worldwide stock of 
operational industrial robots at the end of 2014 was up 
to 1.5 million, with around 4.7 million service robots 
sold for personal and domestic use.11 

While robots have been primarily used in physi-
cally diffi cult or dangerous jobs, they are now becom-
ing more advanced and gaining senses, dexterity, and 
intelligence. They are more compact, adaptable, and

intelligent, have manipulation capabilities, and are 
increasingly able to work alongside humans. Eventu-
ally they may displace or augment humans, primarily 
in low-skilled areas like manufacturing, cleaning, and 
maintenance, but also in high-tech fi elds, like surgery 
and prosthetics.12 A number of leading information 
technology (IT) companies have made investments in 
robotics and are driving development of smart robots. 
Amazon acquired Kiva Systems and is using Kiva 
robots for order fulfi llment. Google acquired Boston 
Dynamics and several other robotics companies. 

Demand for industrial robotics is driven by the 
desire to reduce labor costs and by the need for accu-
racy in undertaking repetitive processes. Robots are 
not paid, they do not get sick, and they can work as 
long as there is power. They can also take on danger-
ous or risky tasks, such as detecting landmines. The 
take-up of robots is expected to rise as a function of 
their falling costs and growing intelligence, including 
in developing countries. China is the world’s biggest 
importer of industrial robots. Guangdong province 
recently announced a program to automate 80 per-
cent of its factories by 2020, by substituting human 
labor with robots.13 Robots have been deployed in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo, in Kinshasa, to man-
age traffi c.14 

Autonomous vehicles
Autonomous vehicles (AV), or self-driving cars, attract 
major research spending from car companies as well 
as internet fi rms. Their proponents argue that they 
will reduce road accidents (for instance, through 
lane-keeping systems, auto-parking, and cruise 
control), ease congestion, reduce fuel consumption, 
improve the mobility of the elderly and disabled, and 
free up commuting time for other tasks.15 But they 
also threaten the jobs of millions of people currently 
employed as drivers. They also raise complex legal 
issues, including for liability insurance, and onboard 
networked computers would be at risk of hacking. 
The European project SARTRE is piloting the concept 
of “autonomous car platoons,” which allows multiple 
vehicles to drive autonomously within meters of one 
another at highway speeds, guided by a professional 
pilot vehicle. This approach is expected to reduce 
fuel consumption and emissions by up to 20 percent, 
improve road safety, and reduce traffi c congestion.  

Drones (unmanned aerial vehicles, and a special-
ized type of AV) are growing in popularity as prices 
fall. They have many potential applications, including 
police work, assisting the disabled, home delivery, 
farming, entertainment, safety, wildlife conservation, 

and even providing internet service in remote areas. 
Rwanda plans to be home to the world’s fi rst drone 
airport, or “droneport,” to facilitate the delivery of 
medical and emergency supplies, quickly and cost-
effectively, across geographical barriers.16 

The introduction of AVs is likely to be gradual, 
with many cars and planes already incorporating ele-
ments of assistive technology. The impact on jobs will 
ultimately be a function of price (self-driving cars are 
currently prohibitively expensive), legislation (will 
they always require a human with manual override?), 
and time. 

Internet of things
The “internet of things” (IoT) refers to the intercon-
nection of objects to internet infrastructure through 
embedded computing devices, such as radio fre-
quency identifi cation (RFID) chips and sensors. IoT 
products can be classifi ed into fi ve broad categories: 
wearable devices, smart homes, smart cities, envi-
ronmental sensors, and business applications.17 Cisco 
estimates that by 2020, 50 billion devices and objects 
will be connected to the internet. 

IoT is quickly redefi ning service delivery and 
unlocking opportunities in multiple areas. Smart 
fi tness sensors and trackers are transforming health 
care and improving personal fi tness and health. 
Embedded sensors accurately relay moisture, air and 
water pollution levels, and resource levels, allowing 
for closer monitoring of environmental problems. 
Factories and supply chains use smart sensors to 
improve the effi ciency of manufacturing and dis-
tribution of goods. Globally, there has been a rise in 
spaces where people can gather to build and learn 
with electronics, software, and digital fabrication. 
Known as makerspaces, these spaces have democra-
tized access to tools and empowered participants to 
build and learn on their own. 

One of the key applications of IoT is in combating 
climate change and its effects. Farms in developing 
countries can use intelligent sensors to monitor soil 
conditions and guide autonomous irrigation systems. 
Smart traffi c synchronization systems in cities save 
on travel time and fuel consumption. Countries such 
as Singapore are deploying smart networks that use 
global positioning systems (GPS), sensor informa-
tion from monitoring cameras, and other sources to 
sense population movement, ease traffi c congestion, 
and re-route traffi c in the case of special events and 
emergencies. 

Some experts believe that the IoT will mark a new 
stage of the internet’s development, since it has the

6potential to revolutionize the way people live, work, 

interact, and learn. However, there are still signifi cant 
barriers to full commercialization of IoT, such as the 
fragmented landscape of standardization, which is 
preventing interoperability; and the relatively high 
cost of embedded devices. The maker movement 
offers a possible solution for the standardization chal-
lenge, empowering individuals to adjust devices to fi t 
the local context. There are also signifi cant privacy 
and security concerns. As more devices are connected 
to networks, hacking unsecure devices could have 
repercussions that far exceed the damage posed by 
conventional security threats. 

3D printing
3D printing, a process whereby machines can print 
objects from digital fi les or scans, consists of adding 
successive layers of material to make a three-
dimensional (3D) object. This technology has transfor-
mational potential for manufacturing, since it enables 
users to create smaller batches of highly customizable 
products at declining prices. In recent years, 3D print-
ing has advanced to printing of body parts (titanium 
jaws, spines), exoskeletons, rocket parts, and even 
food.18 As prices have fallen, consumer-oriented devices 
have appeared on the market in recent years, allowing 
individuals to make three-dimensional solid objects 
locally, often using a computer-assisted design (CAD) 
fi le that can be downloaded from the internet. The 
“ink” used in the printer is usually plastic, but other 
materials—including epoxy resins, silver, titanium, 
steel, and wax—are also available. 

The revolutionary aspect of 3D printing lies in its 
digital nature: physical objects become digital infor-
mation that can be remixed, reformulated, improved, 
and shared. However, desktop 3D printers are still rel-
atively expensive, and use between 50 and 100 times 
more energy per unit of weight than conventional 
injection molding. Other concerns include potentially 
negative uses such as gun and drug printing, and 
infringement of intellectual property.19 However, as 
the performance improves and the cost of the printers 
and their inputs decline, 3D printers could be adopted 
more widely (box S6.1). The most relevant immediate 
progress may be in industrial printers for highly cus-
tomizable objects that are relatively expensive and 
require replicable results. This is most suited to the 
construction industry, where 3D printed buildings 
can provide lower-cost housing solutions. 

3D printing is expanding in developing countries. 
In Uganda, for example, the technology is used to 
create 3D-printed prosthetic limbs. The startup Proto-
print, a social enterprise in Pune, India, helps waste 
pickers turn the waste plastics they collect into 3D 
printer fi lament. iLab Haiti has used 3D printing to 
design basic medical supplies for local clinics (such as 
umbilical clamps, fi nger splints, and casts) and pro-
duce them using on-demand manufacturing.20

Box S6.1 Using cellphones for medical diagnosis, thanks to 3D printing

Doctors in developing countries often lack the necessary 
equipment to diagnose diseases, but they do have smart-
phones. Dr. Aydogan Ozcan, an engineering professor 
at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), has 
created software and hardware that can convert smart-
phones into microscopes and diagnostic machines. He 
uses 3D printing to create a fl uorescent microscope device 
that can be attached to the phone. The device includes an 
app that connects the smartphone to a server at UCLA 
and transmits raw images of DNA molecules to detect 

and diagnose cancer, nervous system disorders such as 
Alzheimer’s disease, and drug resistance to infectious 
diseases.a Similarly, a 15-year-old girl from Cupertino, 
California, has designed a spirometer, a device that can 
diagnose respiratory illnesses such as chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease and asthma. She designed this tool 
using open hardware and 3D printing, at a fraction of the 
cost of a commercial spirometer.b

Environmental Benefi ts Statement
Th e World Bank Group is committed to reducing its environmental footprint. 
In support of this commitment, the Publishing and Knowledge Division 
leverages electronic publishing options and print-on-demand technology, 
which is located in regional hubs worldwide. Together, these initiatives enable 
print runs to be lowered and shipping distances decreased, resulting in reduced 
paper consumption, chemical use, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste. 

Th e Publishing and Knowledge Division follows the recommended stan-
dards for paper use set by the Green Press Initiative. Th e majority of our 
books are printed on Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)–certifi ed paper, with 
nearly all containing 50–100 percent recycled content. Th e recycled fi ber in 
our book paper is either unbleached or bleached using totally chlorine free 
(TCF), processed chlorine free (PCF), or enhanced elemental chlorine free 
(EECF) processes.
