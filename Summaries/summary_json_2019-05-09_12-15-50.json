Statutory working hours, minimum wages, unemployment insurance, taxes and benefits are still modelled on the notion of a traditional and unique employer-employee relationship. In addition, as independent work becomes more common, an increasing number of workers may not be covered by collective agreements. They may also not be eligible for unemployment insurance and pension and health schemes available to employees and face difficulties in obtaining credit.
