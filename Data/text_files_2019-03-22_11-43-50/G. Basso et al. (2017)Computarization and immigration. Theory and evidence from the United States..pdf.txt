ABSTRACT

The changes in technology that took place in the US during the last three decades, mainly due to 
the introduction of computerization and automation, have been characterized as “routine-
substituting.” They have reduced the demand for routine tasks, but have increased the demand for 
analytical tasks.  Indirectly they have also increased the demand for manual tasks and service 
oriented occupations. Little is known about how these changes have impacted immigration, or 
task specialization between immigrants and natives.  In this paper we show that such 
technological progress has attracted skilled and unskilled immigrants, with the latter group 
increasingly specialized in manual-service occupations. We also show that the immigration 
response has helped to reduce the polarization of employment for natives. We explain these facts 
with a model of technological progress and endogenous immigration. Simulations show that 
immigration in the presence of technological change attenuates the drop in routine employment 
and the increase in service employment for natives.

1 Introduction

The automation and computerization of several tasks in manufacturing during the last few

decades have produced important effects on US labor markets. First, this type of techno-

logical change contributed to the decline of the employment share of workers performing

routine-intensive tasks, as those were increasingly performed by computers (Autor, Levy

and Murnane, 2003; Goos, Manning and Salomon, 2014). Second, it simultaneously con-

tributed to the increase in the employment shares of cognitive-intensive occupations whose

productivity and demand were increased by computers. Finally, this phenomenon has been

accompanied by the relative stability and possible increase in the employment shares of work-

ers performing manual and non-routine-intensive jobs, in the service sector (see Autor, 2011).

As routine-intensive occupations tend to be in the middle-range of the earning distribution,

while many manual-intensive jobs are towards the bottom and cognitive intensive jobs clus-

ter at the top, this phenomenon has contributed to what has been called “polarization” of

the labor market.

Within this context, we ask two sets of questions about which very little is known. First,

did foreign workers respond to these shifts in labor demand more than native workers, so

that the share of immigrant workers increased, especially in the faster growing segments of

the labor market? And once established in the United States, did immigrants concentrate

in those labor markets where computerization occurred at faster rates? The focus on immi-

grants is interesting because they exhibit a distribution of skills quite distinct from natives.

They specialize, particularly the less educated among them, in manual-intensive service oc-

cupations1 (such as house-keeping, building, gardening, baby-sitting) and their supply may

have been particularly responsive to these routine-substituting technological changes. More-

over as already emphasized by Cadena and Kovak (2016), less educated immigrants seem

to respond more to differential labor demand shocks than native workers at the local level.

This was shown for short-term shocks; here we analyze whether this was true for long-run

technology-driven demand changes.

Second, did the differential inflow of immigrants in local US labor markets affect the

extent of employment polarization of natives? Namely, did the employment impact of com-

puterization on natives differ in areas with large inflows of immigrants relative to those with

low inflows of immigrants? As immigrants tend to specialize in manual service jobs at the

bottom of the skill spectrum, and growth in the 1980–2010 period was especially intensive

for this segment of the labor market, one could think that it responded to technological

changes and potentially produced a complementary effect on natives, reducing their outflow

from routine jobs, and instead encouraging their inflow into analytical ones.

In the empirical analysis we first test how immigration responded to what we call

“computer-intensive productivity growth.” Computer intensity is the use of computer/machines/IT

in production, which we measure as the computer share in inputs at the sector level. Then

we interact such intensity measured in 1980 with the labor productivity growth of the sector

during the period 1990–2010. The larger is the computer intensity and productivity growth

of the sector, the larger is the index value for that sector. Hence this index captures for

each sector the part of productivity growth positively associated with computer intensity.

We then construct a local labor market measure of this index by weighting the index in

each sector by the 1980 employment share of the sector. This is a novel way to capture the

fact that a locality with a large employment share in sectors that had high computer-related

productivity growth were likely subject to larger changes in occupational and productive

structure and hence in skill demand. Sometimes, for compactness, we simply call this vari-

able “computerization.” To validate our novel measure, we test its correlation with the

existing proxy used to measure the predicted intensity of local computerization, namely the

measure of local routine-intensity as defined by Autor and Dorn (2013). We then analyze its

correlation with employment changes for high- and low-skilled immigrants. We establish that

computerization intensity across local labor markets in the US is strongly associated with

both high skilled and low skilled immigration over the decades 1980–2010. We also show

that the local intensity of computerization is associated with increases in employment for

analytical-intensive jobs, decreases in employment of routine jobs, and moderate increases in

employment in manual jobs, as predicted by Autor and Dorn (2013). However, novel to this

paper, we find that in areas with large immigration potential (proxied by the pre-existing

immigrant network) the employment effects of technological change on native workers are

3



attenuated. In these Commuting Zones (CZs), we observe smaller employment growth of

manual-intensive jobs for natives, and smaller employment declines in routine intensive jobs

for natives. This is because a larger immigrant supply response fills manual-occupation

demand, reducing the displacement of natives from routine to manual and hence reducing

their “downgrading.” Further, the complementarity between manual and routine jobs raises

demand for mid-skills and keeps some natives in routine positions, offsetting some of the

polarizing effects of technology. The interesting new implication of this empirical results

is that, in the presence of endogenous immigration, the employment- and wage-polarizing

effects of computerization on native workers are attenuated. Indeed, we see that the major-

ity of service workers contributing to low-end employment polarization are in fact migrants,

and their presence generates more local demand for routine, mid-skilled jobs. Conceivably

without them mid-skilled natives would be more prone to employment and wage losses.

In the second part of the paper, we develop a model that shows more rigorously what

framework is needed to produce such effects of computerization and endogenous immigra-

tion on native polarization. The model extends Autor and Dorn (2013). In that framework

the acceleration of computerization is the cause of change in demand for routine labor, and

the complementarity between goods (routine intensive) and services (non-routine, manual

intensive) produces the polarization of employment, with low skilled workers moving from

good to service production. The crucial novelty of our model is that we allow for endogenous

inflows of immigrants, focusing on the low-skilled ones.2 We then analyze how computeriza-

tion affects the employment of natives. We compare a baseline case when immigrant supply

responds moderately to computerization with a case where no immigrants are allowed in

the country. These comparisons provide a reasonable quantitative explanation for the key

findings of our empirical analysis. Immigrant supply and their specialization in manual tasks

attenuates the negative impact of technology on routine employment of natives, while at the

same time raises the demand for analytical tasks. Allowing stronger immigrant response

would reduce further the polarization effect of computerization on native jobs and wages at

the low end of the wage spectrum.

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. We review the relevant literature in Section

2In an extension we allow also immigration of high skilled immigrants

2. Then in Section 3 we present some empirical facts and estimate some correlations across

local labor markets. In Section 4 we develop a model that provides intuition for the main

findings and we discuss the simulation results. In section 5 we conclude the paper.

2 Literature Review

This paper stands at the intersection of two strands of literature. On one hand it contributes

to our understanding of how computerization affected jobs and the polarization of the labor

market by exploring less known implications of these phenomena from immigrants’ labor

supply and task specialization. On the other hand it complements the literature on the labor

market impacts of immigration, particularly as it has focused on the differences between

native and immigrant workers (Ottaviano and Peri, 2012), identifying task specialization

(Peri and Sparber, 2009) and technological adoption (Lewis, 2013) as important dimensions.

To explain the poor employment (and wage) growth in the middle of the skill distribu-

tion relative to both high and low skilled jobs during the 1990’s and 2000’s, several recent

papers (notably Autor and Dorn, 2013; Acemoglu and Autor, 2011; and Goos, Salomon

and Manning, 2014; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2017) have shown that computer-intensive

technological growth has eroded the demand for routine-jobs. These used to be well paid

positions squarely in the middle of the earning distribution. Machines and computers have

substituted many of the “routine-tasks” performed by workers. On the other hand they have

enhanced the productivity of analytical (also labeled as “cognitive” or “complex”) jobs (see

Autor, 2015 for a detailed explanation of these effects). This helps explain the increase in

inequality at the top of the wage distribution. Finally computerization has not much affected

the physical productivity of manual-intensive jobs in services (e.g. cooking, house keeping,

baby-sitting, health care, food, landscaping). However, the demand for those services may

have increased because they complement the consumption of goods and services produced

using computers. Hence, computer-driven productivity growth increased the demand for

manual-intensive service-type jobs. This is the reason for polarization in the lower part of

the wage spectrum (see Autor and Dorn, 2013). 3

3A recent paper by Cerina et al. (2017) argues that women are the main driver of both low and high-end

5



New in this literature, we extend the analysis of the consequences of computer-driven pro-

ductivity growth on two dimensions. First, relative to findings in Cadena and Kovak (2016)

and Borjas (2003), who show larger short-run responses of immigrants to local labor demand

shocks, and we document a strong response of immigrants to computer-driven productivity

growth at the Commuting Zone level. Particularly interesting is the strong response of less

skilled immigrants, attracted to areas with fast computer-driven growth. Second, building

on the fact that low-skilled immigrants supply manual-tasks more intensely than natives,

we are the first (to our knowledge) to notice that in areas with high immigration potential,

computer driven growth produced less employment transition of native workers from routine

to manual jobs, relative to areas with low immigration potential (as captured by pre-existing

immigrant networks). While the small (and sometimes positive) association of low skilled

immigration with employment and wages of native workers has been known for some time

(Card, 2001; Card, 2009; Basso and Peri, 2015), we are the first to propose an explanation

based on technological growth and specialization. As computer-driven productivity growth

has depressed routine-job demand and moved workers from intermediate wage jobs to low

paid manual jobs, immigration has pushed in the opposite direction by increasing relative

demand for routine jobs performed by natives. Such an attenuating factor may have helped

reverse the tendency of less skilled natives to move to lower paid manual jobs.

Our paper complements a series of recent papers that have analyzed the role of high

skilled immigrants within the context of innovation and technological change (Bound et al.,

2017, Jaimovich and Siu, 2017; Waugh, 2017). These papers focus on the role of highly skilled

immigrants, who are prevalently employed in science and technology, and analyze long-run

outcomes in the presence of technological innovation enhanced by high skilled immigrants.

These studies (especially Bound et al., 2017; and Jaimovich and Siu, 2017) also explicitly

model the fact that highly skilled immigrants have a strong preference for occupations in the

computer sector which further enhances innovation. While we focus on unskilled immigrants,

and document a less known complementarity between computerization and this group, these

papers share with our approach the emphasis on the different specialization of immigrants

polarization. Our work is complementary to Cerina et al., in that we look at the importance of low-skilled
immigrants in driving the growth in service occupations, and we analyze how, in turn, this affects native
occupational upgrading.

6



relative to similarly educated natives, and the benefits that this may generate for natives.4

Finally, our paper is further related to, but substantially differs from, the literature on di-

rected skill-biased technical change (Galor and Moav; 2000, Acemoglu, 1998, 2002; Acemoglu

and Restrepo, 2016). While recent and valuable contributions in this literature indicate that

the abundance of low-skilled migrants induces a delay in the adoption of machinery and in-

novation (Lewis, 2011; Clemens et al., 2017), we highlight two important channels previously

overlooked by this literature. First, we document that immigration responds endogenously

to the adoption of technology on top of supply-driven immigrant inflows. Second, we high-

light the role of immigration in determining occupational and skill upgrading when both

technology adoption and immigration are present.

3 Empirical Facts

In this section we present some simple empirical facts and regression results that provide

strong support for two regularities. First, labor markets (Commuting Zones) with intense

computerization attracted a significantly larger number of foreign-born workers as a share

of overall employment. This tendency already has been partly documented, as it was known

that highly productive urban economies attracted highly educated workers in the 1980–2010

period (e.g. Diamond, 2016). Here we show specifically that areas with strong computer-

intensive productivity change attracted both high and low educated foreign-born workers.

The complementarity of computerization and analytical jobs cannot explain the inflow of

less skilled immigrants, but another feature of that group can. Unskilled immigrants were

significantly more specialized in manual occupations in the service sector, relative to un-

skilled natives who tended to specialize in routine jobs. Moreover manual tasks supplied by

immigrants increased significantly more during this time. Hence, computer-intensive pro-

ductivity growth that substituted routine tasks and increased demand for manual service

tasks attracted disproportionately low skilled immigrants.

4Llull (2017) adds the education and labor participation adjustment margins to the more traditional
literature on the effects of immigration on natives wages and employment using a more structural approach.
With respect to this paper, we focus on technological advancements, its interplay with immigration and their
effects on job and wage polarization.

7



Second, analyzing Commuting Zones (CZs) which experienced high or low immigration,

as predicted by the pre-1980 network of immigrants, we show that the “polarizing” impacts of

computerization on native employment and wages were attenuated in high immigration CZs

relative to low immigration zones. In high immigration Commuting Zones computerization

attracted immigrants in manual tasks and this response attenuated the “downgrading of

natives” from routine jobs to manual service ones relative to low immigration CZs.

3.1 Computerization and Immigration

We first construct a measure of “computer-intensive productivity growth”’ of local economies

(Commuting Zones) between 1980 and 2010. More precisely we first proxy computer-

intensive productivity growth for each sector during 1980–2010 and then, based on the

industrial structure of a commuting zone in 1980, we calculate this measure at the local

level. Then we show how this measure is correlated with the routine-intensity of the local

economy, the proxy used by Autor and Dorn (2013) to measure the intensity of routine-

substitution occurring during the 1980–2010 period. Finally we analyze its correlation with

post-1980 immigration across Commuting Zones to establish whether this measure of com-

puterization is positively associated with inflows of immigrants. We also check that our

measure is not correlated to pre-1980 immigration, ruling out spurious correlations due to

long-run unobserved and persistent trends.

The data we use are the US Census microdata as available on IPUMS (Ruggles et al.,

2015). We aggregate at the Commuting Zone level, which approximates local labor markets,

and encompasses the entire 48 adjoining US states. Our sample is comprised of foreign and

US born individuals of working age (between 18 and 65 years old), not residing in group

quarters and not enrolled in school.5 We consider as employed all individuals with a positive

number of weeks worked during the previous year. For each of the foreign-born and native

groups we define high-skilled workers as those with at least some college education, while

low-skilled workers have at most a high school degree or equivalent.

Somewhat following Bartik (1991) we use the shares of employment in each industry in

Commuting Zone c and we interact these with the national log wage growth for the whole

industry, weighted by the computer-intensity (share of computer in inputs) of the sector

in 1980. The measure captures the industry-specific productivity growth interacted with

the computer intensity of the sector in 1980, and then allocated to a Commuting Zone

in proportion of its 1980 employment share across industries. Technically, the computer-

intensive productivity growth (CIPG) is calculated as:

CIPGc,t =
∑

j

ωj,c,1980 ∗∆ log(wagej,−c,t), (1)

where ωj,c,1980 =
emplj,c,1980(

ComputerInputj,1980
TotInputj,1980

)

∑
j emplj,c,1980(

ComputerInputj,1980
TotInputj,1980

)
and c stands for CZ, t indicates Census year,

and j indicates industry. The computer input share in 1980 is taken from the Bureau of

Economic Analysis (BEA) Input-Output tables and industries are aggregated to match the

BEA classification to the Census codification. Our variable differs from a standard Bartik

demand shifter in two respects. First, we use the growth of labor productivity (rather

than of employment) in a sector, nationally, in order to better capture the increase in labor

productivity in the sector. Second we weight sectors by their computer-intensity to capture

the part of productivity growth associated to computer use and hence computerization.

As in the Bartik measure we allocate such computer-weighted industry specific growth by

the employment-share of that industry in the Commuting Zone. The constructed measure

of computer-intensive labor productivity growth has a strong correlation with the routine-

intensity measure used by Autor and Dorn (2013). This is shown in Figure 1, which represents

a scatterplot across Commuting Zones and decades of the routine share of local jobs as defined

by Autor and Dorn (horizontal axis) and the CIPG measure (vertical axis). The positive and

strong correlation (t-stat of the linear coefficient is 6.56) indicates that computer-intensive

productivity growth is correlated with routine-intensity in a Commuting Zone, and hence

with the routine-substituting mechanisms argued by Autor and Dorn (2013). Our measure

has the advantage of genuinely capturing the sector-driven computer-intensive productivity

growth rather than being a task-based measure.

As a first step, therefore, we test whether our constructed computer-intensive productivity

growth is associated with changes in the indexes of analytical, routine and manual task

9



specialization, and in employment shares of occupations that mainly provide any of these

three tasks. To do this we construct two different measures capturing these three types

of task specialization. The first builds upon previous work that analyzes migration and

occupational choices within the task framework (Peri and Sparber, 2009). We construct

a set of 330 occupations that are consistently defined across Censuses. Then, we exploit

the information contained in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) database (US

DOL, 1977), which indicates the task performed in each occupation as of 1977. We focus

on the indexes of analytical, routine and manual tasks, as previously done by Autor et al.

(2003) and Autor and Dorn (2013). Each of the three indexes represents the percentile of

each occupation in the distribution of occupations ranked by task in 1980. Each worker,

therefore, has an index that reflects her/his specialization in analytical, routine and manual

tasks, which we can then be aggregated by Census year and local labor market.6 These

indexes of task specialization are exclusively based on the occupational task intensity relative

to all other occupations in the economy. And differently from Acemoglu and Autor (2011)

they purely reflect characteristics of the occupations as classified at the beginning of our

sample period. In the rest of the analysis we normalize these indexes, dividing by the total

supply of tasks in each Census year and local labor market to better capture the changes in

the polarization of foreign-born and natives’ specialization.

Acemoglu and Autor (2011) suggests it may be preferable to work with occupations di-

rectly because task indexes, such as those constructed above, may not accurately reflect the

actual task structure (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011, page 1078). Thus, we also look directly at

occupational employment shares. Following Autor and Dorn (2013) we categorize occupa-

tions into three distinct groups by simply aggregating managerial, professional and technical

occupations, routine occupations (mainly clerical, sales, precision production and machine

operators) and non-managerial/non-routine occupation (personal services, construction, me-

chanics and agricultural workers). This partitioning is obtained simply by following the clas-

sification of Autor and Dorn (2013), and identifying the occupations that entail the largest

use of analytical, routine or manual tasks, respectively. The task-intensity of each group of

6Table A1 in the appendix lists the ten occupations with the highest value of each task intensity index.
The details of the classification procedure are described in the Data Appendix.

10



occupations (managerial, routine and non-managerial/non-routine) is reported in Table 1.

It shows the high analytical content of managerial occupations, the high routine content of

routine occupations, and the high manual content of services/construction/transportation

occupations. The correspondence is of course not exact, but it provides an alternative and

simple way of thinking about what analytical and routine jobs actually are. The downside

of this approach is that, in an effort to identify occupations that are more plausibly affected

by “routine-substituting” technological change, we may select occupations only based on

anecdotal evidence. Reassuringly, the two methods give very consistent results and the cor-

relations between the task indexes and the occupation categories presented in Table 1 are

high.

Figure 2 and Table 2 use the task specialization indexes, our first measure described

above, for four groups of workers — low skilled natives, low skilled immigrants, high skilled

natives and high skilled immigrants — to establish an important fact. Figure 2 shows the

changes in the supply of each type of task in the US labor market by the four groups

mentioned above, after standardizing their initial value to 1 in 1980. Panel (a) shows the

changes for low skilled immigrants, Panel (b) for high skilled immigrants, Panel (c) for low

skilled natives and Panel (d) for high skilled natives. Table 2 shows the average intensity of

each type of task index by each of those groups in 1980 and 2010 and the change over the

period. One difference between immigrants and natives, especially in the low skilled group,

is shown in the table and is clear from panels (a) and (c) of Figure 2. Low skilled immigrants

are specialized significantly more in manual tasks relative to natives, and significantly less

in analytical ones already in 1980. This difference became even larger during the 1980–

2010 period when the index of manual tasks increased significantly more for low skilled

immigrants than for low skilled natives. Even high skilled immigrants increased their manual

specialization more than high skilled natives. On the other hand, immigrant specialization

in routine tasks was relatively similar to the natives’ one as of 1980 and it declined roughly

at the same rate.

Hence, as a group, immigrants’ specialization in manual tasks increased relative to routine

tasks (and to analytical tasks) especially among less educated workers. This is an important

feature differentiating foreign and native low skilled workers and it will play an important role

11



in our story. Related to the significant “manualization” of immigrant jobs relative to natives

over the period 1980-2010, there is another interesting stylized fact not very well known or

even discussed in the “polarization” literature. As firstly noted by Mandelman and Zlate

(2014), and demonstrated in Figure 3, we see that labor polarization at the low end of the skill

spectrum is a phenomenon almost exclusively related to immigrant employment.7 The figure

shows the percent growth in employment, ranking 330 occupations by their wage percentile

in 1980, separately for foreign-born (blue line) and natives (red line). Occupations at the very

low end of the 1980 wage percentile distribution (below the 20th percentile), experienced large

employment growth over this period (15-20%), but this phenomenon was essentially limited

to foreign-born. Native employment growth below the 20th percentile was actually negative.

To the contrary, occupations at the high end of the 1980 wage percentile distribution (above

the 60-70th percentile) which also experienced significant employment growth (+15%) mainly

added native jobs as the employment growth of immigrants in this range was much smaller.

Finally the intermediate occupations (between the 30th and the 60th percentile) which did

not grow much in terms of employment for either group, still show higher employment

growth for natives relative to immigrants. Figure 3 shows, in essence, that the polarization

of employment at the low end of the wage distribution was due to immigrant jobs and at the

high end to native jobs. And natives did better than immigrants in terms of employment

growth in the intermediate wage range. If low-paying manual tasks complement routine-

intensive intermediate-tasks, immigrant labor supply responding to computer adoption may

have attenuated the decline in demand of routine tasks and in routine-employment of natives.

In order to use local area variation to test the correlation between computer-intensive

productivity growth and changes in foreign-born workers, we define the immigration inflow

at the Commuting Zone level as the decennial change in the number of foreign-born workers

divided by the beginning of decade CZ population, ∆Fbc,t =
Fbc,t−Fbc,t−10

USbc,t−10+Fbc,t−10
. As suggested

by Basso and Peri (2015) and Card and Peri (2016), this measure captures inflows of im-

7Mandelman and Zlate (2014) develop a three-country dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model in
which polarization is attenuated by low-skilled undocumented immigrants. We see this valuable work as
complementary to ours as they reach similar conclusions despite substantial differences: first, their driver for
polarization is off-shoring and not automation contrary to the empirical evidence (Autor, Levy and Murnane,
2003; Goos, Manning and Salomons, 2014); second, they model immigration as high-school dropouts illegal
immigration inflows from Mexico only; and third, they provide limited empirical evidence consistent with
their claims and assumptions.

migrants relative to the CZ population at the beginning of the decade, avoiding spurious

correlations that may arise from endogenous native mobility responses to local labor demand

shocks. Specifically we run the following regression:

Fbsc,t − Fbsc,t−10
popsc,t−10

= βCIPGc,t + γ ˆ∆Fbc,t + φ
s
d,t + ∆ε

s
c,t, (2)

where s stands for either low-skilled or high-skilled and CIPGc,t is the measure of computer-

intensive productivity growth defined above. Census division-by-time fixed effects (φd,t) are

included in order to control for time-varying demand factors specific to census divisions, and

εsc,t are zero-mean random errors specific to the Commuting Zone and year. The variable

ˆ∆Fbc,t is a measure of predicted immigration inflow that exploits pre-existing settlements

of immigrants by nationality across US local labor markets. It captures a supply-driven

push of immigrants. This follows a long tradition in the immigration literature (Altonji and

Card, 1991; Card, 2001) and we use the 1970 distribution of immigrants by nationality (n)

across CZs, Fbn,c,1970, and augment it with the nationwide growth of immigrants of each

nationality between 1970 and t, Fbn,t
Fbn,1970

. The imputed number of immigrants in each CZ

would be ˆFbc,t =
∑

n Fbn,c,1970 ∗
Fbn,t

Fbn,1970
and it proxies the change of immigrants at the

local level driven by initial composition and changes in aggregate (nationwide) supply of

immigrants by nationality. We then construct an imputed change of immigrants ∆Fbc,t as

follows:

ˆ∆Fbc,t =
ˆFbc,t − ˆFbc,t−10

USbc,t−10 + ˆFbc,t−10
(3)

This measure, which we call “Immigrant Shift-share”, controls for potential “supply side”

changes of immigrants, driven by the aggregate increase in migration from some countries.

The coefficient on the computer-intensive productivity growth, after controlling for fixed

effects and the immigrant shift-share, isolates the response of immigrants to computer tech-

nological change.

The estimates of the coefficients β and γ from equation (1) are shown in Table 3. In the

first three columns we see the estimates when the change in low-skilled foreign born (those

with high school degree or less) is the dependent variable, while columns 4 to 6 show the

coefficients for the change in high-skilled foreign born. The first row shows the coefficient

13



on the computer-intensive productivity growth (coefficient β) while the second row shows

the coefficient on the immigration shift-share (coefficient γ). Columns one and two (four

and five) show the coefficients estimated when only one of the two explanatory variables is

included, while column three (six) show the estimates when both are included.

Three interesting results emerge. First, both high and low skilled respond positively to

computer-intensive productivity growth. Second, and most interestingly, low skilled immi-

grants seem even more responsive than high skilled ones. A one percent increase of the

productivity variable increases the high skilled immigrant share in the Commuting Zone by

0.35 percentage points, but it will increase the low skilled immigrant share by 0.76 percentage

points. Both effects are very statistically significant and robust. While previous papers had

focused on the inflow of high skilled into high productivity cities (e.g., Moretti, 2013; Dia-

mond, 2016), our paper emphasizes that inflows of low skilled immigrants are significantly

associated with computer-driven productivity growth at the local level.8 Third, our results

confirm that the “supply-driven” immigration shift share variable also has a significant effect

on immigration of high and low skilled foreign workers.

3.2 Native Polarization

In order to test empirically that at the local labor market level computer-intensive productiv-

ity growth was associated with the reduction in routine-employment and with an increase in

manual and analytical employment between 1980 and 2010 for US-born workers, we estimate

coefficient β in the following regression:

∆ykc,t = y
k
c,t − ykc,t−10 = βCIPGc,t + φkd,t + ∆εkc,t, (4)

where ykc,t represents the native specialization intensity for each task k (representing alter-

natively analytical-, routine- and manual-intensive) for Commuting Zone c and year t, and

the operator ∆ captures the difference between census years. We run the regression in dif-

8Notice that if we construct a simple Bartik measure of productivity growth across Commuting Zones,
such a variable is much less correlated with immigration than CIPG. See Table A4 in the Appendix that
includes the standard Bartik and the CIPG as explanatory variables in regressions of Table 3. Moreover,
CIPG does not systematically predict the 1950–1980 immigration inflows (see Table A8 in the Appendix)
confirming that it is not correlated with other unobserved and persistent factors affecting immigrant demand.

14



ferences, thus removing time-invariant unobservable local labor market characteristics. We

further control for Census division-by-time fixed effects (φkd,t), which capture region and time

specific shocks.

Table 4, Panel A reports the estimates of coefficient β from equation (4) above, us-

ing the native employment of analytical, routine and manual indexes, respectively, as de-

pendent variables. Panel B does the same for the share of managerial/professional, cleri-

cal/sales/operators and services/construction/transportation occupations as dependent vari-

ables. The results are consistent across the two occupational partitions and suggest a sig-

nificant role of CIPG in producing task-demand changes. Computer-intensive productivity

growth is positively associated with the share of analytical-intensive and manual-intensive

employment, and it is negatively associated with the share of routine-intensive employment.

The “polarization” effects are somewhat more extreme when we use managerial (as analyti-

cal intensive) and clerical (as routine intensive) occupations, but they are present in each of

the two specifications.

Was the effect of CIPG on task demand of native workers attenuated in areas with

more robust immigration? In particular, given the specific distribution of task specialization

among low skilled immigrants, did labor markets with easier access for immigrants offset

part of the shift in relative demand (routine to manual) with increases in immigrant supply?

As it could be already inferred from Figure 3, job market polarization among natives is less

pronounced at the low-end. Table 5 reports the changes of occupational employment shares

among natives between 1980 and 2010. Managerial and professional occupations, whose

task specialization is prevalently analytical, increased their share by 7.6 percentage points

between 1980 and 2010. In the same period, the employment shares of clerical and ma-

chine operator (prevalently routine) and non-managerial/non-routine (prevalently manual)

occupations decreased by 10.6 and 2.4 percentage points, respectively.

To further analyze this question we run the following regression:

∆ykc,t = y
k
c,t − ykc,t−10 = βCIPGc,t + γ ˆ∆Fbc,t + δ(CIPGc,t ∗ ˆ∆Fbc,t) + φkd,t + ∆εkc,t (5)

where we have shortened the variable computer-intensive labor productivity growth as CIPGc,t

15



and the predicted immigrant inflows (or “Immigrant Shift-share”) as ˆ∆Fbc,t. We have then

included the interaction of these two terms. As ˆ∆Fbc,t captures the potential exposure to

larger supply of immigrants, due to a larger pre-existing network, the interaction term cap-

tures the impact of larger computer-intensive productivity growth in an environment with

potentially larger immigration inflows. If immigration attenuates the demand shift driven by

CIPG on natives in the low-range of wages, such interaction should have a positive effect on

native routine task specialization and clerical employment, and a negative effect on native

manual task specialization and non-managerial/non-clerical employment. The coefficients

on this interaction (as well as those on the main effects) are reported in Table 6. Computer-

intensive productivity growth simultaneously attracts immigrants and pushes workers toward

manual jobs. Commuting zones with larger exposure to immigration, therefore, experienced

the first effect more intensively. Such inflows of immigrants increased the supply of man-

ual tasks, attenuating the increase in relative demand of manual tasks for natives. The

interaction term shows a negative coefficient on manual tasks of natives (both measured as

manual task or non-clerical occupations) and a positive coefficient on the routine tasks of

natives (statistically significant when we measure “clerical occupations”).9 The main effect

of computer-intensive productivity growth (row 2, column 1 of the table) is still negative on

routine tasks, but the effect is reduced in CZs with large immigration.10

If employment does not fully respond to the relative demand changes described above,

wages for routine-intensive jobs should decline and those for manual-intensive jobs should

increase in areas of fast computer-intensive growth. However, exposure to larger immigrant

supply should attenuate these wage effects on natives. This is exactly what is reported in

Table 7. Computer-intensive productivity growth depressed routine wages, but the effect

was attenuated in large-immigration areas, while the rise in manual wages from computer

growth was likewise attenuated in the presence of large immigrant inflow (we will discuss

how immigration can put upward pressure on wages overall in the next section).11

9Figure A1 in the Appendix reports the marginal effects of the computer-intensive productivity measure
on task specialization and occupational shares over the distribution of the 1980-2010 changes in the low-
skilled immigration share.

growth: Labor Productivityc,t =

∑
j Empl Shj,c,1980 ∗∆ log(wagej,−c,t). The main results are robust to the

inclusion of this measure although we loose some precision given the high correlation of the two variables.
11Table A6 in the Appendix reports a similar robustness check to the one we performed for task special-

16



To give an idea of the magnitude of these effects, let’s compare two commuting zones,

one at the 10th percentile and one at the 90th percentile of the 1980–2010 change in im-

migrant share distribution: Winston-Salem (NC) and College Station (TX), respectively.12

A one percent increase in computer-intensive productivity would increase clerical/sales oc-

cupational wages by 1.17 percentage points in College Station relative to Winston-Salem,

which corresponds to a 0.21 percent increase in College Station and a 0.96 percent decrease

in Winston-Salem. Similarly, the wages of services/construction/transportation jobs would

decrease in College Station relative to Winston-Salem by 1.31 percentage points (which cor-

responds to a marginal effects difference of -1.14 and 0.17, respectively).13

Note that, in combining the insights from Tables 6 and 7, we see something interesting

— in high-immigration areas like College Station computerization generates both higher

employment and higher wages for routine-worker natives, compared with low immigration

areas like Winston-Salem. It suggests that immigrants are not merely pushing out natives

into routine jobs — they help raise the demand for routine jobs and hence attenuate their

wage decline. The upshot here is that mid-skilled natives in places like Winston-Salem are

predicted to suffer from the de-routinization of technology more strongly because they do

not benefit from the attenuating effects of migrant inflows.

When focusing on low skilled immigration it is natural to analyze the impact at low levels

of the wage distribution, specifically for routine and manual intensive jobs. It is less clear

whether immigration affected polarization at the high end of the wage distribution. On the

one hand, migrants with high manual-task ability can raise the demand for jobs requiring

analytical task content. On the other hand, immigrants can bring their own analytical skills,

raising the supply of analytical workers overall. Table 8 shows the impact of computer-

intensive productivity growth and its interaction with immigration intensity on the share of

analytical jobs and on the wage for natives. The interaction effect is not statistically signif-

icant for employment (first two columns) and depending on the definition of analytical task

ization and occupational shares. When we include a generic measure of labor productivity growth the sign
and magnitude of the main effects hold, but we loose some precision in the estimates.

12Winston-Salem increase in immigrant share between 1980 and 2010 was equal to 0.1 percentage point,
while it was 15.7 percentage points in College Station.

on occupational wages over the distribution of the 1980-2010 changes in the low-skilled immigration share.

17



specialization and managerial occupation share, the point estimate is positive or negative.

The interaction on native wages for Manager-professionals is negative and borderline signif-

icant. The evidence on how immigration affects polarization at the high end in response to

technology is thus not very clear.14

Summarizing the empirical findings of this section we can say the following. (i) We con-

structed a computer-intensive productivity growth measure for the period 1980–2010, which

is negatively correlated with routine-task demand and positively correlated with manual-task

demand. (ii) This computer-intensive growth, which we take as a measure of local computer-

ization of production, was strongly associated with immigration of both high and low skilled

foreign workers. (iii) In areas of higher immigration the impact of computer-driven produc-

tivity growth on routine relative to manual employment was attenuated, as was the effect

on routine relative to manual wages.

4 Model

To rationalize these results, we now consider a model in which computer-capital deepening, as

a result of lowering its price, drives changes in labor productivities, wages and immigration.

A simplified version of this model is discussed in the Appendix section A4 — in this and

subsequent sections we lay out the full theory. We begin with a framework similar to Autor

and Dorn (2013), and we extend it to include endogenous changes to the supply of labor

through immigration, as the inflow of immigrants respond to domestic wage changes. In the

model we mainly focus on unskilled immigration. This group has been a very important

portion of immigration in the 30 years since 1980, and as we show in the previous section,

it seems crucial to the mechanism of comparative advantages and specialization in response

to technological change. This will be the focus of our analysis. We include the possibility

of skilled immigration in subsequent discussion, although we do not focus on immigrants’

ability to innovate and specialize in technological jobs, as some other recent studies have

done (e.g. Bound et al., 2017 and Jaimovich and Siu, 2017).

14Table A7 report the robustness checks including the generic measure of labor productivity growth. The
main effects hold although the estimates of the interaction term are often not statistically significant at
conventional levels.

The economy consists of two sectors which produce goods, denoted as g, and services,

denoted as s. They are imperfectly substitutable in the utility of the representative agent in

the economy. For simplicity we solve the social planner’s problem (which produces the same

result as general equilibrium) and hence we maximize:

(
ρC

σ−1
σ

s + (1− ρ)C
σ−1
σ

g

) σ
σ−1

, (6)

subject to the constraints discussed below. Here Cs and Cg are per capita consumption

of services and goods, respectively, and ρ is the relative weight placed on services in the

representative agent utility function. The parameter σ ≤ 1 determines the elasticity of
substitution between goods and services. We will assume throughout that σ > 0, so that

goods and services grossly complement each other in utility. 15

There are three basic factors of production — “computer capital” (K) which we some-

times call “computers” for simplicity, skilled or analytical labor (La), and unskilled labor

(U). The difference between skilled and unskilled labor is that an individual has to pay an

education (training) cost to be skilled so that she can supply her labor as analytical. As

the cost of training is paid every period and we are implicitly assuming that skills are fully

used in the production of a final good, one can think of a model as representing infinitely

lived households, with successive generations of people with independent skills and educa-

tion. This is a simple way of modeling costly human capital acquisition. Computer capital

and skilled labor can only work in goods production (manufacturing). Unskilled labor can

be employed in either manufacturing or services. However unskilled workers are heteroge-

neous and they supply different “ability” levels in performing the “routine” tasks that are

needed in manufacturing, and we denote their total supply of these tasks as Lr. They can

also supply non-routine (service) tasks in the service production (whose supply we denote

as Ls). Individuals have different relative abilities in routine tasks and we will discuss this

later. The total effective supply of unskilled workers U , therefore, is split between routine

and service supply so that U = Lr + Ls.

Consumption of services and goods are subject to the following resource constraints:

15This is an important assumption, adopted also in Autor and Dorn (2013), justified by the fact that
goods and services are quite differentiated from each other.

19



Cs = Ys , (7)

Cg = Yg − pkK − paLa , (8)

where Ys is total production of services, Yg is total production of goods, pk is the price of

computer capital, and pa is the price of analytical skills. We have standardized the price

of the manufacturing good to one. Equation (8) shows that in each period resources, in

the form of goods, must be paid to obtain physical and human capital in this economy.

Essentially part of total income in the economy goes each period to investment in human

capital and training to upgrade workers from unskilled to skilled. We will also assume that

computer capital depreciates completely each period, and so will need to be replenished each

period. The price (of physical and human capital) are exogenously given. These prices may

be thought of as the technological efficiency of converting goods into physical and human

capital units. Hence, in a broad sense, they represent the cost of computer capital and

schooling. The exogenous decline in the cost of computer capital will be the exogenous

technological force at the basis of all the changes that we will analyze. Unskilled service

workers produce services with a linear technology and have all the same productivity in

those tasks, so that with a standardization of units we can write the production function

in the service sector as: Ys = Ls. Goods, instead, are produced according to the following

function:

Yg =
[
(αaLa)

β +Xβ
]1/β

, (9)

where

X = [Lγr +K
γ]1/γ . (10)

Here X is a CES aggregator, composed of routine labor services Lr and computer capital.

The elasticity of substitution between analytical labor services and the term X is 1/(1− β),
β < 1. The elasticity of substitution between routine labor and capital within the composite

X is 1/(1 − γ), γ < 1. We make the key assumptions that routine labor and capital are

20



grossly substitutable, which implies 0 > γ > 1. This property is consistent with the fact

that computer capital, in the form of increasingly efficient computers, has substituted many

routine tasks such as data entry, typing, classifying, book keeping and other similar tasks.

We also assume that analytical labor and the capital aggregate are grossly complementary,

which implies β < 0, reflecting the higher productivity of analytical and creative abilities

when the supply of computer capital increased. We will also assume that αa > 1 to reflect

the idea that analytical labor has greater productivity potential than routine labor. All this

is already contained in Autor and Dorn (2013).

Labor and Skill Amounts

All workers are paid their respective marginal products. The total amount of labor in the

economy will be made up of a unitary mass of native workers plus a mass of migrants, mig,

that flows into the economy in response to labor productivity and wage growth (more on

this below). Native workers are indexed by their routine ability which equals ηi for worker

i. We consider this as an endowment distributed in the population as described below.

ηi takes on positive values ranging from 0 to ∞. This can be thought, more precisely, as
the ability to perform routine tasks relative to the ability to perform manual/service tasks

which is common to all workers and standardized to one. We also assume that the process

of education/training for worker i is equivalent to an “upgrade” of her endowment-ability

to an acquired level, proportional to the initial level, φηi. The parameter φ > 1 is the

proportional increase in productivity due to training if she expends a lump sum amount of

pa (in units of goods) in training. This price represents a cost of “education” (or training)

and our assumptions capture the idea that education will proportionally increase the innate

productivity of a worker. Let us emphasize that becoming a skilled (analytical) workers also

produces another effect — it provides workers access to a different labor market, specifically

that for workers in the manufacturing sector who supply analytical services. Alternatively,

if they remain unskilled, native workers may choose whether to work in service production,

or use their routine ability in manufacturing production.

As a consequence of our assumptions there are two relevant ability thresholds for native

workers. Specifically, we call η∗ the ability level at which a worker would be indifferent

21



between being either a low-skilled manual/service worker or a low-skilled routine worker.

For all endowments of η < η∗ workers will prefer to supply manual services to the service

sector, as this would provide them a higher compensation. For η > η∗ workers will supply

routine services to the goods-producing sector. Let η̂ instead be the threshold at which a

worker would be indifferent between being either a low-skilled routine worker or paying the

education cost to become a high-skilled analytical worker. Thus the two thresholds can be

characterized by the following conditions:

wrη
∗ = ws, (11)

waφη̂ − pa = wrη̂, (12)

where wr, ws and wa are the market wages paid to routine, service and analytical labor

respectively, and pa is the training cost to be able to supply analytical labor.

Finally, we assume that native workers’ ability is distributed as a negative exponential

over the interval [0,∞]. The density is given by f(η) = λe−λη, where λ > 0, and the total
mass of native labor force is standardized to 1.

A key novelty of our model is to introduce an immigration response to wages and to allow

immigrants to supply abilities that are different from those of natives. We model the supply

and the abilities of immigrants in a very simple way. We focus on a case in which immigrants

are all unskilled, and we standardize their ability endowment to be equal among them and low

enough that they will always supply manual tasks with a productivity of one (we introduce

the possibility of skilled migrants in a later section). This assumption captures the fact that

unskilled immigrants are likely to have a higher relative productivity in manual service tasks

which are easily transferred across countries (cooking, cleaning, building, gardening) rather

than in routine tasks that are more specifically related to manufacturing and working with

machines, and more related to communication-oriented tasks. We assume that unskilled

migration is negatively related to a cost of migration pms , and positively related to service

wages ws in the economy, as unskilled immigrants can only work in that sector. Note that

pms can include the wages earned by the migrant in their country of origin — in this case

22



it can be interpreted as an opportunity cost of migrating. Such costs are not a function

of changes in the host economy, and so we treat pms as exogenous. We assume a simple

functional form that implies a log linear supply response to wages, which is qualitatively in

line with a simple model of immigration choice, such as Grogger and Hanson (2011). The

reduced form immigration equation is as follows:

mig =





(1 + ws)
�s − (1 + psm), if (1 + ws)�s − 1 > psm,

0, otherwise,

(13)

where mig is the mass of unskilled migrants and �s, (�s > 0) governs the extent to which

unskilled migrants respond to potential income in the host economy. A low value of �s can

mean that service wages do not translate into much utility for immigrants, while a high value

of �s suggests that wage earnings translate strongly into utility and this would then have a

strong effect on their labor supply. This parameter captures the sensitivity of immigration

flows to changes in unskilled wage in the destination country, an elasticity that several

papers estimate to be positive and significant (e.g., Mayda, 2010). It will be determined by

a combination of the distribution of unobserved skills of immigrants, and by immigration

policies.

Under the assumptions described above the total effective supply (i.e. weighted for units

of ability/efficiency) of routine and analytical labor can be written as follows:

Lr =

∫ η̂

η∗
ηλe−ληdη, (14)

La =

∫ ∞

η̂

φηλe−ληdη. (15)

The total mass of unskilled service workers on the other hand is given by

Ls = mig +

∫ η∗

0

λe−ληdη, (16)

wheremig is the endogenously determined total mass of unskilled immigrants in the economy.

All immigrants here are assumed to be unskilled, and they have an average ability equal to

23



one, so that they only supply service labor in an amount effectively equal to their mass.

There will be 1 +mig total individuals in the economy between native and foreign-born.

The distribution of potential analytical and routine skills remains fixed in the economy.

However, changes in technology will have wage effects. These will then change η∗, η̂ and

mig, and these will cause adjustments in equilibrium labor amounts.

4.1 Equilibrium Conditions

What characterizes an equilibrium in this simple economy? For exogenously given pa, pk,

psm and �s, we must have the demands of each factor (La, Lr, Ls and K) equal the respective

supply of each. Demand is determined by what each factor provides marginally. These are

given below:

∂Yg
∂K

The supplies of each labor type will be determined by the threshold levels of human

capital — the amount endowed to the person indifferent between routine and service work,

and that endowned to the person indifferent between routine and analytical work. These are

given by

η∗ =
ws
wr
, (21)

24



η̂ =
pa

φwa − wr
. (22)

Finally, solving (14), (15) and (16) allows us to solve for equilibrium amounts of total

skilled and unskilled employment:

Lr =
(λη∗ + 1)

λ
e−λη

∗ − (λη̂ + 1)
λ

e−λη̂, (23)

La =
φ (λη̂ + 1)

λ
e−λη̂, (24)

Ls = 1 +mig − λe−λη
∗
. (25)

A formal equilibrium is thus given by solving the system of equations (13), (17), (18),

(19), (20), (21), (22), (23), (24), and (25) for values of mig, K, wr, wa, ws, η
∗, η̂, Lr, La,

and Ls.

What are the channels for immigration to affect the equilibrium wages and employment

levels of natives? As mig rises we might expect unskilled wages ws to fall as immigrants

increase the supply of unskilled service workers (20). This, however, also lowers η∗, the

routine-skill/service threshold for natives (21), which then generates a larger number of

native workers choosing routine tasks in manufacturing increasing the routine supply in the

economy (23).

Note that higher levels of services should also raise the relative value of goods in the

economy. Such an effect can be considered as the “demand effect” of immigrants, who

produce more services but they also contribute to the demand of complementary goods. And

this effect attracts additional capital (as the price of capital is exogenously determined),

which should then raise the value of analytical skills, which complements this capital in

production (19), to the advantage of native workers. Note that this also implies that the

threshold level of analytical skills in the economy should then fall (22), generating more

analytical skills in the economy as well (24).

Of course, migration itself is endogenous in our model. To see if the results suggested

25



above hold when unskilled migration is treated endogenously, we next turn to simulation.

4.2 Parameter Values and Model Simulation

In this model we produce one type of exogenous shock to the economy — improvements in

technology, represented by exogenous decreases in the price of capital, pk, each time period.

By so doing we can observe the impact of such changes on the flow of unskilled immigration,

as well as the general equilibrium effects on native earnings and employment each time

period.

Specifically, we simulate technological improvement by exogenously lowering the price of

capital, pk more than 40 percent cumulatively. We decrease pk from 4 to 2.8 over 30 periods,

roughly mimicking the IT-revolution in the US economy from 1980–2010.16 For unskilled

migration, we set pm = (1 + ws)
� − 1 before any technological progress, so that there is zero

migrants to start. For our chosen value of � = 30, the cumulative drop in pk, and our baseline

parameter values (described below), this produces a roughly 6.5 percent cumulative increase

in unskilled labor due to migration. We both show the evolution of the economy over time,

and report cumulative percent changes from period 1 to 30 (baseline case). This roughly

mimics the rise in unskilled immigrants as share of the population observed in the United

States for the past three decades (as described, for instance in Chapter 2-3 of Borjas 2014).

For reasonable parameter values we first must ensure that β < 0 (X and La are grossly

complementary), γ > 0 (K and Lr are grossly substitutable), σ > 0 (Cg and Cs are grossly

complementary in utility), and αa > 1 (analytical labor is more productive than routine

labor). Parameters are set to the following: αa = 1.75, β = −10, γ = 0.5, ρ = 0.5,
σ = 0.5, φ = 2, pa = 0.25, λ = 0.05. This parameterization satisfies the above conditions,

and it produces relative sizes of the three types of initial labor amounts that match the

corresponding relative employment levels around 1980 of what we have defined as analytical,

routine and service workers (shown in Table 2).17

16In the simulation one period can correspond to one year.
17Specifically, initial shares of native employment are Na = 0.27, Nr = 0.35, and Ns = 0.38. Other

combinations of parameter values can generate a similar balance of initial labor amounts. These do not
change the qualitative findings of the theory. A fuller description of parameterization is provided in the
appendix.

26



We demonstrate both the directional changes in the model diagrammatically, and the

we show quantitative magnitudes of changes in tables. Figures 4 to 8 and the left-hand-

side diagrams in Figures A3 through A7 (in the appendix) demonstrate our simulations

through 30 periods (the right-hand-side diagrams are cases with both low and high skilled

immigration, which we discuss in the next section). Table A9 displays the magnitudes of

these changes. We demonstrate two basic cases. The first case is where � = 0, illustrated

with solid blue lines. In this case no immigration takes place as computerization occurs.

The second case is our baseline where � = 30, illustrated with red dashed lines. Here we

observe moderate endogenous migration of a magnitude roughly consistent with the U.S.’s

experience during the three decades of 1980–2010 and computerization in the form of the

decrease in price of capital.

From these simulation exercises we discover a number of interesting and informative

findings which parallel our empirical findings. We summarize these below:

1) Technological progress without migration generates labor market polariza-

tion. That is technological progress produces an increase in employment for analytical and

service workers while it produces a decline of employment for routine workers. We demon-

strate this in Figure 4. Here we have � = 0 so there is no migration, only exogenous decreases

in capital prices. For native workers we observe a rise in analytical employment (cumula-

tively equal to 14 percent of employment), a fall in routine employment (by 21 percent), and

a rise in manual service employment (by 9.6 percent). The latter two effects echo Autor and

Dorn (2013).

The rise in analytical work here differs from Autor and Dorn, as they hold this em-

ployment level fixed. But this matches quite nicely our empirical findings demonstrated in

Table 4. Using either measure of skill level (task-based or occupation-based), we observe

computerization increase employment polarization for native workers.

The model also generates wage polarization. This is clear from Table A9 — wages for

analytical labor rises relative to routine labor. And wages for service labor also rise relative

to routine labor. We thus see that computer capital growth in the model produces the kind

of polarization observed in the United States over the last few decades.

2) Technological progress attracts low-skilled migrants. This can be seen in Figure

27



5. As capital rises due to exogenous capital price declines, it lifts all wages, including those

for manual-intensive service workers. This induces more foreign workers to pay the cost

pm to enter the economy and earn (1 + ws)
�s − 1. For our illustrated baseline case, where

�s = 30, we observe a technologically-induced immigrant inflow of roughly 6.5 percent of

the total original workforce in the simulation. This finding matches the empirical results

shown in Table 3 — our empirical proxy of computer intensive productivity growth, strongly

correlates with low-skilled immigration, even more than with high-skilled immigration.

Thus, both empirically and theoretically, we show that low-skilled migration is a natural

concomitant to economic growth. While this implication is straightforward, as long as im-

migrants respond to local wages, it has important implications for policy. Efforts to staunch

the flow of migrants should be careful not to damage the fundamental source of this flow, or

else risk productivity improvements more generally.

3) Immigration tends to reverse the de-routinization of native employment

from technological change. In Figure 6, we observe that while technology hollows out

routine employment among native workers (solid blue line), unskilled immigration tends

to reverse this by putting downward pressure on η∗ (red dashed line). Specifically, in the

simulation we see that computerization lowers native employment in routine occupations by

roughly 21 percent over 30 periods. With our baseline case of moderate unskilled migration,

computerization lowers native employment in these positions by only 14 percent.

Again, our empirical findings lend support to this, both in terms of direction and mag-

nitude. We see this in Table 6 by observing the estimated coefficient on the cross-term

Computer-Intensive Labor Productivity X Share of Immigration. This is the empirical

equivalent of the difference between the blue line and the red dashed line in the simula-

tion graph of Figure 6 — immigration induced by computerization reverses the employment

polarization for natives. Given that immigration is itself responding to technological changes,

greater openness to migrant inflows should be associated with less de-routinization, even as

computerization rises.

4) Immigration raises the total earnings of routine native workers. The model

demonstrates that immigration tends to increase capital even more given the price level of

capital, raising overall production in manufacturing goods. This is an interesting and novel

28



technological spillover from unskilled migration not observable by past partial equilibrium

studies. One important implication of this is that any negative wage impact from unskilled

migration are somewhat mitigated for all natives. Partial equilibrium analysis misses this

ancillary effect from migration.

Figure 7 demonstrates that higher unskilled immigration tends to raise the total earnings

of both native routine workers and native analytical workers. Specifically, because immigra-

tion produces an extra boost to capital, greater migration partially reverses the negative

effect on total earnings for routine workers, and strengthens the positive effect on total earn-

ings for analytical workers. Both wages and employment are raised by migrant flows for

natives who employ their mid- or high-level skills.

Empirically, we can observe the impact of immigration on the wages of routine workers in

Table 7. Again, we look to the estimated coefficient on the cross term. Here we see that the

extra supply of unskilled immigrants naturally pushes down services wages, but also pushes

up routine wages. Combining this with the rise in routine employment documented in Table

6, we see the empirical validation of the theory that the decrease in routine earnings causes

by computer technology is attenuated by migration.

5) Immigration generates skill upgrading among native workers. With unskilled

immigration, some erstwhile routine workers end up paying the fixed cost of schooling to

upgrade to become analytical workers (η̂ falls). We can see this in Figure 8 — endogenous

migration strengthens the skilling effects of technology for analytical work.

An important implication here is that unskilled immigration can lead natives to upgrade

their education, and thus to become more productive in the workforce. This is an idea

supported empirically by works such as Hunt (2016).

Note however the possibility that skilled migrants accompany these unskilled migrants

(the details of how skilled workers enter are provided in the next section). This would gener-

ate an extra influx of analytical skills into the economy and thus would tend to push natives

back into routine-task occupations. The case with skilled migration along with unskilled

migration is demonstrated in the upper right panel of Figure A4. Here it is clear that the

ability of skilled migrants to enter shifts the curves downward (greater skilled immigrants

enter even with no unskilled migrants), and also flattens them a bit (greater unskilled mi-

29



grants are accompanied by even more skilled migrants). When considering all migrants,

the ultimate employment and wage impacts for analytical natives is then ambiguous. This

ambiguity is captured empirically by Table 8 in which the effect of openness to immigration

interacted with CIPG is not found to be statistically significant.

Overall, the model captures key elements of the empirical findings. Further, we present a

simplified version of the model in the Appendix. Though the simpler model abstracts from

the polarization aspects of our discussions here, it nonetheless echoes the basic findings we

have presented, namely that unskilled migrants help natives upgrade their skills, and thus

help bolster their earnings as a result.

Figure 9 provides some intuition regarding our overall results. Here we generate from

the model demand and supply schedules for unskilled immigration into the economy. The

horizontal axis shows immigrants as share of the population. Supply curves slope upward

— these simply plot equation (13) in m − ws space. Demand curves slope downward —
these simply plot the utility-maximizing values of ws for given amounts of migrants (see

equation 20) and their slope is determined by the fact that at higher costs of service labor

people will demand less services. At point A there is no technological progress or any

migration. Exogenous decreases in the price of capital, ceteris paribus, shifts the demand

for migrants to Demand2. This relates to point 2 — lower capital prices will naturally lead

to greater unskilled immigration. However, there are also general equilibrium effects with

such change. Growth in capital also leads to shifts in native employment, as natives upgrade

their skills (points 3 and 5). This produces even greater productivity and capital growth in

the economy, shifting demand to Demand3 and fostering more unskilled immigration. Point

B demonstrates the full results, where both wages and immigration robustly increase as a

consequence of computerization.

4.3 Introducing Skilled Migrants

We extend the basic analysis described above by including skilled migrants on top of unskilled

(service) migrants. These two groups will be treated separately, and there are no immigrant

routine workers. This captures the bi-modality of immigrant skills in the United States

who, as shown for instance in Peri (2016), are particularly concentrated among less educated

30



manual workers and highly educated professionals in cognitive-intensive jobs.

Each group must pay a fixed cost to enter the economy. Unskilled immigrants pay pm, just

as before. The immigrant analytical worker on the other hand earns ηm [(1 + wa)
�a − 1] after

paying a fixed cost pma , where ηm is the analytical ability of the skilled immigrant, and 0 ≤
�a < 1 governs the earnings of the skilled migrant. Notice that we allow skilled immigrants

to have different moving cost relative to unskilled, which is possibly due to their higher

adaptability (if migrants are heterogeneous) or their higher options to remain in touch with

the country of origin. This is a plausible and general assumption and adopted by Grogger

and Hanson (2011) among others. Also note that earnings for the skilled migrant rises with

�a for any wa > 0 — as �a approaches one, the skilled immigrant earnings approaches that

of the skilled native. ηm is distributed in the same way as for native workers. Let η̄ be

the amount of analytical ability held by the immigrant indifferent between staying home or

paying the fixed cost to work as an analytical worker here. Then

η̄ [(1 + wa)
�a − 1] = pam. (26)

Given this, we now have two sources of abstract labor:

La =

∫ ∞

η̂

φηλe−ληdη +

∫ ∞

η̄

ηλe−ληdη. (27)

The first term is the total amount of analytical skill supplied by natives; the second term is

the total amount of analytical skill supplied by migrants.

Again, we simulate technological improvement by exogenously lowering the price of capi-

tal, pk, by the same amount as before, and look at cases with low and high levels of unskilled

migrants. Now, however, we allow for endogenous inflows of skilled migrants as well.18

Technological changes will then change η∗, η̂, η̄ and mig, and these will cause different ad-

justments in equilibrium labor amounts. In our simulations we now solve equilibrium values

for η∗, η̂, η̄, Lr, La, Ls, K, wr, wa, ws, and mig.

Results from these simulations are illustrated in the right-hand-side panels of Appendix

Figures A3 to A7 where we replicate the simulations for no entry of unskilled migrants

18In these cases �a = 1.5 for all simulations.

31



(�s = 0), and baseline levels of unskilled migration (�s = 30), keeping the scales across

graphs the same for comparability.

As we can observe in the right side diagram of Figure A3, the initial economy is composed

of a sizable group of skilled migrants, and this group rises as computer capital grows over

time. From simulations of this case, we can suggest a number of other propositions:

7) Endogenous skilled migration attracts greater amounts of unskilled mi-

grants and capital. We can observe magnified increases in both the left diagram of Figure

A3 (greater mig), and the lower-right diagram of Figure A5 (greater K). Skilled migration

complements both capital (through production) and service workers (through utility). As

a result greater ease of skilled migration raises the flow of unskilled migration as well as of

capital.

Given that the inclusion of skilled migrants magnifies the rise of both computer capital

and unskilled migrants, one might wonder if the earlier suggestions of the model hold in this

case.

8) Points 2–5 raised above remain consistent with skilled migration. While

quantitative magnitudes may differ, the overall patterns on native employment and wages

from unskilled migration remain the same as before. First, technological growth attracts

unskilled migrants. In fact, this growth creates an even greater attraction, as skilled migrants

flow in as well, and these workers further complement unskilled workers. Next, unskilled

migrants help natives reverse de-routinization. We can observe this in the bottom diagrams

of Figure A4. While the flow of skilled workers tends to shift up routine-labor supply,

unskilled migration still partially reverses the outflow of natives from routine jobs.

It is also still the case that unskilled immigration raises the earnings for routine and

analytical native workers (right side diagrams in Figure A6), and that unskilled immigration

helps natives upgrade to analytical tasks (upper right diagram of Figure A4). Note however

that the inclusion of skilled migrants shift these curves down. If migrants include both skilled

and unskilled workers, the net impact of these migrants on native earnings and skills can be

ambiguous, as suggested by our empirical results in Table 8.

32



5 Conclusions

In this paper, we provide new empirical evidence, and a theoretical explanation, of the

immigration response to computer-driven productivity growth, as well as new insights on how

the productive specialization of migrants has helped reshape computer-driven polarization.

Empirically, we show that immigration increased in Commuting Zones where computer-

intensive growth was stronger between 1980 and 2010. The results hold even when we

include a large set of CZs controls. The pull effect was especially strong on low-skilled

immigration. Then we show that different intensities of local immigration have affected the

extent to which computerization has produced job polarization of employment and wages of

natives. CZs that were more likely to attract low-skilled migrants, based on the presence

of a large immigrant network in 1980, had smaller declines in routine-intensive employment

and wages, and smaller increases in manual-service employment and wages for natives. As

a consequence, immigration seem to have slowed native job polarization at the low end of

the wage distribution. Immigration effects on polarization at the high end of the native skill

spectrum are less clear.

We rationalize these facts in a general equilibrium model with three tasks and an exoge-

nous decline in the price of capital. Our main contribution is to augment the traditional

model of job polarization with the possibility of an endogenous supply of low-skilled im-

migrants, who flow in the country in response to higher manual/service wages, and with

heterogeneity in productivity of low skilled workers. Immigrants are different from natives

in their larger relative productivity in manual services. The model simulations indicate sev-

eral novel facts that are in line with the empirical evidence. First, computerization attracts

low-skilled migrants, and this in turn tends to attenuate the downgrading of natives from rou-

tine to service jobs. Computerization produces a weaker polarization of native employment

and wages, especially at low skill levels, when immigrants respond to it.

These results have important implications for policy. Growing anti-immigrant sentiments

in the US and in Europe occur along with ever increasing labor market polarization. Our

model indicates that while immigrants are attracted by technological advances and may

compete with natives in manual intensive occupations, their general equilibrium effects on

33



the economy is that of reversing job and wage polarization for natives. This is because they

complement native skills and because they increase demand for goods produced. Policies

aimed at reducing immigration inflows, especially of low skilled, can have the unintended

consequences of weakening capital accumulation while simultaneously exacerbating native

job and wage polarization. Such policies often allege to assist middle-class Americans; they

may do precisely the opposite.

A5. Equilibrium of Simplified Model — Two Forms of Labor

and Exogenous Unskilled Migration

In this section we describe a simplified version of the full model. We do this to

show some analytical and straight-forward solutions, as well as to demonstrate

that our basic findings are consistent even in this more restrictive case.

Consider then the case of just two forms of labor — analytical and manual;

there is no routine labor (one can imagine an extreme case where routine labor

and capital are perfectly substitutable, with capital the more productive factor.

Routine labor then has become completely obsolete.). Utility is still given by:

(
ρC

σ−1
σ

s + (1 − ρ)C
σ−1
σ

g

) σ
σ−1

, (A1)

and consumption of services and goods have the same forms as before:

Cs = Ys = Ls , (A2)

Cg = Yg − pkK − paLa , (A3)

where Ys is total production of services, Yg is total production of manufactured

goods, pk is the price of capital, and pa is the price of analytical skills. Natives

now only have two options: they can be a manual worker, or they can pay pa to

employ their analytical skills in manufacturing. Production in manufacturing here

takes the simple Cobb-Douglas form:

Yg = (αaLa)
αK1−α. (A4)

Analytical skill is exponentially distributed as before, and total analytical labor

is still given by:

S-13



La = φ (η̂ + 1) e
−η̂, (A5)

and the threshold amount of skill (η̂) is given by equating the return to analytical

skilled labor and the return to manual labor for the threshold-individual:

waφη̂ − pa = ws. (A6)

As usual, labor-types and capital are paid their marginal products. Finally,

potential migrants are all unskilled, and contribute to the mass of manual workers.

This mass is thus given by

Ls = 1 +mig − e−η̂ (A7)

Comparative Statics

We wish to understand factors that may lead natives to increase or decrease skills.

The wage for these skills is given by

wa = α (αaLa)
α−1K1−α. (A8)

The price of capital, exogenously given, must equal the marginal productivity

of capital:

pk = (1 − α) (αaLa)αK−α. (A9)

Combining these and simplifying then gives us

wa = α (1 − α)
1−α
α p

α−1
α

k . (A10)

Right away, we see that the analytical wage is pinned down strictly by the price

S-14



of capital. As capital prices fall, the return on analytical skills rises. Notice also

that this implies there is no impact from unskilled immigration on analytical wages.

More on this below.

Unskilled immigration on the other hand is predicted to lower the unskilled

wage. To see this note that we can rearrange (A6), substitute in (A10), and get:

η̂ =
(ws + pa) p

1−α

We can take this expression and plug it into (A7) to solve for ws:

Finally, we have some simple comparative statics to suggest.

Proposition 1. ∂η̂
∂pk

> 0.

This is clear from equation (A11). It means that falling capital prices will result

in falling levels of η̂, which means more analytical labor in equilibrium. Capital

growth spurs education.

Proposition 2. ∂η̂
∂mig

=
(

∂η̂
∂ws

)(
∂ws
∂mig

)
< 0.

The first term being positive is clear from (A11); the second term being negative is

clear from (A12). It means that exogenous increases in unskilled migration results

in a falling education threshold, which means more analytical labor in equilibrium.

Immigration spurs education.

Proposition 3. ∂

∂pk∂mig
=

(
∂

∂η̂

)

∂ws

)(
∂ws
∂mig

)
< 0.

Again, the first term being positive is clear from (A11); the second term being

negative is clear from (A12). This suggests that skill enhancements from techno-

logical progress are accelerated with unskilled migration. Technological progress

and migration together spur education increases even more.

S-15



The key takeaway here is that unskilled migration spurs greater human capital

accumulation without hurting the earnings of those with human capital. The

reason is that the marginal productivity of capital here is pinned down by the

price of capital, which is exogenously given. As migrants push natives to higher

levels of education, it raises the productivity of capital, which spurs capital growth,

pushing analytical wages back up.

Relation to Conclusions from Main Model

So how does the simple theory here compare to the full theory described earlier?

This simple model cannot comment on certain points raised by the general theory,

since there is no possibility of polarization in this economy, and immigration is

treated exogenously. However, it does echo points 3 – 5.

Specifically, immigration is shown to drive natives up the skill distribution,

away from manual tasks and toward analytical tasks. Further, we know from

the general model that the negative impacts on native wages from migration are

mitigated, or even reversed, from the growth in capital that such migration fosters.

In this simplified case this suggestion is even more stark. Given (A10) skilled wages

are altogether unaffected by migration, so we find that the total earnings for skilled

natives must rise (greater supply of skills with same wage) with greater migration.

The more generalizable model points to the fact that unskilled immigration is

a benefit to middle-income Americans. The simple model here points to something

related — unskilled immigration is a benefit to those with at least some skills.

A6. Model Robustness

Finally, we note that the basic findings of the theory are quite robust to parameter-

ization. Essentially, what we require is that analytical labor and the capital-routine

labor aggregate are grossly complementary (β < 0), routine labor and capital are

S-16



grossly substitutable (γ > 0), goods and services are grossly complementary in

utility (σ > 0), and analytical workers are more productive than routine workers

in production (αa > 1). Each assumption remains uncontroversial in the literature.

We can however adjust parameters to observe quantitative changes to our base-

line results. How our results change, either positively or negatively, are summarized

in Tables A10–A11. Here we compare our baseline case where � = 30 illustrated

earlier with the same case but with a different parameter value. Each parameter

change creates a change both to the initial values of the variables (“shift”) and to

their growth paths as computer capital growth occurs (“over time”).

B. Data Appendix

The data used to construct our dependent and independent variables are drawn

from the US Census public use microdata as available from IPUMS (Ruggles et

al. 2015) and the US Bureau of Economic Analysis Input-Output Tables. We

use Census microdata from 1950, 1970 (aggregating two 1% metropolitan area

samples), 1980, 1990 and 2000 (5% samples), as well as the 2009-2011 American

Community Survey, which creates a 3% sample around 2010 that we use for that

year. We include in our sample all individuals age 18-65 not residing in group

quarters and not enrolled in school. We define employed an individual who worked

a positive amount of hours and had positive income from wages in the previous

year, excluding thus self-employed and unpaid family workers. Wages are measured

as the logarithm of weekly wages that we define as the total income from wages

divided by weeks worked in the previous year. All the dollar amounts are expressed

in $ as of 2010 adjusted using the BLS CPI-U All Items. The samples are weighted

by the product of the Census personal weight.

We define foreign born, or immigrants, all the individuals who are born abroad

(outside US territories), including those who become naturalized citizens. We

define low-skilled workers (or “high school or less”) as those with either 12 com-

S-18



pleted years of schooling and/or a high school or equivalent diploma, and as high-

skilled workers (or “college or more”) those with at least one year of college or

more. Following Autor and Dorn (2013), we define occupations based on the

IPUMS variable OCC1990, aggregating the classification in order to construct a

consistent set for the entire sample period. We construct the three group of oc-

cupations, managerial/professional/technicians, clerical/sales/operators, and ser-

vices/construct/transp, further aggregating up the occupations following Autor

and Dorn (2013). To construct the task specialization measure we match each of

the 330 occupation categories to the intensity of manual, routine and analytical

tasks performed on the job as described by the 1977 BLS Dictionary of Occupa-

tional Titles (Autor and Dorn, 2013). We directly use these measures to construct

three indexes of task specialization which represent the percentiles of each occupa-

tion in the distribution of occupations ranked by task in 1980 (weighted by 1980

occupational employment). Each worker, therefore, has an index that reflects her

specialization in analytical, routine and manual tasks, which we then aggregate by

Census year and Commuting Zone. Table A1 lists the ten occupations with the

highest value of each task intensity index as of 1980.

We use as main geographical unit of analysis 722 Commuting Zones that en-

compass the 48 adjoining US states, thus dropping Alaska and Hawaii. Commuting

Zones are clusters of counties that are characterized by strong within-cluster and

weak between-cluster commuting ties, thus capturing the boundaries of local labor

markets (Tolbert and Sizer, 1996; Autor and Dorn, 2013; Basso and Peri, 2016).

In order to match the geographic information contained in the IPUMS data (SEA

in the 1950 Census, County Group in the 1970 and 1980 Census, PUMA in the

1990 and 2000 Census, and in the 2009-2011 ACS) to Commuting Zones we use

the crosswalk developed by Autor and Dorn (2013) (as available on David Dorn’s

website, http://www.ddorn.net/data.htm). Hence we multiply the person weights

described above with an adjustment factor that accounts for the fraction of a

S-19



SEA/County Group/PUMA that maps to a given Commuting Zone.

The proxy for computerization that we adopt measures the growth in labor pro-

ductivity overweighing the importance computer and electronic products as inputs

and exploiting the heterogeneity in the US local labor market industrial structure.

Using the Census IPUMS microdata, we calculate the share of employment in each

industry and Commuting Zone in 1980. We interact its numerator with the share

of “Computer and electronic products” as share of overall inputs of the sector in

1980 measured from the Bureau of Economic Analysis BEA Input-Output (I-O)

Use Tables (and we normalize the denominator by the overall use “Computer and

electronic products” as share of inputs in the local economy). In order to match

the BEA industrial definition with that of IPUMS, we first aggregate the IPUMS

variable IND1990 in order to create a consistent set of industries across Census

years. Then, following the definition of industries in the I-O Tables provided by

the BEA, we match the industries to IND1990. Finally, we interact the newly con-

structed weights, ωj,c,1980, with the decennial change in the national log wage for

the industry (i.e., in the entire set of CZs, but its own CZ level). The computer-

intensive productivity growth (CIPG) for each CZ c and Census year t is thus

calculated as follows:

CIPGc,t =
∑

j

ωj,c,1980 ∗ ∆ log(wagej,−c,t),

where industries are indexed by j and ωj,c,1980 =
emplj,c,1980(

ComputerInputj,1980
TotInputj,1980

)

∑
j emplj,c,1980(

ComputerInputj,1980
TotInputj,1980

)
. In

words, the measure captures the industry-specific productivity growth interacted

with the computer intensity of the industry in 1980, and then allocated to a Com-

muting Zone in proportion of its 1980 employment share across industries.
