{"automation": "November 29 2018 The Willard InterContinental HotelThe President s Management Agenda lays out a long term vision for modernizing government In this model agencies not only update their technology but also leverage their data effectively and perhaps most importantly build the right workforce to move into the future Agencies must become future forward delivering on their mission goals while also providing outstanding citizen service At this event we will release survey findings on what the reaction and actions have been for agencies since the PMA was released in March along with several panel sessions focused on where government is on its future forward journey from finding efficiencies with automation to getting Cloud Smart and attracting a skilled workforce Apple has integrated 9 000 trees into its futuristic new headquarters campus reflecting research showing that greenery in workplaces increases productivity by 15 percent Several years ago Google s People Analytics division launched Project Aristotle to understand the components of productive teams embracing research that groups are more creative than individuals Private sector businesses are automating tedious tasks augmenting workers with artificial intelligence technologies reskilling and upskilling their workforces focusing on employee wellness and hungrily recruiting talent Government will have to catch up Perhaps nowhere is the gap between the public and private sector greater than in workforce management Most public sector organizations are still locked into decades old employee policies such as rigid job classifications lockstep pay and a reliance on seniority as a substitute for capability The reality is that government agencies are increasingly called upon to address society s most complex challenges while using workforce approaches rooted in the distant past The good news Change is possible and beginning to happen A new Deloitte study explores some of the ways the nature of government work the public workforce itself and the workplace it occupies will all need to continue to evolve Work New technologies can transform the capabilities of a government worker Artificially intelligent chatbots for example can perform triage on citizen questions freeing human attention for less routine queries The Army s recruitment chatbot SGT STAR does the work of 55 recruiters answering 94 percent of questions A Deloitte analysis of AI s potential found that automation could save the federal government as much as 1 2 billion hours of work annually What AI doesn t automate it can enhance Child welfare caseworkers who according to one study spend just 9 percent of their time with children but 37 5 percent of their time on paperwork could use technology to auto populate documentation freeing time for visits AI also can correlate hospital truancy and arrest records to flag children in danger Some restaurant health inspectors already analyze big data to identify likely candidates for inspections In Chicago for instance tests found 24 percent more critical violations and on average isolated dangers from the food system a week earlier For effective work redesign it s helpful to adopt a two pronged strategy of zooming in and zooming out A zooming in approach hones in on individual tasks and processes that have the most potential to be optimized through automation Zooming out entails looking at the bigger picture to define what work redesign means for entire job classifications departments and the organization as a whole Workforce Specialists in fields like cybersecurity agile development and artificial intelligence are not likely to commit decades to one government position and if they did they d still need to swap into the tech sector periodically to sharpen their skills That s why some government technology programs are taking a tour of duty approach letting private sector experts serve in the public sector for a few years on specific projects without locking them into a lifetime of government work At the federal level the General Services Administration s 18F digital services agency the Oak Ridge Institute for Science Education and the Presidential Innovation Fellows program all help government solve problems with temporary outside hires At the state level Michigan s Cyber Civilian Corps a volunteer group of cybersecurity professionals from the private sector and academia as well as government can be called upon if the governor declares a cyber emergency And long term government workers don t need to be stuck in one place A talent cloud can prepare for unexpected staffing needs by identifying in advance workers with special skills and applying them to tasks suited to their expertise Canada is experimenting with letting multiple agencies dip into a talent cloud and hire workers for specific missions Workers keep their union membership rights and benefits but may be called into service by any agency Workplace Empirical science rarely guides hiring But management is becoming more data driven Applying the newest science on team building personal efficiency and employee wellness to government agencies can upgrade the workplace to better attract retain and utilize talent Insights from studies of the composition and functioning of effective teams can inform decisions about using talents more effectively Organizational network analysis for example can use metadata from emails and other sources to map communication patterns in organizations accurately predicting individuals who will be high performers detecting unsatisfied employees six months before they actually quit and identifying leadership behaviors that correlate with success Modern workplace wellness programs are also extremely impactful Improving employee wellness can reduce lost work days increase retention and fuel productivity After the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center provided a physician and nurse case manager for employees it saw an 80 percent decline in lost work days over six years for a cost savings of 1 5 million In short the future of government work will require a level of dynamic workforce management far beyond the current practices of the public sector The potential for government agencies to unlock more human capital potential and make the public sector a magnet for talent is enormous If states changed where and how we select candidates turnout would soar and we d learn a lot more about what voters really think In preparing for a disaster and recovering from one residents and businesses need to know that their voices will be heard The way governments are measuring results is becoming kinder and more effective As Buffalo s former mayor demonstrated to bring the right people together you have to know what it takes to make a project succeed Local governments are using internet surveys to better gauge residents needs Some states are finding ways to make rules easier to navigate and less costly for business while continuing to protect the public s interests VideoAre the robots coming for government jobs According to Bill Eggers the answer is yes sort of Eggers who runs Deloitte s Center for Government Insights said at a Nov 29 FCW event on government modernization that 20 to 30 percent of all work activities will soon be automatable thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence He pointed to a Deloitte study of the federal workforce that found 4 3 billion hours are spent each year on a wide range of task and activities A huge share of those hours is devoted to essentially moving paper he said while relatively little time goes to coaching and other sorts of human activities But the study also found that four out of five of the most labor intensive activities have either a medium or high automation potential Eggers said That could allow for reductions in certain parts of the workforce he noted but it also frees up time for critical higher value work and the chance to deliver better service by giving the human workforce AI powered support Studies have repeatedly shown Eggers said that it s the human machine pairing that gives the best results he said The full video of Eggers half hour talk which explores the larger implications for government as AI becomes the new electricity is available below Note This dual screen

newsletter I agree to this site s Privacy Policy The government s efforts to reskill and retrain the federal workforce are expected to ramp up in 2019 as the White House s embrace of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and automation continues to expand While these technology solutions are in the early stages of adoption human input and more importantly institutional knowledge will be essential to ensuring the efficiency gains expected of AI and automation And with some estimating that the government will need to reskill up to 300 000 federal employees during this AI boom an early question for agency leaders will be how to introduce these new technologies that will transform future of public service I think you ve got to start first with what you are going to use it for said Meagan Metzger CEO of Dcode which helps emerging technology companies navigate entry into federal markets Metzger said the benefits of AI often break down into two categories doing things that humans shouldn t be doing like labor intensive administrative work and doing things that humans can t do such as sifting through petabytes of data for potential solutions Determining how agencies plan to use AI and how employees will work with it is an essential first step I think first it s identifying which workforce you are actually going to affect with AI because depending on how you get there it s very different Metzger said You are going to have to look at once you assess your skill gaps what tools do you actually need to enable them to train which could be AI or stuff like data science workbenches so people can collaborate The Trump administration is actively pursuing both paths as part of its President s Management Agenda calling on agencies to adopt automated technologies that will allow federal employees to pursue more high value work while also using it to better leverage troves of government data as an asset One challenge of these reskilling efforts is that they are occurring amid a massive technological transformation in the federal government While agencies are also consolidating data centers determining which services to migrate to the cloud and bolstering their cybersecurity posture deciding how to introduce a workforce changing technology like automation or AI can be a daunting task especially with the pressure to catch up to the operations currently happening in the private sector The challenge that I think a lot of agencies have is that they get paralyzed Metzger said They think I need to do a complete infrastructure modernization and I need to have an entire data management strategy complete before I can do any of those things and that s unfortunately not fast She said the easier path for agencies to adopt automation is to identify small tasks to test the technology on and then scaling it up from there Pick a business or a mission problem Metzger said The way that technology is structured now with cloud you can start slowly incrementally modernizing their environment Maybe there s a program that has a discrete set of data sources you can modernize that and start moving that program to AI Then slowly start picking off the programs until you get to a total solution The other advantage an incremental approach offers is that it allows agencies leaders to leverage small wins to cultivate a critical following rather than trying to institute a wholesale change said Department of Transportation CIO Vicki Hildebrand whose last day in government is Jan 4 I think it goes back to those organic opportunities You see an opportunity you start with a baby step and I think that s how you do it Then you show success then you ve got a few more believers and then you have another opportunity she said All of a sudden you have a stakeholder who has bought in and you re not pitching it to somebody who s half listening Tasked with modernizing the technology infrastructure of a department that encompasses regulating air rail and automotive travel Hildebrand said her innovation successes often came by earning small wins and using their success to broaden their adoption This is exactly the way IT loves to live she said When the stakeholders think there is a more modern technological way to help us and you grab those opportunities Then you try to get the few people that are going to be the best to help that initiative move forward Then they bring on a few people and then there s a new opportunity Given the already competitive market for cyber data science and IT talent the Trump administration recently announced its plans to tap the federal workforce to plug critical skills gaps and prepare for the adoption automation technology through reskilling Federal CIO Suzette Kent recently announced the Federal Cybersecurity Reskilling Academy as well as three pilot programs in 2019 to address technology skills gaps leadership management and robotic process automation RPA While those training programs could address reskilling efforts from a high level ensuring that frontline employees will buy into such a transformation will likely determine whether the efforts can be sustained across the enterprise One way to generate organic opportunities is to take some of the workforce s most labor intensive tasks off the table That s why Hildebrand said she expects RPA to make a big splash in the federal government in 2019 You can remove so much manual work and improve quality by using RPA she said So I see a lot of that catching fire around some of the things that RPA is really good at It s not meant for everything but the manual repetitive copy paste kinds of activities I would be surprised if there wasn t a lot of that happening to free up resources for other things Hildebrand added The challenge on the heels of that though is now you have people who have been doing copy paste for a long period of time and a robot is now doing that you need programs to teach them other things Agencies like the Treasury Department s Bureau of Fiscal Service the General Services Administration and other have tested RPA pilot programs in the last year and its potential to make operations more efficient has officials looking to it as an early step in the government s embrace of automation technology Jim Walker director of public sector marketing at RPA vendor UiPath said the technology doesn t so much require reskilling as it does restructuring the work And within that restructuring lies the opportunity for agencies to eliminate time consuming tasks to pursue more workforce development It s not as if robotics is changing the workforce any different than the cell phone has any different than the computer has said Walker a former federal employee Whether it s through the government through a contractor employee or through their own home retraining is not nearly the problem it was 15 or 20 years ago The President s Management Agenda has also called on the Office of Management and Budget and its Office of Federal Procurement Policy to tackle some of those reskilling challenges by developing new training methods for employees impacted by automation The plan is expected in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 Don Kettl academic director of the University of Texas at Austin s LBJ Washington Center said at the heart of the federal government s technological revolution has to be a focus on also revolutionizing how it trains its employees to match The reality is there s no way to be able to make the most effective use of emerging technologies without having the most effective employees to know what to do with it he said The paradox is at the core the more we talk about the issues of technology the more important the issues of human capital become

the nature of work Even with the economy at or near full employment the public is skeptical that the future will bring more job security and they are wary about the long term impact of technological innovation on workers Only 14 of adults say by the year 2050 the average working person in the U S will have more job security About half 49 say workers will have less job security and 36 say jobs will be about as secure as they are now Men are somewhat more pessimistic than women about future job security and those who attended or graduated from college have a more negative outlook than those who did not continue their education beyond high school In addition Democrats are more likely than Republicans to predict that workers will have less job security in the future While pluralities across racial and ethnic groups anticipate less job security in the future blacks and Hispanics are about twice as likely as whites to say workers will have more job security 24 of blacks and Hispanics say this compared with 9 of whites When asked more specifically about employee benefits in the future public views again skew negative Roughly one in five adults 22 say by 2050 the average working person in the U S will have better employee benefits than they do now About twice that share 41 say benefits will be worse than they are now and 36 say they will be about the same Views on benefits follow similar patterns to those on job security Men are more pessimistic than women and Democrats more downbeat than Republicans And again blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to say things will be better in the future Relatively few adults see an upside for workers from automation and new workplace technologies Roughly half 48 say these advances have mostly hurt American workers while only 22 say they have generally helped About three in ten 28 say automation through new technology has neither helped nor hurt There is a notable age gap in opinions on these changes in the workplace Adults 50 and older are more likely than their younger counterparts to say that automation has mostly hurt workers 55 vs 43 respectively In addition those with a high school degree or less education are more likely than those who attended college to see negative repercussions from new workplace technologies while blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to say these changes have helped workers Looking forward most Americans think automation will reshape the workplace but not necessarily for the better A large majority say 30 years from now robots and computers will do much of the work currently done by humans with 30 saying this will definitely happen and 52 saying it will probably happen Among those who say robots and computers will do much of the work currently done by humans in the future most think this will be a bad thing for the country 40 say this will be somewhat bad thing and 29 say it will be a very bad thing In spite of these negative predictions most workers do not believe that the type of work they currently do will be done by robots or computers in the future 24 say this will definitely not happen and 38 say it probably won t Still a quarter of workers say this probably will happen and 11 say it definitely will Workers with no college experience are among those most likely to say the kind of work they do will be done by robots or computers in the next 30 years 47 of those with a high school diploma or less education say this will happen compared with 38 of those with some college experience and 27 of those with a bachelor s or higher degree Lower income workers also are more likely to say their current work will be done by robots or computers 52 of those with an annual family income of less than 30 000 say this will happen in the future compared with 37 of those with family incomes between 30 000 and 74 999 and 26 among those with incomes of 75 000 or higher Americans have a negative view of the broader impact that automation will have on society Roughly three quarters of adults 76 say inequality between the rich and the poor will increase if robots and computers perform most of the jobs currently being done by humans This sentiment is widely held across most demographic groups Democrats 82 are somewhat more likely than Republicans to say that inequality will increase But even among Republicans 72 say this change is likely The public is also skeptical that more good jobs will be created if robots and computers play a bigger role in the workplace About two thirds of adults 66 doubt that the economy will generate many new better paying jobs if robots and computers mostly replace human labor twice the share that say better jobs will follow widespread implementation of these technologies Higher income adults and those with a bachelor s degree or more education are somewhat more optimistic that new technology will create better jobs But even among these groups majorities say greater automation in the workplace isn t likely to lead to an improved job picture in 30 years Previous research has shown that the vast majority of American workers believe it will be important if not essential for them to get training and develop new skills throughout their work life in order to keep up with changes in the workplace Most adults say the primary responsibility for providing workers with the necessary skills and training resides with the education system and individuals themselves rather than with government or employers When asked who should be most responsible over the next 30 years for making sure American workers have the right skills and training to get a good job about four in ten adults 39 point to the education system An additional 34 say the education system should be second most responsible Similar shares say individuals themselves bear the primary 39 or secondary 30 responsibility for ensuring that workers have the necessary training to get a good job By comparison the public is much less likely to say employers or government should play this role Only 11 of adults say employers should be most responsible for ensuring workers have the right skills and training and the same share say government should be most responsible Some 25 and 11 respectively say employers and government should have secondary responsibility in this area The public sees education playing an even bigger role when it comes to ensuring young adults have the skills and training they need to get a good job Roughly half 53 say the education system should be most responsible for providing young people with the necessary tools to succeed in the labor force while 32 say it should be up to young adults themselves Overall more than eight in ten adults look to the education system to play a primary or secondary role in preparing young people for the workforce About seven in ten say the onus should be on individuals themselves Again a relatively small share of the public says employers 5 or government 10 should bear the most responsibility for providing young adults with the skills and training they need About one in five say either government or employers should be mainly or secondarily responsible for training younger workers Blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to say government should be most responsible for making sure that workers have the right skills and training About one in five blacks 20 and Hispanics 19 look to government to play this role compared with 7 of whites And young adults are significantly more likely than their older counterparts to say the education system should be primarily responsible for this 50 of those ages 18 to 29 say this compared with four in ten or fewer among older age groups There are significant gaps by party on this measure A majority of Republicans 59 say individuals should have the most responsibility to ensure they are prepared for the workplace only 23 of Democrats say the same For their part Democrats are twice as likely as Republicans to say the education system should be most responsible Democrats are also more likely to say government should play this role but even among Democrats only 15 say government should be most responsible for this 5 of Republicans say the same The patterns are similar when it comes to who should be responsible for preparing young adults for the workplace Fact

ImpactoApril 30 2018 by Luis Miguel Castilla Leave a CommentThe uncertainty of the future of work naturally raises a number of questions It is no wonder Argentina put it on the agenda as one of three priorities to be discussed at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires Will its impact be the same across the globe What jobs will be most affected What new skillsets will be required But above all how can governments prepare and what role can Multilateral Development Banks play All four leading regional development banks recently came together in Washington to present some key perspectives regarding the jobs of the future which can be found in the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives Here are a few worth considering On the one hand Emerging Europe Developing Asia Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean are witnessing how robotics automation and artificial intelligence are lowering costs and increasing productivity providing an opportunity for accelerated growth Countries like Estonia have taken the lead in digital technology youth in Nigeria and Ethiopia are harnessing technology to boost yields in agriculture in Vietnam and Bangladesh Information and Communication Technologies ICT is boosting the service industry and across Latin America and the Caribbean smartphone adoption is expected to reach beyond 70 by 2020 On the other hand as a result of this new wave of technological advances known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution a series of myths emerge that it is important to clarify Myth 1 All regions will be impacted in the same way The truth is that technology will be adopted at varying speeds depending on the region s economic development and demographic trends An aging population in Emerging Europe will face different challenges than Africa where 12 to 15 million young people enter the job market each year Myth 2 Mass unemployment is unavoidable The truth is that the jobless rate will be lower than originally expected Mass unemployment is unlikely to become a reality But the shifts in job opportunities will certainly require flexibility and access to new training tools which may in turn be provided by technology itself Myth 3 Automation will replace all human jobs and tasks The truth is that automation only takes place where it is both technically and economically feasible A human workforce will still be required in most sectors particularly those such as health and education At the same time it would be foolish to ignore the genuine threats of unemployment and increased income inequality that the rapid expansion of new technology will generate Above all as Multilateral Development Banks the question we need to be asking is how can governments ease the transition What can governments do to ensure that the largest number of people possible benefit from this transition Policymakers can take four actions to ease the adoption of technology while mitigating potentially adverse effects on jobs and incomes Multilateral Development Banks certainly have their own role to play not only by acting as think tanks for initiatives on how to capitalize on new technologies and mitigate their negative effects but also in coordinating global or regional policy responses strengthening partnerships between policymakers and employers to jointly identify and address challenges Our products and services will need to adapt A recent IDB health project in the Dominican Republic which uses drones to link remote rural clinics with hospital laboratories is a prime example of this Change will also take place within our workforce Outsourcing the IDB s human resources department from Washington to Costa Rica to ensure efficiency and reduce costs was certainly a step in the right direction It is important that we take the time to seriously identify the opportunities and risks the 21st century global job market presents so that together we can help shape the future of work In the meantime we must also remain relevant for our customer base and at the forefront of innovation Whether we succeed or not is up to all of us Downlaod the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives hereFiled Under Beyond

a freshly minted college graduate joins the government as a clerk Jane s work consists largely of entering information into databases and creating reports which requires her to spend the better part of her work day seated at a terminal near a mainframe computer that fills an entire room Jane and her colleagues are expected to be at their desks from 9 a m to 5 p m five days a week Jane is grateful to have a steady 9 to 5 job and plans to spend her entire career with her agency Flash forward 40 years and meet Jane s grandson Ian He carries a slim tablet wherever he goes which has more computing power than the mainframe with which Jane worked Ian is constantly tethered to the Internet and works 24 7 from wherever he is Ian expects to switch from project to project and office to office as his career develops and his interests evolve If he feels he has reached the limit of his ability to learn or grow in one role he will look elsewhere for a new opportunity What if the government could give Ian the opportunities and experiences he seeks The GovCloud concept proposed in this paper would restructure government workforces in a way that takes advantage of the talents and preferences of workers like Ian who are entering the workforce today The model is based on a large body of research from interviews with public and private sector experts to best practices from innovative organizations both public and private This is the first generation of people that work play think and learn differently than their parents They are the first generation to not be afraid of technology It s like the air to them Don Tapscott author of Grown Up DigitalThis report details trends in work and technology that offer significant opportunities for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the government workforce It lays out the GovCloud model explaining how governments could be organized to take advantage of its flexibility It examines how work would be performed in the new model and discusses potential changes to government HR programs to support GovCloud Other sections provide resources for executives including a tool to help determine cloud eligibility steps they can take to pilot the cloud concept and future scenarios illustrating the cloud in action The GovCloud model represents a dramatic departure from the status quo It is bound to be greeted with some skepticism Without such innovation however governments will be left to confront the challenges of tomorrow with the workforce structure of yesterday The details of the GovCloud model are open for debate The purpose of this paper is to jumpstart that debate Forty years ago more than half of employed American adults worked in either blue collar or clerical jobs Today less than 40 percent work in these same categories and the share continues to shrink 1 Jobs requiring routine or manual tasks are disappearing while those requiring complex communication skills and expert thinking are becoming the norm 2 Increasingly employers seek workers capable of creative and knowledge based work We should ask ourselves whether we re truly satisfied with the status quo Are our workday lives so fulfilling and our organizations so boundlessly capable that it s now pointless to long for something better Gary Hamel author of The Future of ManagementThe next generation of creative knowledge workers has already entered the job market These Millennials came of age in a rapidly and radically changing world They are the first true digital natives They have grown up with instant access to information through technology As such Millennials have considerably different expectations for the kind of work they do and the information they use The pursuit for variety in work has led Millennials to cite simply needing a change as their top reason for switching jobs 3Advances in technology have also changed the actual ways in which people perform work The ability to crowdsource tasks is one example of this change Since its founding in 2001 volunteers have produced and contributed to over 19 million articles in 281 languages on Wikipedia 4 Built around this concept a burgeoning industry is developing around microtasking dividing work up into small tasks that can be farmed out to workers Amazon s Mechanical Turk rolled out in 2005 allows users to post tasks to a platform where registered workers can accept and complete them for a small fee When this paper was written more than 195 000 tasks were available on Mechanical Turk 5Such technologies may offer suitable possibilities for the public sector Microtask a Finnish cloud labor company maintains Digitalkoot a program that helps the Finnish National Library convert its image archives into digital text and correct existing errors It does so with volunteered labor participants simply play a game in which they are shown the image of a word and then must type it out to help a cartoon character cross a bridge In doing so they are turning scanned images into searchable text greatly improving the search accuracy of old manuscripts 6 At present more than 100 000 people have completed over 6 million microtasks associated with this project 7As the pace of computing power and machine learning increases professors Frank Levy and Richard Murnane contend that more tasks will move from human to computer processing 8 Skeptics need look no further than IBM s Watson a computer that can answer questions posed in natural language In February 2011 Watson defeated two all time champions of the quiz show Jeopardy This was not solely a publicity stunt IBM hopes to sell Watson to hospitals and call centers to help them answer questions from the public 9Around the globe more and more governments are looking to increase telework among employees In 2010 the U S government passed legislation calling for more telework opportunities for government employees Likewise the Australian government in order to attract and retain information and communications technology workers instituted a teleworking policy in 2009 requiring agencies to implement flexible work plans 10 Other countries including Norway and Germany are also focusing on flexible work arrangements to improve public sector recruiting 11 In Canada the government has an official telework policy that recognizes changes are occurring in the public service workforce with a shift towards more knowledge workers and encourages departments to implement telework arrangements 12Cloud definitionsCloud computing Internet based computing whereby shared resources software and

Labor How Computers are Creating the Next Job Market Princeton Princeton University Press 2004 p 50 Figure 1 Trends in routine and non routine tasks in the U S 1960 200213These are all powerful steps in the right direction for employees whose natural work rhythms are not locked into 9 to 5 Some companies have taken telework one step further British Telecom is pushing the concept of agile working through its Workstyle Project where employees decide what work arrangements best suit them rather than a rigid definition by location and hours BT Workstyle is one of the largest flexible working projects in Europe with over 11 000 home based workers BT has found that its home enabled employees are on average 20 percent more productive than their office based colleagues 14Similarly U S electronics retailer Best Buy experimented with a Results Only Work Environment ROWE In a ROWE what matters is not whether employees are in their office but rather that they complete their work and achieve measurable outcomes In a ROWE salaried employees must put in as much time as is actually needed to do their work no more no less The decline in routine and manual tasks and the rise of new ways of working is not isolated to the private sector In 1950 the U S federal workforce largely comprised clerks performing repetitive tasks About 62 percent performed these tasks while only 11 percent performed more white collar work By 2000 those relationships were reversed Fifteen percent performed repetitive tasks compared to 56 percent in the white collar categories 16 Similarly in 1944 the number of workers in the UK civil service considered industrial totaled 505 000 By 2003 this number fell to 18 200 with non industrial workers reaching 538 000 in 2004 17 And in Canada in 2006 knowledge based workers represented 58 percent of federal workers in the Core Public Administration up from 41 percent 11 years earlier 18The swelling ranks of non industrial government workers indicate a shift in public sector jobs toward creative collaborative and complex work The workforce structure however designed for clerks of the last century remains largely the same With limited flexibility to distribute resources governments often address change by creating new agencies and programs This can be seen following major events like the outbreaks of the Avian flu and SARs in the past decade 9 11 and the financial crisis of 2008 Source United States Office of Personnel Management A Fresh Start for Federal Pay A Case for Modernization April 2002 p 5 http www opm gov

a computer in their home 19The world is full of experts who attempt to predict the future and fail 20Instead of endeavoring to predict the future governments can choose to create a flexible workforce that can quickly adapt to future work requirements To accomplish this the government can learn from a game changing concept in the technology world cloud computing Major organizations and small startups alike increase their flexibility by sharing storage space information and resources in a cloud allowing them to quickly scale resources up and down as needed Why not apply the cloud model to people The creation of a government wide human cloud could provide significant benefits including A cloud based government workforce or GovCloud could include workers who perform a range of creative problem focused work Rather than being slotted into any single government agency cloud workers would be true government wide employees This section outlines the organizational structure of the GovCloud model which rests on three main pillars a cloud of government workers thin executive agencies and shared services Most government workforce models tend to constrain workers by isolating them in separate agencies Consider the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom and the subsequent slaughter of more than 6 million pigs sheep and cattle The problem of an impacted food supply is complicated In most countries multiple agencies focus on agriculture food production and public health In the United Kingdom the army and even tourism ministries were impacted by the outbreak as agencies became overwhelmed by the number of animals in need of disposal and by the cordoning off of tourist areas to prevent the spread of the disease Yet the structure of government agencies often confines employees to work in information silos creating inherent operational inefficiencies In a cloud workforce model experts in each area could be pulled together to support remedies and propose coordinated corrective measures I want someone saying Did you know that the Ministry of Justice is doing that or could you piggy back on what the communities department is doing or had you thought about doing it in this way You ve got to get away from thinking about centralized command and control Dame Helen Ghosh Permanent Secretary UK Home Office 21The FedCloud modelThe GovCloud model could become a new pillar of government comprising permanent employees who undertake a wide variety of creative problem focused work As needed the GovCloud model could also take advantage of those outside government including citizens looking for extra part time work full time contractors and individual consultants Cloud workers would vary in background and expertise but would exhibit traits of free agent workers self sufficient self motivated employees who exhibit a strong loyalty to teams colleagues and clients Daniel Pink author of Drive The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us argues that 33 million Americans one quarter of the workforce already operate as free agents 22According to the white paper Lessons of the Great Recession from Swiss staffing company Adecco contingent workers those who chose non traditional employment arrangements23 are expected to eventually make up about 25 percent of the global workforce 24These more autonomous workers according to Pink are better suited to 21st century work and are more productive even without traditional monetary incentives 25The fluid nature of the cloud can provide significant benefits The nature of the cloud teams forming and dissolving as their tasks require encourages workers to focus on specific project outcomes rather than ongoing operations Thin agency structures could lead to Greater use of shared services could allow the federal government to The need to support some ongoing missions will remain of course These missions will be carried out by thin agencies Under the cloud concept federal agencies would remain focused on specific missions and ongoing oversight These agencies however would become thinner as many of their knowledge workers transfer into the cloud Thin agencies could also create opportunities to streamline organizations with overlapping missions Employees working in thin agencies could fall into two main categories GovCloud could change the highest levels of public sector workers as we know them today The Senior Executive Service in the United States Permanent Secretaries and Directors General in the United Kingdom and Australia all such senior officials could rotate between agencies shared services and the cloud which would reflect the original intent behind many of these high level offices giving executives a breadth of experience in roles across government to help develop shared values and a broad perspective An important benefit of rotation would be the ability to tap into cloud networks to assemble high performing teams To further focus agencies on specific missions many of their back office support functions could be pulled into government wide shared service arrangements The use of shared services in government has come and gone in waves usually dictated by fiscal necessity Most countries in Europe as part of their e government strategies have placed increased focus of late on developing shared services whether through an executive agency or a CIO as well as working with EU coordination activities And while the decentralized governments of some EU countries such as Germany make shared services more difficult these countries are using states and agencies to pilot innovative approaches 27Other efforts around the world include the U S e Government Act of 2002 which examined how technology could be used to cut costs and improve services More recently the New Zealand government appointed an advisory group in May 2011 to explore public sector reform to improve services and provide better value In their report Better Public Services the advisory group recommended the use of shared services to improve effectiveness in a variety of government settings including policy advice and real estate 29 Following up on this three New Zealand agencies the Department of the Prime Minister the State Services Commission and the Treasury announced in December 2011 that they would share such corporate functions as human resources and information technology 30 And though shared services in Western Australia were shut down other projects in South Australia are moving ahead and already showing savings 31In August 2011 the government of Canada announced the launch of Shared Services Canada a program that seeks to streamline and identify savings in information technology Among its first targets is something as mundane as email But with more than 100 different email systems being used by government employees the potential savings and boost to efficiency could be significant Not only do these incompatible systems cost money by requiring individual departments to negotiate and maintain separate licenses and technical support it also makes it difficult for government employees to communicate with one another and with the public And with no single standard ensuring the security of information transmitted over email becomes more challenging Shared Services Canada will move the government to one email system as well as consolidate data centers and networks ultimately looking for anticipated savings of between CA 100 million and CA 200 million annually 28While the idea of using shared services is not a novel one it is central to the GovCloud model The GovCloud model envisions building upon effective practices and those shared services already in operation to deliver services like human resources information technology finance and acquisitions government wide Workers in these shared services would include subject matter experts in areas like human resources and information technology as well as generalists who support routine business functions The potential for shared services continues to grow As seen with IBM s Watson and Microtask s Digitalkoot new technologies provide an opportunity to accelerate the automated delivery of basic services Some agencies already have begun capitalizing on these trends For example NASA has moved its shared service center website to a secure government cloud facilitating greater employee self service and helping to reduce demand on finite call center resources 32This decision tool is designed to help leaders determine which employees are appropriate for each of the three structures in the GovCloud model the cloud thin agencies and shared services To the cloud GovCloud Project LifecycleManaging employees in the cloud will require governments to reinvent human resource management Individual and team performance evaluations career development pay structures and benefits and pensions would need to change to support GovCloud This section examines possibilities for HR reinvention including performance management career development workplace flexibility and benefits Employees working in the cloud would require an alternative to determine pay and career advancement The government could take its cues from the gaming world and evaluate cloud workers with a point system The manager as we know it will disappear to be replaced by a new sort of business operative whose expertise is assembling the right people for particular projects Daniel Pink author of Free Agent Nation 33An HR management system that incorporates the accumulation of experience points XP through effective work on cloud projects training education and professional certifications could replace the tenure centric models for cloud employees As employees accumulate XP they could level up and take on additional responsibilities in future projects Workers in the cloud could earn XP in four ways After some high profile incidents slow responses to outbreaks of foot and mouth disease flooding that may have been preventable and a farming subsidy system that seemed to result in more chaos than aid the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs DEFRA was looking to reinvent itself In 2006 the department launched DEFRA Renew One of its key goals was to bring the department s policymaking closer to actual delivery to create more responsive processes Organized mainly by policy with fixed teams DEFRA had been unable to redeploy resources as needed in response to a crisis As part of DEFRA Renew a new operating model was implemented that used flexible resourcing where staff were assigned to specific projects for fixed periods This allowed management to measure and build the required capabilities and competencies needed and to allocate resources efficiently to improve overall service quality New roles were also created to support sustainable staff development and resource management in the new model To create buy in for such a fundamental culture shift within the department a facilitative approach to decision making was employed Change management programs and mentoring were extended to all levels of the department including leadership New mechanisms such as approval panels for resources and the use of business cases also worked to push changes among staff and promote collaborative behavior DEFRA Renew was widely recognized as a key enabler in the department meeting required efficiency improvement targets set by the UK government DEFRA moved to a more project based approach with fewer staff in core teams According to Dame Helen Ghosh former Permanent Secretary of DEFRA they could be more responsive now that the management board won t be made up of director generals with individual policy silos 34Just as XP could be gained through learning new skills it could be lost in the following three ways Any serious discussion about creating a new class of government employees requires a fresh look at employee benefits and compensation For example XP could be used to help determine workers salaries but additional research into alternative pension and benefit programs is needed While any discussion on compensation could be contentious a healthy debate among stakeholders from across the government should be welcomed As new roles emerge in the cloud so too could new career paths Career emphasis could move away from time served in a particular pay grade and toward milestones that are meaningful for employee development Each worker may have different career aspirations For instance not all workers aspire to management some may seek to master a particular subject area instead Career advancement in the cloud would not equate to moving up a ladder but rather moving along a lattice Lattice GovCloud ModelHere s how the lattice could work for Ian who we met in the introduction Think of the lattice as a jungle gym The best opportunities to broaden your experience may be lateral or even down Look every which way and swing to opportunities Pattie Sellers Fortune editor at largeCathleen Benko and Molly Anderson the authors of The Corporate Lattice argue that the corporate ladder is giving way to a lattice that accommodates flatter more networked organizations improves the integration of career and life focuses on competencies rather than tenure and helps increase workforce loyalty 35 The lattice metaphor allows employees to choose many ways to get ahead It is unlikely that all workers will thrive in the new GovCloud environment right out of the gate As such it would be important to assess a worker s readiness before placing her in GovCloud and providing training on core competencies critical to cloud success There could also be opportunities to start workers especially those at earlier stages of a career within an agency or shared service to build up expertise in some area before graduating to the cloud Once in the cloud new workers could be paired with mentors who are more experienced to help navigate the cloud experience itself There should be an emphasis on continuous learning in the cloud It would be important for cloud workers to continue to refine their skills develop additional expertise and adapt to new ways of working Not only could continuous learning affect workers career mobility by increasing the depth and breadth of their skills but it could also impact their salary and level by increasing their XP Learning and development in the cloud could take on many themes of next learning Next learning focuses on creating personalized learning experiences that leverage the latest technologies and collaborative communities to deliver education and learning programs that build knowledge bases and promote learning as a focus and passion not just a checkbox in a career 36To broaden cloud worker skills and the ability to handle multiple tasks and work on a variety of projects cloud learning could include the following principles 37In the cloud careers and expertise will be built in new ways and work will be something we do rather than a place we go to As such the cloud will give workers more control over their schedules and workloads By creating a flexible workplace governments could shed a significant amount of physical infrastructure and create shared workspaces Many buildings could be converted into co located spaces teams could use collaboration spaces or videoconferencing centers Some workers might rarely set foot in a government building instead conducting cloud tasks at home and interacting with project teams virtually With advancing communications and mobile technology distance no longer hinders collaboration It no longer matters whether all workers are at an office between 9 a m and 5 p m what matters is whether project teams produce results and whether everyone contributes A more flexible workplace could also take advantage of resources governments might not otherwise have access to Some retiring workers may not want to quit working altogether and a flexible model could be an enticing way to keep their expertise on retainer Alternatively the model could take advantage of would be government employees unwilling to relocate or unable to work a regular schedule By increasing flexibility governments could increase their available resource pool allowing agencies to access the skills and knowledge they need when they need it For an example of how a retiree could interact with the cloud see Appendix C National Security Case Study Don t think governments will ever take to the cloud At the U S Department of State the idea could soon be a reality The Office of eDiplomacy is preparing to pilot a cloud component to its e internship model for American students as part of the Virtual Student Foreign Service VSFS beginning this year The VSFS currently offers e internships to U S university students of multiple month duration By using a new micro volunteering platform State Department offices and embassies around the world will be able to create non classified tasks that take anywhere from a couple of minutes to a couple of days to complete Each task will be tagged by region and or issue and will automatically populate the profiles of students who have indicated those interests Students can then select the tasks that interest them the most or that fit into their schedule To see that the most pressing work is performed first offices and embassies will be able to prioritize their tasks so critical items appear at the top of the queue Imagine a small embassy preparing for a high profile multilateral meeting The preparations for such an event could be daunting for a small staff The power of the cloud could augment an individual embassy s capacity to prepare for a major event and ensure that related items are performed ahead of those that are less critical While there are plenty of incentives for participating in the VSFS micro volunteering platform from an impressive line on a student s resume to the chance to make a difference by working on topics of interest thought is being put into how to creatively incent high performance One idea is to simply invoke students competitive spirit Competition could be encouraged by a monthly leader board which results in bragging rights and potentially even a low cost but high impact reward Transparency is also key to competition with ratings available to State Department staff and other cloud interns and the ability to make short thank you notes from embassies publicly available interns would be keen to make a good impression The potential applications of this type of program are significant Imagine if offices throughout the State Department could tap into the language and cultural expertise of the thousands of foreign national staff members around the globe Providing a platform for those employees to contribute even a small amount of time to discreet tasks that require their expertise could unlock a world of knowledge 38Creating the GovCloud model will require bold leadership and the ideas and initiatives of entrepreneurial executives While a GovCloud model may be years in the making agencies can begin adopting cloud concepts today The GovCloud concept is designed to be versatile as well as applicable to a wide range of entities Depending on your organization government executives wishing to employ GovCloud may choose to apply the concept first to a unit before expanding to other branches or divisions entire agencies or the whole of government Often GovCloud principles are most effectively implemented as part of a larger reform program within a particular agency as with the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs Renew program as described earlier in this report On a smaller scale the UK Cabinet Office used flexible resourcing FR in its Economic Reform Group ERG with a staff of about 400 as part of its cost reduction plans Using a simple database that it had developed and a strong program of communications FR is now used and embraced by all core ERG employees with strong clear ownership from the top another key implementation factor Says Ian Watmore the UK Cabinet Office s former permanent secretary FR means we are able to deploy people much more quickly to priority projects 40Figure 3 outlines how GovCloud can apply to a variety of organizations Most government workforces haven t undergone a broad restructuring in decades In that time the world has been transformed by computers the Internet and mobile communications To respond to a variety of challenges governments have created scores of new organizations However in today s world of budget cuts and increased fiscal scrutiny the constant creation of new permanent structures is not sustainable The GovCloud model could offer a new way to use government resources A cloud of government wide workers could coalesce into project based teams to solve problems and separate when their work is done This could allow governments to concentrate resources when and where they are needed By using this model in conjunction with thinner agencies and shared services governments can reduce back office redundancies and let agencies focus on their core missions This model capitalizes on the work preferences of Millennials the future government workforce who value career growth over job security or compensation 41 The GovCloud model allows employees to gain a variety of experiences in a shorter amount of time and to self select their career direction To support GovCloud governments could establish the processes by which cloud teams would form work and dissolve New ways to evaluate performance and help workers gain skills and build careers should be considered Today s employee classification system stresses job descriptions and time in service this could be transformed with an XP model that emphasizes the individual s ownership of his or her career The GovCloud model will undoubtedly be controversial Many stakeholders from governing bodies to public employee unions must weigh in to shape the future government workforce The transition to a cloud model will not happen overnight or maybe even in the next five years but the conversation starts today Charlie Tierney is a Manager in Deloitte Consulting LLP s Federal Human

Monthly Group All Rights Reserved Apple has integrated 9 000 trees into its futuristic new headquarters campus reflecting research showing that greenery in workplaces increases productivity by 15 percent Several years ago Google s People Analytics division launched Project Aristotle to understand the components of productive teams embracing research that groups are more creative than individuals Private sector businesses are automating tedious tasks augmenting workers with artificial intelligence technologies reskilling and upskilling their workforces focusing on employee wellness and hungrily recruiting talent Government will have to catch up Perhaps nowhere is the gap between the public and private sector greater than in workforce management Most public sector organizations are still locked into decades old employee policies such as rigid job classifications lockstep pay and a reliance on seniority as a substitute for capability The reality is that government agencies are increasingly called upon to address society s most complex challenges while using workforce approaches rooted in the distant past The good news Change is possible and beginning to happen A new Deloitte study explores some of the ways the nature of government work the public workforce itself and the workplace it occupies will all need to continue to evolve Work New technologies can transform the capabilities of a government worker Artificially intelligent chatbots for example can perform triage on citizen questions freeing human attention for less routine queries The Army s recruitment chatbot SGT STAR does the work of 55 recruiters answering 94 percent of questions A Deloitte analysis of AI s potential found that automation could save the federal government as much as 1 2 billion hours of work annually What AI doesn t automate it can enhance Child welfare caseworkers who according to one study spend just 9 percent of their time with children but 37 5 percent of their time on paperwork could use technology to auto populate documentation freeing time for visits AI also can correlate hospital truancy and arrest records to flag children in danger Some restaurant health inspectors already analyze big data to identify likely candidates for inspections In Chicago for instance tests found 24 percent more critical violations and on average isolated dangers from the food system a week earlier For effective work redesign it s helpful to adopt a two pronged strategy of zooming in and zooming out A zooming in approach hones in on individual tasks and processes that have the most potential to be optimized through automation Zooming out entails looking at the bigger picture to define what work redesign means for entire job classifications departments and the organization as a whole Workforce Specialists in fields like cybersecurity agile development and artificial intelligence are not likely to commit decades to one government position and if they did they d still need to swap into the tech sector periodically to sharpen their skills That s why some government technology programs are taking a tour of duty approach letting private sector experts serve in the public sector for a few years on specific projects without locking them into a lifetime of government work At the federal level the General Services Administration s 18F digital services agency the Oak Ridge Institute for Science Education and the Presidential Innovation Fellows program all help government solve problems with temporary outside hires At the state level Michigan s Cyber Civilian Corps a volunteer group of cybersecurity professionals from the private sector and academia as well as government can be called upon if the governor declares a cyber emergency And long term government workers don t need to be stuck in one place A talent cloud can prepare for unexpected staffing needs by identifying in advance workers with special skills and applying them to tasks suited to their expertise Canada is experimenting with letting multiple agencies dip into a talent cloud and hire workers for specific missions Workers keep their union membership rights and benefits but may be called into service by any agency Workplace Empirical science rarely guides hiring But management is becoming more data driven Applying the newest science on team building personal efficiency and employee wellness to government agencies can upgrade the workplace to better attract retain and utilize talent Insights from studies of the composition and functioning of effective teams can inform decisions about using talents more effectively Organizational network analysis for example can use metadata from emails and other sources to map communication patterns in organizations accurately predicting individuals who will be high performers detecting unsatisfied employees six months before they actually quit and identifying leadership behaviors that correlate with success Modern workplace wellness programs are also extremely impactful Improving employee wellness can reduce lost work days increase retention and fuel productivity After the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center provided a physician and nurse case manager for employees it saw an 80 percent decline in lost work days over six years for a cost savings of 1 5 million In short the future of government work will require a level of dynamic workforce management far beyond the current practices of the public sector The potential for government agencies to unlock more human capital potential and make the public sector a magnet for talent is enormous If states changed where and how we select candidates turnout would soar and we d learn a lot more about what voters really think In preparing for a disaster and recovering from one residents and businesses need to know that their voices will be heard The way governments are measuring results is becoming kinder and more effective As Buffalo s former mayor demonstrated to bring the right people together you have to know what it takes to make a project succeed Local governments are using internet surveys to better gauge residents needs Some states are finding ways to make rules easier to navigate and less costly for business while continuing to protect the public s interests In a new report from Deloitte Government Jobs of the Future the authors predicted six public sector positions that could exist by 2025 and beyond and examined how technology will help not hinder their effectiveness Discussions of how technology is changing the job of government sometimes view the challenge reactively but a recent report from Deloitte lands ahead of the issue probing how the work will change and predicting positions based on advances in tech and the rising influence of the consumer and talent markets In Government Jobs of the Future authors Amrita Datar William D Eggers and Jenn Gustetic consider what will government work look like in 2025 and beyond The aim is to educate readers on how public sector staff and machines can work together to optimize our collective impact A central goal Eggers told Government Technology was to deconstruct how that work takes place then reimagine it enabled by machine learning and digital technologies and new business tools The idea of human to machine pairing permeates the study which Eggers said aims to change the dystopian narrative that s often heard about automation leading to disappearing jobs In fact he noted human to machine pairings date back to the mechanization of farming The current shift is already creating new jobs he said highlighting recent additions to teams like the user experience coordinator and positions in search engine optimization What s new Eggers said is the rise of artificial intelligence and tools and techniques around virtual reality augmented reality and in other areas which should dramatically augment staffers capabilities The report s prediction of future jobs suggests a heavy lean on the use of technology to power flexible remote and connected work Additionally the authors found that future jobs will center on employees focusing on their wellness and personal development and enabling broader on the job mobility and personal opportunities such as passion projects This was really about saying we have an opportunity to shape this future of government work It can be incredibly empowering for employees and we wanted to start that process by developing these future government jobs said Eggers The report released Oct 4 envisions six new public sector job profiles of the future built on areas of government service that regardless of their eventual evolution aren t going anywhere Child aid coordinator would investigate abuse neglect or harm against children offer counseling court testimony and coordinate services and interventions The person profiled in this report has a bachelor s in social work along with certifications in analytics and as a social worker they would have previously worked in analytics and as a child welfare specialist Criminal redirection officer would assist low risk nonviolent offenders in virtual incarceration skill building and employment monitored by digital tools This person would have earned a bachelor s in social work and started their career as a correctional case manager after interning at a county probation department Mobility platform manager oversees the city s multimodal transportation system via AI to minimize accidents and disruption while helping optimize prices and routes This individual would hold a bachelor s in mechanical engineering and a master s in urban and regional planning and would be certified in the use of AI for transportation systems Public health and safety guardian inspects public spaces including restaurants schools and day cares and nursing homes investigates incidences of illness analyzes health data and advises public and private officials This person would have a bachelor s in public health and national environmental certifications Smart base commander would command a garrison managing infrastructure and daily operations and connecting with mission commanders and officials A graduate of military schools this individual would hold dual master s degrees in international relations and strategic studies Talent cloud coordinator is grounded in human resources and helps an agency identify and deploy its workforce enterprisewide based on need and skill sets This person would have a bachelor s in business administration and HR certification Technology underpins each future job classification augmenting as the report s authors wrote the existing abilities of these human workers Powered by tech the child aid coordinator and smart base commander were able to pivot their time away from administrative tasks toward client interactions and strategy sessions In the former case Eggers said the time shift could be particularly welcome He cited an analysis done recently in Colorado indicating case workers there spent less than 10 percent of their work time interacting with children and families In the Deloitte report the child aid coordinator s client interaction time rose from 25 percent to 40 percent The criminal redirection officer whose toolbox includes machine learning to enable virtual check ins with clients and a virtual reality training environment epitomizes the ongoing shift that has seen law enforcement deploy predictive policing body worn cameras AI and analytics The emphasis here on virtual incarceration could be a valuable change for the public sector Eggers said calling it a really big opportunity that could save a lot of money In a recent interview around his company s release of Reimagining the Police Workforce A Vision for the Future Jody Weis Accenture s public safety lead for North America and a federal and local member of law enforcement agreed agencies are embracing technology to varying degrees and praised its potential for expanding their grasp Just sifting through that huge haystack to find that proverbial needle having the tool to help you a little bit is incredibly helpful Weis said But hiring and retention will be ongoing challenges for agencies seeking to modernize or redefine job classifications around technology In the area of cybersecurity and creating a hardened posture Eggers recommended agencies engage with the private and educational sectors to facilitate reskilling and training but also consider imbedding AI into their cyberdefense to expand its reach The issue of outdated job classifications and work rules remains a big one for the public sector the author said As part of early steps toward meeting the challenge of technology he recommended being more strategic with HR and moving away from systems that focus on classifications and rules I think at the very basic level governments need to understand where the world is moving and show a destination and that s a little bit of what these jobs of the future are doing and kind of reimagining how to get there and doing some of that basic analysis Eggers said He suggested agencies consider new jobs they ll need to add future skills employees will need and which activities can be automated Theo Douglas is a staff writer for Government Technology His reporting experience includes covering

at Paddington to West London the Thames Valley region including parts of Berkshire parts of Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire and regional services throughout the West of England and South Wales to the South coast of England GWR was due to begin operating the Heathrow Express service under a management contract on behalf of Heathrow Airport Holdings from August 2018 4 however this was later deferred to November 2018 The company began operating in February 1996 as Great Western Trains as part of the privatisation of British Rail In December 1998 it became First Great Western 5 after FirstGroup bought out its partners shares in Great Western Holdings In April 2006 First Great Western First Great Western Link and Wessex Trains were combined into the new Greater Western franchise and brought under the First Great Western brand The company adopted its current name and a new livery in September 2015 to coincide with the start of an extended franchise that is due to run until April 2020 1 The franchise carries around 105 million passengers a year 6 As part of the privatisation of British Rail the Great Western InterCity franchise was awarded by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising to Great Western Holdings in December 1995 and began operations on 4 February 1996 Great Western Holdings was owned by some former British Rail managers 51 FirstBus 24 5 and 3i 24 5 7 8 In March 1998 FirstGroup bought out its partners stakes to give it 100 ownership 9 10 11 In December 1998 the franchise was rebranded as First Great Western 12 On 1 April 2004 First Great Western Link commenced operating the Thames Trains franchise It operated local train services from Paddington to Slough Henley on Thames Reading Didcot Oxford Newbury Bedwyn Worcester Hereford Banbury and Stratford upon Avon It also operated services from Reading to Gatwick Airport via Guildford and Dorking and from Reading to Basingstoke 13 On 1 April 2006 the Great Western Great Western Link and Wessex Trains franchises were combined into a new Greater Western franchise FirstGroup National Express and Stagecoach were shortlisted to bid for this new franchise On 13 December 2005 it was announced that FirstGroup had won the franchise 14 Originally First planned to subdivide its services into three categories based on routes 15 Following feedback from staff and stakeholders the decision was taken to re brand and re livery all services as First Great Western 16 In May 2011 FirstGroup announced that it had decided not to take up the option to extend its franchise beyond the end of March 2013 FirstGroup stated that in the light of the 1bn plan to electrify the Great Western route from London via Bristol to Cardiff it wanted to try to negotiate a longer term deal CEO Tim O Toole said We believe we are best placed to manage these projects and capture the benefits through a longer term franchise 17 By not taking up the option to extend its original franchise contract for a further three years FirstGroup avoided having to pay 826 6m to the government it received extra subsidies totalling 133m from the government in 2010 18 In March 2012 Arriva FirstGroup National Express and Stagecoach were shortlisted to bid for the new franchise The winner was expected to be announced in December 2012 with the new franchisee taking over in April 2013 19 however it was announced in July 2012 that the franchise would be extended due to the late issue of the Invitation to Tender ITT 20 The ITT ran from the end of July until October 2012 The winner would have been announced in March 2013 and taken on the franchise from 21 July 2013 until the end of July 2028 21 The new franchise would include the introduction of new Intercity Express Trains capacity enhancements and smart ticketing 22 The award of the franchise was again delayed in October 2012 while the Department for Transport reviewed the way rail franchises are awarded In January 2013 the government announced that the current competition for the franchise had been terminated and that FirstGroup s contract had been extended until October 2013 23 A two year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013 24 25 and subsequently extended until March 2019 26 27 28 A further extension to April 2019 was granted in March 2015 29 The refurbishment of first class carriages in 2014 included interiors that featured a new GWR logo 30 and no First branding The whole company was rebranded as Great Western Railway GWR on 20 September 2015 and introduced a green livery in recognition of the former Great Western Railway 31 32 The new livery was introduced when HST interiors were refurbished and on sleeper carriages and Class 57 6 locomotives 33 Great Western Railway is the primary train operator in Devon Cornwall Somerset Bristol Berkshire Wiltshire Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire Summer only Saturdays only Great Western Railway operates commuter services between London and destinations such as Slough Greenford Reading Didcot Oxford Newbury Bedwyn Hereford Worcester and Banbury There are also services between Reading and Basingstoke between Reading and Gatwick Airport via Guildford and Dorking Deepdene on the North Downs Line and between Bristol and Cardiff via Newport Trains also run on various north south routes from Cardiff Gloucester and Worcester to Taunton Weymouth Salisbury Southampton Portsmouth and Brighton Many of these run via Bristol The company also runs trains on local routes including branch lines in Devon and Cornwall such as the Looe Newquay Falmouth and St Ives branch lines in Cornwall the Exmouth Paignton and Barnstaple branch lines in Devon and the Gunnislake branch line in Devon and Cornwall Great Western Railway s named passenger trains include 35 Great Western Railway is the only major UK rail operator with restaurant cars These operate on certain West Country and Wales trains to from London Paddington and are available to First Class and Standard Class passengers though only First Class passengers may make advance reservations and have priority over seats in the restaurant 37 Meals in the restaurant car are not included in the price of rail tickets GWR has First Class on all its long distance high speed services First Class on the IETs includes fabric upright seating with tables at every seat as well as an at seat service provided by a customer host on most journeys 38 Unlike the previous HSTs the IETs do not have leather first class seating due to fire regulations Alike the HSTs there are plug sockets and USB charging points at every seat There is upgraded WiFi throughout the First Class carriages 38 Standard Class is provided on all services There is an at seat trolley service on board all IET services with 2 trolleys on a 10 coach train in each portion This is different from the previous HSTs which had express cafes In 2004 2005 79 6 of trains arrived on time defined as within 10 minutes of their scheduled arrival time 39 On 22 December 2006 the First Great Western InterCity service was declared the worst in Britain for delays according to figures from the Office of Rail Regulation with more than one in four trains running late 40 First was also the only train company to achieve a year on year fall in performance results citation needed First Great Western admitted to misreporting the number of cancellations in the period from August to December 2007 revised figures showing the company to have breached the cancellation threshold in the franchise contract Specifically the company was alleged to have deliberately cancelled trains on the day prior to service without the prior approval of the Department for Transport and without recording these cancellations on their performance figures The company was also accused of falsifying records in order to claim dispensation for large numbers of cancellations 41 First Great Western was named in a Passenger Focus survey as the worst train operating company for 2007 42 On 6 September 2007 FirstGroup announced changes to its management structure apparently designed to strengthen the First Great Western commuter services Anthony Smith head of the rail users council Passenger Focus commented A fresh management approach is welcome Clearly looking at the passenger satisfaction scores for First Great Western the train company and Network Rail have a lot to do However passengers will believe it when they see improvements 43 Some delays are attributable to Network Rail rather than the operator as the Office of Rail Regulation ORR found in September 2007 44 when it remarked that the First Great Western service continued to suffer from very high levels of delays attributed to Network Rail and described Network Rail s performance as exceptionally disappointing By 2009 passenger satisfaction with First Great Western was described by Passenger Focus as having significantly improved 45 The company is no longer the worst performing UK rail operator a title which it held for a long period However the Which survey of rail passengers published in February 2013 showed the company scoring lowest of the larger operators with less than 40 satisfaction Virgin which topped the poll managed 67 46 The latest punctuality statistics to be released by Network Rail for period 7 of 2013 2014 were 89 3 PPM Public Performance Measure and a MAA Moving Annual Average of 88 8 for the 12 months up to 12 October 2013 47 In February 2008 the Secretary of State for Transport stated that FGW had fallen persistently short of customers expectations and been unacceptable to both passengers and government She issued First Great Western with a Breach Notice for misreporting cancellations and a Remedial Plan Notice as a result of exceptionally high levels of cancellations and low passenger satisfaction As part of the Remedial Plan Notice First Great Western was required to achieve improvement milestones to lease five more Class 150 units to allow three car trains to be used on Portsmouth Cardiff services to undertake a much more extensive refurbishment of the Thames Turbo fleet to offer 50 higher compensation for the duration of the franchise to offer 500 000 more cheap tickets on off peak services and to improve station customer information systems Failure to do this would result in FGW losing its franchise FirstGroup s railway operating profit meanwhile was reported to have risen 10 in the six months to September 2007 48 49 By June 2009 FGW had transformed its performance to become one of the UK rail network s more punctual operators recording 94 6 of trains arriving on time 50 In February 2010 FGW was named Train Operator of the Year at the national Rail Business awards Presenting the award judges said First Great Western provides an extensive network of commuter regional local and intercity trains The systems they have put into place over the last two years have made a significant improvement to the service they now provide 51 However in February 2015 First Great Western came 17th out of 21 in Which magazine s Best and worst UK train companies survey Customers gave First Great Western a score of 47 compared to the worst performing operator Thameslink and Great Northern with a score of 43 and the best performing operator Grand Central with a score of 76 First Great Western also scored 3 5 stars across five of six specific categories apart from Value for money in which First Great Western scored 2 5 stars 52 First Great Western has been criticised for overcrowded trains and in January 2007 commuters on the Bath Bristol service staged a protest against overcrowding Participants were issued with imitation tickets printed with Ticket type standing only Class cattle truck Route hell and back Price up 12 The company threatened protestors with criminal prosecution and fines of 5 000 but staff failed to enforce ticket requirements 55 Alison Forster First Great Western s Managing Director at that time apologised to customers 56 In January 2008 another fare strike was held as a passenger group said that not enough improvements have been made despite First Great Western announcing that 2008 season tickets and car parking charges would be frozen until the end of the year 57 58 In August 2010 First Great Western was shown to have operated all of the top ten most overcrowded trains in England and Wales mostly between Reading and London Paddington 59 By December 2011 this had reduced to two 60 In 2011 First Great Western was revealed to be the train company with the highest levels of overcrowding an average of 16 6 of passengers were shown to standing during the morning and evening peak times 61 In 2012 it held the record for the most overcrowded train carrying nearly twice its capacity the 07 44 Henley on Thames to London Paddington 60 Paddington the London terminus for many FGW services was identified as the most overcrowded station 59 The company was also listed as the operator with the most passengers in excess of capacity in the south east region in 2012 62 In July 2018 a disabled woman was threatened by Great Western Railway staff with police action and removal from the train she was travelling in for using a disabled space for her mobility scooter 63 Canadian born comedian Tanyalee Davis who has a form of dwarfism said she was humiliated when a Great Western Railway guard made an announcement that she was causing problems which had delayed the train The incident occurred after a woman travelling with a young child demanded that Davis make way for her pram 64 GWR said the incident should not have happened and No one travelling with us should be left feeling like this 65 The pre imminent arrival of the new Class 800 saw a series of strikes by the RMT union over who has the right to control the doors First Great Western as it was known at the time wanted to replace guards with driver only operation DOO however following several discussions it was agreed to keep guards on all IET services 66 Another strike took place In early December 2016 amidst a background of ongoing rail strikes on a national level the RMT ballotted Servest UK workers who were employed on an outsourcing contract to GWR as cleaners the ballot passed in favour of strike action by 98 A disruptive transfer period in the outsourcing contract from Mitie to Servest UK had resulted in what the RMT referred to as the creation of a two tier workforce amongst cleaners at GWR with an inequality in pay and working conditions between cleaners employed directly by GWR and those outsourced to Servest UK 67 Two 24 hour strikes were held between 0600 0600 on 16 17 December and 23 24 December 68 followed by a 48 hour strike between 0600 on 19 January and 0600 on 21 January 2017 69 Further industrial action was suspended by the RMT following the January strike as a result of an improvement in ongoing negotiations between the RMT GWR and Servest UK 70 The dispute was formally resolved in July 2017 as RMT members voted in favour of accepting a new pay deal 71 Great Western Railway inherited a fleet of InterCity 125 sets Class 43 power cars and Mark 3 Coaches and Class 57 locomotives and Mark 3 sleeper coaches from BR In 2006 it inherited a fleet of Class 165 and Class 166 units from First Great Western Link and a fleet of Class 143 Class 150 Class 153 and Class 158 units from Wessex Trains Most Great Western Railway intercity services are operated by a fleet of fifty seven Class 800 trains GWR operates most of its long distance services between London and destinations such as Swindon Chippenham Bath Spa Bristol Temple Meads Cardiff Central Swansea Carmarthen Cheltenham Spa Oxford Worcester Shrub Hill and Hereford using these trains which gradually replaced the older Class 43 HST trains between Autumn 2017 and Spring 2019 Class 800s may also be used for services to Paignton and Plymouth although the majority of services to far southwestern destinations are operated using Class 802 trains which have higher engine power to cope with the steeper gradients in the south west of the country GWR operates most long distance services between London and destinations in the west of the network such as Paignton Newquay Plymouth and Penzance using its fleet of thirty six Class 802 trains the first of which was introduced on 20 August 2018 These trains are almost identical to Great Western Railway s fleet of Class 800 trains the only key difference being that the Class 802 trains have a higher engine operating power 700 kW 940 hp per engine as opposed to 560 kW 750 hp and are fitted with larger fuel tanks to cope with the gradients and extended running in diesel mode on the long unelectrified stretches in Devon and Cornwall 72 Four Class 57 6 locomotives haul Night Riviera Sleeper services and failed HST sets 73 When these are unavailable GWR hires Direct Rail Services Class 57 3 locomotives to operate the Night Riviera 74 The Class 165 Thames Turbo is a two or three coach DMU used on shorter distance services in the Thames Valley area with the majority based at Reading Traction Maintenance Depot They are mainly used on branches such as the Greenford branch line Slough Windsor Eton line Marlow branch line and Regatta Line They are also used on services between Reading and Basingstoke Newbury Didcot Parkway and Oxford Banbury and sometimes services between London and Bedwyn Oxford Some eventually all are based at St Philip s Marsh depot in Bristol where they work on the most of the lines in the area including the Severn Beach line Heart of Wessex Line Golden Valley line and Bristol to Exeter line From summer 2018 they are due to run on Cardiff Central to Portsmouth Harbour services too In response to its Remedial Plan Notice First Great Western undertook a more thorough refurbishment of the Thames Turbo fleet than originally planned 75 the trains were to be fitted with improved lighting carpets toilets and a revised seating layout 76 This refurbishment started in September 2016 The Class 166 Thames Express Turbo is a three coach DMU similar to the Class 165 units but with an internal layout more suitable for longer distance services They are now mostly based at St Philip s Marsh depot in Bristol where they currently work on the most of the lines in the area including the Wessex Main Line Severn Beach line Heart of Wessex Line Golden Valley line and Bristol to Taunton line The Class 387 Electrostar is a four coach EMU built by Bombardier with a 2 2 seating layout tables plug sockets and free WiFi It can be operated in four eight and twelve coach formations The class began to enter service in September 2016 on weekday peak services between London Paddington and Hayes Harlington using the overhead electrical equipment used by Heathrow Express Services using the class were extended to Maidenhead in May 2017 77 and later to Didcot Parkway 78 and from Reading to Newbury Bombardier Transportation will modify twelve of these trains by December 2019 at Ilford Depot providing new first class seating wi fi luggage racks and on board entertainment to operate Heathrow Express services replacing the existing Class 332 4 Until 2017 GWR operated the vast majority of their long distance services with a fleet of 58 InterCity 125 sets 79 each consisting of eight Mark 3 coaches between two Class 43 locomotives GWR operated the largest InterCity 125 fleet owning five sets outright the rest were leased from Angel Trains and Porterbrook From 2009 to 2012 when Class 180s were reintroduced on the Cotswold line 80 all the company s intercity services were worked by HSTs except the Night Riviera sleeper service between London Paddington and Penzance From late 2017 following the completion of electrification from Hayes Harlington to the west of England 81 intercity services gradually became operated by Class 800 IETs although a few peak services remained operated by HSTs until early 2019 GWR continued to use HSTs on services to Exeter Plymouth and Penzance until early 2019 when the majority were withdrawn in favour of Class 802 units although a few full length eight carriage HSTs will continue to work some services between London and the South West until 18 May 2019 82 The youngest Class 43 locomotive dated from 1982 After a successful trial by Angel Trains and FGW in 2004 two power cars received new MTU engines while two received new Paxman VP185s fitted by Brush Traction of Loughborough The MTU engine proved the better option both for reliability and for emissions resulting in FGW Brush and Angel Trains starting the HST Modernisation programme The last power cars to be re engineered were released in April 2008 while several other companies HSTs have now all undergone a similar programme 83 GWR s High Speed Train fleet were refurbished by Bombardier in Derby and Ilford between 2006 and 2008 84 with leather seats introduced in First Class redesigned toilets a redesigned buffet and at seat power points The company opted for mainly airline seats giving more seats per train Following the Southall and Ladbroke Grove rail crashes GWR requires its HSTs to have Automatic Train Protection and Automatic Warning System safety systems in operation If either is faulty the train is not used Great Western Railway decided to retain 24 powercars and 48 carriages to form 11 four carriage sets for use on local services between Cardiff and Penzance These are progressively being fitted with automatic doors and controlled emission toilets to allow their operation beyond 2020 at Doncaster Works 85 As of April 2019 while the majority of full length HSTs have been withdrawn from Intercity services short HST sets are progressively being introduced on local services in the South West This includes using unrefurbished slam door sets due to a delay in the sliding door sets First Great Western inherited the small fleet of seven two coach Class 143 Pacer railbuses from Wessex Trains following the franchise merger in April 2006 86 87 They are currently used on suburban services in and around Exeter The Class 143 fleet was fully refurbished during 2008 and 2009 and painted in the same livery as the rest of the West of England fleet 88 Since they are unable to meet an accessibility requirement they will be withdrawn at the end of 2019 unless they receive an extensive refurbishment proposed by Porterbrook who own the class 143s and class 144s 89 The type is due to be replaced by Class 158 units cascaded from the Bristol area 90 Some units have been repainted in the green GWR livery without any interior refurbishment The first unit repainted was 143603 in July 2017 In late 2011 the two original three car prototype Class 150 Sprinter units Nos 150001 and 150002 were transferred from London Midland to work services on the Reading to Basingstoke Line allowing the release of Class 165 and 166 units to reinforce other Thames Valley services 91 They were transferred to West of England services in 2017 The fleet of 17 two coach Class 150 Sprinter units was inherited from Wessex Trains as part of the Greater Western franchise shuffle The fleet had been refurbished by Wessex Trains in 2003 with 2 2 seating arranged in a mixture of airline face to back and table seating The fleet is widespread throughout the former Wessex area and carried a maroon livery with advertising vinyls for South West Tourism Each unit was sponsored by a district town or attraction and carried a unique livery Most received names of attractions places and branch lines Two units were repainted into the new First Local livery but all units are now due to receive the new green GWR livery As part of a national fleet shuffle eight units went to Arriva Trains Wales on 10 December 2006 and were replaced with 8 Class 158 units First Great Western received five extra Class 150 2 units in May 2007 as part of its Remedial Plan Notice to enable three car Class 158 trains to operate on the Portsmouth Cardiff services 75 Five Class 150 sets were hired from Arriva Trains Wales from March 2008 until they were returned in November 2010 All of Great Western Railway s Class 150 2s are now based at Exeter TMD citation needed The Class 158 is a two or three coach DMU used on regional express services in the former Wessex Trains area In February 2008 as part of its Remedial Plan Notice First Great Western announced that it would form some hybrid 3 car Class 158 units in March 2008 made possible by the transfer of five Class 150 2 units from Arriva Trains Wales 75 There are now ten hybrid units in operation and combined with the non hybrid 3 car unit this provides eleven 3 car units to operate services between Portsmouth and Cardiff Great Malvern and Brighton and Great Malvern and Weymouth After the introduction of Class 150 1 trains from London Overground and London Midland three of the remaining five 2 coach Class 158s will be reformed to provide two further 3 coach Class 158s 92 The fleet was refurbished in a programme begun in 2007 93 which included fitting of reupholstered seats new lighting and floor coverings CCTV within the passenger saloons and refurbished toilets At the same time the exteriors of the vehicles were repainted in the updated FGW livery including artwork depicting various local places of interest GWR s Class 158 vehicles were refurbished at Wabtec in Doncaster 94 GWR also hires a Class 158 or occasionally a Class 159 from South Western Railway on a daily basis to cover for stock shortages The units are crewed by GWR staff and usually work on Bristol area routes so that they can easily return to their depot in Salisbury citation needed In 2018 Class 158s will begin running alongside the first completed Short set HST on services between Cardiff Bristol Taunton Exeter Plymouth and Penzance Gradually as more Short set HSTs enter service on the route the Class 158s will move onto local and cross county services in and around Exeter citation needed High Speed TrainIntercity Express TrainIn April 2018 GWR announced that they were procuring nineteen bi mode dual voltage Class 769 units from Spring 2019 for use on Reading to Gatwick Oxford and mainline suburban services to London Paddington to cover the loss of Class 387 units which will operate the Heathrow Express service 105 Super SprinterLondon Bristol CheltenhamLocomotive hauled trains were in use on services between Cardiff Bristol Taunton and Paignton from December 2008 until November 2010 These were Class 67 and Class 57 locomotives with Mark 2 coaching stock They had one set of carriages initially but a further set of carriages between December 2009 and October 2010 These services ran in the short term to cover for the unavailability of DMU trains When sufficient DMUs were available following the transfer of 6 Class 150 1 sets from London Overground the locomotives and coaching stock were withdrawn 106 First Great Western issued a tender in May 2013 so that locomotive hauled trains or other train formations can be operated on the Taunton Cardiff route again starting in December 2013 This would cover for its DMUs while they are off for refurbishment on Monday Friday diagrams If locomotive hauled trains were to be used again they would start four years after the final trains from the previous diagrams ran 107 Twelve Class 142 Pacer DMUs were received by First Great Western in 2007 starting operations that December These were loaned from Northern where they had been stored in part to cover for refurbishment of FGW s Sprinter fleets but also to allow the Class 158s to be reformed as three coach sets They were based at Exeter TMD working alongside the similar Class 143s on services in Devon and Cornwall including the Avocet Line Riviera Line and Tarka Line Five 142s were returned to Northern Rail in late 2008 following the completion of the refresh of Class 150 Sprinter units The remaining seven units were returned to Northern Rail by November 2011 as they had been replaced by Class 150 units cascaded from London Overground and London Midland following the arrival of new Class 172 Turbostar units GWR s Night Riviera service also included the UK s last Motorail service until that aspect was withdrawn at the end of the 2005 summer season due to low usage First Great Western previously leased 14 Class 180 Adelante units operating on the Great Western Main Line but following technical issues they were transferred elsewhere 108 109 In 2012 five units were returned to First Great Western to operate weekday services on the Cotswold Line allowing class 165 and 166 units to be reallocated to increase capacity on Thames Valley services 80 The Class 180s left GWR during 2017 to join Grand Central 110 The first left the fleet in June 2017 111 the last transferred in December that year The 150 1s in the GWR fleet transferred to Northern in stages beginning with the first three in August 2017 when their leases expired 112 and ending in April 2018 113 Great Western Trains adopted an ivory and green livery Following the rebranding as First Great Western fader vinyls were added to the ivory and a gold bar containing the stylised FirstGroup F and Great Western logos 114 This livery was sometimes known as the fag packet livery 115 The rolling stock used on the Night Riviera sleeper service retained the original green and gold First Great Western livery until the stock forming these services was refurbished in 2007 when they were painted into dynamic lines livery with vinyls advertising that the coaches operated the Night Riviera Sleeper When the Class 180 Adelante units were delivered they were painted in the intercity version of FirstGroup s corporate livery This consisted of a blue base with purple and gold bars and large pink Fs The doors were painted white to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 The HST fleet was repainted to match as they went through overhaul however the livery on the power cars has been altered following problems with dirt build up on the large white areas citation needed The new Greater Western franchise involved repainting the HST fleet into FirstGroup s Dynamic Lines livery for intercity and commuter services in the former First Great Western and First Great Western Link areas The livery was initially applied to the HST fleet as they went through refurbishment although the Class 180 units did not receive the new livery due to the termination of their lease The commuter units also received the new livery while receiving standard maintenance as a refurbishment was not originally planned 116 A second livery known as Local Lines was applied to the DMU fleet replacing the Dynamic Lines with the names of local attractions forming a similar outline 117 The rebranding of the company as Great Western Railway introduced a new dark green livery in September 2015 which will be rolled out across the fleet by 2018 33 Great Western Railway trains are based at eight depots Other depots at Landore Swansea and Old Oak Common London closed in 2018 Channel 5 broadcast two television series looking into day to day challenges of the Great Western mainline including events at Dawlish as well as the sea wall destruction Cheltenham race day and rugby at Cardiff It was broadcast as The Railway First Great Western and the last series aired in 2015 A similar series based on London Paddington started in September 2017 and covered events such as the reaction to the Manchester and London Bridge attacks and several days of severe disruption The franchise is due to end on 31 March 2020 In November 2017 the Department for Transport announced its intention to negotiate a further extension for the franchise until April 2022 with an option to extend for a further two years

components of productive teams embracing research that groups are more creative than individuals Private sector businesses are automating tedious tasks augmenting workers with artificial intelligence technologies reskilling and upskilling their workforces focusing on employee wellness and hungrily recruiting talent Government will have to catch up Perhaps nowhere is the gap between the public and private sector greater than in workforce management Most public sector organizations are still locked into decades old employee policies such as rigid job classifications lockstep pay and a reliance on seniority as a substitute for capability The reality is that government agencies are increasingly called upon to address society s most complex challenges while using workforce approaches rooted in the distant past The good news Change is possible and beginning to happen A new Deloitte study explores some of the ways the nature of government work the public workforce itself and the workplace it occupies will all need to continue to evolve Work New technologies can transform the capabilities of a government worker Artificially intelligent chatbots for example can perform triage on citizen questions freeing human attention for less routine queries The Army s recruitment chatbot SGT STAR does the work of 55 recruiters answering 94 percent of questions A Deloitte analysis of AI s potential found that automation could save the federal government as much as 1 2 billion hours of work annually What AI doesn t automate it can enhance Child welfare caseworkers who according to one study spend just 9 percent of their time with children but 37 5 percent of their time on paperwork could use technology to auto populate documentation freeing time for visits AI also can correlate hospital truancy and arrest records to flag children in danger Some restaurant health inspectors already analyze big data to identify likely candidates for inspections In Chicago for instance tests found 24 percent more critical violations and on average isolated dangers from the food system a week earlier For effective work redesign it s helpful to adopt a two pronged strategy of zooming in and zooming out A zooming in approach hones in on individual tasks and processes that have the most potential to be optimized through automation Zooming out entails looking at the bigger picture to define what work redesign means for entire job classifications departments and the organization as a whole Workforce Specialists in fields like cybersecurity agile development and artificial intelligence are not likely to commit decades to one government position and if they did they d still need to swap into the tech sector periodically to sharpen their skills That s why some government technology programs are taking a tour of duty approach letting private sector experts serve in the public sector for a few years on specific projects without locking them into a lifetime of government work At the federal level the General Services Administration s 18F digital services agency the Oak Ridge Institute for Science Education and the Presidential Innovation Fellows program all help government solve problems with temporary outside hires At the state level Michigan s Cyber Civilian Corps a volunteer group of cybersecurity professionals from the private sector and academia as well as government can be called upon if the governor declares a cyber emergency And long term government workers don t need to be stuck in one place A talent cloud can prepare for unexpected staffing needs by identifying in advance workers with special skills and applying them to tasks suited to their expertise Canada is experimenting with letting multiple agencies dip into a talent cloud and hire workers for specific missions Workers keep their union membership rights and benefits but may be called into service by any agency Workplace Empirical science rarely guides hiring But management is becoming more data driven Applying the newest science on team building personal efficiency and employee wellness to government agencies can upgrade the workplace to better attract retain and utilize talent Insights from studies of the composition and functioning of effective teams can inform decisions about using talents more effectively Organizational network analysis for example can use metadata from emails and other sources to map communication patterns in organizations accurately predicting individuals who will be high performers detecting unsatisfied employees six months before they actually quit and identifying leadership behaviors that correlate with success Modern workplace wellness programs are also extremely impactful Improving employee wellness can reduce lost work days increase retention and fuel productivity After the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center provided a physician and nurse case manager for employees it saw an 80 percent decline in lost work days over six years for a cost savings of 1 5 million In short the future of government work will require a level of dynamic workforce management far beyond the current practices of the public sector The potential for government agencies to unlock more human capital potential and make the public sector a magnet for talent is enormous If states changed where and how we select candidates turnout would soar and we d learn a lot more about what voters really think In preparing for a disaster and recovering from one residents and businesses need to know that their voices will be heard The way governments are measuring results is becoming kinder and more effective As Buffalo s former mayor demonstrated to bring the right people together you have to know what it takes to make a project succeed Local governments are using internet surveys to better gauge residents needs Some states are finding ways to make rules easier to navigate and less costly for business while continuing to protect the public s interests CommentThe administration is actively moving forward with its IT modernization efforts for government agencies For example this summer we saw Office of Management and Budget announce the first funding awards from the Technology Modernization Fund a significant milestone and since then it has continued conversations on the direct correlation between technology investments and business outcomes The benefits of IT modernization are endless It will allow the federal government to lay the groundwork for continued technological advancement and innovation into the future Improved efficiency and network strength better user experience for employees and citizens increased reliability and security of systems are just the beginning Since the initial funding awards however conversations in Congress about replenishing the fund have called for more data and transparency about how the fund is used The President s Management Agenda includes a mandate for agencies to implement the Technology Business Management system an industry standard for tracking IT costs by 2022 Even though these discussions continue it should not deter agency CIOs from forging ahead with their agency s IT modernization plans In doing so there are certain improvements that CIOs should consider to meet cost benefit standards and to ensure that their agency has the strongest IT infrastructure possible Invest in a strong scalable networkGiven the move toward more demonstrably data driven projects and greater transparency CIOs must lay a strong foundation for future modernization projects Network transformation is a priority for the federal government the General Services Administration has given agencies until May 2020 to shift their telecommunications to the next gen Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions contract vehicle EIS is intended to help agencies modernize their IT and telecommunication systems With the government deadline looming the necessity for a strong scalable network is undisputable Further smart agencies are using today s contract vehicles to modernize Intelligent networking systems help employees operate efficiently speed application delivery enable robust communication and improve constituent interactions and experiences A strong network is just the beginningA strong network unlocks many benefits for federal agencies but speed typically the first concern for decision makers is just part of the equation Agencies need to ensure that their networks support the capacity and data consumption levels required by existing and emerging technologies Mobile technologies and the ability to access data remotely improve federal employees connectivity and productivity but can only make employees as efficient as a network allows Strong networks allow for the adoption of more emerging technologies such as IoT and immersive or augmented applications that can be used to improve training for medical and military personnel For many agencies network improvements are just the first in a series of necessary improvements Some agencies face deadlines like the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative which gives federal agencies until 2020 to optimize their data centers Federal agencies are increasingly turning to cloud technology to reduce costs improve efficiency and expand data sharing Scalable reliable networks give agencies greater choice to maintain speed and efficiency as they modernize their IT systems Wrap security into modernization plansFocusing on network transformation also gives CIOs the opportunity to build security into their modernization plans from the beginning As agencies use more advanced technologies and devices and employees grow increasingly connected new avenues of cyberattacks open up to bad actors Cybersecurity at the federal level can be a matter of national security according to Verizon s 2018 Data Breach Investigations Report state affiliated actors accounted for over half of all breaches in the public sector Scalable networks like software defined networks or software defined wide area networks allow agencies to embed security into their systems at the network level greatly reducing the risk of an attack Modernized networks not only set agencies up to meet federally mandated modernization deadlines but also allow them to successfully pursue other necessary modernization projects such as data center consolidation or cloud migration Working with experienced vendors that can design implement and support comprehensive end to end solutions allowing for consistency in unified communications and a coherent managed security plan enables agencies to take full advantage of emerging technology With modernized networks agencies gain the flexibility to adopt and implement new innovations such as augmented reality training applications that keep pace as technologies evolve and employee and constituent expectations change As CIOs plan for IT modernization it is essential that they consider if they have the network to support the projects necessary to keep up with innovation and to successfully and efficiently carry out their

messages and social media aided the rescue efforts Coast Guard photo by Petty Officer 2nd Class Sondra Kay Kneen The concept of mobility in the government today is a source of many things excitement productivity innovation consternation The vision for tomorrow however is a much broader wide open horizon of potential uses and applications These days mobility conversations center on what usage should and will look like just as much as they center on establishment and implementation of policies In other areas such an approach would be putting the proverbial cart before the horse but mobility demands it Those demands come in the form of soldiers needing better communications on the battlefield agencies looking for savings that mobility can help yield disaster response that hinges on quickness and agility and a citizenry that insists the government catch up with commercial IT It is a brave new world There are a lot of capabilities Rear Adm Ron Hewitt director of the office of emergency communications at the Homeland Security Department said Aug 8 at the AFCEA Bethesda Mobile Technology Symposium in Washington There s a lot of innovation that s occurring and we re all adapting on the fly Expect to see the government collaborating in new and different ways to meet the pressing demands including agencies working together as well as with non governmental organizations according to Thom Rubel vice president of IDC Government Insights Government organizations are going to partner with other agencies to create wholeness around the rapidly increasing use of applications Citizens don t care who it comes from what they really want is something useful in the end Rubel said He also noted that people are abandoning personal computers in record numbers In 2015 we re projecting there will be more consumers in the U S accessing the Internet through mobile devices than through PCs At the Defense Department mobile technologies already play a critical role that will continue to grow as leaders at the top and troops on the ground push for more mobility and as the services hash out responsibilities and authorities Already some70 mobile pilot programs have helped meet and prove military requirements and officials must determine how to move forward It s been a juggling act admitted Brian Teeple principle director for the deputy CIO for command control communications and computers and information infrastructure capabilities in the DOD CIO office Nonetheless expect the Pentagon in the coming years to have a list of approved mobile devices mobile device management policies in place a DOD app store shared services and a reduction in desktops laptops offices and landlines he said But the Pentagon won t be completely virtual just yet he added I think there will still be some challenges how do we incorporate satellite communications so that there s no out of range for the soldier Some of the security measures will still be evolving face recognition voice recognition and how do you use that instead of a common access card with a sled hooked up to a device Teeple said Those things are all in the works We ve seen them They ve been kind of lower priority to make sure we re doing this securely but we ll be trying to decide what the right way is and how to implement In the world of disaster response mobile devices have proven critical for some time and officials are anxious to further institute tools for taking action when a catastrophe strikes In 2010 the earthquake that struck Haiti revealed the importance of mobility survivors sent text messages beneath the rubble and social networks were central to getting a handle on the damage and aftermath After 2011 s massive earthquake in Japan social media again proved to be a lifeline And when the Japanese government was slow to release data related to damaged nuclear reactors citizen scientists put together their own plans for monitoring and mapping the situation forcing the government into greater transparency according to Jody Ranck author of Connected Health How Mobile Phones Cloud and Big Data will Reinvent Healthcare Today the U S government is building on such examples The Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration are spearheading efforts that will shape the future of mobility in crisis response The future I think my program is heading toward is becoming a data provider not for my federal partners but for the disaster response community all the way down to state and local levels said Karole Johns program manager at FEMA s disaster assistance improvement program Eventually we will become an intake service We will collect all of the information from a disaster or survivor event package it and pass it back to whatever entity is authorized to receive that data At the NTIA the First Responder Network Authority FirstNet is set to become the first nationwide high speed network dedicated to public safety with 56 states and territories assigned a coordinator and planning to roll out dedicated broadband services Hewitt said FirstNet will move public safety to the next generation Hewitt said No network now in the United States provides national coverage and yet this has been identified to provide that national coverage While the program is still in its infancy it involves an estimated 35 000 radio access networks and a nationwide spectrum license to link first responders at all levels Work now under way to set up the network includes outreach and agreements with states

Cottle Katie JorgensenWind back the clock to 1971 Jane a freshly minted college graduate joins the government as a clerk Jane s work consists largely of entering information into databases and creating reports which requires her to spend the better part of her work day seated at a terminal near a mainframe computer that fills an entire room Jane and her colleagues are expected to be at their desks from 9 a m to 5 p m five days a week Jane is grateful to have a steady 9 to 5 job and plans to spend her entire career with her agency Flash forward 40 years and meet Jane s grandson Ian He carries a slim tablet wherever he goes which has more computing power than the mainframe with which Jane worked Ian is constantly tethered to the Internet and works 24 7 from wherever he is Ian expects to switch from project to project and office to office as his career develops and his interests evolve If he feels he has reached the limit of his ability to learn or grow in one role he will look elsewhere for a new opportunity What if the government could give Ian the opportunities and experiences he seeks The GovCloud concept proposed in this paper would restructure government workforces in a way that takes advantage of the talents and preferences of workers like Ian who are entering the workforce today The model is based on a large body of research from interviews with public and private sector experts to best practices from innovative organizations both public and private This is the first generation of people that work play think and learn differently than their parents They are the first generation to not be afraid of technology It s like the air to them Don Tapscott author of Grown Up DigitalThis report details trends in work and technology that offer significant opportunities for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the government workforce It lays out the GovCloud model explaining how governments could be organized to take advantage of its flexibility It examines how work would be performed in the new model and discusses potential changes to government HR programs to support GovCloud Other sections provide resources for executives including a tool to help determine cloud eligibility steps they can take to pilot the cloud concept and future scenarios illustrating the cloud in action The GovCloud model represents a dramatic departure from the status quo It is bound to be greeted with some skepticism Without such innovation however governments will be left to confront the challenges of tomorrow with the workforce structure of yesterday The details of the GovCloud model are open for debate The purpose of this paper is to jumpstart that debate Forty years ago more than half of employed American adults worked in either blue collar or clerical jobs Today less than 40 percent work in these same categories and the share continues to shrink 1 Jobs requiring routine or manual tasks are disappearing while those requiring complex communication skills and expert thinking are becoming the norm 2 Increasingly employers seek workers capable of creative and knowledge based work We should ask ourselves whether we re truly satisfied with the status quo Are our workday lives so fulfilling and our organizations so boundlessly capable that it s now pointless to long for something better Gary Hamel author of The Future of ManagementThe next generation of creative knowledge workers has already entered the job market These Millennials came of age in a rapidly and radically changing world They are the first true digital natives They have grown up with instant access to information through technology As such Millennials have considerably different expectations for the kind of work they do and the information they use The pursuit for variety in work has led Millennials to cite simply needing a change as their top reason for switching jobs 3Advances in technology have also changed the actual ways in which people perform work The ability to crowdsource tasks is one example of this change Since its founding in 2001 volunteers have produced and contributed to over 19 million articles in 281 languages on Wikipedia 4 Built around this concept a burgeoning industry is developing around microtasking dividing work up into small tasks that can be farmed out to workers Amazon s Mechanical Turk rolled out in 2005 allows users to post tasks to a platform where registered workers can accept and complete them for a small fee When this paper was written more than 195 000 tasks were available on Mechanical Turk 5Such technologies may offer suitable possibilities for the public sector Microtask a Finnish cloud labor company maintains Digitalkoot a program that helps the Finnish National Library convert its image archives into digital text and correct existing errors It does so with volunteered labor participants simply play a game in which they are shown the image of a word and then must type it out to help a cartoon character cross a bridge In doing so they are turning scanned images into searchable text greatly improving the search accuracy of old manuscripts 6 At present more than 100 000 people have completed over 6 million microtasks associated with this project 7As the pace of computing power and machine learning increases professors Frank Levy and Richard Murnane contend that more tasks will move from human to computer processing 8 Skeptics need look no further than IBM s Watson a computer that can answer questions posed in natural language In February 2011 Watson defeated two all time champions of the quiz show Jeopardy This was not solely a publicity stunt IBM hopes to sell Watson to hospitals and call centers to help them answer questions from the public 9Around the globe more and more governments are looking to increase telework among employees In 2010 the U S government passed legislation calling for more telework opportunities for government employees Likewise the Australian government in order to attract and retain information and communications technology workers instituted a teleworking policy in 2009 requiring agencies to implement flexible work plans 10 Other countries including Norway and Germany are also focusing on flexible work arrangements to improve public sector recruiting 11 In Canada the government has an official telework policy that recognizes changes are occurring in the public service workforce with a shift towards more knowledge workers and encourages departments to implement telework arrangements 12Cloud definitionsCloud

demand GovLabSource Frank Levy and Richard J Murnane The New Division of Labor How Computers are Creating the Next Job Market Princeton Princeton University Press 2004 p 50 Figure 1 Trends in routine and non routine tasks in the U S 1960 200213These are all powerful steps in the right direction for employees whose natural work rhythms are not locked into 9 to 5 Some companies have taken telework one step further British Telecom is pushing the concept of agile working through its Workstyle Project where employees decide what work arrangements best suit them rather than a rigid definition by location and hours BT Workstyle is one of the largest flexible working projects in Europe with over 11 000 home based workers BT has found that its home enabled employees are on average 20 percent more productive than their office based colleagues 14Similarly U S electronics retailer Best Buy experimented with a Results Only Work Environment ROWE In a ROWE what matters is not whether employees are in their office but rather that they complete their work and achieve measurable outcomes In a ROWE salaried employees must put in as much time as is actually needed to do their work no more no less The decline in routine and manual tasks and the rise of new ways of working is not isolated to the private sector In 1950 the U S federal workforce largely comprised clerks performing repetitive tasks About 62 percent performed these tasks while only 11 percent performed more white collar work By 2000 those relationships were reversed Fifteen percent performed repetitive tasks compared to 56 percent in the white collar categories 16 Similarly in 1944 the number of workers in the UK civil service considered industrial totaled 505 000 By 2003 this number fell to 18 200 with non industrial workers reaching 538 000 in 2004 17 And in Canada in 2006 knowledge based workers represented 58 percent of federal workers in the Core Public Administration up from 41 percent 11 years earlier 18The swelling ranks of non industrial government workers indicate a shift in public sector jobs toward creative collaborative and complex work The workforce structure however designed for clerks of the last century remains largely the same With limited flexibility to distribute resources governments often address change by creating new agencies and programs This can be seen following major events like the outbreaks of the Avian flu and SARs in the past decade 9 11 and the financial crisis of 2008 Source United States Office of Personnel Management A Fresh Start for Federal Pay A Case for Modernization April 2002 p 5 http www opm gov strategiccomp whtpaper pdfFigure 2 The changing U S federal workforce 1950 200015Given increasing budgetary pressures and burgeoning national debts the conventional model of creating new agencies or permanent structures in response to new challenges is unsustainable This is exacerbated by our inability to accurately predict future needs and trends Consider a 1968 Business Week article proclaiming that the Japanese auto industry isn t likely to carve out a big share of the market for itself or the president of Digital Equipment Corporation who in 1977 said t here is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home 19The world is full of experts who attempt to predict the future and fail 20Instead of endeavoring to predict the future governments can choose to create a flexible workforce that can quickly adapt to future work requirements To accomplish this the government can learn from a game changing concept in the technology world cloud computing Major organizations and small startups alike increase their flexibility by sharing storage space information and resources in a cloud allowing them to quickly scale resources up and down as needed Why not apply the cloud model to people The creation of a government wide human cloud could provide significant benefits including A cloud based government workforce or GovCloud could include workers who perform a range of creative problem focused work Rather than being slotted into any single government agency cloud workers would be true government wide employees This section outlines the organizational structure of the GovCloud model which rests on three main pillars a cloud of government workers thin executive agencies and shared services Most government workforce models tend to constrain workers by isolating them in separate agencies Consider the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom and the subsequent slaughter of more than 6 million pigs sheep and cattle The problem of an impacted food supply is complicated In most countries multiple agencies focus on agriculture food production and public health In the United Kingdom the army and even tourism ministries were impacted by the outbreak as agencies became overwhelmed by the number of animals in need of disposal and by the cordoning off of tourist areas to prevent the spread of the disease Yet the structure of government agencies often confines employees to work in information silos creating inherent operational inefficiencies In a cloud workforce model experts in each area could be pulled together to support remedies and propose coordinated corrective measures I want someone saying Did you know that the Ministry of Justice is doing that or could you piggy back on what the communities department is doing or had you thought about doing it in this way You ve got to get away from thinking about centralized command and control Dame Helen Ghosh Permanent Secretary UK Home Office 21The FedCloud modelThe GovCloud model could become a new pillar of government comprising permanent employees who undertake a wide variety of creative problem focused work As needed the GovCloud model could also take advantage of those outside government including citizens looking for extra part time work full time contractors and individual consultants Cloud workers would vary in background and expertise but would exhibit traits of free agent workers self sufficient self motivated employees who exhibit a strong loyalty to teams colleagues and clients Daniel Pink author of Drive The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us argues that 33 million Americans one quarter of the workforce already operate as free agents 22According to the white paper Lessons of the Great Recession from Swiss staffing company Adecco contingent workers those who chose non traditional employment arrangements23 are expected to eventually make up about 25 percent of the global workforce 24These more autonomous workers according to Pink are better suited to 21st century work and are more productive even without traditional monetary incentives 25The fluid nature of the cloud can provide significant benefits The nature of the cloud teams forming and dissolving as their tasks require encourages workers to focus on specific project outcomes rather than ongoing operations Thin agency structures could lead to Greater use of shared services could allow the federal government to The need to support some ongoing missions will remain of course These missions will be carried out by thin agencies Under the cloud concept federal agencies would remain focused on specific missions and ongoing oversight These agencies however would become thinner as many of their knowledge workers transfer into the cloud Thin agencies could also create opportunities to streamline organizations with overlapping missions Employees working in thin agencies could fall into two main categories GovCloud could change the highest levels of public sector workers as we know them today The Senior Executive Service in the United States Permanent Secretaries and Directors General in the United Kingdom and Australia all such senior officials could rotate between agencies shared services and the cloud which would reflect the original intent behind many of these high level offices giving executives a breadth of experience in roles across government to help develop shared values and a broad perspective An important benefit of rotation would be the ability to tap into cloud networks to assemble high performing teams To further focus agencies on specific missions many of their back office support functions could be pulled into government wide shared service arrangements The use of shared services in government has come and gone in waves usually dictated by fiscal necessity Most countries in Europe as part of their e government strategies have placed increased focus of late on developing shared services whether through an executive agency or a CIO as well as working with EU coordination activities And while the decentralized governments of some EU countries such as Germany make shared services more difficult these countries are using states and agencies to pilot innovative approaches 27Other efforts around the world include the U S e Government Act of 2002 which examined how technology could be used to cut costs and improve services More recently the New Zealand government appointed an advisory group in May 2011 to explore public sector reform to improve services and provide better value In their report Better Public Services the advisory group recommended the use of shared services to improve effectiveness in a variety of government settings including policy advice and real estate 29 Following up on this three New Zealand agencies the Department of the Prime Minister the State Services Commission and the Treasury announced in December 2011 that they would share such corporate functions as human resources and information technology 30 And though shared services in Western Australia were shut down other projects in South Australia are moving ahead and already showing savings 31In August 2011 the government of Canada announced the launch of Shared Services Canada a program that seeks to streamline and identify savings in information technology Among its first targets is something as mundane as email But with more than 100 different email systems being used by government employees the potential savings and boost to efficiency could be significant Not only do these incompatible systems cost money by requiring individual departments to negotiate and maintain separate licenses and technical support it also makes it difficult for government employees to communicate with one another and with the public And with no single standard ensuring the security of information transmitted over email becomes more challenging Shared Services Canada will move the government to one email system as well as consolidate data centers and networks ultimately looking for anticipated savings of between CA 100 million and CA 200 million annually 28While the idea of using shared services is not a novel one it is central to the GovCloud model The GovCloud model envisions building upon effective practices and those shared services already in operation to deliver services like human resources information technology finance and acquisitions government wide Workers in these shared services would include subject matter experts in areas like human resources and information technology as well as generalists who support routine business functions The potential for shared services continues to grow As seen with IBM s Watson and Microtask s Digitalkoot new technologies provide an opportunity to accelerate the automated delivery of basic services Some agencies already have begun capitalizing on these trends For example NASA has moved its shared service center website to a secure government cloud facilitating greater employee self service and helping to reduce demand on finite call center resources 32This decision tool is designed to help leaders determine which employees are appropriate for each of the three structures in the GovCloud model the cloud thin agencies and shared services To the cloud GovCloud Project LifecycleManaging employees in the cloud will require governments to reinvent human resource management Individual and team performance evaluations career development pay structures and benefits and pensions would need to change to support GovCloud This section examines possibilities for HR reinvention including performance management career development workplace flexibility and benefits Employees working in the cloud would require an alternative to determine pay and career advancement The government could take its cues from the gaming world and evaluate cloud workers with a point system The manager as we know it will disappear to be replaced by a new sort of business operative whose expertise is assembling the right people for particular projects Daniel Pink author of Free Agent Nation 33An HR management system that incorporates the accumulation of experience points XP through effective work on cloud projects training education and professional certifications could replace the tenure centric models for cloud employees As employees accumulate XP they could level up and take on additional responsibilities in future projects Workers in the cloud could earn XP in four ways After some high profile incidents slow responses to outbreaks of foot and mouth disease flooding that may have been preventable and a farming subsidy system that seemed to result in more chaos than aid the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs DEFRA was looking to reinvent itself In 2006 the department launched DEFRA Renew One of its key goals was to bring the department s policymaking closer to actual delivery to create more responsive processes Organized mainly by policy with fixed teams DEFRA had been unable to redeploy resources as needed in response to a crisis As part of DEFRA Renew a new operating model was implemented that used flexible resourcing where staff were assigned to specific projects for fixed periods This allowed management to measure and build the required capabilities and competencies needed and to allocate resources efficiently to improve overall service quality New roles were also created to support sustainable staff development and resource management in the new model To create buy in for such a fundamental culture shift within the department a facilitative approach to decision making was employed Change management programs and mentoring were extended to all levels of the department including leadership New mechanisms such as approval panels for resources and the use of business cases also worked to push changes among staff and promote collaborative behavior DEFRA Renew was widely recognized as a key enabler in the department meeting required efficiency improvement targets set by the UK government DEFRA moved to a more project based approach with fewer staff in core teams According to Dame Helen Ghosh former Permanent Secretary of DEFRA they could be more responsive now that the management board won t be made up of director generals with individual policy silos 34Just as XP could be gained through learning new skills it could be lost in the following three ways Any serious discussion about creating a new class of government employees requires a fresh look at employee benefits and compensation For example XP could be used to help determine workers salaries but additional research into alternative pension and benefit programs is needed While any discussion on compensation could be contentious a healthy debate among stakeholders from across the government should be welcomed As new roles emerge in the cloud so too could new career paths Career emphasis could move away from time served in a particular pay grade and toward milestones that are meaningful for employee development Each worker may have different career aspirations For instance not all workers aspire to management some may seek to master a particular subject area instead Career advancement in the cloud would not equate to moving up a ladder but rather moving along a lattice Lattice GovCloud ModelHere s how the lattice could work for Ian who we met in the introduction Think of the lattice as a jungle gym The best opportunities to broaden your experience may be lateral or even down Look every which way and swing to opportunities Pattie Sellers Fortune editor at largeCathleen Benko and Molly Anderson the authors of The Corporate Lattice argue that the corporate ladder is giving way to a lattice that accommodates flatter more networked organizations improves the integration of career and life focuses on competencies rather than tenure and helps increase workforce loyalty 35 The lattice metaphor allows employees to choose many ways to get ahead It is unlikely that all workers will thrive in the new GovCloud environment right out of the gate As such it would be important to assess a worker s readiness before placing her in GovCloud and providing training on core competencies critical to cloud success There could also be opportunities to start workers especially those at earlier stages of a career within an agency or shared service to build up expertise in some area before graduating to the cloud Once in the cloud new workers could be paired with mentors who are more experienced to help navigate the cloud experience itself There should be an emphasis on continuous learning in the cloud It would be important for cloud workers to continue to refine their skills develop additional expertise and adapt to new ways of working Not only could continuous learning affect workers career mobility by increasing the depth and breadth of their skills but it could also impact their salary and level by increasing their XP Learning and development in the cloud could take on many themes of next learning Next learning focuses on creating personalized learning experiences that leverage the latest technologies and collaborative communities to deliver education and learning programs that build knowledge bases and promote learning as a focus and passion not just a checkbox in a career 36To broaden cloud worker skills and the ability to handle multiple tasks and work on a variety of projects cloud learning could include the following principles 37In the cloud careers and expertise will be built in new ways and work will be something we do rather than a place we go to As such the cloud will give workers more control over their schedules and workloads By creating a flexible workplace governments could shed a significant amount of physical infrastructure and create shared workspaces Many buildings could be converted into co located spaces teams could use collaboration spaces or videoconferencing centers Some workers might rarely set foot in a government building instead conducting cloud tasks at home and interacting with project teams virtually With advancing communications and mobile technology distance no longer hinders collaboration It no longer matters whether all workers are at an office between 9 a m and 5 p m what matters is whether project teams produce results and whether everyone contributes A more flexible workplace could also take advantage of resources governments might not otherwise have access to Some retiring workers may not want to quit working altogether and a flexible model could be an enticing way to keep their expertise on retainer Alternatively the model could take advantage of would be government employees unwilling to relocate or unable to work a regular schedule By increasing flexibility governments could increase their available resource pool allowing agencies to access the skills and knowledge they need when they need it For an example of how a retiree could interact with the cloud see Appendix C National Security Case Study Don t think governments will ever take to the cloud At the U S Department of State the idea could soon be a reality The Office of eDiplomacy is preparing to pilot a cloud component to its e internship model for American students as part of the Virtual Student Foreign Service VSFS beginning this year The VSFS currently offers e internships to U S university students of multiple month duration By using a new micro volunteering platform State Department offices and embassies around the world will be able to create non classified tasks that take anywhere from a couple of minutes to a couple of days to complete Each task will be tagged by region and or issue and will automatically populate the profiles of students who have indicated those interests Students can then select the tasks that interest them the most or that fit into their schedule To see that the most pressing work is performed first offices and embassies will be able to prioritize their tasks so critical items appear at the top of the queue Imagine a small embassy preparing for a high profile multilateral meeting The preparations for such an event could be daunting for a small staff The power of the cloud could augment an individual embassy s capacity to prepare for a major event and ensure that related items are performed ahead of those that are less critical While there are plenty of incentives for participating in the VSFS micro volunteering platform from an impressive line on a student s resume to the chance to make a difference by working on topics of interest thought is being put into how to creatively incent high performance One idea is to simply invoke students competitive spirit Competition could be encouraged by a monthly leader board which results in bragging rights and potentially even a low cost but high impact reward Transparency is also key to competition with ratings available to State Department staff and other cloud interns and the ability to make short thank you notes from embassies publicly available interns would be keen to make a good impression The potential applications of this type of program are significant Imagine if offices throughout the State Department could tap into the language and cultural expertise of the thousands of foreign national staff members around the globe Providing a platform for those employees to contribute even a small amount of time to discreet tasks that require their expertise could unlock a world of knowledge 38Creating the GovCloud model will require bold leadership and the ideas and initiatives of entrepreneurial executives While a GovCloud model may be years in the making agencies can begin adopting cloud concepts today The GovCloud concept is designed to be versatile as well as applicable to a wide range of entities Depending on your organization government executives wishing to employ GovCloud may choose to apply the concept first to a unit before expanding to other branches or divisions entire agencies or the whole of government Often GovCloud principles are most effectively implemented as part of a larger reform program within a particular agency as with the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs Renew program as described earlier in this report On a smaller scale the UK Cabinet Office used flexible resourcing FR in its Economic Reform Group ERG with a staff of about 400 as part of its cost reduction plans Using a simple database that it had developed and a strong program of communications FR is now used and embraced by all core ERG employees with strong clear ownership from the top another key implementation factor Says Ian Watmore the UK Cabinet Office s former permanent secretary FR means we are able to deploy people much more quickly to priority projects 40Figure 3 outlines how GovCloud can apply to a variety of organizations Most government workforces haven t undergone a broad restructuring in decades In that time the world has been transformed by computers the Internet and mobile communications To respond to a variety of challenges governments have created scores of new organizations However in today s world of budget cuts and increased fiscal scrutiny the constant creation of new permanent structures is not sustainable The GovCloud model could offer a new way to use government resources A cloud of government wide workers could coalesce into project based teams to solve problems and separate when their work is done This could allow governments to concentrate resources when and where they are needed By using this model in conjunction with thinner agencies and shared services governments can reduce back office redundancies and let agencies focus on their core missions This model capitalizes on the work preferences of Millennials the future government workforce who value career growth over job security or compensation 41 The GovCloud model allows employees to gain a variety of experiences in a shorter amount of time and to self select their career direction To support GovCloud governments could establish the processes by which cloud teams would form work and dissolve New ways to evaluate performance and help workers gain skills and build careers should be considered Today s employee classification system stresses job descriptions and time in service this could be transformed with an XP model that emphasizes the individual s ownership of his or her career The GovCloud model will undoubtedly be controversial Many stakeholders from governing bodies to public employee unions must weigh in to shape the future government workforce The transition to a cloud model will not happen overnight or maybe even in the next five years but the conversation starts today Charlie Tierney is a Manager in

plans to spend 5 billion on modernising the Great Western main line its South Wales branch and other associated lines The modernisation plans were announced at separate times but their development time scales during the second decade of the 21st century overlap each other The work includes electrification resignalling new rolling stock and station upgrades According to Network Rail the modernisation started in June 2010 and was due to end in 2017 1 As of January 2019 update electrification was complete as far west as Bristol Parkway and also from Reading to Newbury The project has been subject to repeated delays 2 In November 2016 the government announced that several major elements of the electrification programme would be indefinitely deferred because costs had tripled The five sections that are delayed are 2 3 Under the Intercity Express Programme IEP 21 electric Class 800 trains were ordered as replacements for the ageing InterCity 125 diesels In May 2016 owing to delays in the modernisation project it was confirmed that the new trains would be converted to bi mode meaning they can run on diesel fuel and electric overhead wire 7 At the start of the 21st century the Great Western main line and the Midland Main Line were the last of the major main line routes in the UK using diesel as the main source of locomotive power 8 When the announcement was made in July 2009 to electrify the Great Western along with the Liverpool Manchester line it represented the first big rail electrification project in the UK for 20 years 9 The South Wales Main Line section of the GWML is set to be the first electrified cross country railway line in Wales The plan to upgrade the rolling stock on the Great Western was included in the IEP announced in 2007 a Department for Transport DfT led initiative to replace the ageing fleet of InterCity 125 and InterCity 225 train sets then in use on much of the UK rail network Passenger timetables introduced electric running from Paddington to Didcot in January 2018 10 and to Swindon and as far west as Bristol Parkway in January 2019 The same month saw electric services between Reading and Newbury 11 12 Work continues between Swindon and Chippenham and through the Severn Tunnel towards Cardiff and Newport with services there expected to begin in January 2020 13 Prior to 2009 the only electrified portion of the Great Western was between London Paddington and Airport Junction west of Hayes and Harlington This portion is equipped with a 25 kV AC overhead system which was implemented in 1997 in readiness for the Heathrow Express service commencing in early 1998 Electrification was extended from Airport Junction to Maidenhead under the Crossrail scheme 14 Further electrification west of Maidenhead was announced by the DfT separately though the work west of Airport Junction to take Crossrail to Maidenhead and west of Maidenhead is likely to be undertaken as one scheme 15 The UK government first considered electrifying the Great Western between London Paddington and Bristol Temple Meads in a first phase then electrifying the rest of the line between Swindon to Swansea at a later date However in July 2009 the Department of Transport under the then Labour Government in the run up to the 2010 general election announced that there would be a 1bn programme to electrify the whole of the Great Western from London to Swansea as well as to Bristol Temple Meads 16 The Labour government claimed that the investment would pay for itself over a 40 year period 17 18 The scheme announced by the government on 23 July 2009 stated that work will begin immediately on the electrification of the Great Western main line between London Reading Oxford Newbury Bristol Cardiff and Swansea to be completed within eight years 2016 2017 14 The proposed electrified route included 14 Estimates showed that the Hitachi Super Express trains could reduce journey times from London Paddington to Swansea by 19 minutes 14 In an effort to minimise disruption during the electrification works Network Rail developed new factory engineering trains to facilitate the process of installing overhead lines There are three types of train the first train will be used to install pylons followed by a train to hang the wires and finally a train which will check the installation The system was expected to be able to install 1 5 kilometres 0 93 mi of electrification in an eight hour shift 19 The vehicles were supplied by German firm Windhoff 20 In its initial survey Network Rail identified 113 structures mainly bridges and tunnels which required modernisation 19 In subsequent surveys this increased to 137 21 The largest structure the Severn Tunnel has good clearances and is relatively easy to electrify 21 After the 2010 UK general election in May 2010 the coalition Conservative Liberal Democrat alliance placed all major government capital expenditure including the Great Western electrification scheme on hold pending a return on investment review 22 In November 2010 Transport Secretary Philip Hammond gave the go ahead for the lines from Oxford via Didcot to London and Newbury to London to be electrified in the next six years Extension from Didcot to Swindon Bath Bristol and to South Wales would be dependent on a further assessment due in 2011 of the costs and implementation requirements of the IEP 23 On 1 March 2011 Hammond announced that rail electrification from Didcot Parkway to Bristol Temple Meads and Cardiff Central would go ahead The section linking Bristol Parkway and Bristol Temple Meads would also be electrified 24 In March 2012 Amey plc was awarded a 700 million contract to undertake the electrification works 25 In July 2012 the UK Government announced that the final portion of the Great Western from Cardiff to Swansea would be electrified 26 In addition as part of the Electric Spine project the line between Reading and Basingstoke would also be electrified at 25 kV AC OHL The overhead electrification of the branches to Henley Marlow and Windsor were also added to the scope of the project 27 However the Marlow electrification has been postponed for the foreseeable future due to difficulties at Bourne End The new NR Series 1 overhead line equipment designed and manufactured by Furrer Frey is a TSI compliant OLE design specified to allow multiple pantograph operation at 140 mph operation and is being installed using Amey plc s High Output Plant System HOPS and other conventional techniques This is designed to allow Adjacent Line Operation ALO where works can be carried out while trains operate on adjacent tracks The HOPS has five sections each of which handles a different aspect of the installation these can be coupled together to work as one unit or separated to work independently The train will be maintained at the High Output Operations Base HOOB in Swindon on the site of former sidings HOPS will mix and lay 30 m3 1 100 cu ft of concrete per night and all equipment and personnel will arrive at the site on board 28 The HOPS train was operational by 2014 but had not reached full productivity due to teething problems 29 By 2015 completion of the electrification project had been delayed reportedly 1 year behind schedule with completion expected in 2017 Costs of the electrification were reported to have tripled from an estimated 640M to 1 74bn 30 In June 2015 the International Railway Journal reported Britain s secretary of state for transport Mr Patrick McLoughlin has asked Sir Peter Hendy to review Network Rail s 2014 2019 capital investment programme known as CP5 and report back in the autumn 31 The report stated that costs had tripled from the 874M original estimate to 2 8bn and was 1 2bn higher than the estimate made a year ago 32 The main part of the programme will go ahead as planned and should be delivered by March 2019 but the Cardiff to Swansea section will be delayed to some time between 2019 and 2024 33 Revised dates for the completion of electrification work were published in early 2016 with electrification to Cardiff via Bristol Parkway and the connection to Newbury planned by December 2018 the branch to Oxford from Didcot by June 2019 and the branch to Bristol Temple Meads from Wootton Bassett sometime between February 2019 and April 2020 34 In November 2016 the government announced that electrification work on the sections from Oxford to Didcot Parkway Bristol Parkway to Bristol Temple Meads Thingley Junction near Chippenham to Bath Spa and Bristol Temple Meads and branches lines to Henley and Windsor had been indefinitely deferred For Oxford and Bristol the deferral was due to imminent resignalling and remodelling of the existing track layout 2 In July 2017 it was announced that the Cardiff Swansea electrification project had been cancelled and that bi mode trains would be used on the route 35 The Great Western main line is currently equipped with colour light signalling common to the rest of the United Kingdom At the time of the Ladbroke Grove rail crash 1999 the ATP Automatic Train Protection warning system was under trial In response to that incident it became a requirement for all First Great Western trains to be fitted with ATP 36 When the Department for Transport first released the train specification for the new trains for the IEP in November 2007 it was stated that the Great Western main line would be upgraded to ETCS level 2 and ERTMS Level 2 in cab signalling 37 Some or all of the resignalling work will be carried out alongside the electrification work 14 Signalling Solutions is to resignal the 12 miles from Paddington to West Drayton including the Airport branch as part of the Crossrail project 38 In November 2008 Westinghouse subsequently known as Invensys Rail and now part of Siemens Rail Automation was awarded a 20M contract for a 30 month programme of signalling enabling work 39 Over a series of 12 commissionings Invensys Rail will re lock the existing Reading Station and Spur interlockings to three new WESTLOCK Interlocking units re control the remaining 18 relay interlockings and move signalling and telecommunications control from Reading Station to the new Thames Valley Signalling Centre at Didcot The work culminates in a final commissioning scheduled for 5 December 2010 and paves the way for future stages of the remodelling programme 40 The Thames valley signalling centre will eventually replace older signalling control in the entire English Western region The London area is due to switch over at the end of 2011 followed by the old Slough PSB Power Signal Box area Attention will then be given to abolishing Oxford Swindon A Bristol PSBs and the 1990s Swindon B IECC This will be followed by the elimination of the 1980s PSBs at Westbury and Exeter and the 1970s Plymouth PSB the 1960s PSB at Gloucester as well as substantial semaphore signalling in Cornwall 41 The signalling is due to be overlaid with ERTMS control system level 2 from 2016 42 The first phase of a 400M ten year resignalling scheme in South Wales by Network Rail was carried out on a 22 mile 35 km stretch between Port Talbot and Bridgend termed Port Talbot East in 2006 and 2007 The works provided a new turnback facility in both directions at Port Talbot Parkway if required 43 The renewals replaced an old British Railways Western Region NX panel installation dating from 1963 Railway technology has evolved somewhat since 1963 and the renewals will make some signalling facilities redundant 44 Further signalling renewals are programmed for the Newport area which will be implemented in two phases Cardiff and Port Talbot West 44 The first phase of the Newport Area remodelling and resignalling began in 2009 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2010 The first phase covers the stretch of line between Patchway and Marshfield to the west of Newport 45 A new South Wales Control Centre built on the eastern end of Canton Depot in Cardiff opened in Spring 2009 The signals implemented in Newport Area resignalling phase 1 will be the first to have control transferred to the South Wales Control Centre and once Phase 2 of the Newport Area resignalling is complete in 2011 the Newport signalbox will be closed Control will pass to the South Wales Control Centre for other parts of the south Wales network as resignalling progresses 45 Services from London Paddington to south west England and south Wales are currently served by Class 43 InterCity 125 train sets The Intercity 125 trains were built between 1975 and 1982 and due to their age are to be replaced by new Hitachi Super Express train sets The Intercity 125 trains are one of the fastest trains on the Great Western operating at 125 mph 201 km h the only faster services in the UK are on High Speed One from Eurostar and Southeastern with their Class 373s Class 374s and Class 395s London to Folkestone Channel Tunnel which operate at 186 mph 299 km h 186 mph 299 km h and 140 mph 225 km h respectively the Class 390 Pendolinos on the West Coast Main Line and the InterCity 225 trains on the East Coast Main Line which are both capable of 140 mph 225 km h restricted only by line speed The new Super Express trains will have a top speed of 125 mph 201 km h but will be capable of 140 mph 225 km h with minor modifications The upgrading of the signalling on the Great Western to in cab signalling is one pre requisite to allow the new trains to run at the higher speed In the 2010 GWML RUS Network Rail stated that linespeeds in excess of 125 mph 201 km h west of Reading would be reviewed in line with electrification and resignalling opportunities as ERTMS becomes deployed across the RUS area after Control Period 4 2014 2019 46 The initial new Hitachi Super Express trains planned for the Great Western inter city services will be Class 800 electro diesel bi mode trains capable of running on lines with and without overhead wires This is because of the deferment of the electrification project 4 Despite the initial limit of 125 mph the increased acceleration and operational efficiency are expected to decrease the journey time from London to Bristol Temple Meads by 22 minutes 47 The new Super Express trains will bring an estimated 15 increased capacity during the morning peak hours 14 The bi mode trains will allow inter city services to operate from London directly to locations in South Wales and southwest England to which electrification does not extend under the current electrification proposals like Carmarthen Worcester Gloucester Cheltenham and the regions to the southwest of Bristol and Newbury A portion of the fleet will be Class 802 trains a more powerful variant of the Class 800 which will cope better with the gradients in Devon and Cornwall 48 New servicing facilities for the new fleet of Inter City Express trains will be developed at the London North Pole Depot the Filton Triangle rail depot in Stoke Gifford and at Maliphant sidings in Swansea 49 Thames Valley commuter services from London Paddington to Reading and to Oxford are currently served by a combination of Class 165 Network Turbo and Class 166 Network Express Turbo three car DMUs which are capable of operating at 90 mph 145 km h 50 These trains will be replaced by the new 45 Class 387 four car 110 mph 177 km h trains currently used on Thameslink as an interim fleet The Class 365 Networker trains electric versions of the class 165 166s operated currently by Govia Thameslink Railway will not now cascade from Great Northern to the Thames Valley as originally planned The plans were dependent on sufficient Class 700 and Class 377s replacing 365s and 387s on the Thameslink Great Northern network The Network Turbo Network Express Turbo trains would then be transferred for use for services in the Bristol and South West area see Bristol Metro scheme below 14 51 Present rolling stock Class 165 1 diesel at ReadingPresent rolling stock Class 166 diesel at Didcot ParkwayFuture rolling stock Class 387 electric at Ealing BroadwayThe western section of Crossrail to be known as the Elizabeth Line when opened in summer 2019 will have 57 Class 345 trains which are formed of 9 carriages and can carry 1 500 passengers These electric multiple units can achieve speeds of up to 90 mph 140 km h on the surface sections of the route and up to 60 mph 97 km h in the tunnels 52 These trains are being built by Bombardier Transportation at their Derby Litchurch Lane Works Several stations along the Great Western are undergoing redevelopment or have recently been upgraded to cope with growing passenger numbers and to ease rail traffic congestion Bristol Temple Meads will be expanded into Digby Wyatt s 1870s extension to the original train shed 53 built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1840 as the terminus for the Great Western main line This part of the Old Station building is currently in use as a car park but will be remodelled as terminating platforms for services to London Paddington 54 55 To achieve rail access to the existing old platforms the Bristol power box opened in 1970 and controlling 114 route miles of track will need to be decommissioned and demolished 56 Bristol Parkway had a new third platform Platform 4 completed in 2007 to provide a new platform for trains departing to London and Birmingham and to make services more reliable between London and south Wales 57 A new fourth platform has been built on the south side of the station 58 On 10 September 2008 Network Rail unveiled a 400M regeneration and reconfiguration of Reading station and surrounding track incorporating an overpass to the west of the station with freight and passenger trains able to transit from the Reading to Taunton Line and Reading to Basingstoke Line to the slow lines via an underpass beneath the fast lines replacing the conventional at grade crossing of the fast lines via points with the aim of alleviating delays due to slow moving freight service passing through the station By 2014 the total cost had risen to more than 800M 59 60 As well as the reconfiguration of the track the terminal platforms for services to from London Waterloo will be altered and the Cow Lane bridge under the tracks has been made two way and now includes a cycle path There will be improvements that will provide capacity for at least four extra trains in each direction every hour 61 The station received These plans provide for the future Crossrail and possible Airtrack services at Reading station building a railway that will be fit for at least the next thirty years Also the improvements will allow six new freight trains each day this could take around 300 lorries a day off the roads While much of the work was carried out in 2010 trains to Devon and Cornwall ran from London Waterloo instead of Paddington using the South Western Main Line via Basingstoke then the West of England Main Line and Wessex Main Lines Trains to Bristol South Wales and Cheltenham were diverted via the Chiltern Main Line from London to Banbury where they reversed and returned via Oxford to Didcot Parkway South Oxfordshire to re adopt the Great Western main line As of February 2015 the regeneration and modernisation of Reading Station is complete The station now has 15 platforms each serving their own specialist destination and purpose The new platforms allow more frequent trains to run through Reading and allow more passengers to join longer trains The entire Reading Redevelopment project will be completed by 2017 An improvement programme for the forecourt of Didcot Parkway began in September 2012 and ran for two years 62 Features included In 2018 a new multi storey car park started to be built at Didcot Parkway over the west long stay carpark It should be completed in the autumn of 2018 providing 1800 spaces to reflect the station s role as a Park and ride facility for the surrounding area 63 In 2009 an upgrade to Newport station was started to enable the station to cope with the expected passenger traffic associated with the 2010 Ryder Cup A new passenger bridge and two new terminal buildings were constructed with each platform being served by a lift The new bridge is clad in ethylene tetrafluoroethylene ETFE the material which protects the Eden Project in Cornwall despite which the roof initially gave problems with leaking 64 The new development at the station includes a new multi story car park and a new bus station will be developed outside replacing the existing Newport bus station The new north and south concourses opened on 13 September 2010 65 The development was criticised by Rail Magazine columnist Barry Doe for being at the wrong end of the station having a leaking roof a lack of seating and generally poor design 66 Extra platform capacity at Cardiff Central will be introduced in the form of a new bay platform platform 5 67 for services between Cardiff and Maesteg along the GWML and one new through platform to the south of the station platform 8 for the Cardiff urban services to cater for up to 16 trains per hour 68 This will bring the number of platforms from 7 to 10 Redevelopment of Cardiff Central bus station outside the railway station commenced in 2008 Between 2009 and 2015 69 a new Crossrail station will be built under London Paddington serving as a connection to National Rail services and London Underground Services are due to start in 2018 70 Network Rail had planned to demolish the arched section to the north east of Paddington station known as Span 4 Span 4 was an extension completed in 1916 and the roof had since become dangerous An internal blanket was erected in the 1990s to protect people from falling glass Span 4 was to be replaced by an office block over the rails but it was later decided that the structure would be restored 71 The restoration of Span 4 took place between 2009 and 2010 and it re opened in late 2011 looking notably brighter than the other three spans of the station 72 Work on modernising Port Talbot Parkway station began in Autumn 2014 The old ticket office was demolished and a new footbridge built over the platforms The footbridge will features a new ticket office and step free access to the platforms provided by lifts 73 Severn Tunnel Junction serves as a Park and Ride station for commuters from southern Monmouthshire to Bristol Newport and Cardiff and there is a local action group the Severn Tunnel Action Group STAG who are campaigning to enhance the Junction s status as a transport hub for the southern Monmouthshire area 74 As of January 2010 Network Rail have remodelled the tracks around the station re opened Platform 4 and modernised the parking and passenger facilities The junction where the Gloucester to Newport Line joins the South Wales Main Line has been moved west of the station and now joins the main line with high speed turnouts 45 A 7 6M modernisation of Swansea station began in 2011 and was completed in June 2012 75 The renovation work included enlargement of the concourse cleaning of the front of the station with a new entrance replacement of the partition wall between concourse and platforms with a glazed wall a new caf and more shops 76 Crossrail is a major rail scheme to provide a new east west railway connection under Central London The western portion of the line will connect with the Great Western main line to the west of Paddington Current plans are for Crossrail services to terminate at Reading in the west With electrification of the Great Western being extended westwards past Reading the Department of Transport has stated that Crossrail will terminate at Reading from the outset 14 Some of the suburban services using the GWML into London Paddington will be transferred to Crossrail which will free up some capacity at the surface level station at London Paddington 14 The Western Rail Access Programme is a scheme under development by the DfT Network Rail and local authorities near Heathrow Airport to develop a direct rail link to the airport from the west At present passengers travelling from the west of Airport Junction need to change trains at either Hayes and Harlington or Paddington which are to the east of the junction 77 78 The proposed link will consist of a 5 km 3 mi tunnel connecting a new junction between Langley and Iver stations to Terminal 5 79 The new link will enable direct rail services between Reading and the airport With the confirmed electrification of the Great Western main line west of Airport Junction local authorities in the Thames Valley identified a case to be made for introducing a service to Heathrow Airport from Reading via the Great Western which would also serve Maidenhead and Slough 14 On 12 July 2012 Transport Secretary Justine Greening announced that a new rail link connecting Slough and Heathrow had been given the go ahead and would be operational by 2021 80 The Greater Bristol Metro is a project to improve the rail services in Greater Bristol It was first proposed at First Great Western s Stakeholder Event in March 2008 On 5 July 2012 the UK government and councils in and around Bristol agreed a City Deal whereby Bristol would have more funding for investment in the area As a result of the City Deal around 100M is expected to be invested in rail services under the Greater Bristol Metro scheme 81 As part of the work the Cross Country Route between Bristol Parkway and Bristol Temple Meads commonly known as Filton Bank will be expanded from two to four tracks 82 The South Wales Metro is a proposed integration of heavy rail South Wales Main Line and Valley Lines and development of light rail and bus based public transport services and systems in South East Wales around the hub of Cardiff Central The first phase was approved for development in October 2013 83 The Golden Valley Line serves as a diversionary line for several other lines in the area as well as serving its normal traffic It will be a major diversionary route during the electrification of the Great Western main line The line between Swindon and Kemble was reduced to a single track in 1968 limiting its capacity In his March 2011 Budget the Chancellor George Osborne approved a project to re double this section of line after several years of campaigning by local politicians 84 The scheme was completed in August 2014 85 During his announcement on Great Western electrification in March 2011 transport secretary Phillip Hammond stated that a good business case existed for the electrication of several south Wales commuter lines 86 In July 2012 the UK Government announced that the south Wales commuter lines would be electrified The lines which would be electrified are all Valleys Cardiff Local Routes the Ebbw Valley Railway and the Maesteg Line 87 Some press reports state that passengers face six years of disruption from the electrification work Over 100 bridges and tunnels require demolition or modification to accommodate the new overhead lines 88 The Goring Gap Railway Action Group formed in March 2015 has complained that there has been insufficient consultation between Network Rail and residents of Goring on Thames about the visual impact of the overhead line supports 89 The announcement of electrification of the Great Western led to the Government changing their plans to purchase a new fleet of diesel trains consisting of 202 locomotives and 1 300 train carriages 90 The RMT union called for assurances that the plans will not have an adverse impact on jobs at the UK s only train maker Bombardier 17 In February 2010 it was announced that the IEP for long distance express services was suspended pending an independent report with a decision on its viability to be given after the 2010 UK general election 91 92 93 94 In 2012 the contract to provide Intercity Express bi mode trains was awarded to Hitachi Although the enabling work on the trackbed platforms and bridges is now complete the installation of the electrification equipment has been delayed on the sections between Chippenham Bath Spa and Bristol Temple Meads and between Bristol Temple Meads and Bristol Parkway ", "skills": "WRITTEN BY Charlie Tierney Steve Cottle Katie JorgensenWind back the clock to 1971 Jane a freshly minted college graduate joins the government as a clerk Jane s work consists largely of entering information into databases and creating reports which requires her to spend the better part of her work day seated at a terminal near a mainframe computer that fills an entire room Jane and her colleagues are expected to be at their desks from 9 a m to 5 p m five days a week Jane is grateful to have a steady 9 to 5 job and plans to spend her entire career with her agency Flash forward 40 years and meet Jane s grandson Ian He carries a slim tablet wherever he goes which has more computing power than the mainframe with which Jane worked Ian is constantly tethered to the Internet and works 24 7 from wherever he is Ian expects to switch from project to project and office to office as his career develops and his interests evolve If he feels he has reached the limit of his ability to learn or grow in one role he will look elsewhere for a new opportunity What if the government could give Ian the opportunities and experiences he seeks The GovCloud concept proposed in this paper would restructure government workforces in a way that takes advantage of the talents and preferences of workers like Ian who are entering the workforce today The model is based on a large body of research from interviews with public and private sector experts to best practices from innovative organizations both public and private This is the first generation of people that work play think and learn differently than their parents They are the first generation to not be afraid of technology It s like the air to them Don Tapscott author of Grown Up DigitalThis report details trends in work and technology that offer significant opportunities for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the government workforce It lays out the GovCloud model explaining how governments could be organized to take advantage of its flexibility It examines how work would be performed in the new model and discusses potential changes to government HR programs to support GovCloud Other sections provide resources for executives including a tool to help determine cloud eligibility steps they can take to pilot the cloud concept and future scenarios illustrating the cloud in action The GovCloud model represents a dramatic departure from the status quo It is bound to be greeted with some skepticism Without such innovation however governments will be left to confront the challenges of tomorrow with the workforce structure of yesterday The details of the GovCloud model are open for debate The purpose of this paper is to jumpstart that debate Forty years ago more than half of employed American adults worked in either blue collar or clerical jobs Today less than 40 percent work in these same categories and the share continues to shrink 1 Jobs requiring routine or manual tasks are disappearing while those requiring complex communication skills and expert thinking are becoming the norm 2 Increasingly employers seek workers capable of creative and knowledge based work We should ask ourselves whether we re truly satisfied with the status quo Are our workday lives so fulfilling and our organizations so boundlessly capable that it s now pointless to long for something better Gary Hamel author of The Future of ManagementThe next generation of creative knowledge workers has already entered the job market These Millennials came of age in a rapidly and radically changing world They are the first true digital natives They have grown up with instant access to information through technology As such Millennials have considerably different expectations for the kind of work they do and the information they use The pursuit for variety in work has led Millennials to cite simply needing a change as their top reason for switching jobs 3Advances in technology have also changed the actual ways in which people perform work The ability to crowdsource tasks is one example of this change Since its founding in 2001 volunteers have produced and contributed to over 19 million articles in 281 languages on Wikipedia 4 Built around this concept a burgeoning industry is developing around microtasking dividing work up into small tasks that can be farmed out to workers Amazon s Mechanical Turk rolled out in 2005 allows users to post tasks to a platform where registered workers can accept and complete them for a small fee When this paper was written more than 195 000 tasks were available on Mechanical Turk 5Such technologies may offer suitable possibilities for the public sector Microtask a Finnish cloud labor company maintains Digitalkoot a program that helps the Finnish National Library convert its image archives into digital text and correct existing errors It does so with volunteered labor participants simply play a game in which they are shown the image of a word and then must type it out to help a cartoon character cross a bridge In doing so they are turning scanned images into searchable text greatly improving the search accuracy of old manuscripts 6 At present more than 100 000 people have completed over 6 million microtasks associated with this project 7As the pace of computing power and machine learning increases professors Frank Levy and Richard Murnane contend that more tasks will move from human to computer processing 8 Skeptics need look no further than IBM s Watson a computer that can answer questions posed in natural language In February 2011 Watson defeated two all time champions of the quiz show Jeopardy This was not solely a publicity stunt IBM hopes to sell Watson to hospitals and call centers to help them answer questions from the public 9Around the globe more and more governments are looking to increase telework among employees In 2010 the U S government passed legislation calling for more telework opportunities for government employees Likewise the Australian government in order to attract and retain information and communications technology workers instituted a teleworking policy in 2009 requiring agencies to implement flexible work plans 10 Other countries including Norway and Germany are also focusing on flexible work arrangements to improve public sector recruiting 11 In Canada the government has an official telework policy that recognizes changes are occurring in the public service workforce with a shift towards more knowledge workers and encourages departments to implement telework arrangements 12Cloud definitionsCloud computing Internet based computing whereby shared resources software and information are provided to computers and other devices on demand like electricity AmazonCrowdsourcing Neologistic compound of crowd and outsourcing for the act of taking tasks traditionally performed by an employee or contractor and outsourcing them to a group of people or community through an open call to a large group of people a crowd asking for contributions WikipediaGovCloud A new model for government based on team collaboration whereby workforce resources can be surged to provide services to government agencies on demand GovLabSource Frank Levy and Richard J Murnane The New Division of Labor How Computers are Creating the Next Job Market Princeton Princeton University Press 2004 p 50 Figure 1 Trends in routine and non routine tasks in the U S 1960 200213These are all powerful steps in the right direction for employees whose natural work rhythms are not locked into 9 to 5 Some companies have taken telework one step further British Telecom is pushing the concept of agile working through its Workstyle Project where employees decide what work arrangements best suit them rather than a rigid definition by location and hours BT Workstyle is one of the largest flexible working projects in Europe with over 11 000 home based workers BT has found that its home enabled employees are on average 20 percent more productive than their office based colleagues 14Similarly U S electronics retailer Best Buy experimented with a Results Only Work Environment ROWE In a ROWE what matters is not whether employees are in their office but rather that they complete their work and achieve measurable outcomes In a ROWE salaried employees must put in as much time as is actually needed to do their work no more no less The decline in routine and manual tasks and the rise of new ways of working is not isolated to the private sector In 1950 the U S federal workforce largely comprised clerks performing repetitive tasks About 62 percent performed these tasks while only 11 percent performed more white collar work By 2000 those relationships were reversed Fifteen percent performed repetitive tasks compared to 56 percent in the white collar categories 16 Similarly in 1944 the number of workers in the UK civil service considered industrial totaled 505 000 By 2003 this number fell to 18 200 with non industrial workers reaching 538 000 in 2004 17 And in Canada in 2006 knowledge based workers represented 58 percent of federal workers in the Core Public Administration up from 41 percent 11 years earlier 18The swelling ranks of non industrial government workers indicate a shift in public sector jobs toward creative collaborative and complex work The workforce structure however designed for clerks of the last century remains largely the same With limited flexibility to distribute resources governments often address change by creating new agencies and programs This can be seen following major events like the outbreaks of the Avian flu and SARs in the past decade 9 11 and the financial crisis of 2008 Source United States Office of Personnel Management A Fresh Start for Federal Pay A Case for Modernization April 2002 p 5 http www opm gov strategiccomp whtpaper pdfFigure 2 The changing U S federal workforce 1950 200015Given increasing budgetary pressures and burgeoning national debts the conventional model of creating new agencies or permanent structures in response to new challenges is unsustainable This is exacerbated by our inability to accurately predict future needs and trends Consider a 1968 Business Week article proclaiming that the Japanese auto industry isn t likely to carve out a big share of the market for itself or the president of Digital Equipment Corporation who in 1977 said t here is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home 19The world is full of experts who attempt to predict the future and fail 20Instead of endeavoring to predict the future governments can choose to create a flexible workforce that can quickly adapt to future work requirements To accomplish this the government can learn from a game changing concept in the technology world cloud computing Major organizations and small startups alike increase their flexibility by sharing storage space information and resources in a cloud allowing them to quickly scale resources up and down as needed Why not apply the cloud model to people The creation of a government wide human cloud could provide significant benefits including A cloud based government workforce or GovCloud could include workers who perform a range of creative problem focused work Rather than being slotted into any single government agency cloud workers would be true government wide employees This section outlines the organizational structure of the GovCloud model which rests on three main pillars a cloud of government workers thin executive agencies and shared services Most government workforce models tend to constrain workers by isolating them in separate agencies Consider the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom and the subsequent slaughter of more than 6 million pigs sheep and cattle The problem of an impacted food supply is complicated In most countries multiple agencies focus on agriculture food production and public health In the United Kingdom the army and even tourism ministries were impacted by the outbreak as agencies became overwhelmed by the number of animals in need of disposal and by the cordoning off of tourist areas to prevent the spread of the disease Yet the structure of government agencies often confines employees to work in information silos creating inherent operational inefficiencies In a cloud workforce model experts in each area could be pulled together to support remedies and propose coordinated corrective measures I want someone saying Did you know that the Ministry of Justice is doing that or could you piggy back on what the communities department is doing or had you thought about doing it in this way You ve got to get away from thinking about centralized command and control Dame Helen Ghosh Permanent Secretary UK Home Office 21The FedCloud modelThe GovCloud model could become a new pillar of government comprising permanent employees who undertake a wide variety of creative problem focused work As needed the GovCloud model could also take advantage of those outside government including citizens looking for extra part time work full time contractors and individual consultants Cloud workers would vary in background and expertise but would exhibit traits of free agent workers self sufficient self motivated employees who exhibit a strong loyalty to teams colleagues and clients Daniel Pink author of Drive The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us argues that 33 million Americans one quarter of the workforce already operate as free agents 22According to the white paper Lessons of the Great Recession from Swiss staffing company Adecco contingent workers those who chose non traditional employment arrangements23 are expected to eventually make up about 25 percent of the global workforce 24These more autonomous workers according to Pink are better suited to 21st century work and are more productive even without traditional monetary incentives 25The fluid nature of the cloud can provide significant benefits The nature of the cloud teams forming and dissolving as their tasks require encourages workers to focus on specific project outcomes rather than ongoing operations Thin agency structures could lead to Greater use of shared services could allow the federal government to The need to support some ongoing missions will remain of course These missions will be carried out by thin agencies Under the cloud concept federal agencies would remain focused on specific missions and ongoing oversight These agencies however would become thinner as many of their knowledge workers transfer into the cloud Thin agencies could also create opportunities to streamline organizations with overlapping missions Employees working in thin agencies could fall into two main categories GovCloud could change the highest levels of public sector workers as we know them today The Senior Executive Service in the United States Permanent Secretaries and Directors General in the United Kingdom and Australia all such senior officials could rotate between agencies shared services and the cloud which would reflect the original intent behind many of these high level offices giving executives a breadth of experience in roles across government to help develop shared values and a broad perspective An important benefit of rotation would be the ability to tap into cloud networks to assemble high performing teams To further focus agencies on specific missions many of their back office support functions could be pulled into government wide shared service arrangements The use of shared services in government has come and gone in waves usually dictated by fiscal necessity Most countries in Europe as part of their e government strategies have placed increased focus of late on developing shared services whether through an executive agency or a CIO as well as working with EU coordination activities And while the decentralized governments of some EU countries such as Germany make shared services more difficult these countries are using states and agencies to pilot innovative approaches 27Other efforts around the world include the U S e Government Act of 2002 which examined how technology could be used to cut costs and improve services More recently the New Zealand government appointed an advisory group in May 2011 to explore public sector reform to improve services and provide better value In their report Better Public Services the advisory group recommended the use of shared services to improve effectiveness in a variety of government settings including policy advice and real estate 29 Following up on this three New Zealand agencies the Department of the Prime Minister the State Services Commission and the Treasury announced in December 2011 that they would share such corporate functions as human resources and information technology 30 And though shared services in Western Australia were shut down other projects in South Australia are moving ahead and already showing savings 31In August 2011 the government of Canada announced the launch of Shared Services Canada a program that seeks to streamline and identify savings in information technology Among its first targets is something as mundane as email But with more than 100 different email systems being used by government employees the potential savings and boost to efficiency could be significant Not only do these incompatible systems cost money by requiring individual departments to negotiate and maintain separate licenses and technical support it also makes it difficult for government employees to communicate with one another and with the public And with no single standard ensuring the security of information transmitted over email becomes more challenging Shared Services Canada will move the government to one email system as well as consolidate data centers and networks ultimately looking for anticipated savings of between CA 100 million and CA 200 million annually 28While the idea of using shared services is not a novel one it is central to the GovCloud model The GovCloud model envisions building upon effective practices and those shared services already in operation to deliver services like human resources information technology finance and acquisitions government wide Workers in these shared services would include subject matter experts in areas like human resources and information technology as well as generalists who support routine business functions The potential for shared services continues to grow As seen with IBM s Watson and Microtask s Digitalkoot new technologies provide an opportunity to accelerate the automated delivery of basic services Some agencies already have begun capitalizing on these trends For example NASA has moved its shared service center website to a secure government cloud facilitating greater employee self service and helping to reduce demand on finite call center resources 32This decision tool is designed to help leaders determine which employees are appropriate for each of the three structures in the GovCloud model the cloud thin agencies and shared services To the cloud GovCloud Project LifecycleManaging employees in the cloud will require governments to reinvent human resource management Individual and team performance evaluations career development pay structures and benefits and pensions would need to change to support GovCloud This section examines possibilities for HR reinvention including performance management career development workplace flexibility and benefits Employees working in the cloud would require an alternative to determine pay and career advancement The government could take its cues from the gaming world and evaluate cloud workers with a point system The manager as we know it will disappear to be replaced by a new sort of business operative whose expertise is assembling the right people for particular projects Daniel Pink author of Free Agent Nation 33An HR management system that incorporates the accumulation of experience points XP through effective work on cloud projects training education and professional certifications could replace the tenure centric models for cloud employees As employees accumulate XP they could level up and take on additional responsibilities in future projects Workers in the cloud could earn XP in four ways After some high profile incidents slow responses to outbreaks of foot and mouth disease flooding that may have been preventable and a farming subsidy system that seemed to result in more chaos than aid the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs DEFRA was looking to reinvent itself In 2006 the department launched DEFRA Renew One of its key goals was to bring the department s policymaking closer to actual delivery to create more responsive processes Organized mainly by policy with fixed teams DEFRA had been unable to redeploy resources as needed in response to a crisis As part of DEFRA Renew a new operating model was implemented that used flexible resourcing where staff were assigned to specific projects for fixed periods This allowed management to measure and build the required capabilities and competencies needed and to allocate resources efficiently to improve overall service quality New roles were also created to support sustainable staff development and resource management in the new model To create buy in for such a fundamental culture shift within the department a facilitative approach to decision making was employed Change management programs and mentoring were extended to all levels of the department including leadership New mechanisms such as approval panels for resources and the use of business cases also worked to push changes among staff and promote collaborative behavior DEFRA Renew was widely recognized as a key enabler in the department meeting required efficiency improvement targets set by the UK government DEFRA moved to a more project based approach with fewer staff in core teams According to Dame Helen Ghosh former Permanent Secretary of DEFRA they could be more responsive now that the management board won t be made up of director generals with individual policy silos 34Just as XP could be gained through learning new skills it could be lost in the following three ways Any serious discussion about creating a new class of government employees requires a fresh look at employee benefits and compensation For example XP could be used to help determine workers salaries but additional research into alternative pension and benefit programs is needed While any discussion on compensation could be contentious a healthy debate among stakeholders from across the government should be welcomed As new roles emerge in the cloud so too could new career paths Career emphasis could move away from time served in a particular pay grade and toward milestones that are meaningful for employee development Each worker may have different career aspirations For instance not all workers aspire to management some may seek to master a particular subject area instead Career advancement in the cloud would not equate to moving up a ladder but rather moving along a lattice Lattice GovCloud ModelHere s how the lattice could work for Ian who we met in the introduction Think of the lattice as a jungle gym The best opportunities to broaden your experience may be lateral or even down Look every which way and swing to opportunities Pattie Sellers Fortune editor at largeCathleen Benko and Molly Anderson the authors of The Corporate Lattice argue that the corporate ladder is giving way to a lattice that accommodates flatter more networked organizations improves the integration of career and life focuses on competencies rather than tenure and helps increase workforce loyalty 35 The lattice metaphor allows employees to choose many ways to get ahead It is unlikely that all workers will thrive in the new GovCloud environment right out of the gate As such it would be important to assess a worker s readiness before placing her in GovCloud and providing training on core competencies critical to cloud success There could also be opportunities to start workers especially those at earlier stages of a career within an agency or shared service to build up expertise in some area before graduating to the cloud Once in the cloud new workers could be paired with mentors who are more experienced to help navigate the cloud experience itself There should be an emphasis on continuous learning in the cloud It would be important for cloud workers to continue to refine their skills develop additional expertise and adapt to new ways of working Not only could continuous learning affect workers career mobility by increasing the depth and breadth of their skills but it could also impact their salary and level by increasing their XP Learning and development in the cloud could take on many themes of next learning Next learning focuses on creating personalized learning experiences that leverage the latest technologies and collaborative communities to deliver education and learning programs that build knowledge bases and promote learning as a focus and passion not just a checkbox in a career 36To broaden cloud worker skills and the ability to handle multiple tasks and work on a variety of projects cloud learning could include the following principles 37In the cloud careers and expertise will be built in new ways and work will be something we do rather than a place we go to As such the cloud will give workers more control over their schedules and workloads By creating a flexible workplace governments could shed a significant amount of physical infrastructure and create shared workspaces Many buildings could be converted into co located spaces teams could use collaboration spaces or videoconferencing centers Some workers might rarely set foot in a government building instead conducting cloud tasks at home and interacting with project teams virtually With advancing communications and mobile technology distance no longer hinders collaboration It no longer matters whether all workers are at an office between 9 a m and 5 p m what matters is whether project teams produce results and whether everyone contributes A more flexible workplace could also take advantage of resources governments might not otherwise have access to Some retiring workers may not want to quit working altogether and a flexible model could be an enticing way to keep their expertise on retainer Alternatively the model could take advantage of would be government employees unwilling to relocate or unable to work a regular schedule By increasing flexibility governments could increase their available resource pool allowing agencies to access the skills and knowledge they need when they need it For an example of how a retiree could interact with the cloud see Appendix C National Security Case Study Don t think governments will ever take to the cloud At the U S Department of State the idea could soon be a reality The Office of eDiplomacy is preparing to pilot a cloud component to its e internship model for American students as part of the Virtual Student Foreign Service VSFS beginning this year The VSFS currently offers e internships to U S university students of multiple month duration By using a new micro volunteering platform State Department offices and embassies around the world will be able to create non classified tasks that take anywhere from a couple of minutes to a couple of days to complete Each task will be tagged by region and or issue and will automatically populate the profiles of students who have indicated those interests Students can then select the tasks that interest them the most or that fit into their schedule To see that the most pressing work is performed first offices and embassies will be able to prioritize their tasks so critical items appear at the top of the queue Imagine a small embassy preparing for a high profile multilateral meeting The preparations for such an event could be daunting for a small staff The power of the cloud could augment an individual embassy s capacity to prepare for a major event and ensure that related items are performed ahead of those that are less critical While there are plenty of incentives for participating in the VSFS micro volunteering platform from an impressive line on a student s resume to the chance to make a difference by working on topics of interest thought is being put into how to creatively incent high performance One idea is to simply invoke students competitive spirit Competition could be encouraged by a monthly leader board which results in bragging rights and potentially even a low cost but high impact reward Transparency is also key to competition with ratings available to State Department staff and other cloud interns and the ability to make short thank you notes from embassies publicly available interns would be keen to make a good impression The potential applications of this type of program are significant Imagine if offices throughout the State Department could tap into the language and cultural expertise of the thousands of foreign national staff members around the globe Providing a platform for those employees to contribute even a small amount of time to discreet tasks that require their expertise could unlock a world of knowledge 38Creating the GovCloud model will require bold leadership and the ideas and initiatives of entrepreneurial executives While a GovCloud model may be years in the making agencies can begin adopting cloud concepts today The GovCloud concept is designed to be versatile as well as applicable to a wide range of entities Depending on your organization government executives wishing to employ GovCloud may choose to apply the concept first to a unit before expanding to other branches or divisions entire agencies or the whole of government Often GovCloud principles are most effectively implemented as part of a larger reform program within a particular agency as with the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs Renew program as described earlier in this report On a smaller scale the UK Cabinet Office used flexible resourcing FR in its Economic Reform Group ERG with a staff of about 400 as part of its cost reduction plans Using a simple database that it had developed and a strong program of communications FR is now used and embraced by all core ERG employees with strong clear ownership from the top another key implementation factor Says Ian Watmore the UK Cabinet Office s former permanent secretary FR means we are able to deploy people much more quickly to priority projects 40Figure 3 outlines how GovCloud can apply to a variety of organizations Most government workforces haven t undergone a broad restructuring in decades In that time the world has been transformed by computers the Internet and mobile communications To respond to a variety of challenges governments have created scores of new organizations However in today s world of budget cuts and increased fiscal scrutiny the constant creation of new permanent structures is not sustainable The GovCloud model could offer a new way to use government resources A cloud of government wide workers could coalesce into project based teams to solve problems and separate when their work is done This could allow governments to concentrate resources when and where they are needed By using this model in conjunction with thinner agencies and shared services governments can reduce back office redundancies and let agencies focus on their core missions This model capitalizes on the work preferences of Millennials the future government workforce who value career growth over job security or compensation 41 The GovCloud model allows employees to gain a variety of experiences in a shorter amount of time and to self select their career direction To support GovCloud governments could establish the processes by which cloud teams would form work and dissolve New ways to evaluate performance and help workers gain skills and build careers should be considered Today s employee classification system stresses job descriptions and time in service this could be transformed with an XP model that emphasizes the individual s ownership of his or her career The GovCloud model will undoubtedly be controversial Many stakeholders from governing bodies to public employee unions must weigh in to shape the future government workforce The transition to a cloud model will not happen overnight or maybe even in the next five years but the conversation starts today Charlie Tierney is a Manager in Deloitte Consulting LLP s Federal Human

percent Several years ago Google s People Analytics division launched Project Aristotle to understand the components of productive teams embracing research that groups are more creative than individuals Private sector businesses are automating tedious tasks augmenting workers with artificial intelligence technologies reskilling and upskilling their workforces focusing on employee wellness and hungrily recruiting talent Government will have to catch up Perhaps nowhere is the gap between the public and private sector greater than in workforce management Most public sector organizations are still locked into decades old employee policies such as rigid job classifications lockstep pay and a reliance on seniority as a substitute for capability The reality is that government agencies are increasingly called upon to address society s most complex challenges while using workforce approaches rooted in the distant past The good news Change is possible and beginning to happen A new Deloitte study explores some of the ways the nature of government work the public workforce itself and the workplace it occupies will all need to continue to evolve Work New technologies can transform the capabilities of a government worker Artificially intelligent chatbots for example can perform triage on citizen questions freeing human attention for less routine queries The Army s recruitment chatbot SGT STAR does the work of 55 recruiters answering 94 percent of questions A Deloitte analysis of AI s potential found that automation could save the federal government as much as 1 2 billion hours of work annually What AI doesn t automate it can enhance Child welfare caseworkers who according to one study spend just 9 percent of their time with children but 37 5 percent of their time on paperwork could use technology to auto populate documentation freeing time for visits AI also can correlate hospital truancy and arrest records to flag children in danger Some restaurant health inspectors already analyze big data to identify likely candidates for inspections In Chicago for instance tests found 24 percent more critical violations and on average isolated dangers from the food system a week earlier For effective work redesign it s helpful to adopt a two pronged strategy of zooming in and zooming out A zooming in approach hones in on individual tasks and processes that have the most potential to be optimized through automation Zooming out entails looking at the bigger picture to define what work redesign means for entire job classifications departments and the organization as a whole Workforce Specialists in fields like cybersecurity agile development and artificial intelligence are not likely to commit decades to one government position and if they did they d still need to swap into the tech sector periodically to sharpen their skills That s why some government technology programs are taking a tour of duty approach letting private sector experts serve in the public sector for a few years on specific projects without locking them into a lifetime of government work At the federal level the General Services Administration s 18F digital services agency the Oak Ridge Institute for Science Education and the Presidential Innovation Fellows program all help government solve problems with temporary outside hires At the state level Michigan s Cyber Civilian Corps a volunteer group of cybersecurity professionals from the private sector and academia as well as government can be called upon if the governor declares a cyber emergency And long term government workers don t need to be stuck in one place A talent cloud can prepare for unexpected staffing needs by identifying in advance workers with special skills and applying them to tasks suited to their expertise Canada is experimenting with letting multiple agencies dip into a talent cloud and hire workers for specific missions Workers keep their union membership rights and benefits but may be called into service by any agency Workplace Empirical science rarely guides hiring But management is becoming more data driven Applying the newest science on team building personal efficiency and employee wellness to government agencies can upgrade the workplace to better attract retain and utilize talent Insights from studies of the composition and functioning of effective teams can inform decisions about using talents more effectively Organizational network analysis for example can use metadata from emails and other sources to map communication patterns in organizations accurately predicting individuals who will be high performers detecting unsatisfied employees six months before they actually quit and identifying leadership behaviors that correlate with success Modern workplace wellness programs are also extremely impactful Improving employee wellness can reduce lost work days increase retention and fuel productivity After the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center provided a physician and nurse case manager for employees it saw an 80 percent decline in lost work days over six years for a cost savings of 1 5 million In short the future of government work will require a level of dynamic workforce management far beyond the current practices of the public sector The potential for government agencies to unlock more human capital potential and make the public sector a magnet for talent is enormous If states changed where and how we select candidates turnout would soar and we d learn a lot more about what voters really think In preparing for a disaster and recovering from one residents and businesses need to know that their voices will be heard The way governments are measuring results is becoming kinder and more effective As Buffalo s former mayor demonstrated to bring the right people together you have to know what it takes to make a project succeed Local governments are using internet surveys to better gauge residents needs Some states are finding ways to make rules easier to navigate and less costly for business while continuing to protect the public s interests Loading PreviewSorry preview is currently unavailable You can

weekend after talks failed to resolve a row over the introduction of the new fleet of Hitachi inter city trains Members of the RMT union will go ahead with the planned strike action for Sunday 23 August followed by a 72 hour walkout over the bank holiday weekend Yesterday union representatives and FGW failed to reach an agreement to prevent the action after two days of talks An RMT spokesman said Despite strenuous efforts we have failed to reach agreement with First Great Western on the fundamental issues at the heart of the dispute over the introduction of the new Hitachi trains As a result the action this Sunday goes ahead The union remains available for talks A spokesman for FGW added that while it held a positive meeting with the RMT disappointingly no agreement had been

gap could threaten the timetables for future rail projects such as Crossrail and HS2 NSARE forecasts that the rail industry needs between 1 600 and 2 000 new people in the next five years over 30 of which need to be trained at a technical level The largest gap in terms of numbers is expected in traction and rolling stock RMT general secretary Bob Crow said The reality of under investment in training and apprenticeships across the rail industry combined with the dumping of core staff in favour of a casualised agency approach threatens the viability of rail projects of all kinds including the High Speed plans announced this week The figures coming from NSARE make a mockery of the McNulty Rail Review plans endorsed by the Government to slash rail industry jobs in the name of cash savings Britain s rail industry will be left unable to cope with the progammes being laid out for the future if the Government don t row back RMT has already raised serious concerns over the latest job loss plan at Network Rail which would reduce the frontline operations workforce of 5600 to less than 1500 and reduce the maintenance workforce by 8 or 1250 workers including 800 track staff and would increase the use of external contractors This is a wake up call for the Government stop the rail job cuts and start investing in training and apprenticeships or watch your plans collapse into chaos For more on NSARE s skills forecasting see the Feb March edition of the magazine where RTM speaks to chief executive Gil Howarth Tell us what you think have your say below or email us directly

insistence on 3D models for its project coupled with the governments championing of BIM for all new major projects buildings etc Unless more 2D draughters become 3D modellers once the other projects really get going HS2 et al there will not be enough 3D microstation modellers to service all the projects Programmes will slip and there will be hell to pay somewhere More trainiing cross training needs to take place before we get back to the stage where draughting modelling staff are being poached from one company to service the requirements of another Rates are already slowly on the rise and

railtechnologymagazine comOther brands produced by Cognitive Publishing LtdWeb Design by SeniorFind out more Remind Me LaterJapanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama said on Wednesday he and his powerful party No 2 would resign after a slide in the polls threatened their party s chances in an election expected next month Calls have built up in Hatoyama s Democratic Party for him to step down to revive the party s fortunes ahead of an election for the upper house of parliament expected on July 11 that it must win to smooth policymaking With tears in his eyes Hatoyama told a party gathering both he and party secretary general Ichiro Ozawa would resign their posts Analysts have tipped outspoken Finance Minister Naoto Kan as the likely successor to Hatoyama who quits after just eight months on the job Political rows including the recent departure of a tiny leftist party from the ruling coalition has distracted the government as it thrashes out a plan to cut huge public debt and a strategy to engineer growth despite a fast ageing population Hatoyama becomes the fourth straight Japanese leader to leave office after a year or less in office Hatoyama s resignation may cause delays in the scheduled releases this month of the government s growth strategies and fiscal discipline targets Whoever replaces Hatoyama would need to work them out before an upper house election or else disappoint voters said Hirokata Kusaba an economist at Mizuho Research Institute Things could not get any worse after Hatoyama quits given the current deadlock in many important issues Finance Minister Kan has in the past pressed the Bank of Japan to do more to fight deflation and has sounded more positive than Hatoyama about raising the 5 percent sales tax in the future to fund bulging social welfare costs That stance would be welcomed by investors worried about Japan s huge public debt which is nearly 200 percent of GDP If Finance Minister Kan takes over it would be welcome news for the JGB market because Kan is more proactive about fiscal discipline and about raising the consumption tax than any other cabinet minister Mizuho Research s Kusaba said The Democrats swept to power last August after a landslide election win for parliament s powerful lower house ousting the conservative Liberal Democratic Party LDP after more than 50 years of almost non stop rule But doubts over Hatoyama s leadership skills have eroded the government s approval ratings with one poll showing support at just 17 percent after he failed to keep a campaign pledge to move a U S airbase off

Parliament They also reproduced in the next edition of the Daily Report and of Hansard in the relevant House Written statements made before 17 November 2014 were published only in Hansard My Right Honourable Friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Mark Field has made the following written Ministerial statement I am announcing today the start of a Tailored Review of the Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission MACC Established by an Act of Parliament in 1953 in commemoration of the assistance received by the United Kingdom from the United States under the Marshall Plan the MACC administers the British Marshall scholarships As a Non Departmental Public Body NDPB sponsored by the Foreign Commonwealth Office FCO the MACC is required to undergo a Tailored Review at least once in every parliament The principal aims of Tailored Reviews are to ensure public bodies remain fit for purpose are well governed and properly accountable for what they do The Review will provide a robust scrutiny of and assurance on the continuing need for the MACC both its function and its form It will then assess the governance and control arrangements in place to ensure they are compliant with the recognised principles of good corporate governance and delivering good value for money The Review will look both at the current performance of the MACC and at how it is able to respond and adapt to those factors which are most likely to affect its position as a prestigious scholarship provider and effective public diplomacy tool for the UK A Challenge Group comprising senior FCO and Cabinet Office officials will have regular oversight of the interim findings to ensure the Review is robust and rigorous The Review will follow guidance published in 2016 by the Cabinet Office Tailored Reviews guidance on reviews of public bodies https www gov uk government publications tailored reviews of public bodies guidance The Terms of Reference for the review can be found on gov uk In conducting this Tailored Review officials will engage with a broad range of stakeholders in the UK and US including across UK Government Devolved Administrations partner academic institutions current scholars alumni the MACC s volunteer Commissioners and recruitment panels and the Association of Commonwealth Universities who provide administration for the programme I shall inform the House of the outcome of the Review when it is completed and copies of the report of the Review will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses I am pleased to place in the Library of the House this year s financial summary of the Defence Equipment Plan This is the seventh consecutive annual publication of the equipment plan summary and presents our plans to deliver the equipment needed by our Armed Forces to defend the country and keep our people safe The Government is committed to meeting the NATO target to spend 2 of GDP on defence and at least 20 of that spending on equipment This report sets out our plans to spend 186 billion on equipment in the 10 years from 2018 19 We have substantially revised the content of this report to make it more transparent and accessible For the first time we have set out the strategic context for the Equipment Plan and presented in detail the Department s assessment of the affordability of the Plan The NAO has assessed our plans and we are grateful to them for their report which is also published today In 2017 18 the Department achieved several notable milestones in procurement and support of equipment and successfully delivered the plan within budget Looking ahead there are significant financial pressures we must manage in the Equipment Plan Our central estimate for the cost of the Equipment Plan at April 2018 exceeded the allocated budget by an average of 3 7 over the 10 years from 2018 19 The shortfall is greatest in the four years from 2018 19 This forecast will vary as risks and opportunities materialise and project plans mature or are changed through management action The Department secured 1 billion additional funding in the Autumn budget which will help reduce the risk to affordability until 2020 and allow the Department to continue delivering existing plans for Joint Force 2025 and to modernise some key capability areas We are also taking steps to improve management of the Plan and enable longer term affordability The Modernising Defence Programme was launched to further strengthen and modernise UK defence and the Armed Forces and put UK defence onto an enduringly affordable footing for the future This work involves rigorously pursuing productivity and efficiency gains as well as prioritising capabilities to meet the changing threat environment It will reshape the content of the Equipment Plan and improve the way in which it is managed We will report on the implications for the Equipment Plan in subsequent financial summary reports Today I am placing before the House the Government s prevention vision Prevention is Better than Cure This document sets out a cross Government vision for stopping health problems from arising in the first place and when they do supporting people to manage them as effectively as possible Our mission is to improve healthy life expectancy so that by 2035 we are enjoying at least five extra years of healthy independent life whilst closing the gap between the richest and poorest When it comes to prevention we all have a role to play individuals families communities employers charities the NHS social care and local and national government Only by working together can we make this vision a reality I am placing a copy of the prevention vision in the libraries of both HousesCitizens from the Commonwealth have a long tradition of serving with distinction in the Armed Forces In light of changes to the size of our Armed Forces a five year UK residency criterion for Commonwealth citizens wishing to join the Armed Forces was re imposed in 2013 A limited waiver to this requirement was introduced in May 2016 to recruit up to 200 Commonwealth personnel per annum to fill skill shortage posts We have now decided to remove the five year UK residency criterion for Commonwealth citizens and increase recruitment to 1 350 across the Royal Navy British Army and Royal Air Force Applications will be accepted from all Commonwealth countries although in order to mitigate the risks associated with unaccompanied minors travelling to the UK without the guarantee of a job we will not be accepting applications from those under 18 Applicants from Commonwealth countries will need to meet all necessary recruitment criteria for the Service and role they wish to join Security standards which will be assessed on a case by case basis and may differ from the current UK security requirements In 2009 1 a 15 percent limit on foreign and Commonwealth nationals in a number of areas of the Army the Royal Logistic Corps RLC the Royal Army Dental Corps RADC and the Queen Alexandra s Royal Army Nursing Corps QARANC was established as a necessary and proportionate requirement to sustain operational effectiveness As we now intend to increase the numbers of Commonwealth citizens joining across the full spread of Army roles we have concluded that it is appropriate to both limit the overall numbers recruited and to replicate the 15 per cent limit across all Cap Badges The requirement for individuals to have Indefinite Leave to Remain ILR or Indefinite Leave to Enter ILE to join the Reserves has not been changed This will not affect personnel from the Republic of Ireland or those in the Brigade of Gurkhas This policy will be kept under review 1 Written Ministerial Statement Army Nationality Policy dated 2 February 2009The UK is committed to preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon We believe the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action JCPoA remains the best way of achieving that goal It is a critical agreement that makes the world a safer place The United Kingdom and our European partners continue to work with the remaining parties to the deal to maintain it We expect Iran to meet its nuclear commitments as set out in the agreement in full In May of this year President Trump announced the withdrawal of the United States of America from the JCPoA In consequence today US sanctions on Iran will be re imposed including on Iran s oil and gas exporting capability We have been clear with the US administration about our determination to preserve the JCPoA and the fact that this is driven by our national security interests As a party to the JCPoA we remain committed to ensuring that Iran receives the sanctions relief to which it is entitled This includes taking steps to enable firms wishing to engage in legitimate trade with Iran to do so We are working with our partners France and Germany fellow parties to the JCPoA to develop a Special Purpose Vehicle SPV to enable continued sanctions relief to reach Iran and allow for European exporters and importers to trade in compliance with EU and UN sanctions In parallel to our work with partners to maintain the JCPoA we continue to take steps with our partners against the IRGC s destabilising behaviour across the region and to hold Iran to account on human rights including its treatment of British Iranians detained in Iran I am announcing today the start of a Tailored Review of the Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission MACC Established by an Act of Parliament in 1953 in commemoration of the assistance received by the United Kingdom from the

administration for the programme I shall inform the House of the outcome of the Review when it is completed and copies of the report of the Review will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses I am announcing today the start of a Tailored Review of the Great Britain China Centre GBCC The GBCC is a Non Departmental Public Body of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office FCO Its principal activity is to encourage mutual knowledge and understanding through the promotion of closer cultural professional economic educational legal judicial and other contacts between Britain and China As a Non Departmental Public Body NDPB sponsored by the FCO the GBCC is required to undergo a Tailored Review at least once in every parliament The principle aims of Tailored Reviews are to ensure public bodies remain fit for purpose are well governed and are properly accountable for what they do The Review will provide a robust scrutiny of and assurance on the continuing need for the GBCC both its function and its form If the review finds the GBCC should be retained in its current form and status the review will then consider GBCC s capacity for delivering on its core mandate more effectively and efficiently It will also assess the control and governance arrangements that are in place to ensure that GBCC and the FCO are complying with recognised principles of good corporate governance The review will follow guidance published in 2016 by the Cabinet Office Tailored Reviews guidance on reviews of public bodies The Terms of Reference for the review can be found on gov uk In conducting the Tailored Review officials will engage with a broad range of stakeholders across the UK and overseas including staff management and the Board of the GBCC These consultations will include participating and sponsor organisations of GBCC projects and events and partners from across UK Government foreign governments academics and civil society Both Houses will be informed of the outcome of the review when it is completed and copies of the report of the review will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses My Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Housing Communities and Local Government James Brokenshire has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement In the written statement of 12 March 2018 HCWS535 my Rt Hon Friend the then Secretary of State for Housing Communities and Local Government Sajid Javid told the House that there was consensus amongst the five Buckinghamshire councils that local government across the county should be reorganised and that two alternative approaches for doing this were being proposed He announced that he was minded to implement subject to Parliamentary approval the locally led proposal for replacing the current structures with a single new unitary council and that he was not minded to implement the locally led proposal for two new unitary councils for the same area There followed a period for representations Since then I have received over 3 000 representations which I have carefully considered along with all other relevant information available to me I am clear that there is broad consent for change in Buckinghamshire A survey conducted by Opinion Research Services of a representative sample of residents found that 75 per cent agreed with the principle of reorganisation in Buckinghamshire and overall 87 per cent of the representations made to me supported change Both proposals made it clear that retaining the status quo is not an option Having assessed both proposals against the criteria that we announced to the House on 28 February 2017 PQ 65271 I have concluded that whilst both proposals meet the criterion for a good deal of local support only the proposal for a single unitary council satisfies the criteria for improving local government and for being a credible geography and that in any event the proposal for a single unitary council is better able to meet the criteria overall The Government s policy as explained to the House by Ministers on 22 May 2018 Hansard Col 336WH is that we will not seek to impose top down solutions on local government where there is a desire and a thrust for more change and innovation we will look to support those involved according to the criteria we have laid out Given the desire and thrust for change and innovation in Buckinghamshire that the five councils agree that the current structures are not sustainable and that the locally led proposal for a single unitary is the only proposal that meets the three criteria I am persuaded that the right course of action is to establish a new single unitary district council for Buckinghamshire Accordingly I am today announcing that I have decided to implement subject to Parliamentary approval the locally led proposal to replace the existing five councils across Buckinghamshire the two tier structure of Buckinghamshire County Council and the district councils of Aylesbury Vale Chiltern South Bucks and Wycombe by one new single unitary district council and that I have decided not to implement the proposal for two new unitary councils Whilst I am clear that the single unitary proposal fully meets the three criteria I recognise that some have questioned whether such a structure might weaken local democratic engagement at the most local level To help reassure any who might be concerned on this I intend to speak with the five councils to determine whether I should modify the proposal before implementing it in relation to councillor numbers perhaps providing for three member electoral wards I will also expect the new unitary council and in the meantime the existing councils to engage with their local communities about the appropriate arrangements for civic representation for towns and parishes I similarly expect the councils to promote and help support the development of neighbourhood plans as I consider these can be key building blocks for the successful implementation of change in Buckinghamshire that residents deserve In March the then Secretary of State was clear that in relation to establishing a single council further steps were needed to secure local consent amongst the local partners Further steps have been taken with Ministers having meetings with council leaders The great majority of local partners do support the proposal for a single unitary council including the police the ambulance service CCG NHS Trust Independent Chair of the Adult Safeguarding Board Thames Valley Local Enterprise Partnership and Bucks Business First In addition to enjoying a good deal of local support I am satisfied that the proposal meets the requirement for local consent set out in the Cities and Local Government Devolution Act 2016 I now intend to prepare and lay before Parliament drafts of the necessary secondary legislation to give effect to my decision My intention is that if Parliament approves this legislation the new council will be established on 1 April 2020 with the first elections to the council held on 7 May 2020 I intend to explore with the district councils whether they would like me to make and lay before Parliament an Order to delay for one year the May 2019 local elections in Aylesbury Vale Chiltern South Bucks and Wycombe so as to avoid councillors being elected for only one year if Parliament approves the legislation establishing the new council From March 2019 the sunset clause means that the consent provisions in the process we are currently using for reorganisations fall away In future any proposal considered under the Cities and Local Government Devolution Act process will require unanimous consent from all councils Alternatively I may issue a formal invitation for proposals and the specific circumstances in which I would do so will be set out in due course In the written statement of 12 March 2018 HCWS535 my Rt Hon Friend the then Secretary of State for Housing Communities and Local Government Sajid Javid told the House that there was consensus amongst the five Buckinghamshire councils that local government across the county should be reorganised and that two alternative approaches for doing this were being proposed He announced that he was minded to implement subject to Parliamentary approval the locally led proposal for replacing the current structures with a single new unitary council and that he was not minded to implement the locally led proposal for two new unitary councils for the same area There followed a period for representations Since then I have received over 3 000 representations which I have carefully considered along with all other relevant information available to me I am clear that there is broad consent for change in Buckinghamshire A survey conducted by Opinion Research Services of a representative sample of residents found that 75 per cent agreed with the principle of reorganisation in Buckinghamshire and overall 87 per cent of the representations made to me supported change

laying a Departmental Minute to advise that HM Treasury intends subject to the standard procedure for notification to Parliament of the assumption of contingent liabilities as described below to make the government s fourth and fifth annual capital contributions of US 122 180 000 approx 95 3m 1 to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank at year end 2018 and year end 2019 This is in line with the authority provided by this House under the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Initial Capital Contribution Order 2015 Parliamentary approval for these payments will be sought in Supplementary Estimates for HM Treasury The UK s overall capital contribution will total US 3 054 700 000 approx 2 4bn of which five payments together will make up the 20 paid in capital contribution requiring a cash transfer The other 80 US 2 443 800 000 approx 1 9bn is callable capital the AIIB has the right to call for payment for these shares if there is a crisis affecting the bank s assets or liabilities The payment of the fourth and fifth instalments of the capital contribution will therefore incur additional contingent liabilities in line with the amount of callable capital paid As such the UK will increase its current contingent liability by US 488 760 000 approx 381m to a cumulative total contingent liability of US 1 955 040 000 approx 1 5bn after the fourth payment and by a final US 488 760 000 to reach the total of US 2 443 800 000 This will complete the UK s purchase of AIIB shares Although the AIIB has the right to call for payment of this callable capital incurred when the initial capital instalment was paid no such instance has occurred in any multilateral development bank in the past If the liability were to be called provision for any payment would be sought through the normal Supply procedure As is usual a Departmental Minute has been laid before Parliament to give at least 14 sitting days notice of the intent to incur a contingent liability 1 Exchange rate as of 29 October 2018My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement I am today laying a Departmental Minute to advise that HM Treasury intends subject to the standard procedure for notification to Parliament of the assumption of contingent liabilities as described below to make the government s fourth and fifth annual

a Departmental Minute has been laid before Parliament to give at least 14 sitting days notice of the intent to incur a contingent liability 1 Exchange rate as of 29 October 2018My Hon Friend Minister of State for Agriculture Fisheries and Food George Eustice has today made the following statement I was unable to attend this year s meeting of the International Whaling Commission IWC67 on the 10 14 September 2018 in Brazil due to pressing commitments in relation to the UK s exit from the EU However a strong UK delegation was present This meeting was particularly challenging with a number of complex and controversial proposals tabled These included a significant challenge to the long standing moratorium on commercial whaling However I am happy to report that all UK objectives for this meeting were achieved and the strong global protection in place for cetaceans was maintained As always the UK delegation worked tirelessly behind the scenes supporting the EU Presidency analysing proposals brokering compromises and influencing crucial decisions all with the aim of securing improvements to the conservation and welfare of cetaceans The UK also ensured its long standing opposition to commercial whaling and whaling under Special Permit scientific whaling was made clear at every appropriate opportunity As always there was the need for careful diplomacy with the UK working hard to ensure dialogue remained constructive and respectful despite the fundamental differences in views Of particular importance at this meeting was resisting the proposal by Japan to restructure the organisation to allow for the resumption of commercial whaling This complex proposal sought to create a new Whaling Committee within the IWC to oversee a return to commercial whaling on abundant whale populations and relax the voting rules for amending the Convention s Schedule which contains the provision establishing the moratorium from a three quarter to a simple majority The UK worked extremely hard on defending against this proposal leading the coordination with likeminded countries to ensure a coherent and well aligned strategy I was therefore extremely relieved to see that the proposal failed to secure sufficient support and that the critical commercial whaling moratorium remains in place The UK will now use the intersessional period to reach out to countries on both sides of the debate to ensure that constructive engagement within the IWC is maintained I am pleased to also report that a number of other important agreements were reached In particular with regards Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling ASW which was a challenging but important proposal and one that the UK had been engaging closely on for several months prior to the meeting The proposal sought to renew and in some cases increase quotas for indigenous communities reliant on whales for subsistence purposes In addition it also introduced expanded carryover provisions to allow greater flexibility for hunters and a mechanism to automatically renew quotas without the need for the IWC to discuss and agree providing the scientific advice was favourable and there were no substantive changes to the hunt or subsistence need After a series of complex negotiations within which the UK was centrally placed an eventual compromise was reached A compromise that protects indigenous communities access to food reducing the stress and uncertainty associated with returning to the IWC every six years to request food for their families But crucially balancing this by ensuring the IWC maintains its important oversight role and protecting its decision making power in the event that the status quo situation of the hunts changes I am extremely pleased by this landmark decision for the IWC which clearly demonstrates the maturity and functioning nature of the organisation I was also encouraged to see a number of important decisions taken on tackling important threats to cetaceans In particular the passing by consensus of Resolutions on underwater noise and ghost gear The Florianopolis Declaration also passed following a vote delivering a clear statement from anti whaling nations on their vision for the future of the IWC one that is rooted in conservation without the need for commercial or scientific whaling Important progress was also made on further modernisation of the organisation through institutional and governance improvements An intersessional process was established to bring forward recommendations and develop a programme of work in time for the next biennial meeting in 2020 The working group tasked with delivering this will be chaired by the USA with the UK taking on an important role as Vice Chair I was pleased to see how the discussions on Special Permits progressed following the report of the intersessional working group established by Resolution at the previous biennial meeting The UK participated in this group expertly chaired by Australia which delivered for the first time a clear and concise summary of the advice of the Scientific Committee and proposed conclusions for the IWC to adopt Despite disagreements from pro whaling nations the IWC meeting report will reflect these conclusions as representing the view of the Commission with a statement opposing from those that disagreed This represents a good outcome and for the first time provides significant clarity of position for the IWC on this matter Once again I am pleased to report that the UK in line with the agreed position of EU Member States voted in favour of establishing a South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary Unfortunately the proposal failed to gain the three quarters majority required for adoption I expect this proposal to be re tabled at the next meeting in 2020 which in the absence of any other offer will be hosted by Slovenia Finally I was pleased that UK led work to develop a tool to assess the welfare implications of non hunting threats to cetacean welfare and efforts to further strengthen the conservation work of the IWC received endorsement We will continue working closely with NGOs and academia to maintain momentum and continue to deliver improved conservation and welfare outcomes for cetaceans In conclusion despite the significant challenges faced at this meeting this can be viewed as a success We now turn our attention to the intersessional period and following our successful nomination to the IWC Bureau begin building for the 2020 meeting Integral to this will be our continued close working with civil society in delivering our shared goal of improving the conservation and welfare of cetaceans globally My Hon Friend Minister of State for Agriculture Fisheries and Food George Eustice has today made the following statement Agriculture and Fisheries Council took place in Luxembourg on 15 October The UK was represented by Katrina Williams Deputy Permanent Representative to the EU and Rory O Donnell Agriculture Counsellor The main focus of the Council for fisheries was a Regulation on fixing the fishing opportunities in the Baltic Sea for 2019 for which a political agreement was sought Additional scientific advice for 2019 was presented and the deal received unanimous support from member states There was also an exchange of views on the EU Norway annual consultation for 2019 The Commission highlighted the 2019 deadline for full implementation of the EU Landing Obligations and the 2020 deadline for all EU stocks to be fished at Maximum Sustainable Yield The UK mentioned the importance of maximising inward trades of fish species to help mitigate potential choke problems in the North Sea in 2019 During an exchange of views on the annual meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ICCAT some member states supported a move within ICCAT to progress the Bluefin tuna recovery plan into a management plan Commissioner Vella agreed with greater participation of small scale fishers but made it clear that the existing controls should remain in place For agriculture the main item that was discussed was the progress report on the Regulation on CAP Strategic Plans Member states supported the new delivery model in principle but discussed making some of the requirements optional In response the Commission pointed out the importance of ensuring a level playing field The Commission debriefed Council on the G20 Agricultural Ministerial meeting that took place in July highlighting that the conclusions reflected the EU s position The Presidency updated Council on the outcome of the informal process to identify a single EU candidate for the next Director General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO A number of items were discussed under any other business The Italian delegation raised an item about the state of the European sugar market The Spanish delegation informed Council of the upcoming electoral round for the Director General of the International Organisation of Vine and Wine OIV The Commission gave an update on the state of play with African Swine Fever ASF An informal ministerial meeting on ASF will be held in the margins of the AgriFish Council on 19 DecemberMy Rt hon friend the Minister of State for Energy and Clean Growth Claire Perry has today made the following statement I attended the EU Environment Council in Luxembourg on 9 October Dr Th r se Coffey Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the Environment and Roseanna Cunningham Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Environment Climate Change and Land Reform also attended I wish to update the House on the matters discussed Regulation on CO2 standards for cars and vansThe main outcome of Council was reaching an agreed position General Approach on the regulation on emissions standards for new cars and vans as part of which the European Commission had proposed a 30 reduction in emissions by 2030 Council began with a full roundtable where Ministers set out their respective positions The UK intervened calling for greater ambition in 2030 and stressing the importance of getting the package right as a whole Following debate the Presidency presented a revised proposal and called for an informal vote for agreement Agreement was not reached in that round so a further Presidency proposal was presented the key elements included a higher level of ambition of a 35 reduction by 2030 strengthened incentives for zero and low emission vehicles a strengthened review clause and a continuation of the niche derogation for smaller car manufacturers to 2030 This was sufficient for Council to achieve a General Approach although a number of Member States could not support the text or abstained Trilogue discussions have already commenced Adoption of conclusions on the preparations for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Katowice Poland 2 14 December 2018 The Council adopted conclusions on the EU s priorities and approach for the negotiations at the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties COP24 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC The conclusions focus on the urgency of climate action especially in light of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC s special report Global Warming of 1 5 C published on 8th October 2018 completion of the COP21 Paris Agreement Work Programme PAWP which constitutes the implementing rules underpinning the Agreement and the Talanoa Dialogue the facilitative process culminating at COP24 for taking stock of collective progress towards the long term goals of the Paris Agreement The UK intervened to underline the stark and sobering messages of the IPCC report that current global efforts are insufficient and that COP24 is crucial to making the Paris Agreement a reality The UK highlighted the action the UK is taking to address climate change including hosting Green Great Britain Week promoted greater climate ambition and the EU updating its Nationally Determined Contribution NDC by 2020 and signalled the importance of continued collaboration on climate change The UK also supported the inclusion of at least one net zero 2050 scenario in the EU s Long term Strategy on emissions reductions and the need for common time frames for submission of NDCs to the UNFCCC The conclusions highlighted the EU s ambitious climate and energy policy framework to 2030 and acknowledged that recent increases to the EU s 2030 renewable and energy efficiency targets will have an impact on the EU s level of achievement Ministers expressed that they looked forward to the European Commission s proposal for a Strategy for long term EU greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the objectives and long term goals of the Paris Agreement underlining that the Strategy should include a 1 5 C scenario and at least one pathway towards net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by 2050 The conclusions stressed that the EU is ready to communicate or update its NDC by 2020 and recalled the importance of striving towards common time frames for all UNFCCC Parties NDCs Conclusions on the Convention on Biological Diversity Sharm El Sheikh Egypt 17 29 November 2018 Council adopted Conclusions on the Convention on Biological Diversity ahead of the 14th session of the Conference of the Parties in November Member States stressed the need to prioritise action on biodiversity as well as climate Minister Coffey called for 30 of the world s oceans to be protected by 2030 highlighted the UK s Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference and stressed the importance of taking action on mangroves Minister Coffey also argued that a holistic approach was required in order to overcome climate change and other environmental challenges going forward including biodiversity Regulation on CO2 standards for heavy duty vehiclesThe Council held a policy debate on CO2 emissions from heavy duty vehicles with the Presidency seeking views on the level of ambition and incentives for low and zero emission vehicles Council was broadly supportive of the proposals with some pushing for more ambition and others indicating they thought the Commission s proposal struck the right balance The UK indicated its support for high ambition to help meet our clean growth and climate change ambitions AOB ItemsDirective on single use plasticsAll Member States including the UK strongly welcomed the thrust of the proposal but views were mixed on scope and targets The UK alongside other Member States stressed the need for Extended Producer Responsibility requirements to be sufficiently flexible Minister Coffey also highlighted the importance of taking into account the context in which products were used for example in a medical setting and emphasised that any fishing gear regulations needed to be implementable Reports on main recent international meetingsThe Presidency and Commission updated Council on two recent

PolandPoland updated the Council on their Clean Air Programme My rt hon Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department Sajid Javid has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement My first priority as Home Secretary is to keep the public safe Today I have published a new revised and updated Serious and Organised Crime Strategy The strategy has been laid before Parliament as Command Paper Cm 9718 and copies are available in the Vote Office and on gov uk Serious and organised crime affects more UK citizens more often than any other national security threat Its perpetrators ruthlessly target the most vulnerable ruining lives and blighting communities Their activities cost us at least 37 billion each year and have a corrosive impact on our public services communities reputation and way of life Since the previous strategy was published in 2013 we have made significant progress in creating the powers partnerships and law enforcement structures we need to respond to the threat The law enforcement community and the National Crime Agency in particular has an impressive and sustained track record of pursuing serious and organised criminals and bringing them to justice But the threat we face has grown increasingly complex over the past five years Criminals and networks are quick to exploit the rate of technological change and globalisation whether it is grooming children online using malware to steal personal data or moving illegal goods people and money across borders They have learnt to become more adaptable and resilient Our response must continue to adapt to new challenges The revised strategy follows a comprehensive cross government review led by the Home Office It sets out the government s new approach to prevent serious and organised crime build our defences against it track down the perpetrators from child sex offenders to corrupt elites and bring them to justice We will allow no safe space for these people their networks or their illicit money in our society Our new approach will be to target the highest harm networks and the most dangerous and determined criminals exploiting vulnerable people using all the powers and levers available to the state to deny them access to money assets and infrastructure But we will not achieve our aim through disruption alone We will also work with the public businesses and communities to help stop them from being targeted by criminals and support those who are and we will intervene early with those at risk of being drawn into criminality We will invest at least 48 million in 2019 20 in law enforcement capabilities to strengthen efforts to tackle illicit finance which will enhance our overall response to serious and organised crime including additional investment in the multi agency National Economic Crime Centre We will pilot new approaches to preventing people engaging in serious and organised crime and build community resilience against it We will establish a new national tasking framework for law enforcement We will improve engagement with the private sector particularly the information and communications technology industry We will also expand our overseas capabilities including establishing a new network of overseas policy specialists The new strategy will align our efforts to tackle serious and organised crime as one cohesive system We will equip the whole of government the private sector communities and individual citizens to play their part in a single collective endeavour Agriculture and Fisheries Council took place in Luxembourg on 15 October

ambition of a 35 reduction by 2030 strengthened incentives for zero and low emission vehicles a strengthened review clause and a continuation of the niche derogation for smaller car manufacturers to

Nationally Determined Contribution NDC by 2020 and signalled the importance of continued collaboration on climate change The UK also supported the inclusion of at least one net zero 2050 scenario in

framework to 2030 and acknowledged that recent increases to the EU s 2030 renewable and energy efficiency targets will have an impact on the EU s level of achievement Ministers expressed that they looked forward to the European Commission s proposal for a Strategy for long term EU greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the objectives and long term goals of the Paris Agreement underlining that the Strategy should include a 1 5 C scenario and at least one pathway towards net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by 2050 The conclusions stressed that the EU is ready to communicate or

Programme My first priority as Home Secretary is to keep the public safe Today I have published a new revised and updated Serious and Organised Crime Strategy The strategy has been laid before Parliament as Command Paper Cm 9718 and copies are available in the Vote Office and on gov uk Serious and organised crime affects more UK citizens more often than any other national security threat Its perpetrators ruthlessly target the most vulnerable ruining lives and blighting communities Their activities cost us at least 37 billion each year and have a corrosive impact on our public services communities reputation and way of life Since the previous strategy was published in 2013 we have made significant progress in creating the powers partnerships and law enforcement structures we need to respond to the threat The law enforcement community and the National Crime Agency in particular has an impressive and sustained track record of pursuing serious and organised criminals and bringing them to justice But the threat we face has grown increasingly complex over the past five years Criminals and networks are quick to exploit the rate of technological change and globalisation whether it is grooming children online using malware to steal personal data or moving illegal goods people and money across borders They have learnt to become more adaptable and resilient Our response must continue to adapt to new challenges The revised strategy follows a comprehensive cross government review led by the Home Office It sets out the government s new approach to prevent serious and organised crime build our defences against it track down the perpetrators from child sex offenders to corrupt elites and bring them to justice We will allow no safe space for these people their networks or their illicit money in our society Our new approach will be to target the highest harm networks and the most dangerous and determined criminals exploiting vulnerable people using all the powers and levers available to the state to deny them access to money assets and infrastructure But we will not achieve our aim through disruption alone We will also work with the public businesses and communities to help stop them from being targeted by criminals and support those who are and we will intervene early with those at risk of being drawn into criminality We will invest at least 48 million in 2019 20 in law enforcement capabilities to strengthen efforts to tackle illicit finance which will enhance our overall response to serious and organised crime including additional investment in the multi agency National Economic Crime Centre We will pilot new approaches to preventing people engaging in serious and organised crime and build community resilience against it We will establish a new national tasking framework for law enforcement We will improve engagement with the private sector particularly the information and communications technology industry We will also expand our overseas capabilities including establishing a new network of overseas policy specialists The new strategy will align our efforts to tackle serious and organised crime as one cohesive system We will equip the whole of government the private sector communities and individual citizens to play their part in a single collective endeavour My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Justice Edward Argar has made the following Written Statement Today I am publishing guidance on How to Apply to Run a Secure School launching the provider selection process for the first school This follows our acceptance of and commitment to delivering Charlie Taylor s Secure Schools proposal in December 2016 and the Secretary of State s announcement on 2 October 2018 of the site for the first Secure School In the Government response to Charlie Taylor s review we committed to tackling violence and improve outcomes for children in custody By creating the first Secure School we are taking a major step towards delivering a truly reformed youth custodial estate that is fit for purpose characterised by the principles set out in the Taylor Review That is Secure Schools will be run by Academy Trusts not for profit organisations that are limited by guarantee With Secure Schools we want to place education and health at the heart of youth custody and create a therapeutic environment for the children in our care It is imperative that the successful provider is driven to work with children in crisis We have worked in partnership with the Departments for Education and Health and Social Care as well as NHS England to achieve a truly cross governmental commitment and approach to reforming youth justice We have also engaged wholeheartedly with a wide range of stakeholders and this has enabled us to benefit from insightful feedback from experts across the youth justice and education sectors This means we can confidently say that the Secure Schools model is shaped by best practice and what we know really works We know that children in custody display a wide range of complex needs so it is crucial that we provide the right type of education support and care to address those needs By empowering Secure School providers to make key decisions like being able to set and adapt the curriculum and timetable to provide meaningful activities we can offer a bespoke service that best meets each child s individual needs Giving providers the autonomy necessary to deliver services in an innovative way is a key part of the Secure Schools vision but they will also be subject to a high level of accountability to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place We are working closely with Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission to establish the inspection regime for Secure Schools and this will be supplemented by monthly independent visitor reviews and independent oversight from organisations such as the Local Safeguarding Children s Board We agree with the importance that David Lammy s Review on The Treatment of and Outcomes for Black Asian and Minority Ethnic individuals in the Criminal Justice System places on addressing disproportionality in the youth justice system With Charlie Taylor s vision of seeing the child first and the offender second we want Secure Schools to enable all students including those from Black Asian and Minority Ethnic backgrounds to have trust in the system and be able to access the meaningful support they need to make sure their offending does not continue into adulthood The decision has been taken to close Medway and reopen it as a Secure School Delivering the first Secure School at this site will provide a fresh start for youth custodial provision in the South East and ensure that provision remains in place in this crucial area of demand The closure will enable us to set up the first school as quickly and cost effectively as possibly and it is a first step towards our future vision for youth custody I would like to pay tribute to the hard work of staff whose work over the last two years has resulted in improvements for people living and working at Medway These were recognised in a recent Ofsted report which praised the care and consideration given by staff to improving Medway Secure School Academy Trusts will be funded in line with the terms set out in a funding agreement They must adhere to this agreement and to the Academies Financial Handbook Academies are also subject to Company Law which requires that they have clear published frameworks for accountability They are also subject to a system of independent audit of their accounts however Secure Schools will be subject to greater financial oversight The How To Apply Guidance is available at

response will be available from the BEIS website at www beis gov uk 1 Details to be provided in the Low Pay Commission s upcoming 2018 reportI would like to make a short statement about parliamentary privilege in the light of representations I have received A robust and healthy democracy such as ours rests upon a number of common and shared features Two of the most important are the freedom for members of the legislature to speak freely without repercussion and respect by the legislature for the independence of the courts and the rule of law As we know this is not the case everywhere in the world The relationship between these two should not be one of conflict but one of mutual respect As parliamentarians we should be keen to respect the proper business of the courts just as we expect the courts to respect the authority of Parliament In particular we should be careful that in exercising our undoubted right to free speech in Parliament we do not set ourselves in conflict with the courts or seek to supplant them My hon Friend the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Small Business Consumers and Corporate Responsibility Kelly Tolhurst has today made the following statement

Secretary of State for International Trade and President of the Board of Trade Dr Liam Fox MP has today made the following statement This Government is committed to establishing the new UK Trade Remedies Authority TRA which will be responsible for providing a safety net to domestic industries after the UK has left the EU We have made significant progress so far The Taxation Cross Border Trade Act 2018 which sets out the trade remedies framework that the TRA will be responsible for delivering received Royal Assent on 13 September 2018 In parallel we are in the process of establishing the TRA as a non departmental public body through the Trade Bill The UK is a strong supporter of free trade But this does not mean trade without rules Trade remedy measures support free trade by ensuring it is also based on rules in accordance with the UK s international obligations to the World Trade Organisation and our traditions We cannot risk leaving UK industry unprotected against these unfair trading practices That is why it is in our national interest to ensure the TRA is established and appropriately staffed in case we do not negotiate a deal prior to the UK s departure from the European Union I hope all opposition parties in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords will give support to the Trade Bill to ensure that no UK industries or parts of the UK are at risk of being left unprotected On 29 March 2018 the Department secured a technical Ministerial Direction to authorise spending on the implementation of the TRA prior to Royal Assent for the Trade Bill in line with the guidance issued by the Permanent Secretaries of HM Treasury and the Department for Exiting the European Union as well as the Written Ministerial Statement from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury in October 2017 We have been focused on ensuring that the TRA has the right leadership in place from the start That is why I am pleased to announce that Sir David Wright the UK s former ambassador to both the Republic of Korea and Japan has been appointed to DIT as TRA Chair Designate Sir David presents an outstanding profile in international and bilateral trade policy having served as the first Chief Executive of British Trade International which later became UK Trade and Investment He also served as Vice Chairman of Barclays Capital from 2003 to 2010 and then subsequently as Vice Chairman of Barclays PLC until his final role as Senior Advisor from 2016 to 2018 Today he is Global Advisor of SMFG Chairman of Skarbek and Chairman of TheCityUK s Japan Market Advisory Group I am confident that Sir David s unique experience in international trade diplomacy and non executive roles make him the ideal candidate Sir David will initially be appointed to DIT as TRA Chair Designate until the Trade Bill receives Royal Assent and the TRA is legally established which is of course subject to the will of Parliament Once this has taken place it is my intention that Sir David be formally appointed as TRA Chair The total length of Sir David s term across both roles will be three years I can also announce that Claire Bassett has been recruited to DIT as TRA Chief Executive Designate Claire offers extensive public body leadership experience having most recently served as Chief Executive of the Electoral Commission Prior to that she has been Chief Executive of the Parole Board for England and Wales and the Criminal Cases Review Commission Once the TRA has been legally established the TRA Chair will be responsible for making a final decision on the appointment of a TRA Chief Executive subject to my approval This is consistent with the appointment powers set out in the Trade Bill I am also pleased to say that the future TRA s wider senior leadership team has also now been recruited to DIT including its Chief Economist Chief Operating Officer General Counsel and Joint Chief Investigators It is our intention that they will be transferred to the TRA once it has been legally established Sir David Claire and the senior leadership team will join the Department s shadow TRA function in its Reading office premises in Northgate House in the near future Located in the heart of Reading Northgate House offers excellent transport links and will enable the TRA to serve the whole of the UK effectively Reading has one of the highest concentrations of relevant skills in the country and this is in addition to having access to Reading s university and leading businesses By securing these office premises now we have ensured that future TRA staff have a location in which to be properly trained in preparation for the UK s exit from the EU and the TRA being legally established through Royal Assent of the Trade Bill This Government is committed to establishing the new UK

European Union I hope all opposition parties in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords will give support to the Trade Bill to ensure that no UK industries or parts of the UK are at risk of being left unprotected On 29 March 2018 the Department secured a technical Ministerial Direction to authorise spending on the implementation of the TRA prior to Royal Assent for the Trade Bill in line with the guidance issued by the Permanent Secretaries of HM Treasury and the Department for Exiting the European Union as well as the Written Ministerial Statement from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury in October 2017 We have been focused on ensuring that the TRA has the right leadership in place from the start That is why I am pleased to announce that Sir David Wright the UK s former ambassador to both the Republic of Korea and Japan has been appointed to DIT as TRA Chair Designate Sir David presents an outstanding profile in international and bilateral trade policy having served as the first Chief Executive of British Trade International which later became UK Trade and Investment He also served as Vice Chairman of Barclays Capital from 2003 to 2010 and then subsequently as Vice Chairman of Barclays PLC until his final role as Senior Advisor from 2016 to 2018 Today he is Global Advisor of SMFG Chairman of Skarbek and Chairman of TheCityUK s Japan Market Advisory Group I am confident that Sir David s unique experience in international trade diplomacy and non executive roles make him the ideal candidate Sir David will initially be appointed to DIT as TRA Chair Designate until the Trade Bill receives Royal Assent and the TRA is legally established which is of course subject to the will of Parliament Once this has taken place it is my intention that Sir David be formally appointed as TRA Chair The total length of Sir David s term across both roles will be three years I can also announce that Claire Bassett has been recruited to DIT as TRA Chief Executive Designate Claire offers extensive public body leadership experience having most recently served as Chief Executive of the Electoral Commission Prior to that she has been Chief Executive of the Parole Board for England and Wales and the Criminal Cases Review Commission Once the TRA has been legally established the TRA Chair will be responsible for making a final decision on the appointment of a TRA Chief Executive subject to my approval This is consistent with the appointment powers set out in the Trade Bill I am also pleased to say that the future TRA s wider senior leadership team has also now been recruited to DIT including its Chief Economist Chief Operating Officer General Counsel and Joint Chief Investigators It is our intention that they will be transferred to the TRA once it has been legally established Sir David Claire and the senior leadership team will join the Department s shadow TRA function in its Reading office premises in Northgate House in the near future Located in the heart of Reading Northgate House offers excellent transport links and will enable the TRA to serve the whole of the UK effectively Reading has one of the highest concentrations of relevant skills in the country and this is in addition to having access to Reading s university and leading businesses By securing these office premises now we have ensured that future TRA staff have a location in which to be properly trained in preparation for the UK s exit from the EU and the TRA being legally established through Royal Assent of the Trade Bill My Honourable Friend the Minister of State for Transport Jo Johnson has made the following Ministerial Statement On 31 August 2018 Crossrail Limited a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London TfL announced a delay to the planned opening of the Elizabeth line Discussions between TfL and Government are underway as to how any additional funding will be provided with London as the primary beneficiary of Crossrail bearing any additional costs via a financing arrangement TfL and the Department for Transport have commissioned an independent review of Crossrail s governance and a separate review on Crossrail s finance and commercial position Today as an interim measure we are announcing that 350m of short term repayable financing will be made available to the Mayor for the year 2018 19 This will ensure that full momentum is maintained behind Crossrail This project is already delivering benefits for the whole of the UK through its cross country supply chain and its UK built train fleet When open Crossrail will be transformative and carry up to 200 million passengers a year delivering 42 billion of investment into the UK economy A further update will be provided once the discussions on the financing arrangements have concluded My Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Housing Communities and Local Government James Brokenshire has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement I am today publishing a consultation on updates to national planning policy and guidance This consultation proposes changes to the standard method for calculating local housing need to ensure consistency with the objective of delivering 300 000 homes per year on average by the mid 2020s whilst providing the clarity that communities need The consultation also proposes clarifications of national planning policy on housing land supply the definition of deliverable sites and appropriate assessment for habitats sites Our reforms are enabling local planning authorities to plan for the right homes in the right places in a way that is open transparent and sustainable for local communities A key part of this is a standard method for assessing housing need This has been introduced to ensure a consistent starting point when understanding how many homes are needed in each local area Recent changes to one of the statistical datasets the standard method relies on has led to confusion and uncertainty in some areas about how many homes are needed This consultation therefore proposes changes to the standard method to ensure consistency with the objective of building more homes whilst ensuring local authorities have the clarity they need to produce local plans This consultation is open until 7 December and I will inform the House of the outcome of the consultation as appropriate My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice David Gauke has made the following Written Statement The Supplement to the Fortieth Annual Report on Senior Salaries 2018 is published today The supplement follows the Senior Salaries Review Body s SSRB Annual and Major Reviews of judicial pay Copies are available from the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office I am grateful to the chairman and members of the Review Body for their work in undertaking these reviews The Government values the vital role played by the judiciary Our judges are the envy of the world They deservedly have the very highest reputation for integrity and independence They deliver justice every day in courts and tribunals across the land without fear or favour and in doing so uphold the rule of law on which our society is founded Beyond that fundamental role the quality and dependability of our judiciary is a critical part of making the UK an attractive place to settle disputes and English law a pre eminent choice for contracts I am pleased therefore to confirm today that members of the judiciary will receive a pay increase of 2 in 2018 19 which is the biggest pay rise for judges in nearly 10 years This award will be backdated to April 2018 In reaching our final position for the 2018 19 pay award the Government has had to balance the need for affordability for the tax payer and future sustainability of public services whilst ensuring that pay awards are fair and consistent across the public sector Therefore the Government has not accepted in full the SSRB s recommended increase of 2 5 The SSRB has also at the Government s request conducted a Major Review of the judicial salary structure This is a comprehensive assessment of the appropriate structure and levels of judicial pay for the future taking into account the need to recruit and retain judicial office holders of the highest calibre In its Major Review report which I am also publishing today the SSRB highlight evidence of a growing recruitment problem at certain key levels within the judiciary notably at High Court and Circuit Bench level The SSRB conclude that these problems are principally occurring because the reward package has become much less attractive to potential applicants and highlight in particular the impact of recent pensions changes on judicial reward The SSRB have made a series of recommendations including that varying levels of pay increase are made across different salary groups with the biggest increases recommended for those judges in salary groups where there is evidence of a recruitment problem and who are in the new Judicial Pension Scheme 2015 The Government takes very seriously the threat that being unable to fill key judicial posts represents to the proper functioning of justice and the UK s wider prosperity We are now carefully considering what changes might be made to the judicial remuneration package to address the particular issues highlighted by the SSRB s Major Review The Government will also be considering the SSRB s recommendations on changes to the current judicial salary structure and their proposals for new pay supplements for those judges who undertake extra leadership responsibilities I can also confirm that the Government will honour its commitment to maintain the recruitment and retention allowance currently paid to eligible High Court Judges until it has responded to the Major Review This Government remains committed to ensuring our courts and tribunals system is as efficient as possible Through our Reform Programme we have already taken important steps towards enabling judges to make the best possible use of their time and I will continue to work towards this objective in partnership with the Lord Chief Justice and Senior President of Tribunals I will make a further statement to the House when I am in a position to set out in full the Government s response to the Major Review The

made the following statement This Government is committed to fairness and equal treatment in all areas of life Families in all their forms are a fundamental element of society and we want to ensure that they are as secure and stable as possible in order for people to flourish Civil partnerships were originally created to enable same sex couples to formalise their relationships at a time when marriage was not available to them Since then we are pleased to have introduced marriage for same sex couples through the Marriage Same Sex Couples Act 2013 However this created a situation whereby same sex couples have the option to either marry or form a civil partnership but opposite sex couples only have the option to marryThe Government has been considering how to equalise access to civil partnerships between same sex and opposite sex couples and on 2 October the Prime Minister announced that the Government will extend civil partnerships to opposite sex couples There are around 3 3million cohabiting couples in the UK almost half of them with children and all of them without the protections and security that a formalised relationship can bring The announcement ensures that in future opposite sex couples will be able to benefit from the protections and security that a civil partnership provides I would like to pay tribute to those who have campaigned for this change over a number of years including my hon friend for East Worthing and Shoreham whose commitment to this cause has laid the foundation for the Government to take forward this important change through his support for the cause of equal civil partnerships and his Civil Partnerships Marriages and Deaths Registration etc Bill currently before the House The changes needed to effect the greater equality we wish to see are not all straightforward and there are a number of questions that arise specifically about opening civil partnerships to opposite sex couples for the first time on which we will need to consult For example whether couples can choose to convert their civil partnership into a marriage or vice versa and what should be the grounds for dissolution of an opposite sex civil partnership We are clear that Government legislation is essential to ensure that these and other consequentials of opposite sex civil partnerships are properly legislated for and adequately debated by this house and in the other place This would not be possible through my Hon Friend s bill as currently amended We intend to consult to enable us to introduce legislation in the next Parliamentary Session to bring about the necessary changes My Right Honourable Friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Mark Field has made the following written Ministerial statement I am announcing today the publication of the recent Tailored Review of Wilton Park an Executive Agency of the Foreign Commonwealth Office Wilton Park convenes discreet dialogue on the UK s strategic foreign policy priorities It has shaped and delivered events since 1946 which link a global network of experts from sectors including academia the military civil society business politicians and diplomats The principal aim of Tailored Reviews which are carried out according to Cabinet Office guidance is to ensure public bodies remain fit for purpose well governed and properly accountable for what they do The full report can be read on gov uk This Review involved consultation with a broad range of stakeholders across the UK and beyond including Wilton Park staff the Wilton Park Board commercial and academic sponsors and a full range of partner organisations The Review reported in September 2018 It found that Wilton Park is functioning well as an organisation It recommended that it should remain an executive agency of the Foreign Commonwealth Office and remain at Wiston House at least until the end of the current lease in 2027 The Review nonetheless contains a number of recommendations to refresh and strengthen Wilton Park s corporate governance A plan to implement all the recommendations by their stated deadlines has been developed and agreed between the FCO and Wilton Park and will be taken forward by officials Copies of the Review will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses On 31 August 2018 Crossrail Limited a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London TfL announced a delay to the planned opening of the Elizabeth line Discussions between TfL and Government are underway as to how any additional funding will be provided with London as the primary beneficiary of

the financing arrangements have concluded My hon Friend the Minister of State for Health Stephen Barclay has made the following written statement Today the Government is introducing the Healthcare International Arrangements Bill This will provide the Government with the powers that are needed to fund and effectively implement arrangements for UK nationals to obtain healthcare abroad after the UK exits the European Union EU Current EU reciprocal healthcare arrangements enable UK nationals to access healthcare when they live study work or travel abroad and visa versa for EU citizens when in the UK They give people more life options support tourism and businesses and healthcare cooperation The UK also has a number of reciprocal healthcare agreements with non EU and EEA countries such as Australia and New Zealand These arrangements ensure that UK nationals living and working in the EU European Economic Area EEA and Switzerland can access healthcare in exchange for paying taxes and social security contributions The UK also funds healthcare abroad for a number of current or former UK residents This includes healthcare for UK state pensioners who spend their retirement in the EU and needs arising healthcare when UK residents visit the EU for holiday or study through the European Healthcare Insurance Card EHIC Scheme The Bill is part of the Government s preparations for EU Exit and will ensure that whatever the outcome of EU Exit the Government can take the necessary steps to continue reciprocal healthcare arrangements or otherwise support UK residents to obtain healthcare when they move to or visit the EU Presently the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care has limited domestic powers to fund and arrange healthcare outside of the UK When the UK leaves the EU the current EU regulations will no longer be part of UK law and new legislation will be needed This Bill confers powers on the Secretary of State to make and arrange for payments to be made in respect of the cost of healthcare provided outside the UK This would allow for the funding of reciprocal healthcare arrangements for UK nationals living in the EU EEA and Switzerland The Bill also confers powers on the Secretary of State to make regulations for and in connection with the provision of healthcare abroad and to give effect to healthcare agreements with other countries or territories both EU and non EU or supranational bodies such as the EU Finally the Bill provides for the lawful processing of data where necessary for purposes of implementing operating or facilitating the operation of reciprocal healthcare arrangements or payments Current healthcare agreements benefit people in all parts of the UK assisting people to obtain healthcare when they are abroad The UK Government is therefore engaging with the devolved administrations to deliver an approach that works for the whole UK in a way that fully respects the devolution settlements The Bill underscores the Government s commitment to reaching a reciprocal healthcare agreement with the EU or where necessary making agreements with Member States and to exploring potential agreements with third countries in the future The Government welcomes the forthcoming scrutiny of the Bill to ensure that it achieves its aims for the continuation of healthcare support for UK nationals in the EU EEA and Switzerland after the UK exits the EU but also enabling the UK to look to the future My right hon Friend the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister for Defence People and Veterans Tobias Ellwood has

Government legislation is essential to ensure that these and other consequentials of opposite sex civil partnerships are properly legislated for and adequately debated by this house and in the other place This would not be possible through my Hon Friend s bill as currently amended We intend to consult to enable us to introduce legislation in the next Parliamentary Session to bring about the necessary changes I wish to apologise for an error made in a written response to a Parliamentary Question asked by the Rt Hon Kevan Jones MP the Member for North Durham The question and answer were as
