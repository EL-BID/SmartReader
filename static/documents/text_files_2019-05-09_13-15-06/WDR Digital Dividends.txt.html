Digital dividends—the broader development benefi ts from using these technologies—have lagged behind. In many instances digital technologies have boosted growth, expanded opportunities, and improved service delivery. Yet their aggregate impact has fallen short and is unevenly distributed. For digital technologies to benefi t everyone everywhere requires closing the remaining digital divide, especially in internet access.</p><p> But greater digital adoption will not be enough. To get the most out of the digital revolution, countries also need to work on the “analog complements”—by strengthening regulations that ensure competition among businesses, by adapting workers’ skills to the demands of the new economy, and by ensuring that institutions are accountable. 3OVERVIEW institutions, amplify the voice of elites, which can result in policy capture and greater state control. And because the economics of the internet favor natural monopolies, the absence of a competitive business environment can result in more concentrated markets, benefi ting incumbent fi rms. Not surprisingly, the better educated, well connected, and more capable have received most of the benefi ts—circumscribing the gains from the digital revolution. and can’t participate in the digital economy in any meaningful way.</p><p> Second, some of the perceived benefi ts of digital technologies are offset by emerging risks (fi gure O.3). Many advanced economies face increasingly polarized labor markets and rising inequality—in part because technology augments higher skills while replacing routine jobs, forcing many workers to compete for low-paying jobs.

The long-term development impact is by no means defi nitive, being continuously shaped by the evolution of technology (connectivity) and the country’s choice of economic, social, and governance arrangements (complements).</p><p>4 Countries that are able to swiftly adjust to this evolving digital economy will reap the greatest digital dividends, while the rest are likely to fall behind (fi gure O.3 and box O.1). The triple complements—a favorable business climate, strong human capital, and good governance— will sound familiar—and they should because they are the foundation of economic development. But digital technologies add two important dimensions. First, they raise the opportunity cost of not undertaking the necessary reforms.</p><p> They amplify the impact of good (and bad) policies, so any failure to reform means falling farther behind those who do reform. With digital technologies, the stakes have risen for developing countries, which have more to gain than high-income countries, but also more to lose. Second, while digital technologies are no shortcut to development, they can be an enabler and perhaps an accelerator by raising the quality of the complements. Online business registries ease market entry for new and innovative fi rms. Well-designed internet-based training helps workers upgrade their skills. New media platforms can increase citizen participation.</p><p> And digital enablers—digital fi nance, digital identifi cation, social media, and open data—spread To maximize the digital dividends requires better understanding of how technology interacts with other factors that are important for development—what the Report calls “analog complements.” Digital technologies can make routine, transaction-intensive tasks dramatically cheaper, faster, and more convenient. But most tasks also have an aspect that cannot be automated and that requires human judgment, intuition, and discretion. When technology is applied to automate tasks without matching improvements in the complements, it can fail to bring broad-based gains. The digital revolution can give rise to new business models that would benefi t consumers, but not when incumbents control market entry. Technology can make workers more productive, but not when they lack the know-how to use it.</p><p> Digital technologies can help monitor teacher attendance and improve learning outcomes, but not when the education system lacks accountability.3 What should countries do? Making the internet universally accessible and affordable should be a global priority. The internet, in a broad sense, has grown quickly, but it is by no means universal. For every person connected to high-speed broadband, fi ve are not. Worldwide, some 4 billion people do not have any internet access, nearly 2 billion do not use a mobile phone, and almost half a billion live outside areas with a mobile signal.</p><p> The unfi nished task of connecting everyone to the internet—one of the targets in the recently approved Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—can be achieved through a judicious mix of market competition, public-private partnerships, and effective regulation of the internet and telecom sector. Access to the internet is critical, but not suffi cient. The digital economy also requires a strong analog Source: WDR 2016 team. Figure O.3 Why digital dividends are not spreading rapidly—and what can be done EFFICIENCY INNOVATIONINCLUSION Accessible Affordable Open and safe INEQUALITYCONTROL CONCENTRATION Reducing risks Spreading benefits Making the internet Digital development strategy Digital technologies Divide Connectivity ComplementsDividends 5OVERVIEW Box O.1 Frequently asked questions: The Report at a glance What is the Report about?</p><p> It explores the impact of the internet, mobile phones, and related technologies on economic development. <a href="#13"><mark>Part 1 shows that potential gains from digital technologies are high, but often remain unrealized.</mark></a> Part 2 proposes policies to expand connectivity, accelerate complementary reforms in sectors beyond information and communication technology (ICT), and address global coordination problems. What are the digital dividends? Growth, jobs, and services are the most important returns to digital investments. The fi rst three chapters show how digital technologies help businesses become more productive; people fi nd jobs and greater opportunities; and governments deliver better public services to all.</p><p> How do digital technologies promote development and generate digital dividends? By reducing information costs, digital technologies greatly lower the cost of economic and social transactions for fi rms, individuals, and the public sector. They promote innovation when transaction costs fall to essentially zero. They boost effi ciency as existing activities and services become cheaper, quicker, or more convenient. And they increase inclusion as people get access to services that previously were out of reach. Why does the Report argue that digital dividends are not spreading rapidly enough?</p><p> For two reasons. First, nearly 60 percent of the world’s people are still offl ine and can’t fully participate in the digital economy. There also are persistent digital divides across gender, geography, age, and income dimensions within each country. Second, some of the perceived benefi ts of the internet are being neutralized by new risks. Vested business interests, regulatory uncertainty, and limited contestation across digital platforms could lead to harmful concentration in many sectors. Quickly expanding automation, even of mid-level offi ce jobs, could contribute to a hollowing out of labor markets and to rising inequality.</p><p> And the poor record of many e-government initiatives points to high failure of ICT projects and the risk that states and corporations could use digital technologies to control citizens, not to empower them. What should countries do to mitigate these risks? Connectivity is vital, but not enough to realize the full development benefi ts. Digital investments need the support of “analog complements”: regulations, so that fi rms can leverage the internet to compete and innovate; improved skills, so that people can take full advantage of digital opportunities; and accountable institutions, so that governments respond to citizens’ needs and demands. Digital technologies can, in turn, augment and strengthen these complements—accelerating the pace of development. What needs to be done to connect the unconnected?</p><p> Market competition, public-private partnerships, and eff ective regulation of internet and mobile operators encourage private investment that can make access universal and aff ordable. Public investment will sometimes be necessary and justifi ed by large social returns. A harder task will be to ensure that the internet remains open and safe as users face cybercrime, privacy violations, and online censorship. What is the main conclusion? Digital development strategies need to be broader than ICT strategies. Connectivity for all remains an important goal and a tremendous challenge.</p><p> But countries also need to create favorable conditions for technology to be eff ective. When the analog complements are absent, the development impact will be disappointing. But when countries build a strong analog foundation, they will reap ample digital dividends—in faster growth, more jobs, and better services. benefi ts throughout the economy and society, further strengthening the interaction between technology and its complements. Digital transformations— digital divides The internet and related technologies have reached developing countries much faster than previous technological innovations. For Indonesia to reap the benefi ts of steamships took 160 years after their invention and for Kenya to have electricity, 60 years; but for Vietnam to introduce computers, only 15 years.</p><p> Mobile phones and the internet took only a few years. More households in developing countries own a mobile phone than have access to electricity or improved sanitation (fi gure O.4, panel a). Greater internet access has led to an explosion in the production and consumption 6 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 nearly 70 percent own a mobile phone. The lowest mobile penetration is in Sub-Saharan Africa (73 percent), against 98 percent in high-income countries. But internet adoption lags behind considerably: only 31 percent of the population in developing countries had access in 2014, against 80 percent in high-income countries.</p><p> China has the largest number of internet users, followed by the United States, with India, Japan, and Brazil fi lling out the top fi ve. The world viewed from the perspective of the number of internet users looks more equal than when scaled by income (map O.1)—refl ecting the internet’s rapid globalization. Connected businesses Internet adoption has increased across businesses in all country income groups. Nearly 9 of 10 businesses in high-income OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries had a broadband internet connection in 2010–14, compared with 7 for middle-income countries and 4 for low-income countries. But adoption rates for more sophisticated technologies such as secure servers, enterprise network, inventory management, and e-commerce are much lower in most developing countries.</p><p> Connected governments Governments are increasingly going digital, and a greater share of government jobs in developing countries is ICT-intensive than in the private sector. By 2014, all 193 member states of the United Nations (UN) had national websites: 101 enabled citizens to create personal online accounts, 73 to fi le income taxes, and 60 to register a business. For the most common core government administrative systems, 190 member states had automated fi nancial management, 179 used such systems for customs processing, and 159 for tax management. And 148 of them had some form of digital identifi cation, and 20 had multipurpose digital identifi cation platforms. So far, developing countries have invested more in automating back-offi ce functions than in services directed at citizens and businesses. The divide in digital access and use persists The lives of the majority of the world’s people remain largely untouched by the digital revolution.</p><p> Only around 15 percent can afford access to broadband internet. Mobile phones, reaching almost four-fi fths of the world’s people, provide the main form of internet access in developing countries. But even then, nearly 2 billion people do not own a mobile phone, and nearly 60 percent of the world’s population has no access to the internet. The world’s offl ine population is of information around the world (fi gure O.4, panel b). But while the internet has reached almost all countries quickly, the intensity of its use has been lower in poorer countries—in large part because it has not spread as widely within those countries.</p><p> And despite many great examples of the uses of new technologies in developing countries, advanced economies have been using them even more effectively.5 Connected people On average, 8 in 10 individuals in the developing world own a mobile phone, and the number is steadily rising. Even among the bottom fi fth of the population, Sources: World Development Indicators (World Bank, various years); WDR 2016 team; http://www .internetlivestats.com/one-second/ (as compiled on April 4, 2015).

Adoption gaps between the bottom 40 percent and the top 60 percent and between rural and urban populations are falling for mobile phones but increasing for the internet. In Africa, the digital divide across demographic groups remains considerable (fi gure O.6, panel a). Women are less likely than men to use or own digital technologies. Gaps are even larger between youth (20 percent) and those more than 45 years old (8 percent).</p><p> IBRD 42010 8 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 government. And their use of e-government is highly uneven—citizens in the top 20 percent of income in the most connected EU country are 45 times more likely to use e-services than those in the bottom 20 percent of income in the least connected EU country (fi gure O.6, panel b). Within countries, greater e-government use by individuals is associated with education, employment, urban residence, being male, and broadband access. How the internet promotes development Digital technologies have dramatically expanded the information base, lowered information costs, and created information goods. This has facilitated searching, matching, and sharing of information and contributed to greater organization and collaboration among economic agents—infl uencing how fi rms operate, people seek opportunities, and citizens interact with their governments.</p><p> The changes are not limited to economic transactions—they also infl uence the participation of women in the labor force, the The increased connectivity has had limited effect in reducing information inequality. For example, there are more contributions to Wikipedia from Hong Kong SAR, China, than from all of Africa combined, despite the fact that Africa has 50 times more internet users.6 The amount of information published on the web, and its origin, often corresponds to what one sees in the offl ine world as well. For instance, 85 percent of the user-generated content indexed by Google comes from the United States, Canada, and Europe, similar to the share of global scientifi c journals originating in these countries. In fact, the information produced and consumed in the digital economy has little bearing on the number of users of digital technologies. Given that nearly one-fi fth of the world’s population is illiterate, the spread of digital technologies alone is unlikely to spell the end of the global knowledge divide.</p><p> Countries that have bridged the digital-access divide often face a new divide in digital capabilities. In the European Union (EU), businesses are more likely than citizens to use the internet to interact with the government. Citizens use e-government mostly for getting information and not for transacting with Sources: World Bank 2015; Meeker 2015; ITU 2015; GSMA, ; UN Population Division 2014. Data at .

In all these cases, a fundamental ease of communication for people with disabilities, and the way people spend their leisure. By overcoming information barriers, augmenting factors, and transforming products, digital technologies can make development more inclusive, effi cient, and innovative (fi gure O.7 and box O.2). Spotlight 1 in the full Report explores the links between these three mechanisms in the broader economic literature.</p><p> The internet promotes inclusion Before the internet arrived, some transactions were so expensive that a market for them did not exist. Two types of transactions fall into this category. First is when two parties to a potentially benefi cial transaction simply didn’t know about each other and faced exorbitantly high search and information costs. Second is when one party had a lot more information than the other. In the economics literature, such situations are known as information asymmetries between buyers and sellers, and in the absence of trust and transparency, many transactions do not take place. By reducing the cost of acquiring information and making more information available transparently, digital technologies can make new transactions possible.</p><p>7 Consider a poor farmer who cannot access credit because the lender has no way to assess Source: WDR 2016 team.

While they make the market more effi cient, the biggest benefi t seems to be their market creation effects: Box O.2 e-commerce with Chinese characteristics: Inclusion, effi ciency, and innovation in Taobao villages The dynamic growth and rapid spread of e-commerce in China is best illustrated by the Shaji phenomenon. The economy of Dongfeng village in Shaji town (Jiangsu Province) shifted from pig farming in the 1980s to plastic waste recycling in the 1990s. In 2006, a migrant from the village returned to open an online shop to sell simple furniture. His success encouraged other villagers to do likewise, and by the end of 2010, the village had 6 board processing factories, 2 metal parts factories, 15 logistics and shipping companies, and 7 computer stores serving 400 households engaged in online sales throughout China and even in neighboring countries.</p><p> Shaji was one of the fi rst “Taobao villages”—named after an online shopping platform run by the Alibaba Group—where at least 10 percent of households are engaged in online commerce.a The Taobao villages, and the rise of e-commerce in China more generally, illustrate how the internet promotes inclusion, effi ciency, and innovation. Inclusion. While the economies of China’s coastal urban areas have grown rapidly over the last three decades, rural and western parts of the country have lagged behind. But China’s large investments in rural connectivity are beginning to pay off . More than 90 percent of villages will have fi xed broadband access by the end of 2015.</p><p> Online commerce has allowed producers in towns and villages to participate in the national and even global economy. At the end of 2014, there were more than 70,000 merchants in 200 Taobao villages, and many more in other rural areas. Most of the stores are small, with an average of 2.5 employees. About one-third of owners are female, and one-fi fth were previously unemployed. About 1 percent are persons with disabilities.</p><p> One of Alibaba’s top “netpreneurs,” confi ned to a wheelchair after an accident, built a thriving online livestock business. Effi ciency. Besides the Taobao e-commerce site for consumers, Alibaba and other Chinese fi rms operate business-to-business platforms. They facilitate intra- and inter-industry trade in China’s already effi cient production sector, as well as exports. They also make it easier for foreign fi rms to sell in China. Consumers benefi t from greater selection and convenience on online retail sites.</p><p> Online trade has not only helped raise rural incomes but also made shopping more effi cient. Purchasing power in rural areas is only about one-third that in cities, but the aggregate consumption of China’s 650 million rural residents is vast, contributing to the national goal of moving from an export- and investment-driven economy to one that is more consumption based. And the boom in online trade has spawned numerous logistics companies that provide quick delivery—sometimes by bicycle in towns and villages. Innovation. Taobao and other e-commerce platforms are examples of innovation generated by the economies of scale that emerge when transaction costs drop drastically. Since these platforms are highly automated, fees can be kept low, and operations are often fi nanced by advertising alone.</p><p> Some problems cannot easily be solved solely by automation, such as creating trust in the market and preventing fraud. Online ratings, escrow services, and confl ict resolution mechanisms address them. One of the most valuable assets Alibaba and other e-commerce operators accumulate is data. Each transaction contributes to better knowledge about the economy and consumer behavior. This information supports new business lines, such as extending credit to small fi rms based on automated evaluations of creditworthiness. This can also advance fi nancial inclusion.</p><p> In early 2015, for instance, Alibaba’s Ant Financial teamed up with the International Finance Corporation to expand credit to female entrepreneurs in China. Sources: WDR 2016 team, based on information from the China State Information Center, China Association for Employment Promotion, and Alibaba company reports. a. . 11OVERVIEW Many internet businesses or services use a platform or “two-sided market” model. The platforms match buyers with sellers or a service user with a provider.</p><p> In a ride sharing service, the platform automatically matches drivers and passengers (innovation), the driver takes advantage of a fl exible income-earning activity not otherwise accessible (inclusion), and the passenger benefi ts from greater convenience and often lower prices (effi ciency). Online crowdfunding, job matching, room sharing, and music sites operate similarly (fi gure O.8). The dividends: Growth, jobs, and service delivery The benefi ts of digital technologies fi lter throughout the economy (fi gure O.9). For businesses, the internet promotes inclusion of fi rms in the world economy by expanding trade, raises the productivity of capital, and intensifi es competition in the marketplace, which in turn induces innovation.</p><p> It brings opportunities to households by creating jobs, leverages human capital, and produces consumer surplus. It enables citizens to access public services, strengthens government capability, and serves as a platform for citizens to tackle collective action problems. These benefi ts are neither automatic nor assured, but in numerous instances digital technologies can bring signifi cant gains. This mechanism operates in two ways. First, the dramatic decline in the price of digital technologies has led businesses and governments to replace existing factors—labor and non-ICT capital—with ICT capital and to automate some of their activities. Airlines use online booking systems to fi ll planes.</p><p> Supermarkets substitute cashiers with automated checkout counters. Manufacturers use real-time inventory and supply chain management systems. And governments invest in information management systems and offer online services for a wide range of tasks—from issuing drivers’ licenses to fi ling taxes. Second, digital technologies augment the factors not substituted and make them more productive. They help managers to better supervise their workers, politicians to monitor the service providers, and workers to use technology to become more productive, thus raising the returns to their human capital. By streamlining tasks and raising the productivity of existing factors, the internet can greatly increase economic effi ciency across fi rms, workers, and governments.</p><p> The internet promotes innovation The extreme case of effi ciency is when transactions are executed automatically, without human input, and transaction costs fall to essentially zero. This is the realm of the “new economy,” such as search or e-commerce platforms, digital payment systems, e-books, streaming music, and social media. The fi xed cost of building the platform may be large, but the marginal cost of carrying out another transaction or adding another user is tiny. This gives rise to increasing returns to scale, which stimulate new business models and provide a major advantage to online fi rms competing with their offl ine counterparts. The zero marginal cost attracts new sellers and buyers to the fi rm’s platform, creating virtuous network effects, where the benefi t to a buyer increases as more sellers join in, and vice versa. An auction site attracts more bidders the more the sellers use it, and a search engine learns and becomes more useful the more searches are performed.</p><p> Scale and zero marginal costs also explain why many of the social network sites have become the preferred vehicles for social mobilization and political protests. By enabling almost frictionless communication and collaboration, the internet can support new delivery models, encourage collective action, and accelerate innovation. The 2016 WDR presents many examples of how the internet promotes inclusion, effi ciency, and innovation. In the internet economy the three mechanisms often operate together. So the one-to-one mapping in fi gure O.7 simplifi es a more complex reality.</p><p> Source: WDR 2016 team.

Isolating the impact of digital technologies is therefore diffi cult at an aggregate level. Firm-level analysis provides a more reliable picture.9 The internet enables many small fi rms to participate in global trade, thus leading to more inclusion; it makes existing capital more productive, raising effi ciency; and by stimulating competition, it encourages innovation.</p><p> Expanding trade The internet enables more products to be exported to more markets, often by newer and younger fi rms. A 10-percent increase in internet use in the exporting country is found to increase the number of products traded between two countries by 0.4 percent. A similar increase in internet use of a country pair increases the average bilateral trade value per product by 0.6 percent.10 Firms selling on eBay in Chile, Jordan, Peru, and South Africa are younger than fi rms in the offl ine markets.</p><p>11 In Morocco, rural artisans, some of them illiterate, sell globally through the Anou crafts platform. At the other end of the spectrum, businesses trade on global e-commerce sites such as Alibaba’s in an online market that could reach more than US$6 trillion over the next fi ve years. Online platforms overcome trust and information problems through feedback and rating systems and by offering escrow and dispute resolution mechanisms. Easier trade of intermediate products encourages further “unbundling” of production processes, not just in the markets for goods but also for services.12 Firms in India, Jamaica, and the Philippines have captured a share of these global markets for services that range from traditional back-offi ce services to long-distance online tutoring. Improving capital utilization Perhaps the greatest contribution to growth comes from the internet’s lowering of costs and thus from raising effi ciency and labor productivity in practically all economic sectors.</p><p> Better information helps companies make better use of existing capacity, optimizes inventory and supply chain management, cuts downtime of capital equipment, and reduces risk. In the airline industry, sophisticated reservation and pricing algorithms increased load factors by about one-third for U.S. domestic fl ights between 1993 and 2007. The parcel delivery company UPS famously uses intelligent routing algorithms to avoid left turns, saving time and about 4.5 million liters of petrol per year.</p><p> Many retailers now integrate their suppliers in The internet can lead to more trade, better capital use, and greater competition The ICT sector is a fairly modest part of the overall economy. Its share in GDP is around 6 percent in OECD member countries and considerably less in developing countries (fi gure O.10, panel a). In the United States, home to 8 of the world’s 14 largest technology companies by revenue, the contribution of the ICT sector to GDP is around 7 percent. The corresponding number for Ireland is 12 percent—a country that does not boast its own Silicon Valley, but attracts many foreign fi rms through its competitive business environment and favorable tax rates. In Kenya, which hosts one of the largest ICT sectors in Africa, the value added share of ICT services in GDP was 3.</p><p>8 percent in 2013. The contribution of ICT capital to GDP growth has been fairly constant over the past two decades. In high-income countries, it has fallen from 0.7 percentage points in 1995–99 to 0.4 percentage points in 2010–14 (fi gure O.10, panel b).</p><p> In developing countries, the contribution of ICT capital to GDP growth has been fairly modest—around 15 percent of growth— refl ecting lower digital adoption. With rapid diffusion of digital technologies into developing countries, this number could rise in the future. In addition, the indirect contributions of ICT capital to economic growth, through improvements in total factor productivity (TFP), could be large as well, although rigorous evidence linking the two is still missing. The rapid adoption of digital technologies in the economy has meant that its benefi ts are widely dispersed and its indirect growth impacts diffi cult to estimate.

Vietnamese fi rms using e-commerce had on average 3.6 percentage point higher TFP growth than fi rms that did not use it (fi gure O.</p><p>11).

And Botswana and Uruguay maintain unique ID and trace-back systems for livestock that fulfi ll requirements for beef exports to the EU, while making the production process more effi cient. Advancing competition When fully automated internet-based services drive marginal transaction costs to zero, the consequences for market structure are somewhat ambiguous. Low marginal costs imply large economies of scale, which favor natural monopolies. In the offl ine world, such sectors—for example, electricity production—often require some form of regulation to protect consumer interests.</p><p> But the characteristics of internet-based services could also encourage competition. Pricecomparison websites, for example, should reduce prices for consumers, even though the evidence shows that price dispersion on the internet persists, in part because companies are getting better at price discrimination—offering different prices to different 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 19 95 –9 9 20 00 –0 4 20 05 –0 9 20 10 –1 4 19 95 –9 9 20 00 –0 4 20 05 –0 9 20 10 –1 4 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Ire lan d Ko re a, Re p.

As governments and the private sector get better at tailoring digital services to the poor, those gains will likely increase.</p><p> Creating jobs The number of direct jobs created by digital technologies is fairly modest, but the number enabled by it can be large. In developing countries, the ICT sector accounts for only about 1 percent of the workforce on average: less than 0.5 percent in Bolivia and Ghana, and just under 2 percent in Colombia and Sri Lanka. In OECD countries, about 3–5 percent of the employment is in this sector. Instagram, a photo sharing app, had just 13 employees in 2012 when it was bought by Facebook for US$1 billion. Facebook had 5,000 employees at the time—compared with 145,000 at Kodak at its peak in photographic fi lm in the 1990s.</p><p> Yet Facebook’s market value is several times what Kodak’s was back then.13 ICT jobs, however, tend to pay well, and each high-tech job generates 4.9 additional jobs in other sectors in the United States.14 In Kenya, the M-Pesa digital payment system creates additional income for more than 80,000 agents. And China’s State Information Center estimates that the recent boom in the country’s e-commerce sector has created 10 million jobs in online stores and related services, about 1.3 percent of the country’s employment.</p><p> New opportunities for entrepreneurship and self-employment are also growing rapidly in the digital economy. The internet’s ability to reduce transaction costs increases opportunities for people who face barriers in fi nding jobs or productive inputs. This promotes inclusion for women, for persons with disabilities, services—reduces startup costs and allows fi rms to add capacity as the need arises, which also reduces risk to investors. Although many internet fi rms seem to operate in separate markets, most if not all compete with offl ine fi rms. Instant messaging apps compete with telecoms, search engines and social media sites compete with traditional media for advertising revenue, e-commerce fi rms compete with brick-andmortar fi rms, and mobile money competes with traditional banks. Innovations triggered by this onlineoffl ine competition generally benefi t consumers, especially when offl ine markets are distorted.</p><p> Transport service companies such as Uber, Lyft, Olacabs, and Didi-Kuaidi Dache have disrupted taxi markets that tend to be overregulated with restricted entry and high prices. Similarly, TransferWise and Xoom have reduced regulatory rents in the fi nancial sector and cut the prices of international currency transfers by up to 90 percent. In Uganda, eKeebo allows independent or amateur chefs to provide and share home-cooked meals, circumventing restaurant licenses. The internet supports job creation and makes workers more productive People have an enormous desire to communicate and connect. The personal welfare gain from having access to digital technology is clearly great. Does it also increase people’s economic opportunities?</p><p> People certainly use mobile phones and the internet more for social purposes than for professional ones. But an emerging literature also indicates that people realize tangible economic benefi ts. Quantifying these benefi ts is diffi cult, but qualitative evaluation of the evidence shows that benefi ts accrue most to those already better off (table O.1). Those who have the skills to leverage Table O.1 Benefi ts of digital technologies for workers and consumers: A scorecard Channel Impact so far Potential impact Poor Nonpoor Poor Nonpoor Creating jobs In the ICT sector and occupations Negligible Negligible In sectors that use ICT Increasing worker productivity Increasing returns to human capital Connecting people to work and markets Benefi ting consumers Increasing consumer surplus Source: WDR 2016 team.</p><p> Note: Poor refers to the bottom 20 percent of the welfare distribution.

The biggest gains from digital technologies for the poor are likely to come from lower information and search costs. Technology can inform workers about prices, inputs, or new technologies more quickly and cheaply, reducing friction and uncertainty.</p><p>15 That can eliminate costly journeys, allowing more time for work and reducing risks of crime or traffi c accidents (box O.4).16 Using technology for information on prices, soil quality, weather, new technologies, and coordination with traders has been extensively documented in agriculture (see sector focus 1 in the full Report). In Honduras, farmers who got market price information via short message service (SMS) reported an increase of 12.5 percent in prices received.17 In Pakistan, mobile phones allow farmers to shift to more perishable but higher return cash crops, reducing postharvest losses from the most perishable crops by 21–35 percent.</p><p>18 The impacts of reduced information asymmetries tend to be larger when learning about information in distant markets or among disadvantaged farmers who face more information constraints.19 Increasing the consumer surplus Where the internet has led to a full automation of services, many jobs have been lost—few travel agents, booksellers, or music store employees are left. But these same dynamics have been a boon to consumers. There are new digital goods and services—such as e-books, digital music, and search engines. And the internet has transformed existing ones—such as taxi and for people in remote areas (box O.3).</p><p> Impact outsourcing brings internet-based jobs to the poor and vulnerable. <a href="#70"><mark>The government of the Indian state of Kerala set up the Kudumbashree project to outsource information technology services to cooperatives of women from poor families; 90 percent of the women had not previously worked outside the home.</mark></a> Samasource and Rural Shores link clients in the United States and the United Kingdom with workers in Ghana, Haiti, India, Kenya, and Uganda. Of global online workers on the Elance freelancing platform, part of Upwork, 44 percent are women, and many wish to balance work and family life. Among respondents to a survey of online workers for this Report, the ability to work fl exible hours from home is considered the greatest advantage of online work. Increasing labor productivity For the economy as a whole, the most profound impact of the internet on individuals is that it makes workers more productive.</p><p> By handing off routine and repetitive tasks to technology, workers can focus on activities with higher value. <a href="#71"><mark>Judicious use of massive open online courses (MOOCs) or online teaching tools like Khan Academy lets teachers spend more time fostering discussion and working with students who fall behind.</mark></a> Researchers can dedicate more time thinking and innovating rather than searching for information or duplicating other people’s work. Managers can work more easily with teams across borders. These benefi ts are largest for the higher skilled. In fact, there has never been a better time to be a high-skilled worker, as the returns to education Box O.</p><p>3 Bridging the disability divide through digital technologies Over 1 billion people around the world have disabilities, and 80 percent of them live in developing countries. Persons with disabilities face barriers to communicate, interact, access information, and participate in civic activities. Digital technologies are helping overcome some of these barriers. Technology enables multiple means of communication—voice, text, and gestures—to access information and engage with others. Voice recognition, magnifi cation, and text-to-speech functionality benefi t persons with visual, cognitive, learning, and mobility disabilities. Short message service (SMS), instant messaging, telephone relay, and video captions reduce communication barriers for persons with hearing and speech disabilities.</p><p> Hands-free navigation and gesture-controlled interfaces assist persons with severe mobility impairments in using digital devices. But the mere existence of technology is an insuffi cient condition to bridge the gaps in the socioeconomic inclusion of persons with disabilities. A supportive ecosystem is needed to drive the implementation of accessible digital technologies. Source: Raja 2015, for the WDR 2016. 16 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 an average of US$50 a month for services it now gets for free on the internet. Time-use data in the United States suggest that the median individual gains more than US$3,000 annually from the internet.</p><p> In Estonia, digital signatures saved 20 minutes per transaction. And a study of the time costs of searching for information shows that the average online search tends to be 15 minutes faster, the results are more accurate and relevant, and the experience more enjoyable than offl ine search in a library. On average, people might realize a consumer surplus as high as US$500 a year from such services, adding up to vast benefi ts when aggregated over all users. The internet can make governments more capable and responsive Governments provide services that are typically nontradable, often lack scale, and are not subject to market competition. Raising effi ciency in the public and hospitality services, health, education, and retail. This has increased the variety of goods and services available, including those for leisure.</p><p> The internet thus enhances consumer welfare, but in ways that are hard to measure. People’s perceptions are that digital technologies have certainly made them better off. In 12 countries surveyed in Africa, 65 percent of people believe that their family is better off because they have mobile phones, whereas only 20 percent disagree (14.5 percent not sure).20 And 73 percent say mobile phones help save on travel time and costs, with only 10 percent saying otherwise. Two-thirds believe that having a mobile phone makes them feel more safe and secure.</p><p> Some studies have attempted to quantify the economic value of these gains. A McKinsey survey of consumers in France, Germany, the Russian Federation, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States in 2010 found that a household is willing to pay Box O.4 Digital dividends and the bottom billion The poor benefi t from digital technologies, but only modestly in relation to the true potential. Nearly 7 of 10 people in the bottom fi fth of the population in developing countries own a mobile phone, improving their access to markets and services. In rural Niger, agricultural price information obtained through mobile phones reduces search costs by 50 percent.a In rural Peru, access to mobile phones boosted household real consumption by 11 percent between 2004 and 2009, reducing poverty by 8 percentage points and extreme poverty by 5.</p><p>4 percentage points.b The poor can benefi t from digital technologies even when they don’t own a mobile phone or a computer. For example, a digital ID, by giving millions of poor people an offi cial identity, increases their access to a host of public and private services. In Narma Dih—a village in Bihar, India, with no electricity or all-weather roads—poor farmers benefi t from digitally enabled agricultural extension services from Digital Green, an NGO (nongovernmental organization) that trains farmers using locally produced how-to videos.c Yet the poor are capturing only a modest share of the digital dividends. While a majority of the poor have a mobile phone, they can’t access or aff ord the internet.</p><p> In Latin America, fewer than 1 in 10 poor households is connected to the internet. In the Central African Republic, one month of internet access costs more than 1.5 times the annual per capita income. Even mobile phones are expensive: the median mobile phone owner in Africa spends over 13 percent of her monthly income on phone calls and texting. And many poor lack the basic literacy and numeracy skills needed to use the internet. In Mali and Uganda, about three-quarters of third-grade children cannot read.</p><p> In Afghanistan and Niger, 7 of 10 adults are illiterate. In advanced economies the poor face the prospects of stagnant wages and fewer opportunities, as they are increasingly forced to compete with those displaced by automation. Digital technologies can also exacerbate socioeconomic disparities. For example, the internet voting on municipal budget proposals in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil and citizen engagement initiatives such as Uganda’s U-report show that the new users are more likely to be male, young, university educated, and wealthy—those already better off before the internet’s advent.d Rapid technological progress will increasingly enable the poor to aff ord and use many digital services. But their ability to reap dividends from these investments will be largely determined by providing the analog complements.</p><p> Source: WDR 2016 team. a. Aker and Mbiti 2010. b.

E-procurement helped India and Indonesia inject more competition into the process by increasing the probability that the winning bidder comes from outside the project’s region. This also improved the quality of infrastructure.</p><p> But a majority of public sector digital technology projects fail to achieve the project objectives, resulting in considerable fi scal waste.22 Digital technologies can also improve management by monitoring the performance of workers. <a href="#82"><mark>A small but growing impact evaluation literature reports generally positive effects of technology-based monitoring on worker absenteeism when combined with other institutional reforms.23 In Uganda, where teacher absenteeism is estimated at 27 percent, head teachers use mobile phones to record attendance and transmit data to a central database that generates weekly reports.</mark></a> Combined with incentive pay for teachers tied to attendance, the program reduced absenteeism by 11 percentage points. The internet also provides real-time data for better planning and management of service facilities.</p><p> In Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, and Zambia, health workers use mobile phones to report counterfeit drugs and stock-outs. Aggregated in a central database and geographically mapped, this information helps administrators address drug and equipment shortages. Providing citizens the opportunity to give specifi c feedback quickly has helped improve performance in many instances. Mobile-phone apps like SeeClickFix and FixMyStreet in the United States and the United Kingdom let users report potholes, graffi ti, and illegal dumping. Governments can report back on fi xes, closing the feedback loop. Internet call centers enabling citizens to report problems and track the status of their requests are now standard in Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Muscat, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul, and Ulaanbaatar, to name a few cities.</p><p> The Nairobi water company uses MajiVoice, and one of the electricity supply companies in the Dominican Republic, EDE Este, uses a similar system to receive complaints, track their resolution through an automated workfl ow, and regularly update citizens on progress. When implemented well, citizens eagerly take up the opportunity to give feedback, and resolution time declines (see fi gure O.12). Advancing voice Governments, particularly those in digitally advanced countries like Estonia, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore, are beginning to take advantage of data analytics and digital platforms for faster, more informed, and integrated policy making. The internet also opens new avenues for participatory democracy. Iceland has experimented with crowdsourcing its constitution, and Brazil and Estonia have explored sector is thus challenging, and one might expect the internet to bring large benefi ts in public service provision.</p><p> There are indeed many examples where the internet has raised the capabilities of the public sector. Better tools for communicating with citizens and providing information also allow greater participation—through inclusion in government assistance programs, or feedback to and monitoring of public offi cials. And the internet helps citizens to connect online and organize for collective action in order to put pressure when government performance falls short of people’s expectations. Expanding participation Lack of identity is an impediment for poor people to exercise their basic democratic and human rights. Where civil registration systems are weak or nonexistent, many of the poor are simply not counted. Digital identifi cation can help overcome barriers to participation.</p><p> Many countries have introduced general- purpose digital identity (ID) schemes or specifi c systems for elections or to manage postconfl ict transfers—with numerous benefi ts, including making the public sector more effi cient. Nearly 900 million Indians have been issued digital IDs in the past fi ve years, which they are using to open bank accounts, monitor attendance of civil servants, and identify recipients of government subsidies. Nigeria’s e-ID revealed 62,000 public sector “ghost workers,” saving US$1 billion annually. But the most important benefi t may be in better integrating marginalized or disadvantaged groups into society. Digital technologies also enable the poor to vote by providing them with robust identifi cation and by curtailing fraud and intimidation through better monitoring. Mobile phones enable citizens to report instances of violence and voter intimidation, improving electoral participation.</p><p> In Mozambique, SMS messages allowed citizens to report electoral irregularities and increased voter turnout by 5 percentage points.21 Ushahidi and Uchaguzi are crowdsourced applications that report and map election violence in Kenya. By multiplying the sources of information, the internet can reduce the risk of media capture and make censorship diffi cult. Improving public sector capability The internet raises effi ciency and productivity through automation and data-driven management. Almost all countries have tried to automate tax and customs administration, as well as budget preparation, execution, and accounting. Results have been mixed.</p><p> E-fi ling reduces tax compliance costs, and one-stop computerized service centers and online portals have 18 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 The risks: Concentration, inequality, and control So, the internet can be an effective force for development. But as the Report documents, the benefi ts too often are not realized, and the internet sometimes makes persistent problems worse. Why? The key insight is that for complex occupations, business activities, or public services, the internet usually can make only a portion of tasks cheaper, more effi cient, or more convenient through automation. Another portion still requires capabilities that humans possess in abundance but computers do not. Many traditional tasks of an accountant or bank teller are now automated, such as making calculations or processing withdrawals.</p><p> Others require complex reasoning or socioemotional skills, such as designing tax strategies or advising clients. Likewise, many public services involving provision of information or routine permissions can be automated. But others, such as teaching or policing, need a high degree of human discretion, tacit knowledge, and judgment. Many problems and failures of the internet surface when digital technology is introduced but the important analog complements remain inadequate. What are these complements? The main ones are regulations that ensure a high degree of competition, skills that leverage technology, and institutions that are accountable (fi gure O.</p><p>13). • When the internet delivers scale economies for fi rms but the business environment inhibits competition, the outcome could be excessive concentration of market power and rise of monopolies, inhibiting future innovation. • When the internet automates many tasks but workers do not possess the skills that technology augments, the outcome will be greater inequality, rather than greater effi ciency. • When the internet helps overcome information barriers that impede service delivery but governments remain unaccountable, the outcome will be greater control, rather than greater empowerment and inclusion. The interplay between internet investments and reforms in complementary areas is at the core of policy debates about technology impacts. A 2008 study by Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz,27 drawing on earlier work by Jan Tinbergen, framed these dynamics in the labor market as a “race between education and technology.</p><p>” As technology progresses, some skills become obsolete. Workers must acquire new participatory lawmaking. By dramatically lowering the cost of communication and coordination, social media can overcome the traditional barriers to citizen collective action. A growing empirical literature has also shown that cellphones and the use of Twitter and Facebook aided protests during the Arab Spring in the Arab Republic of Egypt,24 antiwar demonstrations in the United States,25 and citizen mobilization across Africa.26 Source: WDR 2016 team.

The third potential risk comes from the dominant position of many online platforms and internet intermediaries. Economic history shows that fi rms are tempted to exploit a dominant position. Large internet fi rms may be no exception. The economics of the internet favor natural monopolies,28 and some platforms now dominate their markets. They enjoy such high profi ts that they can quickly capture new markets by buying out competitors or developing a rival service; local startups, including those in developing countries, are left with tiny niche markets.</p><p> Some of the biggest internet fi rms now face scrutiny from regulators. Google, which captures almost one-third of global digital advertising revenue,29 has been investigated for preferential placement of its own products, exploiting third-party content, and exclusionary practices in its placement of advertising.30 Amazon, the largest sales platform for book publishers, has used its market power to enforce its pricing policies. Safaricom, operating the M-Pesa payment system, resisted the entry of competing service providers. The vast amount of identifi able personal information that many of these companies collect raises further challenges (box O.5).</p><p> It is too early to tell whether these problems will diminish the overall economic benefi ts from the internet or be mitigated by the sector’s low entry costs and rapid technological change. Consumers have generally benefi ted from the internet-based business models of existing and new fi rms. Markets are extremely dynamic, so many advantages from scale or moving fi rst may be temporary. And greater size skills that help them become more productive with the help of that technology. Adjustment takes time and will be painful for many, but this is how economies progress. The sections that follow discuss risks and complements in the private sector, in labor markets, and in the public sector.</p><p> Growing concentration: The nexus between regulations and technology One of the main mechanisms for the internet to promote economic growth is competition. Information fl ows increase and speed up so that customers have more choice and can compare prices more easily. Firms that use technology more effectively will do well and force others to follow suit. There is considerable evidence that this is happening throughout the economy, but three potential problems could emerge. First, while the internet has spread quickly in the private sector of some countries, adoption among non-ICT fi rms has been slow in other countries. Larger, fast-growing, skill-intensive, export-oriented, and urban fi rms tend to use digital technologies more.</p><p> The causes of these differences are not well understood. Differences in adoption rates may simply refl ect differences in income, sector characteristics, and management capabilities, but they could also be due to barriers to adoption (fi gure O.14). One possibility is high import duties for digital goods and services in some countries. Another is market distortions and protections that allow fi rms to maintain profi ts without threats from more innovative entrants. For example, fi rms in Mexico that faced competition from China increased the number of computers per employee and became twice as likely to use the internet for purchasing as those that didn’t face signifi cant competition.</p><p> Second, when online businesses enter the turf of their offl ine counterparts, disruption can be great, and regulators are often unsure whether or how to react. Recently, “on-demand economy” fi rms Uber and Airbnb have challenged established taxi and hotel industries. Their platform business model is scalable and global and has spawned numerous local imitators. In cities from Paris to Delhi to Beijing, the reaction has been a scramble by offl ine incumbents to keep these new competitors out, usually by appealing to regulators to enforce established sector regulations such as the knowledge of the city (in the case of London cabbies) or insurance requirements. This can be a valid appeal when regulations protect public safety and ensure minimum service levels. But these new models often succeed because they enter heavily distorted markets with virtual monopolies Source: WDR 2016 team.</p><p> Vested interests Regulatory uncertainty Digital monopoly Analog economy Digital economy (4–5% of GDP; 1–2% of jobs) Figure O.14 Factors explaining the lower adoption of digital technologies by businesses 20 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 Rising inequality: The race between skills and technology If the internet and related technologies promote growth, how are the gains shared in the labor market? While digital technologies raise productivity and enhance overall welfare, labor market disruptions can be painful and can result in higher inequality. Global trends provide some indication. One is that the share of national income that has gone to labor, especially routine labor, has fallen quite sharply in many developing countries—though Brazil and Ukraine are exceptions (fi gure O.15).</p><p>31 Inequality has allows large fi rms to provide services and products at low cost or free of charge, and their high profi ts fuel investments in research and development (R&D). At the same time, it is clear that competition and market structure on the internet are in many ways not so different from the offl ine world. Policies need to ensure that all innovative companies can enter markets and compete on equal terms. Otherwise, the economic performance between fi rms of different size and in different countries could diverge further and contribute to similarly divergent performance of national economies. Box O.5 What Facebook “Likes” reveal—the convenience-privacy trade-off When economists such as George Stigler and Richard Posner wrote about privacy and economics in the early 1980s, they raised many issues debated today, but at that time the “storage and retrieval of information, and its accurate dissemination, [were] often extremely expensive.</p><p>”a Today, an enormous collection of identifi able information is making service delivery more effi cient and more relevant. Service providers can better target or price their products based on known characteristics and preferences. Search engines provide more relevant search results. Health and auto insurers can better price premiums with verifi able information about exercise or driving behavior. And governments can use data systems to reduce the bureaucratic burden for citizens. In Estonia’s e-government system, citizens never have to provide the same information twice.</p><p> The problem is that few people know how these large amounts of data are collected and used—and who controls them. Users are not always aware of and providers often don’t tell what information is collected. The secret snooping by governments can be for legitimate law enforcement reasons, but sometimes violates laws and rights, as the Edward Snowden revelations about spying by the security agencies of the United States, the United Kingdom, and others have shown. <a href="#102"><mark>A consequence has been a new “data nationalism,” where countries are demanding that data about their residents be stored within their territory or favoring domestic technology that may be inferior or more expensive, but is trusted more.</mark></a> Data collectors often sell the data to others. One data broker assembled an average of 1,500 pieces of information about more than half a billion consumers worldwide from information people provided voluntarily on various websites.</p><p> But even easily accessible data such as Facebook “Likes” can predict sensitive characteristics including “sexual orientation, ethnicity, religious and political views, personality traits, intelligence, happiness, use of addictive substances, parental separation, age, and gender.”b And smartphone sensors can infer a user’s “mood, stress levels, personality type, bipolar disorder, demographics (e.g., gender, marital status, job status, age), smoking habits, overall wellbeing, progression of Parkinson’s disease, sleep patterns, happiness, levels of exercise, and types of physical activity or movement.”c The risks? Cybercrime such as identity theft when data stored insecurely fall into the wrong hands.</p><p> Discrimination when customers are charged a higher premium or interest rate, or denied a job based on erroneous information they can’t easily correct. Persistence of dated information that denies protection from embarrassing but irrelevant information or a second chance, which prompted Europe’s “right to be forgotten” ruling. And perhaps most important, reduced trust and thus suboptimal use of the internet. These concerns vary across societies. Fifty-eight percent of Nigerians and 57 percent of Indians believe private information on the internet is very secure, but only 18 percent of French and 16 percent of German respondents do.d Sources: WDR 2016 team, based on Peppet 2014; Castro 2013; Economist 2014; Kosinski, Stillwell, and Graepel 2013.</p><p> a.

CIGI and Ipsos 2014. 21OVERVIEW increased more where this shift in incomes toward capital and away from labor has been higher (fi gure O.16). A number of recent studies have linked technological change to this rising inequality (see chapter 2 in the full Report). A related trend is the polarization—or “hollowing out”—of the labor market, not only in advanced economies, but increasingly also in many developing countries.</p><p> The share of employment in high-skilled occupations is up, as is the share of low-skilled jobs. The share of middle-skilled employment, in contrast, is down in most developing countries for which detailed data are available (fi gure O.17). And these types of jobs are often near the top of the income distribution in low-income countries, as in Africa. A notable exception to these global trends is China, where growing mechanization in agriculture has led to a (perhaps temporary) increase in routine, midlevel labor. Exceptions also include some countries rich in natural resources and commodity exporters, which include several countries in Central Asia and Latin America.</p><p> What explains all this? Machines can increasingly perform routine tasks more quickly and cheaply than humans, and much of what is considered nonroutine today—such as translation, insurance underwriting, or even medical diagnostics—computers might do just as well tomorrow.

But it will likely take longer in lower-income countries. Most of them are still fairly low-tech, with only about onethird of urban jobs in a sample of developing countries using any ICTs at work. And wage rates are still low, with a larger share of manual nonroutine labor, so investments in technology will be less profi table for fi rms. This does not mean, however, that lower income countries need not pay attention to these trends.</p><p> Most important, even without signifi cant employment shifts, the nature of jobs is changing toward skills that remain hard for technology to emulate: that is, advanced cognitive and socioemotional skills. The policy response, besides rethinking social protection systems, is better and more responsive education and training—areas where reforms take many years to pay off. It is important to keep in mind the historical perspective that job displacement and job losses from technological change are an integral part of economic progress. <a href="#111"><mark>It is precisely rising productivity—as technology replaces some human labor but augments the skills of remaining and new workers—that generates agriculture or the automation of manufacturing, the internet affects well-paying white-collar jobs even more than blue-collar jobs.</mark></a> Some mid-level workers will have additional skills that allow them to switch to better-paid nonroutine occupations in which technology tends to augment human capital and make skilled workers more productive. These workers will gain from technological disruption.</p><p> In developing countries, returns to education are highest among those with tertiary education, and they are higher and rising faster in ICT-intensive occupations.32 Those who do not have such skills will need to seek work in lower-skilled, nonroutine occupations, such as janitorial services, hospitality, or personal care. Demand for such services could increase, but perhaps not enough to prevent downward wage pressure as the available workforce in these sectors grows. These dynamics are consistent with the rising returns to education and income inequality we see in many countries. The implications for developing countries depend on the pace of technological disruption. The share of occupations that could experience signifi cant automation is actually higher in developing countries Sources: WDR 2016 team, based on ILO KILM (ILO, various years); the International Income Distribution database (I2D2; World Bank, various years); National Bureau of Statistics of China (various years).</p><p> Data at .

It also reduces the need for humans to do physically hard, repetitive, or dangerous work. Such trends will be welcome in countries that are rapidly aging or where the population is declining, or in professions where skills are in short supply.</p><p> Telemedicine and automated diagnostics, for instance, allow medical experts to serve many more people, even remotely in areas with a shortage of doctors. And fears of “technological unemployment” go back to the industrial revolution. Even such thinkers as the economist John Maynard Keynes and the writer Isaac Asimov submitted to this fallacy. Keynes, in the 1930s, predicted 15-hour workweeks by the end of the 20th century, and Asimov, in a 1964 essay, expected that one of the most pressing problems for humanity by 2014 would be boredom “in a society of enforced leisure.” Yet over the centuries, economies have adapted to massive changes in labor markets— the largest by far, being the shift out of agriculture. In 1910, there were 12 million farmworkers in the United States.</p><p> One hundred years later, there were only 700,000 in a population more than three times larger. Still, nobody can predict the full impact of technological change in coming decades, which may be faster and broader than previous ones. What is clear, however, is that policy makers face a race between technology and education, and the winners will be those who encourage skill upgrading so that all can benefi t from digital opportunities. Engendering control: The gap between institutions and technology The internet was expected to usher in a new era of accountability and political empowerment, with citizens participating in policy making and forming self-organized virtual communities to hold government to account. These hopes have been largely unmet. While the internet has made many government functions more effi cient and convenient, it has generally had limited impact on the most protracted problems—how to improve service provider accountability (principal-agent problems) and how to broaden public involvement and give greater voice to the poor and disadvantaged (collective action problems).</p><p> Whether citizens can successfully use the internet to raise the accountability of service providers depends on the context. Most important is the strength of existing accountability relationships between policy makers and providers, as discussed in the 2004 World Development Report, Making Services Work for Poor People. An examination of seventeen digital engagement initiatives for this Report fi nds that of nine cases in which citizen engagement involved a partnership between civil society organizations (CSOs) and government, Lit hu an ia Uz be kis tan Ma lta O EC D Mo ng oli a Ky rg yz Re pu bli c La tvi a Cy pr us Se yc he lle s Ta jik ist an Bu lga ria Do m ini ca n Re pu bli c Ge or gia Ur ug ua y Cr oa tia Pa ra gu ay W es t B an k a nd G az a Uk ra ine Ar ge nti na Ni ge ria Pa na m a Ni ca ra gu a Se rb ia So uth A fri ca Bo liv ia Ma ur itiu s Ma lay sia Ma ce do nia , F YR Co sta Ri ca Ec ua do r Ro m an ia Ind ia Th ail an d Al ba nia An go la El Sa lva do r Gu ate m ala Ba ng lad es h Ch ina Ca m bo dia Ne pa l Eth iop ia 0 20 40 60 80 100 Sh ar e of e m pl oy m en t t ha t c an be c om pu te riz ed (% ) Adjusted (technological feasibility + adoption time lags) Unadjusted (technological feasibility) 24 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 Grande do Sul, online voting increased voter turnout by 8 percentage points, but online voters were disproportionately wealthier and more educated (fi gure O.19). Even in developed countries, engaging citizens continues to be a challenge. Only a small, unrepresentative subset of the population participates, and it is often diffi cult to sustain citizen engagement.</p><p> There is no agreement among social scientists on whether the internet disproportionately empowers citizens or political elites, whether it increases polarization, or whether it deepens or weakens social capital, in some cases even facilitating organized violence. The use of technology in governments tends to be successful when it addresses fairly straightforward information and monitoring problems. For more demanding challenges, such as better management of providers or giving citizens greater voice, technology helps only when governments are already responsive. The internet will thus often reinforce rather than replace existing accountability relationships between three were successful (table O.2). Of eight cases that did not involve a partnership, most failed.</p><p> This suggests that, although collaboration with government is not a suffi cient condition for success, it may well be a necessary one. Another ingredient for success is effective offl ine mobilization, particularly because citizen uptake of the digital channels was low in most of the cases. For example, Maji Matone, which facilitates SMS-based feedback about rural water supply problems in Tanzania, received only 53 SMS messages during its fi rst six months of operation, far less than the initial target of 3,000, and was then abandoned. Political participation and engagement of the poor has remained rare, while in many countries the internet has disproportionately benefi ted political elites and increased the governments’ capacity to infl uence social and political discourse. Digital technologies have sometimes increased voting overall, but this has not necessarily resulted in more informed or more representative voting.

Closing the gap between changing technology and unchanging institutions will require initiatives that strengthen the transparency and accountability of governments. Making the internet universal, aff ordable, open, and safe First-generation ICT policies involving market competition, private participation, and light-touch regulation have led to near-universal access and affordability of mobile telephony, but have so far been less successful in spreading internet services. Much of the explanation lies in continued policy failures such as regulatory capture, troubled privatizations, ineffi cient spectrum management, excessive taxation of the sector, and monopoly control of international gateways. At the same time the absence of global consensus in dealing with the next-generation issues— such as privacy, cybersecurity, censorship, and internet governance—is resulting in more circumspect and diverse approaches to regulating the internet (box O.7 and fi gure O.</p><p>20). Supply-side policies: Availability, accessibility, and aff ordability A useful framework for analyzing supply-side ICT policies is to consider the value chain that stretches from the point where the internet enters a country (the fi rst mile), passes through that country (the middle mile) to reach the end user (the last mile), and certain hidden elements in between (the invisible mile). • The fi rst mile can be improved by liberalizing the market for satellite dishes and eliminating monopoly status over the international gateway and cable landing stations. • Strengthening the middle mile involves liberalizing the market for building and operating backbone networks, encouraging open access to the incumbent’s network, requiring all major infrastructure programs (such as roads, railways, pipelines, and energy distribution) to include provision for an optical fi ber link, setting up internet exchange points, and creating local caches for frequently used content. • Government policies can encourage the provision of last mile connectivity by permitting competing facilities, especially for intermodal competition (between cable, wireless, and digital subscriber line), and mandating the incumbent to make local access lines available to competitors at wholesale prices (local loop unbundling). • The most critical portion of the invisible mile involves spectrum management, which requires increasing the amount of spectrum available, ensuring competitive access, encouraging sharing of essential facilities, such as radio masts, and liberalizing the market for spectrum resale.</p><p> In addition to pure ICT policies, almost everything that the private sector, citizens, or governments do on the internet requires some essential building blocks (box O.8). Demand-side policies: Open and safe internet use The challenges facing internet stakeholders today are as much about how networks are used (demand) as how they are built (supply). Global interconnectedness introduces new vulnerabilities in areas where coordination mechanisms are weak, still evolving, or based on nongovernment models. Threats to cybersecurity, and censorship are undermining confi dence and trust in the internet and increasing costs to businesses and governments, resulting in economic losses Source: WDR team, based on Spada and others 2015.

An early internet pioneer, John Gilmore, claimed, “the Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.”a And Bill Clinton in 2000 said, “trying to control the internet is like trying to nail Jell-O to a wall.</p><p>”b Yet private software vendors and state institutions have fi gured out ways to censor access to internet content, whether by shutting down the entire national web domain, as the Arab Republic of Egypt did in 2011 for fi ve days; by preventing access to specifi c domestic or foreign websites; or by targeting individuals’ blog posts or other social media postings. Google received 6,951 requests from governments in 2013 to remove content from search results, with the largest numbers from Turkey, the United States, and Brazil. Other countries, including China and the Islamic Republic of Iran, block Google and some other internet sites completely, although such restrictions may change in the future. Governments of all types restrict access to content such as child pornography, hate speech, insults, or criticisms of authority fi gures, challenges to cultural or religious morals, or reporting of uprisings or accidents. When accountable governments determine what should be censored, the result refl ects broad societal preferences. In autocratic countries, where use of the internet in government is often as high as in democratic countries (fi gure BO.</p><p>6.1), leaders face a dilemma. If they permit open discourse on the internet, they risk challenges to their authority. If they do not, they risk isolating themselves from the global information economy. This is a balancing act, and countries are becoming more sophisticated in calibrating their control—for example, censoring content that might encourage collective action, but not individual criticism. Internet fi ltering and censorship impose welfare and economic costs.</p><p> First, the cost of censoring or fi ltering internet content diverts public funds from other uses. Monitoring domestic internet traffi c and selectively blocking foreign websites requires large fi nancial resources, technical knowhow, and dedicated staff —all of which could be deployed for more productive tasks. Second, fi ltering and methods to circumvent it can slow the speed of internet access, which hurts business users. Third, fi ltering can restrict access to economically or scientifi cally useful information, such as the Google Scholar search engine for academic papers— indispensable in universities and labs.

Box O.</p><p>7 Is the internet a public good? The internet does not have all of the characteristics of a pure public good. Access to the internet often requires a fee, so individuals can be eff ectively excluded from its use. But once on the internet, the consumption of information by one user does not reduce its availability to others, so in that sense it is nonrivalrous (although capacity constraints can slow down access). One way to describe the internet is as a club good that is excludable but nonrivalrous, similar to cable television; or if bandwidth is scarce, as a private good with strong positive externalities—everyone benefi ts as more people come online. As more essential services and information migrate to the web, anyone without access almost becomes a second-class citizen.</p><p> And all citizens benefi t when everyone else is better informed and when public services are provided electronically at lower cost. The private sector should take the lead in providing internet infrastructure and services because the business case is usually compelling. But public investment or intervention is sometimes justifi ed where the private sector is unable to provide aff ordable access. Historical precedents include the United States Communications Act of 1934, which called for universal “wire and radio communication service,” even in remote rural areas. Some countries have gone further. Finland, for example, has defi ned access to the internet at broadband speeds as a legal right and pursues a universal access policy.</p><p> Source: WDR 2016 team. (Box continues next page) Box O.8 The four digital enablers The WDR 2016 looks at how the internet increases productivity of businesses, opportunities for people, and the eff ectiveness of governments. Across these domains, four major enablers of digital development are critical. Four spotlights in the Report discuss their benefi ts and potential risks. Digital fi nance.</p><p> Banks have been early and eager adopters of digital technologies, but many of the major innovations, such as online payments, mobile money, and digital currencies, have come from nonbank institutions, including telecom and internet companies. Some of these innovations took root fi rst in developing countries, where they overcame shortcomings in traditional fi nancial systems. Their benefi ts are distributed widely. Secure online payments fuel e-commerce. Electronic transfers reduce the cost of sending remittances. Peer-to-peer lending can vastly improve the fi nancial access of startups.</p><p> Governments can make payments and social transfers at lower cost and with less fraud and leakage. However, if fi nancial regulations don’t keep pace with the rapid technological progress, these innovations could risk aff ecting the stability of the overall system. Social media. Social networks are fundamental to human society, and digital technologies have accelerated their formation. More than one-fi fth of the world’s population is now believed to be a member of one or more social media platforms. These platforms have been credited with facilitating economically benefi cial interactions, channeling users’ 28 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 Supply side Censorship and content filtering First mile Middle mile Last mile Invisible mile Cybersecurity Online privacy Internet governance Open-access ecosystem for innovation, tech hubs, and maker spaces Multistakeholder approach Global cooperation Awareness and investment Competition policies Effective regulation New technologies Public-private partnership Demand side Universalizing connectivity Figure O.</p><p>20 A policy framework for improving connectivity Source: WDR 2016 team. behavior in ways that are consistent with development, providing a platform for information and dissemination during natural disasters and emergencies, and encouraging political mobilization and social change. Some analysts think that social media played a critical role in recent events such as the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street, and thereby were instrumental in spreading democratic ideas, although many remain skeptical of their actual impact. There is still much to learn about the role social media can play in development. While a source for innovative ideas, social media also remain conduits for gossip, slander, misinformation, harassment, bullying, and crime. One important lesson is that the impact of social media on development seems to be highly specifi c to context.</p><p> Variation in access to technology, education, and broader sociopolitical context matters. For instance, there is evidence that people in more autocratic countries are less likely to forward information (for example, by re-tweeting it). Digital identity. Being able to prove who you are may seem trivial, but it can be transformational for those excluded from jobs and services. Simple electronic identifi cation systems, often using biometric characteristics, have become an eff ective platform for secure bank transactions, voting, accessing social services, paying utility bills, and much more. Many countries, from Moldova to Nigeria and Oman, have introduced digital IDs.</p><p> India is on track to register its entire population using its Aadhaar digital ID. In Estonia and other countries, thousands of diff erent types of public and private transactions are verifi ed with a unique electronic ID system, including legally binding contracts and voting in national elections. Data revolution. In harnessing data for development, attention focuses on two overlapping innovations: “big data” and open data. Big data are voluminous or fast, and they come from myriad sources—from satellites to sensors and from clouds to crowds. Big data analytics is being deployed to improve traffi c planning, estimate macro aggregates (also referred to as “nowcasting”), track the spread of epidemics, and improve credit scoring and job matching.</p><p> Open data are those that are freely and easily accessible, machine-readable, and explicitly unrestricted in use. Governments are, or could be, the most important source of open data. Exuberant estimates of the current and potential economic value of big data and open data range from hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars per year. <a href="#143"><mark>Yet sustained, impactful, scaled-up examples of big data and open data in developing countries are still relatively rare.</mark></a> Most big data are in private hands—large telecom and internet companies—which are reluctant to share it for fear of jeopardizing customer privacy or corporate competitiveness. Public agencies, too, are reluctant to share data, even when they have large public benefi ts.</p><p> For example, of countries surveyed by the Open Data Barometer, one-third of the high-income countries and 85 percent of developing countries had made little or no progress in opening map data. <a href="#144"><mark>Reasons include lack of technical skills, inadequate resources, and unwillingness to expose data to scrutiny.</mark></a> Box O.8 The four digital enablers (continued) 29OVERVIEW • Workers, entrepreneurs, and public servants who have the right skills to take advantage of opportunities in the digital world • An accountable government that effectively uses the internet to empower its citizens and deliver services. What these priorities highlight is that core elements of the development agenda—business regulations that ease market entry, education and training systems that deliver the skills that fi rms seek, and capable and accountable institutions—are becoming more important with the spread of the internet. Not making the necessary reforms means falling farther behind those who do, while investing in both technology and its complements is the key to the digital transformation.</p><p> Internet use still varies greatly between countries, as does the quality of complements, and both tend to move up with income (fi gure O.21). Policy priorities change as countries move along the digital transformation (fi gure O.22). Countries where internet use is still low should lay the foundation—such as removing barriers to internet access and adoption, promoting basic and digital literacy, and using the internet for elementary government functions like provision of information. As countries transition to higher levels as well as higher security spending.</p><p> For privacy and data protection, different countries are taking quite different approaches. That makes it harder to develop global services. Ensuring safe and secure access will require enhanced international collaboration, based on a multistakeholder model. Analog complements for a digital economy The internet has great potential to promote economic development, but only some of that potential has so far been realized. It disrupts established markets for products, services, and labor, and it disrupts the public sector—major reasons for the frequent reluctance to adopt and deploy the internet more broadly. But the benefi ts will come to those who embrace the changes the internet brings, not to those who resist them.</p><p> And the way to get internet-enabled inclusive growth without long-term disruption is to strengthen the analog complements of digital investments (box O.9). Three policy objectives emerge from the analysis in the Report: • A business environment where fi rms can leverage the internet to compete and innovate for the benefi t of consumers Box O.9 Technology and complements: Lessons from academic research Recent research on growth, labor markets, and governance has taken a fresh look at the interplay between technology and other factors. These insights inform the discussion of policy priorities in this Report. Rules.</p><p> Technology interacts with rules (such as regulations and standards) to create new ideas, such as new ways of producing goods and services. Technology is traded across markets and borders, while most rules are established locally. <a href="#148"><mark>When it encounters rules that do not match, technology fails to deliver the expected benefi ts.</mark></a> New businesses can acquire internet technology to reduce prices and increase convenience for consumers, but they will not be able to enter the market and compete if local regulations protect incumbents. Skills. Technology interacts with workers’ skills.</p><p> It allows routine tasks to be automated. Workers with the right abilities will leverage technology to become more productive. Consider a modern offi ce assistant who uses digital technologies to perform routine tasks quickly, and now spends far more time on personal interaction, complex scheduling, and other tasks that computers cannot easily perform. Institutions. Technology interacts with discretion. Many tasks in government can also be automated, but others involve a high degree of judgment.</p><p> That means that even as the internet can make many public service functions more effi cient, the benefi ts will be limited when government offi cials and workers do not have the incentives to use the technology for the public good. Teacher attendance can be fairly easily monitored using digital technologies, but the quality of teaching depends on the teacher’s training, resources, ability, and motivation.

Regulations that promote competition and entry Digital adoption by fi rms varies among countries, and there are reasons for it to be slow. Most fundamentally, adoption requires knowledge about the technology, access to it, and knowledge of how to best apply it.</p><p> But the most important driver is competitive pressure, as fi rms adopting new technology of internet use, they require effective competition regulation and enforcement—including easy fi rm entry and exit; a greater focus on advanced cognitive and socioemotional skills that are augmented by technology; and effective e-government delivery systems for provider management and citizen engagement. Countries in advanced stages of the digital transformation need to tackle some of the most challenging tasks. They need to fi nd ways to facilitate “new economy” competition, to ensure lifelong learning and respond to the changing nature of work, and to use Figure O.21 The quality of complements and technology rises with incomes Source: WDR 2016 team.

Similarly, complements is the average of three subindicators: starting a business; years of education adjusted for skills; and quality of institutions.

And to allow more innovative companies to enter markets easily, countries need to improve fi rm registration and create greater market transparency to reduce price collusion, market sharing, and rigged public procurement. E-government systems such as online business registration and e-procurement systems can simplify these processes and produce more openness. Increase competition through eff ective regulation and enforcement State control in economic sectors, barriers to entrepreneurship, and restrictions on trade and investment reduce the incentives for fi rms in protected sectors to use digital technologies. Most countries have a competition authority, although many were set up fairly recently and enforcement varies, especially when the state or politically connected fi rms benefi t from market restrictions.</p><p> Moreover, the internet makes it easy to deliver services online from anywhere in the world, so how trade in services is regulated becomes increasingly important. Ethiopia, India, and Zimbabwe have the greatest restrictions on service trade, but many other countries restrict specifi c services such as legal or accounting tasks. Countries can increase the competitiveness of their economies and encourage greater use of digital technologies by gradually reducing market distortions while building up effective competition enforcement. This applies as raise productivity and those who don’t fall behind. This highlights the critical role of a country’s business climate. It includes laws and regulations that ensure easy entry and exit of fi rms, and an open trade regime that exposes companies to foreign competition and investment.</p><p> There is a political economy dimension to this as well—special interests infl uence regulators to keep markets closed to competition. This lessens the need for fi rms to reach for the technological frontier. Where banks are heavily regulated and protected from new market entrants, they have less incentive to invest in effi ciency-boosting technology that might also help them serve customers better or reach new ones. But competition policy and enforcement are complex, and many low-income countries lack capacity to design and implement them effectively. Lower the barriers to digital adoption In countries where the digital economy is still emerging, the priority is to facilitate connectivity and develop the foundation for effective competition regulation. Although 74 mostly middle- and high-income countries have unilaterally removed tariffs on ICT capital goods, computers and smartphones are still treated as luxury goods in some countries, including Turkey, where taxation adds almost half to the price of mobile handsets.</p><p>33 Djibouti’s tariff on computers is 26 percent. Many countries treat their telecom fi rms as cash cows. Where fi rms may have limited knowledge about how the internet can improve their business, Note: ICT = information and communication technology.

Skills for the digital economy Technological change means that many routine tasks will soon be done by machines.</p><p> In contrast to previous episodes, the internet will also make many tasks carried out in white-collar jobs redundant. This puts a premium on different types of skills that automation complements rather than replaces (fi gure O.23). Education systems have been slow to respond to this challenge. <a href="#160"><mark>Furthermore, the pace of change is fast, and the types of skills in demand change quickly.</mark></a> So workers will have to upgrade their skills frequently throughout their careers.</p><p> These dynamics already play out in many transforming and some transitioning countries, but even for emerging countries it is not too early to prepare. Start early with foundational skills Skills development starts at birth and lasts a lifetime. Good parenting and early stimulation prepare children for school, where cognitive and socioemotional foundations are laid. Technology can play a role. Even though the record on simply providing laptops or tablets to students is mixed, videoconferencing with English speakers from the Philippines has improved learning among fi rst graders in Uruguay. Khan Academy provides resources for independent learning, and using a gaming approach to math teaching benefi ted grade four children in Mumbai.</p><p> But in these and many other cases, one factor was more important: the quality of teaching. It is no coincidence that Finland, one of the most connected and best-performing countries in educational testing, uses very little technology in the classroom. It takes time to improve the quality of teachers, much to traditional businesses that use the internet as to internet platforms (box O.10). Tailor “new economy” regulations to ensure competition Internet fi rms create new business models and change market structure, posing new challenges for regulatory authorities. On-demand economy fi rms like Uber and Airbnb scaled up traditional ride sharing and subletting to a global scale.</p><p> But regulators struggle to determine whether these companies are taxi or hotel companies or simply software providers. Offl ine competitors complain that they do not follow the same regulations. Where these industries tend to be overregulated and their markets distorted, as is often the case in the taxi business, this new competition can encourage a general overhaul of the industry. In the United States, cities like New York and states like Massachusetts have begun to develop appropriate regulations for these platforms, imposing safety and tax obligations but also reducing their competitors’ regulatory burdens. Similar regulatory puzzles are posed by fi rms such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google. For example, Google is known as a search engine company but is better described as an advertising fi rm.</p><p> These fi rms confound conventional competition law because they do not act as traditional monopolies. Their services are often free to consumers. But given their dominance in the markets for online ads and books, they have considerable leverage over marketers and booksellers. This is similar to credit card companies’ position with respect to retailers. Research by economists such as Jean Tirole has shown that regulations in such industries must be carefully tailored to guarantee competition and avoid harm to consumers. These are very challenging problems, and most pressing in the transforming countries.</p><p> Developing countries Box O.10 Opening the M-Pesa mobile money platform to competition Safaricom’s mobile money system is a well-known success story. It was able to grow quickly because Kenya’s banking regulators initially decided to take a hands-off approach. For seven years, Safaricom maintained a dominant position through exclusivity agreements locking agents into the system. Initially such arrangements were perhaps justifi ed because Safaricom incurred high costs developing the system. But in 2014, Kenya’s Competition Authority changed the rules and opened the system to alternative mobile operators.</p><p> The transaction cost of transfers of up to K Sh 500 (US$4.91) fell from K Sh 66 to K Sh 44 (US$ 0.43). Source: Plaza, Yousefi , and Ratha 2015, for the WDR 2016. 33OVERVIEW that traditional education systems do not teach and that are hardest to measure. Many countries are rethinking their approach.</p><p> Singapore is moving from a fairly rigid “effi ciency driven” model that tried to get the best results from inputs (teachers and fi nance) to an “ability driven” model that emphasizes project work and fewer assessments in place of frequent testing. Colombia’s Escuela Nueva model, now serving 5 million students in 16 countries, also focuses on group learning and problem solving. These approaches change the relationship between teacher and student. No longer simply sources of information, teachers now must instruct students in how to fi nd information and apply it in a new and unexpected context. This requires changes in teacher training. There are many examples of how digital technologies can assist teachers and students—by allowing group however.</p><p> But technology can help here as well, as Rio de Janeiro’s Educopedia platform shows (box O.11). <a href="#168"><mark>Using technology to closely guide teaching is a second-best option that can improve learning outcomes at modest cost where teacher training is unlikely to improve quickly.</mark></a> This is the model used by the for-profi t Bridge Academy in Kenya and elsewhere, where scripted instruction and automated administrative tasks help provide education at low cost. Although yet to be evaluated rigorously, such approaches hold promise to improve education. Rethink curricula and teaching methods Today’s education systems need to prepare students for a career and not only a job.</p><p> Modern labor markets require creativity, teamwork, problem solving, and critical thinking in ever-changing environments—skills Cognitive Literacy, numeracy, and higher-order cognitive skills (for example, reasoning and creative thinking) Raw problem-solving ability versus knowledge to solve problems Verbal ability, numeracy, problem solving, memory, and mental speed Social and behavioral Socioemotional skills and personality traits Openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeability, and emotional stability Self-regulation, grit, mind-set, decision making, and interpersonal skills Technical Manual dexterity and the use of methods, materials, tools, and instruments Technical skills developed through postsecondary schooling or training or acquired on the job Skills related to specific occupations (for example, engineer, economist, IT specialist) Source: WDR 2016 team, adapted from Pierre, Sanchez Puerta, and Valerio 2014.

It now serves almost 700,000 students. It has yet to be formally evaluated, but together with other reforms it likely contributed to a more than 20-percent increase in the Basic Education Development Index in middle schools between 2009 and 2012. And 80 percent of Rio’s students agreed that Educopedia helps their learning eff orts. Source: Bruns and Luque 2014. 34 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2016 Improve informational services and monitoring Although internet access is still low in many emerging economies, mobile phones are widespread and have great potential for improving services.</p><p> In the health sector, simple mobile phone–based reminders for taking medications have been effective for HIV patients in Malawi and for providing maternal health information in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Phones can support the monitoring of teachers or other government workers where absenteeism is a problem, even if monitoring alone is insuffi cient to improve service quality or outcomes (box O.12). Monitoring also becomes important in provision by nonstate entities in weak institutional contexts, where for-profi t or non-profi t organizations deliver services often funded by the government. And digital technologies can improve electoral accountability. In Afghanistan, Kenya, and Mozambique, election monitoring using cellphones helped uncover fraud and reduced election violence.</p><p> This can complement— or, even in low-capacity settings, replace—more demanding approaches such as biometric identifi cation (see spotlight 4 in the full Report). Strengthen e-government delivery and citizen engagement Where investments to automate government service delivery have advanced, complementary improvements in regulations, interdepartmental cooperation, and streamlining become more important. Rather than just replicating cumbersome processes such as business regulations online, automation provides an opportunity for simplifying steps, increasing the impact as well as the transparency. E-procurement systems reduce the risk of corruption, but countries have invested less in them than in more complex budget or treasury systems. With greater internet use in a country, the scope for work among classrooms connected online, apps that stimulate creativity and problem solving, and games designed for education (“gamifi cation”). Develop advanced technological skills and encourage lifelong learning As more and more parts of the economy rely heavily on the internet, demand for advanced ICT skills will also grow.</p><p> Only a small share of the workforce will be involved in developing software or systems design, but exposing children to coding and basic ICT concepts can infl uence career choices for some and impart a basic understanding to many. NairoBits, a youth organization in Kenya, exposes underprivileged young people from informal settlements to web design and other ICT skills, while AkiraChix reaches out to “geek girls.” Women tend to be underrepresented in ICT fi elds, and encouraging girls to enter such professions and ICT companies to create welcoming environments for women will increase the available workforce in fi elds with rising demand for labor. With technology likely continuing to get more advanced and affecting ever more occupations, workers need to continuously reevaluate and upgrade their skills. Much of that will happen outside the formal education system, but governments can provide the incentives for fi rms and workers to create the mechanisms for lifelong learning. Institutions that are accountable to citizens Although the internet has enabled many governments to provide some basic services more effi ciently, technology so far has not strengthened accountability.</p><p> For policies, this implies a dual strategy: tailoring the application of digital technologies to environments with limited accountability in the short term, and strengthening institutions in the longer term (table O.3). Table O.3 Priority policies for better service delivery Emerging countries: Laying the foundation for more effective institutions Transitioning countries: Building capable and accountable institutions Transforming countries: Deepening collaborative institutions • Improve information services to citizens • Strengthen monitoring of and payment to providers • Establish population registers • Scale up nonstate provision of services • Increase electoral accountability • Strengthen government delivery systems • Strengthen provider management • Get regular user feedback on service quality • Increase transparency in priority areas • Improve collaboration across and beyond government • Enhance participatory policy making 35OVERVIEW collection of identifi able information creates privacy and security concerns. Automation changes work in ways that challenge existing social protections and reveal the inadequacy of existing labor laws. And scale economies create antitrust concerns.</p><p> Digital safeguards that mitigate these risks become increasingly important as the digital transformation proceeds. Developing privacy policies The fl ood of data collected on the internet brings many benefi ts to consumers and citizens but also raises the risk of abuse through cybercrime, discrimination, or manipulation. As of 2014, some 107 countries had privacy laws, but only 51 of them were developing countries. The basic principles of privacy law are well established. They should give users more control (and perhaps co-ownership) over their data and make digital engagement with citizens also increases. As long as access is not universal, there is a risk of leaving those unconnected behind.</p><p> But citizen feedback systems have reduced problems such as petty corruption or poor services in the Dominican Republic, Nigeria, and Pakistan. As one Kenyan water utility manager said, “By introducing an automated complaint management system we took a noose and put it around our own necks. We are now accountable!” Deepen collaboration and participatory policy making Even in countries with advanced e-government systems, their use remains surprisingly low. Many citizens prefer traditional ways of interacting with the government such as phones or mail, so parallel systems remain in place and savings go unrealized. Providing incentives such as faster tax refunds for e-fi ling or greater convenience through simplifi ed and closely integrated services across agencies increases their use.</p><p> Estonia’s X-Road framework integrates services from all parts of government as well as private or civil society groups according to protocols that govern data exchange and security standards.34 Practically any transaction—from paying the parking meter to voting in national elections—can be done from a smartphone. Tangible benefi ts for citizens will lead to universal use of e-government services, making such platforms also suitable for broad-based participatory policy making. Digital safeguards Strengthening analog complements will ensure a high social and economic return from digital investments. But a downside risk remains. Returning to the Report’s framework (fi gure O.</p><p>24), large-scale Box O.12 Can continuous monitoring and small sanctions improve provider performance? Traditional monitoring systems are expensive and complex. New technologies lower these costs, allowing rewards or punishment to be more immediate and frequent. The idea comes from criminal justice innovations. Usually lawbreakers face a low probability of being caught, but a large punishment.</p><p> When people face a high probability, but fi nes are lower, violations become rarer. The idea could be extended to public service monitoring. In Niger, a well-designed monitoring system enabled by mobile phones motivated teachers because they felt their far-away superiors cared about their work and looked out for them.

Today, the internet is managed by an international coalition of governments, industry, technical experts, and civil society—in what is referred to as the multistakeholder model. U.S.</p><p> users are now a small minority of total internet users, given the dramatic growth in the number of users in developing countries, especially in Asia. Many countries are demanding more meaningful representation in the discussions of how the internet should be governed. In addition, the lack of trust among nations following the Edward Snowden episode, the surveillance by state agencies, and the increasing confl icts between national policy and regulations and global norms have raised questions about internet governance. Several countries have advocated for a multilateral model of governance, which would give national governments greater power in overseeing the internet, much the same way the United Nations, the International Telecommunication Union, or the World Bank are currently governed. The promoters of “multistakeholderism” argue that state control of the internet would not leave space for the range of players currently involved in internet governance and could pave the path for greater suppression of privacy and restrictions on access to information and on rights of free expression. The inability of the stakeholders of the internet to reach a consensus on future governance mechanisms can be costly; some have even suggested that the internet is at risk of splitting up into several local or regional internets.</p><p> The broad-based, participatory approach involving all stakeholders is seen by many to be best suited to ensure an effi cient and unrestricted global fl ow of information essential for economic development. Creating a global digital market The internet is encouraging more cross-border exchanges of goods and services, allowing consumers and fi rms to bypass national borders. But crossborder issues—such as barriers to data fl ows and uncoordinated intellectual property rights regimes—are impairing the growth of internet fi rms and robbing consumers of gains from increased digital trade. This has also meant that many startups from smaller countries with relatively modest domestic markets, particularly in Europe (box O.13), are moving their business to the United States as soon as they achieve a certain scale. The small scale imposed by cross-border barriers may also partly explain why e-commerce fi rms are opting out at the point of collection easier.</p><p> Even when such laws exist, preventing abuse is diffi cult, especially where legal and enforcement capacity is weak. Adapting social protection systems to changing labor markets Better skills will help many workers cope with the effects of internet-enabled automation. But changes in the labor market also require rethinking social protection and tax systems. The on-demand economy leads to more informal employment, transferring insurance and occupational obligations to freelance workers. Strict labor regulations, common in developing countries, and overreliance on labor taxation encourage faster automation by making hiring more expensive. It would be better to strengthen workers’ protection independently from work contracts by delinking social insurance from employment, offering independent social assistance, and helping workers retrain and fi nd new employment quickly.</p><p> In many countries this requires major reforms. And countries just starting to develop social protection systems and deepening labor laws should design them for the 21st-century workplace, rather than copy what industrialized countries created for a very different world of work. Building antitrust enforcement capacity Regulatory reform that improves the business environment is the fi rst priority. But even in countries with comprehensive competition policies, including easy market entry and exit, there will be cases in which mergers, collusion, or discriminatory pricing harm consumers by creating overly dominant enterprises or by keeping innovative competitors out. Because the internet is still quite new and its impact on markets constantly evolving, developing the capacity to investigate and prosecute complex violations to competition law will take time. Cases pursued in high-income countries can provide guidance.</p><p> Global cooperation to solve global problems The internet is truly an international network. It can be better managed with coordination across nations and serve as a powerful platform to facilitate global cooperation. Three priority areas are governing the internet, creating a global digital market, and providing global public goods—including those that promote poverty reduction and environmental sustainability. 37OVERVIEW problems—climate change, ozone depletion, air pollution, epidemics—are features of globally interconnected environmental, economic, and social systems and require global cooperation. What’s the role of development agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and international organizations in a world where their fi nancial heft is small? The data and technology revolutions arrive in time to bridge the gap between their resources and ambition by amplifying the impacts of action and including more people in the formulation and execution of plans.</p><p> But for this to work, development actors must tackle policy constraints, internal and external. Start with the how of development operations. With new technologies, development agencies can be more inclusive by tapping on benefi ciary wisdom in designing interventions. They can raise effi ciency by using rapid feedback to refi ne and improve their actions through trial and error. But these approaches won’t come easily in organizations that emphasize spending and outputs over results, have burdensome structures for accountability, and see any failures as damning rather than informative. If traditional agencies can’t adapt, some of their business may be taken up by disruptive newcomers.</p><p> Next, the what. Development agencies can support information services that help individuals and systems managers make better decisions in ways that promote poverty reduction. These services have fi xed often losing money in Africa while being profi table in China and India. Some countries are considering regulations that make it legally binding for data of or about their citizens to reside within their national borders, also referred to as data localization or data nationalism. While such barriers may stem from legitimate concerns about privacy and security for their citizens’ information, they can be costly. A study of six developing countries and the EU-28 found that such regulations can reduce GDP by up to 1.</p><p>7 percent, investments up to 4.2 percent, and exports by 1.7 percent.35 Restrictions on data fl ows face the risk of becoming a new tool for protectionism—disguised to impede trade and economic activity or to encourage domestic data-driven sectors. At the same time, countries should make it easier for fi rms to protect their intellectual property (IP) rights—but within limits that do not give excessive protections to large, wellconnected fi rms at the cost of stifl ing innovation and creativity. The process to apply for IP licenses should be harmonized, streamlined, and globalized—so fi rms need only to register their patent or trademark in any signatory country to protect it across member countries.</p><p> Providing global public goods Sustainable development and poverty reduction are a focus of global partnerships. Many environmental Box O.13 European Union: A fragmented market for digital trade Despite being a single market with free fl ows of goods, services, and people for many decades, the European Union (EU) still functions like a fragmented market for digital trade. Consumers in the EU prefer to shop from online stores within their national borders. While 44 percent of consumers made an online purchase from a domestic business in 2014, only 15 percent did so from a business in another EU country. Firms also face many diffi culties selling their goods and services online into other EU markets.</p><p> For example, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Malmo, Sweden, are separated only by an 8-kilometer bridge, but a package sent from Copenhagen to Malmo costs €27, whereas the same package sent from Malmo to Copenhagen costs €42. Firms facing large costs to adapt to various national laws believe that the costs outweigh the benefi ts of selling online. In May 2015, the European Commission (EC) announced plans to create a Digital Single Market, in three main policy areas. First, the EC wants to increase the access for consumers and fi rms to these digital goods and services by facilitating e-commerce, improving parcel delivery, and dealing with geoblocking, where access to online services or content is restricted to specifi c countries. Second, it will examine the regulatory environment for telecoms, media, online platforms, and data protection. Third, it will encourage more ICT investment and innovation through better standards and interoperability, and more use of “big data” and cloud computing.</p><p> If EU reforms to create a common digital market are successful, they could become a model for other world regions.

Diffi culties in measuring technology’s role are another partial explanation for the gap between individual cases of substantial benefi ts and modest macro effects. Technology impact is diffused throughout the economy, the world of work, and many aspects of personal life. And many benefi ts come in the form of higher quality or convenience—nonmonetary benefi ts not refl ected in GDP numbers.</p><p> 3. Even if rapid progress in artifi cial intelligence could solve some of these problems, it could take decades (see spotlight 6 in the full Report).

So the private sector will tend either to shy away from providing these services, or will price them at a level that shuts out poor people who could benefi t.

Why?</p><p> Because technology needs to be complemented by improvements in areas that determine whether fi rms, people, and governments can make effective use of new digital tools. The analog foundation cannot be strengthened overnight. It requires overcoming some of the most protracted development challenges: how to create an environment for fi rms to thrive, how to build effective education and training systems, and how to make service providers more responsive to citizens. The stakes are high, because the digital revolution leaves behind countries that do not make the necessary reforms. For those that do, technology investments will produce ample digital dividends, and these dividends will be widely shared among all stakeholders. </p>
