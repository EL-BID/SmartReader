What Will Automation Mean for Government
Jobs?
New studies shed light on the job security of certain government jobs in an increasingly
digital age.

BY MIKE MACIAG, GOVERNING / JANUARY 4, 2018

While teachers incorporate technology into their daily routines, few expect their jobs to disappear from payrolls
anytime soon.

Automation has already altered several industries, and it’s only a matter of time before it
transforms more of them. Given that many governments continue to grapple with tight
budgets and suppressed staffing levels, it’s worth considering whether they might one
day rely more on automation and technology to carry out tasks performed by humans.

Recent studies have shed some light on what this might look like, particularly in the
public sector.

Automation has already made some forays into government. Kirke Everson, a KPMG
intelligent automation consultant, cited "chatbots" utilized in call centers
(http://www.governing.com/columns/tech-talk/gov-artificial-intelligence-government-
technology.html) as an example. He suggested that automation could soon replace
personnel who perform repetitive back-office tasks, such as eligibility checks and other
procedures following a defined set of rules.

“Government is ripe for automation,” Everson says. "But if it requires a large amount of
judgments or human interaction, maybe you don’t start there.”

In the U.K., an estimated 861,000 public-sector jobs could be automated by 2030,
according to an analysis (https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/press-
releases/articles/automation-set-to-transform-public-services.html) by Deloitte and
Oxford University. “Administrative and operative” roles, which account for 27 percent of
the public workforce, were identified as having the highest probability of being
automated. These types of jobs are already declining, and the report projects their
numbers in the U.K. to fall further from 87,000 in 2015 to only 4,000 by 2030.

A separate Oxford University study
(https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.
examined U.S. job occupations, deeming about 47 percent of total employment in both
government and the private sector to be “at risk” of computerization. Some public-sector
roles considered most vulnerable included library workers, postal service clerks and
transportation inspectors -- all positions with highly repetitive tasks. Many of the other
occupations researchers identified were especially common in transportation. These
included bus drivers and subway or streetcar operators, as well as highway maintenance
workers.

But does this mean large numbers of public employees will one day be out of work? 
 
Historically, industrialization and improvements in technology haven't caused higher
long-term unemployment. It’s unknown whether this time will be any different, though,
with economists offering different predictions for automation’s effects.

Neil Reichenberg, who heads the International Public Management Association for
Human Resources, views it more as a shift. “It’s not so much cutting staff as it is moving
people to more strategic, higher-level work,” he says.

While technology has already reshaped countless occupations across just about every
segment of the economy, it hasn’t yet prompted the complete elimination of many types
of jobs. Consider teachers, who employ greater use of educational software programs in

classrooms. These and other types of public employee positions haven’t vanished, but
they do require greater tech skills than in years past.

Although some might associate automation with armies of robots, it’s computers that
are most responsible for redefining work these days. A recent Brookings Institution
report (https://www.brookings.edu/research/digitalization-and-the-american-
workforce/) assessed “digitization,” or the degree of computer skills and related
knowledge typically required of various occupations. Several public-sector jobs that
required few digital skills in 2002 now mandate at least mid-level proficiency of
computers or other devices.

Parking enforcement workers and compliance officers, for example, might have relied
entirely on paper records not long ago. Today, the Brookings data suggests digital skills
for these occupations have jumped considerably over the past decade.

In some ways, automating various aspects of jobs could prove to be more difficult in the
public sector than in the private sector. Unions, Reichenberg says, will likely oppose
efforts expected to result in job losses. Last year, the union membership rate
(https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm) for government workers was more
than five times that of the private sector. 
 
Still, if automation offers governments ways to cut costs without sacrificing quality of
services, they'll likely consider it. Resources remain limited. Revenues aren’t expected to
grow much, and total state and local government employment is still below
(http://www.governing.com/topics/mgmt/gov-suppressed-staffing-levels-government-
recession.html) levels reached a decade ago. In some jurisdictions, automated processes
or technologies could enable governments to provide services that otherwise wouldn’t be
available. 
 
“It’s inevitable," Reichenberg says. "If you look at the way we do work today, technology
is going to play a major role.”
