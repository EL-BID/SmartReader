Since its founding in 1990, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) has sought 
to develop a deeper understanding of the evolving global economy. As the 
business and economics research arm of McKinsey & Company, MGI aims 
to provide leaders in the commercial, public, and social sectors with the facts 
and insights on which to base management and policy decisions. The Lauder 
Institute at the University of Pennsylvania has ranked MGI the world’s number-
one private-sector think tank in its Think Tank Index.

MGI research combines the disciplines of economics and management, 
employing the analytical tools of economics with the insights of business 
leaders. Our “micro-to-macro” methodology examines microeconomic 
industry trends to better understand the broad macroeconomic forces 
affecting business strategy and public policy. MGI’s in-depth reports have 
covered more than 20 countries and 30 industries. Current research focuses 
on six themes: productivity and growth, natural resources, labor markets, 
the evolution of global financial markets, the economic impact of technology 
and innovation, and urbanization. Recent reports have assessed the 
digital economy, the impact of AI and automation on employment, income 
inequality, the productivity puzzle, the economic benefits of tackling gender 
inequality, a new era of global competition, Chinese innovation, and digital and 
financial globalization. 

MGI is led by three McKinsey & Company senior partners: Jacques Bughin, 
Jonathan Woetzel, and James Manyika, who also serves as the chairman 
of MGI. Michael Chui, Susan Lund, Anu Madgavkar, Sree Ramaswamy, and 
Jaana Remes are MGI partners, and Jan Mischke and Jeongmin Seong are 
MGI senior fellows.

Project teams are led by the MGI partners and a group of senior fellows, 
and include consultants from McKinsey offices around the world. These 
teams draw on McKinsey’s global network of partners and industry and 
management experts. Advice and input to MGI research are provided by 
the MGI Council, members of which are also involved in MGI’s research. 
MGI council members are drawn from around the world and from various 
sectors and include Andrés Cadena, Sandrine Devillard, Richard Dobbs, 
Tarek Elmasry, Katy George, Rajat Gupta, Eric Hazan, Eric Labaye, Acha Leke, 
Scott Nyquist, Gary Pinkus, Sven Smit, Oliver Tonby, and Eckart Windhagen. 
In addition, leading economists, including Nobel laureates, act as research 
advisers to MGI research.

JOBS LOST, JOBS GAINED: 
WORKFORCE TRANSITIONS 
IN A TIME OF AUTOMATION 



PREFACE 

Automation is not a new phenomenon, and fears about its transformation of the workplace 
and effects on employment date back centuries, even before the Industrial Revolution in 
the 18th and 19th centuries. In the 1960s, US President Lyndon Johnson empaneled a 
“National Commission on Technology, Automation, and Economic Progress.” Among its 
conclusions was “the basic fact that technology destroys jobs, but not work.”* Fast forward 
and rapid recent advances in automation technologies, including artificial intelligence, 
autonomous systems, and robotics are now raising the fears anew—and with new urgency. 
In our January 2017 report on automation, A future that works: Automation, employment, 
and productivity, we analyzed the automation potential of the global economy, the timelines 
over which the phenomenon could play out, and the powerful productivity boost that 
automation adoption could deliver. 

This report goes a step further by examining both the potential labor market disruptions 
from automation and some potential sources of new labor demand that will create jobs. 
We develop scenarios that seek to address some of the questions most often raised in the 
public debate. Will there be enough work in the future to maintain full employment, and if so 
what will that work be? Which occupations will thrive, and which ones will wither? What are 
the potential implications for skills and wages as machines perform some or the tasks that 
humans now do? 

The report is part of the McKinsey Global Institute’s research program on the future of work, 
and is by no means the final word on this topic. The technology continues to evolve, as will 
our collective understanding of the economic implications. Indeed, we highlight some of the 
limitations of our analysis and scenarios, and areas for further research. The report builds on 
our previous research on labor markets, incomes, skills, and the expanding range of models 
of work, including the gig economy, as well as the potential impacts on the global economy 
of digitization, automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence. 

The research was led by James Manyika, chairman and director of the McKinsey Global 
Institute and McKinsey senior partner based in San Francisco; Susan Lund, an MGI partner 
based in Washington, DC; Michael Chui, an MGI partner in San Francisco; Jacques Bughin, 
MGI director and McKinsey senior partner based in Brussels; and Jonathan Woetzel, 
MGI director and McKinsey senior partner in Shanghai. Parul Batra, Ryan Ko, and

IN BRIEF 

JOBS LOST, JOBS GAINED: WORKFORCE 
TRANSITIONS IN A TIME OF AUTOMATION 
In our latest research on automation, we examine work 
that can be automated through 2030 and jobs that may 
be created in the same period. We draw from lessons 
from history and develop various scenarios for the future. 
While it is hard to predict how all this will play out, our 
research provides some insights into the likely workforce 
transitions that should be expected and their implications. 
Our key findings: 

  Automation technologies including artificial intelligence 
and robotics will generate significant benefits for 
users, businesses, and economies, lifting productivity 
and economic growth. The extent to which these 
technologies displace workers will depend on the 
pace of their development and adoption, economic 
growth, and growth in demand for work. Even as it 
causes declines in some occupations, automation 
will change many more—60 percent of occupations 
have at least 30 percent of constituent work 
activities that could be automated. It will also create 
new occupations that do not exist today, much as 
technologies of the past have done. 

  While about half of all work activities globally have 
the technical potential to be automated by adapting 
currently demonstrated technologies, the proportion 
of work actually displaced by 2030 will likely be 
lower, because of technical, economic, and social 
factors that affect adoption. Our scenarios across 46 
countries suggest that between almost zero and one-
third of work activities could be displaced by 2030, 
with a midpoint of 15 percent. The proportion varies 
widely across countries, with advanced economies 
more affected by automation than developing ones, 
reflecting higher wage rates and thus economic 
incentives to automate. 

  Even with automation, the demand for work and 
workers could increase as economies grow, 
partly fueled by productivity growth enabled 
by technological progress. Rising incomes and 
consumption especially in developing countries, 
increasing health care for aging societies, investment 
in infrastructure and energy, and other trends will 
create demand for work that could help offset the 
displacement of workers. Additional investments such 
as in infrastructure and construction, beneficial in their 
own right, could be needed to reduce the risk of job 
shortages in some advanced economies. 

  Even if there is enough work to ensure full employment 
by 2030, major transitions lie ahead that could match 
or even exceed the scale of historical shifts out of 
agriculture and manufacturing. Our scenarios suggest 
that by 2030, 75 million to 375 million workers (3 to 
14 percent of the global workforce) will need to switch 
occupational categories. Moreover, all workers will 
need to adapt, as their occupations evolve alongside 
increasingly capable machines. Some of that 
adaptation will require higher educational attainment, 
or spending more time on activities that require social 
and emotional skills, creativity, high-level cognitive 
capabilities and other skills relatively hard to automate. 

  Income polarization could continue in the United 
States and other advanced economies, where 
demand for high-wage occupations may grow the 
most while middle-wage occupations decline—
assuming current wage structures persist. Increased 
investment and productivity growth from automation 
could spur enough growth to ensure full employment, 
but only if most displaced workers find new work 
within one year. If reemployment is slow, frictional 
unemployment will likely rise in the short-term and 
wages could face downward pressure. These wage 
trends are not universal: in China and other emerging 
economies, middle-wage occupations such as 
service and construction jobs will likely see the most 
net job growth, boosting the emerging middle class. 

  To achieve good outcomes, policy makers and 
business leaders will need to embrace automation’s 
benefits and, at the same time, address the worker 
transitions brought about by these technologies. 
Ensuring robust demand growth and economic 
dynamism is a priority: history shows that economies 
that are not expanding do not generate job growth. 
Midcareer job training will be essential, as will 
enhancing labor market dynamism and enabling 
worker redeployment. These changes will challenge 
current educational and workforce training models, as 
well as business approaches to skill-building. Another 
priority is rethinking and strengthening transition and 
income support for workers caught in the cross-
currents of automation.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 

The technology-driven world in which we live is a world 
filled with promise but also challenges. Cars that drive 
themselves, machines that read X-rays, and algorithms 
that respond to customer service inquiries are all 
manifestations of powerful new forms of automation. Yet 
even as these technologies increase productivity and 
improve our lives, their use will substitute for some work 
activities humans currently perform—a development that 
has sparked much public concern. 

This research builds on MGI’s January 2017 report on 
automation and its impact on work activities.1 We assess 
the number and types of jobs that might be created under 
different scenarios through 2030, and compare that to 
work that could be displaced by automation.2 The results 
reveal a rich mosaic of potential shifts in occupations in 
the years ahead, with important implications for workforce 
skills and wages. The analysis covers 46 countries that 
comprise almost 90 percent of global GDP. We focus on 
six countries that span income levels (China, Germany, 
India, Japan, Mexico, and the United States). For each, 
we modeled the potential net employment changes for 
more than 800 occupations, based on different scenarios 
for the pace of automation adoption and for future labor 
demand. The intent of this research is not to forecast. 
Rather, we present a set of scenarios (necessarily 
incomplete)  to serve as a guide, as we anticipate and 
prepare for the future of work. This research is by no 
means the final word on this topic; ongoing research is 
required. Indeed, in Box E2 at the end of this summary, 
we highlight some of the potential limitations of the 
research presented in this report. 

Our findings suggest that several trends that may serve 
as catalysts of future labor demand could create demand 
for millions of jobs by 2030. These trends include caring 
for others in aging societies, raising energy efficiency 

1 A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity, McKinsey Global Institute, January 2017.
2 We use the term “jobs” as shorthand for full-time equivalent workers (FTEs), and apply it to both work displaced by automation and to new work 

created by future labor demand. In reality, the number of people working is larger than the number of FTEs, as some people work part-time. Our 
analysis of FTEs covers both employees within firms as well as independent contractors and freelancers. 

and meeting climate challenges, producing goods 
and services for the expanding consuming class, 
especially in developing countries, not to mention the 
investment in technology, infrastructure, and buildings 
needed in all countries. Taken from another angle, we 
also find that a growing and dynamic economy—in 
part fueled by technology itself and its contributions to 
productivity—would create jobs. These jobs would result 
from growth in current occupations due to demand 
and the creation of new types of occupations  that may 
not have existed before, as has happened historically. 
This job growth (jobs gained) could more than offset 
the jobs lost to automation. None of this will happen by 
itself—it will require businesses and governments to seize 
opportunities to boost job creation and for labor markets 
to function well. The workforce transitions ahead will 
be enormous. We estimate that as many as 375 million 
workers globally (14 percent of the global workforce) 
will likely need to transition to new occupational 
categories and learn new skills, in the event of rapid 
automation adoption. If their transition to new jobs is slow, 
unemployment could rise and dampen wage growth. 

Indeed, while this report is titled Jobs lost, jobs gained, it 
could have been, Jobs lost, jobs changed, jobs gained; 
in many ways a big part of this story is about how more 
occupations will change than will be lost as machines 
affect portions of occupations and people increasingly 
work alongside them. Societal choices will determine 
whether all three of these coming workforce transitions 
are smooth, or whether unemployment and income 
inequality rise. History shows numerous examples of 
countries that have successfully ridden the wave of 
technological change by investing in their workforce and 
adapting policies, institutions, and business models to the 
new era. It is our hope that this report prompts leaders in 
that direction once again. 



Summary of findings McKinsey Global Institute2

AUTOMATION COULD DISPLACE A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF WORK GLOBALLY 
TO 2030; 15 PERCENT IS THE MIDPOINT OF OUR SCENARIO RANGE 
In our prior report on automation, we found that about half the activities people are paid to 
do globally could theoretically be automated using currently demonstrated technologies.3 
Very few occupations—less than 5 percent—consist entirely of activities that can be 
fully automated. However, in about 60 percent of occupations, at least one-third of the 
constituent activities could be automated, implying substantial workplace transformations 
and changes for all workers. All this is based on our assessments of current technological 
capability—an ever evolving frontier (Exhibit E1). 

While technical feasibility of automation is important, it is not the only factor that will influence 
the pace and extent of automation adoption. Other factors include the cost of developing 
and deploying automation solutions for specific uses in the workplace, the labor market 
dynamics (including quality and quantity of labor and associated wages), the benefits 
of automation beyond labor substitution, and regulatory and social acceptance. Taking 
into account these factors, our new research estimates that between almost zero and 
30 percent of the hours worked globally could be automated by 2030, depending on the 
speed of adoption. In this report we mainly use the midpoint of our scenario range, which is 
15 percent of current activities automated. Results differ significantly by country, reflecting 

3 Our definition of automation includes robotics (machines that perform physical activities) and artificial 
intelligence (software algorithms that perform calculations and cognitive activities). Companies may adopt 
these technologies for reasons other than labor cost savings, such as improved quality, efficiency, or scale, 
although worker displacement could still be a consequence. A glossary of automation technologies and 
techniques is in the technical appendix.

employment is reassuring”).

Technology adoption can and often does cause 
significant short-term labor displacement, but history 
shows that, in the longer run, it creates a multitude of new 
jobs and unleashes demand for existing ones, more than 
offsetting the number of jobs it destroys even as it raises 
labor productivity (Exhibit E3).1 An examination of the 
historical record highlights several lessons: 

  All advanced economies have experienced 
profound sectoral shifts in employment, first out of 
agriculture and more recently manufacturing, even 
as overall employment grew. In the United States, the 
agricultural share of total employment declined from 
60 percent in 1850 to less than 5 percent by 1970, 
while manufacturing fell from 26 percent of total US 
employment in 1960 to below 10 percent today. Other 
countries have experienced even faster declines: one-
third of China’s workforce moved out of agriculture 
between 1990 and 2015. 

  Such shifts can have painful consequences for some 
workers. During the Industrial Revolution in England, 
average real wages stagnated for decades, even as 
productivity rose.2 Eventually, wage growth caught up 
to and then surpassed productivity growth. But the 
transition period was difficult for individual workers, 
and eased only after substantial policy reforms. 

  New technologies have spurred the creation of many 
more jobs than they destroyed, and some of the new 
jobs are in occupations that cannot be envisioned 
at the outset; one study found that 0.56 percent of 
new jobs in the United States each year are in new 
occupations.3 Most jobs created by technology 
are outside the technology-producing sector itself. 
We estimate that the introduction of the personal 
computer, for instance, has enabled the creation of 
15.8 million net new jobs in the United States since 
1980, even after accounting for jobs displaced. About 
90 percent of these are in occupations that use the PC 
in other industries, such as call center representatives, 
financial analysts, and inventory managers. 

  Robust aggregate demand and economic growth 
are essential for job creation. New technologies have 
raised productivity growth, enabling firms to lower 
prices for consumers, pay higher wages, or distribute 
profits to shareholders. This stimulates demand 
across the economy, boosting job creation.4 

  Rising productivity is usually accompanied by 
employment growth, because it raises incomes 
which are then spent, creating demand for goods and 
services across the economy. When there has been 
a tradeoff between employment growth and labor 
productivity growth, it has been short-lived. In the 
United States, for example, our analysis shows that 
employment and productivity both grew in 95 percent 
of rolling three-year periods and 100 percent of rolling 
10-year periods since 1960. 

  Over the long term, productivity growth enabled by 
technology has reduced the average hours worked 
per week and allowed people to enjoy more leisure 
time.5 Across advanced economies, the length 
of the average work-week has fallen by nearly 
50 percent since the early 1900s, reflecting shorter 
working hours, more paid days off for personal 
time and vacations, and the recent rise of part-time 
work. The growth in leisure has created demand 
for new industries, from golf to video games to 
home improvement. 

Although the historical record is largely reassuring, 
some people worry that automation today will be 
more disruptive than in the past. Technology experts 
and economists are debating whether “this time, 
things are different” (and we examine that debate 
starting on page 48 of this report). Our current 
view is that the answer depends on the time horizon 
considered (decades or centuries) and on the pace of 
future technological progress and adoption. On many 
dimensions, we find similarities between the scope and 
effects of automation today compared to earlier waves of 
technology disruption, going back to the Industrial

Box E1. The historical evidence on technology and employment is reassuring (continued)
Revolution. However, automation going forward might 
prove to be more disruptive than in recent decades—
and on par with the most rapid changes in the past—in 
two ways. First, if technological advances continue 

apace and are adopted rapidly, the rate of worker 
displacement could be faster. Secondly, if many sectors 
adopt automation simultaneously, the percentage of the 
workforce affected by it could be higher.



Summary of findings McKinsey Global Institute6

The potential impact of automation on employment varies by occupation and sector. 
Activities most susceptible to automation include physical ones in predictable environments, 
such as operating machinery and preparing fast food. Collecting and processing data  
are two other categories of activity that can increasingly be done better and faster with 
machines. This could displace large amounts of labor, for instance in mortgage origination, 
paralegal work, accounting, and back-office transaction processing. It is important to note, 
however, that even when some tasks are automated, employment in those occupations 
may not decline, but rather workers may perform new tasks. In addition, employment in 
occupations may also grow, if the overall demand for that occupation grows enough to 
overwhelm the rates of automation. 

Automation will have a lesser effect on jobs that involve managing people, applying 
expertise, and those involving social interactions, where machines are unable to match 
human performance for now. Jobs in unpredictable environments—occupations such as 
gardeners, plumbers, or providers of child- and elder-care—will also generally see less 
automation by 2030, because they are difficult to automate technically and often command 
relatively lower wages, which makes automation a less attractive business proposition. 

RISING INCOMES, INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY, AND 
OTHER CATALYSTS COULD POTENTIALLY CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS 
While automation’s displacement of labor has been visible for many years, it is more difficult 
to envision all the new jobs that will be created. Many of these new jobs are created indirectly 
and spread across different sectors and geographies.  

In this report, we model some potential sources of new labor demand that may spur job 
creation to 2030, even net of automation. We consider two scenarios, a “trendline” scenario 
based on current spending and investment trends observed across countries, and a “step-
up” scenario that assumes additional investments in some areas. We calculate jobs (full-time 
equivalents) that could be created both directly and indirectly for more than 800 existing 
occupations. We do not consider the dynamic interactions between trends or across the 
economy (Exhibit E4). The results are not precise forecasts of future job growth, but rather 
are suggestive of where jobs of the future may be. 

For three trends, we model only a trendline scenario. They are: 

  Rising incomes and consumption, especially in emerging economies. Previous 
MGI research has estimated that 1 billion more people will enter the consuming class by 
2025.4 Using external macroeconomic forecasts, we estimate that global consumption 
could grow by $23 trillion between 2015 and 2030, and most of this will come from the 
expanding consuming classes in emerging economies. As incomes rise, consumers 
spend more on all categories. But their spending patterns also shift, creating more jobs 
in areas such as consumer durables, leisure activities, financial and telecommunication 
services, housing, health care, and education. The effects of these new consumers will 
be felt not just in the countries where the income is generated, but also in economies that 
export to those countries.5 Globally, we estimate that 300 million to 365 million new jobs 
could be created from the impact of rising incomes.  

  Aging populations. By 2030, there will be at least 300 million more people aged 
65 years and above than there were in 2014. As people age, their spending patterns 

4 We define consuming classes or consumers as individuals with an annual income of more than $3,600, or $10 
per day, at purchasing power parity, using constant 2005 PPP dollars. Urban world: Cities and the rise of the 
consuming class, McKinsey Global Institute, June 2012.

5 We assume that current patterns of global trade continue, at the same level relative to GDP as today. As a 
result, advanced economies also benefit from rising incomes in developing countries. The United States, 
for example, could gain up to 3 percent of net new jobs from rising incomes by 2030 from net exports. In 
Germany’s case, that figure could be more than 40 percent.

shift, with a pronounced increase in spending on health care and other personal 
services. This will create significant demand for a range of occupations, including 
doctors, nurses, and health technicians, but also home health aides, personal care aides 
and nursing assistants in many countries, even as it reduces demand for pediatricians 
and primary-school teachers. Globally, we estimate heath care and related jobs from 
aging and rising incomes could grow by 80 million to 130 million by 2030.6 

  Development and deployment of technology. Jobs related to developing and 
deploying new technologies may also grow. These jobs include computer scientists, 
engineers, and IT administrators. Overall spending on technology could increase by 
more than 50 percent between 2015 and 2030. About half would be on information 
technology services, both in-house IT workers within companies and external or 
outsourced tech consulting jobs. The number of people employed in these occupations 
is small compared to those in health care or construction, but they are high-wage 
occupations. By 2030, we estimate this trend could create 20 to 50 million jobs globally. 

6 We net out the effect of fewer health-care jobs related to children in this trend.

Summary of findings McKinsey Global Institute8

For three other trends, we model both a trendline scenario and a step-up scenario; the latter 
is based on explicit choices that could be made by governments, business leaders, and 
individuals to create additional jobs. 

  Investment in infrastructure and buildings. Infrastructure and buildings are two 
areas of historic underspending that may create significant additional labor demand 
if action is taken to bridge infrastructure gaps and overcome housing shortages. MGI 
has estimated that the world needs to invest about 3.8 percent of GDP annually, or an 
average of $3.3 trillion per year to fill infrastructure gaps, compared with $2.5 trillion 
currently.7 This includes both developing countries that are urbanizing and industrializing, 
and advanced economies that have underinvested in maintaining their infrastructure 
and buildings. Rising incomes also create demand for more and higher quality buildings. 
Both factors could create new demand, mainly in the construction sector, for up to 
80 million jobs in the trendline scenario  and, in some cases, potentially up to 200 million 
globally in the step-up scenario.8 These jobs include architects, engineers, carpenters 
and other skilled tradespeople, as well as construction workers, machinery operators 
and other jobs with lower skill requirements. 

  Investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and climate adaptation. 
Investments in renewable energy, such as wind and solar, energy efficiency 
technologies, and adaptation and mitigation of climate change may create new demand 
for workers in a range of occupations, including in manufacturing, construction, and 
installation. In our trendline scenario, we model future job growth based on already-
announced policy intentions for energy efficiency and the required investment to meet 
these goals.9 For a step-up scenario, we use more ambitious targets that countries 
will need to get closer to meeting commitments to the Paris climate accord.10 These 
investments could create up to ten million new jobs in the trendline scenario, and up to 
ten million additional jobs globally in the step-up scenario. 

  “Marketization” of previously unpaid domestic work. The last trend we consider 
is the potential to pay for services that substitute for currently unpaid and primarily 
domestic work—including cooking, childcare, and cleaning. This so-called marketization 
of previously unpaid work is already prevalent in advanced economies, and rising female 
labor force participation worldwide could accelerate the trend. About 75 percent of the 
world’s total unpaid care is undertaken by women and amounts to as much as $10 trillion 
of output per year, roughly equivalent to 13 percent of global GDP.11 Individual decisions 
within the household to use paid services or government investment to provide universal 
childcare and pre-school could fuel this development. We consider this in the step-up 
scenario only, as its magnitude and timing is unclear. But we estimate that this shift could 
marketize 50 million to 90 million unpaid jobs globally, mainly in occupations such as 
childcare, early childhood education, cleaning, cooking, and gardening.

8 In the step-up scenario, we assume higher levels of run-rate infrastructure investment after countries have 

closed their respective infrastructure gap. We also assume that, at minimum, countries reach levels of 
commercial and residential real estate investment comparable to those in the United States.

UP TO 375 MILLION PEOPLE MAY NEED TO SWITCH OCCUPATIONAL 
CATEGORIES, WITH THE HIGHEST SHARE IN ADVANCED ECONOMIES 
When we look at the net changes in job growth and decline from the trends described 
above compared with the work that can be automated, a mosaic of shifts in occupations 
and job categories emerges (Exhibit E5). 

Across all countries, the categories with the highest percentage job growth net of 
automation include health-care providers; professionals such as engineers, scientists, 
accountants, and analysts; IT professionals and other technology specialists; managers and 
executives, whose work cannot easily be replaced by machines; educators, especially in 
emerging economies with young populations; and “creatives,” a small but growing category 
of artists, performers, and entertainers who will be in demand as rising incomes create 
more demand for leisure and recreation. Builders and related professions will also grow, 
particularly in the step-up scenario that involves higher investment in infrastructure and 
buildings. Manual and service jobs in unpredictable environments will also grow, such as 
home health aides and gardeners. 

Advanced economies may also see employment declines in occupations that are most 
susceptible to automation. These include office support occupations, such as record 
clerks, office assistants, and finance and accounting; some customer interaction jobs, 
such as hotel and travel workers, cashiers, and food service workers; and a wide range of 
jobs carried out in predictable settings, such as assembly line workers, dishwashers, food 
preparation workers, drivers, and agricultural and other equipment operators. Helping 
individuals transition from the declining occupations to growing ones will be a large-
scale challenge. 

The coming workforce transitions among occupations could be very large 
The changes in net occupational growth or decline imply that a very large number of people 
may need to shift occupational categories and learn new skills in the years ahead. The shift 
could be on a scale not seen since the transition of the labor force out of agriculture in the 
early 1900s in the United States and Europe, and more recently in China. But unlike those 
earlier transitions, in which young people left farms and moved to cities for industrial jobs, 
the challenge, especially in advanced economies, will be to retrain midcareer workers. 
There are few precedents in which societies have successfully retrained such large numbers 
of people. Frictions in the labor markets—including cultural norms regarding gender 
stereotypes in work and geographic mismatches between workers and jobs—could also 
impede the transition.12

11Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute

We estimate that between 400 million and 800 million individuals could be displaced by 
automation and need to find new jobs by 2030 around the world, based on our midpoint 
and earliest (that is, the most rapid) automation adoption scenarios. We think demand for 
jobs will be there, based on our scenarios of future labor demand and the net impact of 
automation, as described in the next section. However people will need to find their way into 
these jobs. Of the total displaced, 75 million to 375 million may need to switch occupational 
categories and learn new skills, under our midpoint and earliest automation adoption 
scenarios (Exhibit E6).13 Under the latest adoption scenario (that is, the slowest), this number 
would be far lower, below 10 million. Given the minimal impact on the workforce of this 
edge-case scenario, we have not highlighted it in the exhibits in this report. In absolute 
terms, China faces the largest number of workers needing to switch occupations—up to 
100 million if automation is adopted rapidly, or 12 percent of the 2030 workforce—although 
this figure is relatively small compared with the huge shift in China out of agriculture in the 
past 25 years. For advanced economies, the share of the workforce that may need to learn 
new skills and find work in new occupations is much higher: up to one-third of the 2030 
workforce in the United States and Germany, and nearly half in Japan.

Summary of findings McKinsey Global Institute12

WILL THERE BE ENOUGH WORK IN THE FUTURE? 
Today there is growing concern about whether there will be enough jobs for workers given 
potential automation. History would suggest that such fears may be unfounded: over time, 
labor markets adjust to changes in demand for workers from technological disruptions, 
although at times with depressed real wages. We address this question about the future 
of work through two different sets of analyses: one based on modeling of a limited number 
of catalysts of new labor demand and automation described above, and one using a 
macroeconomic model of the economy that incorporates the dynamic interactions 
among variables. We also note that if history is any guide, we could expect 8 to 9 percent 
of 2030 labor demand will be in new types of occupations that have not existed before.14 
Both analyses lead us to conclude that, with sufficient economic growth, innovation, and 
investment, there can be enough new job creation to offset the impact of automation, 
although in some advanced economies additional investments will be needed as per our 
step-up scenario to reduce the risk of job shortages. But a larger challenge will be ensuring 
that workers have the skills and support needed to transition to new jobs. Countries that fail 
to manage this transition could see rising unemployment and depressed wages. 

Future jobs lost and jobs gained vary by country, with the largest disruptions 
expected in advanced economies 
The magnitude of future job creation from the trends described above and the impact of 
automation on the workforce vary significantly by country, depending on four factors: 

  Wage levels. Higher wages make the business case for automation adoption stronger. 
However, low-wage countries may be affected as well, if companies adopt automation 
to boost quality, achieve tighter production control, move production closer to end 
consumers in high-wage countries, or other benefits beyond reducing labor costs. Some 
economists worry about “premature deindustrialization” in developing countries due 
to automation.15 

  Demand growth. Economic growth is essential for job creation; economies that are 
stagnant or growing slowly create few if any net new jobs. Countries with stronger 
economic and productivity growth and innovation will therefore be expected to 
experience more new labor demand, although the amount and nature of job creation will 
vary depending on the sectors that drive growth. 

  Demographics. Demographics affect both labor demand and labor supply. Countries 
with a rapidly-growing workforce, such as India, may enjoy a “demographic dividend” 
that boosts GDP growth—if young people are employed. Countries with a shrinking 
workforce, such as Japan, can expect lower future GDP growth, derived only from 
productivity growth. However, countries with a declining workforce need automation to 
offset their shrinking labor supply, while countries with growing workforces have greater 
job creation challenges. 

  Mix of economic sectors and occupations. The automation potential for countries 
reflects the mix of economic sectors and the mix of jobs within each sector. Japan, for 
example, has a higher technical automation potential than the United States because 
the weight of sectors that are highly automatable, such as manufacturing, is higher. And 
within Japanese manufacturing, a larger proportion of jobs involve activities that can be 
more easily automated, such as production, than in the United States.

number 1, 2016.



13Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute

These factors combine to create different outlooks for the future of work in each country 
(Exhibit E7). For instance, Japan is rich but its economy is projected to grow slowly to 2030. 
It faces the combination of slower job creation coming from economic expansion and a 
large share of work that can be automated as a result of high wages and the structure of its 
economy. However, Japan will also see its workforce shrink by 2030 by four million people. 
In the step-up scenario, and considering the jobs in new occupations we cannot envision 
today, Japan’s net change in jobs could be roughly in balance. 

Like Japan, the United States and Germany could also face significant workforce 
displacement from automation by 2030, but their projected future growth—and hence 
new job creation—is higher. The United States has a growing workforce and, in the step-
up scenario, with innovations leading to new types of occupations and work, Germany’s 
workforce will decline by three million by 2030, and it will have more than enough labor 
demand to employ all workers. 

At the other extreme is India: a fast-growing developing country with relatively modest 
potential for automation over the next 15 years, reflecting low wage rates. Our analysis finds 
that most occupational categories are projected to grow in India, reflecting its potential for 
strong economic expansion. However, India’s labor force is expected to grow by 138 million 
people by 2030, or about 30 percent. Employing these new entrants in formal sector jobs 
will require job creation on a much larger scale than in the past. Automation will make this 
challenge more difficult; some fear “jobless growth.”16 However, our analysis suggests 
that India can create enough new jobs to offset automation and employ new entrants, if it 
undertakes the investments in our step-up scenario. 

China and Mexico have higher wages than India, and so are likely to see more automation. 
China is still projected to have robust economic growth and will have a shrinking workforce; 
like Germany, China’s problem could be a shortage of workers. Mexico’s projected rate of 
future economic expansion is more modest, and its workforce will grow by 15 million by 
2030. Like the United States and Japan, our results suggest that Mexico could benefit from 
the job creation in the step-up scenario plus innovation in new occupations and activities to 
make full use of its workforce.

If displaced workers are not reemployed quickly, countries will face rising 
unemployment and depressed wages 
To model the impact of automation on overall employment and wages, we use a general 
equilibrium model of the economies of our six focus countries that takes into account the 
economic impacts of automation and dynamic interactions.17 The model is not intended to 
forecast the future, but rather is a tool to explore the implications of different scenarios. 

Automation has at least three distinct economic impacts. Most attention has been devoted 
to the potential displacement of labor. But automation also may raise labor productivity: 
firms only adopt automation when doing so enables them to produce more or higher-quality 
output with the same or fewer inputs (including material, energy, and labor inputs). The third 
impact is that automation adoption raises investment in the economy, lifting short-term GDP 
growth. We model all three effects.18 We also create different scenarios for how quickly 
displaced workers find new employment, based on historical data. 

The results reveal that across different rates of re-employment, our six countries could 
expect to be at or very near full employment by 2030. Consistent with the historical 
experience, labor markets adjust to technological shocks. However, the model also 
illustrates the importance of reemploying displaced workers quickly. If displaced workers 
are able to be reemployed within one year, our model shows automation lifting the overall 
economy: full employment is maintained in both the short and long-term, wages grow 
faster than in the baseline model, and productivity is higher. However, in scenarios in which 
some displaced workers take years to find new work, unemployment rises in the short- to 
medium-term. The labor market adjusts over time and unemployment falls—but with slower 
average wage growth. In these scenarios, average wages end up lower in 2030 than in 
the baseline model, which could dampen aggregate demand and long-term growth. The 
pace of reemployment will be influenced by the effectiveness of retraining, the capacity of 
companies to innovate and, in some sectors, the elasticity of demand.

WORKERS WILL REQUIRE DIFFERENT SKILLS, AND WAGE POLARIZATION IN 
ADVANCED COUNTRIES COULD CONTINUE 
In all six of our focus countries, we find that in general, the current educational requirements 
of the occupations that may grow are higher than those for the jobs displaced by 
automation. In advanced economies, occupations that currently require only a secondary 
education or less see a net decline from automation, while those occupations requiring 
college degrees and higher grow. In India and other emerging economies, we find higher 
labor demand for all education levels, with the largest number of new jobs in occupations 
requiring a secondary education but the fastest rate of job growth will be for occupations 
currently requiring a college or advanced degree (Exhibit E8). For all countries, increasing 
investments in education and workforce training will be a priority. 

Moreover, we find that workers of the future will spend more time on activities that machines 
are less capable of, such as managing people, applying expertise, and communicating 
with others. They will spend less time on predictable physical activities, and on collecting 
and processing data, where machines already exceed human performance. The skills and 
capabilities required will also shift, requiring more social and emotional skills, and more 
advanced cognitive capabilities, such as logical reasoning and creativity. 

17 We used McKinsey & Company’s Global Growth Model, a supply-side general equilibrium macroeconomic 
model that covers more than 100 countries with data from 1960 through 2015.

18 We obtain data for labor displacement and required firm investment from MGI’s automation model, at the 
midpoint adoption scenario. We make a conservative assumption on the productivity impact of automation, 
that firms produce the same value of output as prior to automation but with fewer workers. See technical 
appendix for more detail.

Wage polarization could be exacerbated in advanced economies but developing 
countries will see a growing middle class 
Wages may stagnate or fall in declining occupations. Although we do not model shifts in 
relative wages across occupations, the basic economics of labor supply and demand 
suggests that this should be the case for occupations in which labor demand declines. 
Since 1980, most advanced economies have seen an overall declining share of national 
income being captured by labor (compared with capital). Recent academic work suggests 
that technological change is one reason for this decline.19 

Our analysis, looking at changes in employment by occupation at today’s relative wage 
levels, shows that most job growth in the United States and other advanced economies 
will be in occupations currently at the high end of the wage distribution. Some occupations 
that are currently low-wage, such as nursing assistants and teaching assistants, will 
also increase, while a wide range of middle-income occupations will have the largest 
employment declines. These results suggest that income polarization could continue. 
Policy choices we identified in our step-up scenario, such as increasing investments in 
infrastructure, buildings, and energy transitions could help create additional demand for 
middle-wage jobs such as construction workers in advanced economies. 

The wage trend picture is quite different in emerging economies such as China and India, 
where our scenarios show that middle-wage jobs such as retail salespeople and teachers 
will grow quickly as these economies develop. This implies that their consuming class will 
continue to grow in the decades ahead. However, our analysis comes with several important 
caveats (see Box E2, “What could overstate or understate the impact scenarios assessed in 
this research—and what we have not considered”). 

BUSINESSES AND POLICYMAKERS WILL NEED TO ACT TO KEEP PEOPLE 
WORKING AS AUTOMATION IS ADOPTED 
The benefits of AI and automation to users and businesses, and the economic growth that 
could come via their productivity contributions, are compelling. They will not only contribute 
to dynamic economies that create jobs, but also help create the economic surpluses that 
will enable societies to address the workforce transitions that will likely happen regardless.  
Faced with the scale of worker transitions we have described, one reaction could be to try 
to slow the pace and scope of adoption in an attempt to preserve the status quo. While this 
may limit the workforce transitions, it would affect the contributions that these technologies 
make to business dynamism and economic growth, via the contribution to productivity 
growth, and which in turn leads to jobs growth and prosperity. We should embrace these 
technologies but also address the workforce transitions and challenges they bring. In many 
countries, this may require an initiative on the scale of the Marshall Plan involving sustained 
investment, new training models, programs to ease worker transitions, income support, and 
collaboration between the public and private sectors. 

Achieving the benefits of deploying automation, such as productivity growth, while 
addressing its challenges, is not impossible. During the transition out of agriculture, for 
example, the United States made a major investment in expanding secondary education, 
and for the first time required all students to attend. Called the High School Movement, 
this raised the rate of high school enrolment of 14- to 17-year-olds from 18 percent in 1910

to 73 percent in 1940, making the US workforce among the best-educated and most 
productive in the world, and enabling the growth of a vibrant manufacturing sector.20 

Policy makers, business leaders, and individual workers all have constructive and important 
roles to play in smoothing workforce transitions ahead. History shows that societies across 
the globe, when faced with monumental challenges, often rise to the occasion for the well-
being of their citizens. Yet over the last few decades, investments and policies to support 
the workforce have eroded. Public spending on labor force training and support has fallen in 
most OECD countries, and corporate spending on training has declined in the United States 
(Exhibit E9). Educational models have not fundamentally changed in 100 years; we still 
use systems designed for an industrial society to prepare students for a rapidly-changing 
knowledge economy. It is now critical to reverse these trends, with governments making 
workforce transitions and job creation a more urgent priority.

19Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute

Today, while policy choices will vary by country, all societies will need to address four key 
areas to smooth the looming workforce transitions: 

  Maintaining robust economic growth to support job creation. Sustaining robust 
aggregate demand growth is critical to support new job creation, as is support for 
new business formation. Fiscal and monetary policies that ensure sufficient aggregate 
demand, as well as support for business investment and innovation, will be essential. 
Targeted initiatives in certain sectors could also help, including by increasing investment 
in infrastructure and energy transitions, as well as policies to enable a shift of unpaid 
household work such as childcare to the market, as discussed in our step-up scenario. 

  Scaling and reimagining job retraining and workforce skills development. Providing 
job retraining and enabling individuals to learn marketable new skills throughout their 
lifetimes will be a critical challenge—and for some countries, the central challenge. 
Midcareer retraining will become ever more important as the skill mix needed for a 
successful career changes. A range of initiatives in countries from Sweden to Singapore 
may point the way to new approaches to improving skills or teaching new ones, including 
to older workers. Governments can play an important role here, as the US government 
did in previous eras with the GI Bill, which enabled just under eight million veterans 
returning from war to go to college or be retrained.21 Programs that can more quickly 
retool the labor force by focusing on re-training and credentialing at the level of skills 
in demand rather than multi-year degrees could be important. Business can take a 
lead in some areas, including with on-the-job training and providing opportunities to 
workers to upgrade their skills, both through in-house training and partnerships with 
education providers. 

  Improving business and labor market dynamism including mobility. Greater fluidity 
will be needed in the labor market to manage the difficult transitions we anticipate. This 
includes restoring now-waning geographic mobility in advanced economies including 
the United States. Digital talent platforms and the rise of the “gig” economy can foster 
fluidity, by matching workers and companies seeking their skills, and by providing a 
plethora of new work opportunities for those open to taking them.22 Policy makers 
in countries with relatively inflexible labor markets can learn from others that have 
deregulated, such as Germany, which transformed its federal unemployment agency into 
a powerful job-matching entity. Governments may also update labor market regulations 
to ensure that gig economy jobs are not subject to discrimination, and that remaining 
uncertainties about worker benefits are resolved. 

  Providing income and transition support to workers. Income support and other 
forms of transition assistance to help displaced workers find gainful employment will 
be essential. Beyond retraining, a range of policies can help, including unemployment 
insurance, public assistance in finding work, and portable benefits that follow workers 
between jobs. We know from history and from our analysis that wages for many 
occupations can be depressed for some time during workforce transitions. More 
permanent policies to supplement work incomes might be needed to support aggregate 
demand and ensure societal fairness. Possible solutions to supplement incomes, such 
as more comprehensive minimum wage policies, universal basic income, or wage gains 
tied to productivity, are all being explored.

Summary of findings McKinsey Global Institute20

Business leaders have much to gain by early adoption of automation technologies, 
enabling performance benefits such as quality and speed, as well as greater efficiency 
and productive use of all factors of production. Businesses will be on the front lines of the 
workplace as it changes.  That will require them to both retool their business processes 
and re-evaluate their talent strategies and workforce needs, carefully considering which 
individuals are needed, which can be redeployed to other jobs, and where new talent may 
be needed. Many companies are finding it is in their self-interest—as well as important for 
societal responsibility—to train and prepare workers for a new world of work. 

Individuals, too, will need to be prepared for a rapidly evolving future of work. Acquiring new 
skills that are in demand and resetting intuition about the world of work will be critical for 
their own well-being. There will be demand for human labor, but workers everywhere will 
need to rethink traditional notions of where they work, how they work, and what talents and 
capabilities they bring to that work. Ultimately, we will all need creative visions for how our 
lives are organized and valued in the future, in a world where the role and meaning of work 
start to shift. 

•••

Automation represents both hope and challenge. The global economy needs the boost to 
productivity and growth that it will bring, especially at a time when aging populations are 
acting as a drag on GDP growth. Machines can take on work that is routine, dangerous, or 
dirty, and may allow us all to use our intrinsically human talents more fully. But to capture 
these benefits, societies will need to prepare for complex workforce transitions ahead. For 
policy makers, business leaders, and individual workers the world over, the task at hand 
is to prepare for a more automated future by emphasizing new skills, scaling up training, 
especially for midcareer workers, and ensuring robust economic growth.

empirical exploration,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics, volume 18, number 4, November 2003.

We analyze scenarios for the net impact of automation 
and future labor demand on employment, skills, and 
wages. Most of them suggest that, while there will be 
enough work to maintain full employment in the long 
term, ensuring that displaced workers have the skills and 
support needed to obtain the new jobs will be critical. 
If workers are not re-employed quickly, the impact on 
wage growth could be negative. This conclusion could 
overstate or understate the impact. 

On the one hand, the future disruption could be smaller 
than we anticipate for several reasons: 

  Adopting automation requires significant investments 
and redesign of business processes, and companies 
have been slow to adopt digital technologies, let alone 
recent forms of AI and automation.1 In our slowest 
automation adoption scenario, less than 5 percent of 
work is automated by 2030, so the overall impact on 
the economy could be minimal. 

  In our analysis, we make the strong assumption that 
every hour of work that is automated results in one 
hour less of work for a full-time equivalent employee. 
But companies often choose to redefine occupations, 
or redeploy some workers instead. For instance, after 
the introduction of the ATM, the number of bank tellers 
in the United States continued to grow for many years, 
even as the activities they performed changed.2 

  Our model of the seven catalysts of labor demand 
does not take into account dynamic effects within the 
economy, and they represent only a partial list of future 
sources of labor demand. If automation adoption is 
rapid, future productivity growth could be higher than 
we model, and this could raise incomes and result in 
more job creation than we anticipate. This could offset 
the labor displacement, even during the transition. 

On the other hand, the impact of automation on 
work could be more disruptive than we anticipate for 
several reasons: 

  The development of automation technologies, 
including AI, could accelerate or break through new 
frontiers. AI researchers today say that machine 
learning has unlocked more rapid improvements in 
the technology than could have been imagined even a 
few years ago. Improvements in machine capabilities 

in areas such as natural language understanding 
and generation could mean that more work might be 
automated more rapidly than we estimate here. 

  While we assume that wage levels will play a major 
role in determining automation adoption, companies 
may also adopt these technologies for other reasons, 
including their capacity to exceed human performance 
capabilities in some areas. This would mean more 
rapid automation adoption than we model, particularly 
in low-wage economies and for low-wage work in 
advanced economies.

  Displaced workers might not find new work quickly, 
or at all, because they lack the skills or educational 
requirements, or because other barriers such as 
cultural preferences or geographic mobility stand 
in their way. There are few examples of large-scale 
retraining and redeployment of midcareer workers. 
Moreover, labor markets may not work as well as 
they need to do to help displaced workers find 
new employment. 

  The assumptions we make on future consumption 
growth and spending on infrastructure and buildings 
might be too optimistic. In the past decade, actual 
GDP growth in nearly all advanced economies has 
been lower than forecast. Continued sluggish growth, 
rising geopolitical tensions, or a new recession could 
make our future job creation scenarios too optimistic. 

A number of other caveats to our findings should also be 
noted. We have not made assumptions in our modeling 
about sector trends, such as the growth of ecommerce 
in retailing, or the impact of fiscal constraints on public 
sector employment. We also do not model changes in 
work structure, such as the growth of the gig economy, 
or activities within an occupation that could change 
as a result of technological innovation. Our analysis of 
wage trends is based on current average wages for each 
occupation in each country, and we do not model wages 
over time by occupation based on the dynamics of labor 
supply and demand. Finally, we do not model changing 
skill requirements for occupations or analyze the “skill 
bias” of automation technologies, that is, whether they will 
enable high-skill workers at the expense of low-skill ones, 
or vice-versa.3

We live in an age when machines answer customer inquiries, help doctors understand 
X-rays, lip-read better than human professionals, and sort trash into compost and 
recyclables—an age, too, when the public debate about automation and its impact on the 
workplace raises anxious questions. First is the existential one about the future of work 
itself. Given rapid advances in technologies including robotics and artificial intelligence, will 
there be enough work to ensure full employment? Second is the question about what those 
jobs will be, and which skills will be needed for them. The third is what all this could mean 
for wages. 

We seek to address these questions in this report through, first, an analysis of automation 
potential and scenarios about the extent of adoption of current work activities by 2030 
and, second, an analysis of potential future labor demand. We looked at 46 countries, 
representing almost 90 percent of global GDP. To illustrate the potential impact at a country 
level, we use six as exemplars of countries that vary by sector and occupation mix, GDP per 
capita growth, wage rates, and demographics: China, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, and 
the United States.23 

In this chapter, we focus on automation’s potential to transform the workplace. Building 
on our previous automation work, we create a range for the number of hours that could be 
displaced by automation by 2030, and seek to identify the work activities, occupations, and 
sectors that are most—and least—susceptible to being automated (see Box 1, “Automation’s 
rapid advances and its limitations—for now”).24 

Among the findings of our new research are that as much as 30 percent of the hours 
worked globally could be automated by 2030, depending on the speed of adoption, with 
15 percent of current work activities being automated in our midpoint scenario. The speed 
of adoption depends on factors including technical feasibility, the pace of technology 
development, costs, and social and regulatory acceptance. These results differ significantly 
by country, reflecting the mix of activities currently performed by workers and prevailing 
wage rates, ranging from 9 percent in India to 26 percent in Japan in the midpoint adoption 
rate scenario.

Automation is not a new phenomenon; industrial robots 
have been a fixture on factory floors for several decades, 
and software algorithms help logistics companies 
optimize the route planning of deliveries in a faster and 
more efficient manner than human route planners could. 

Recent developments in robotics, artificial intelligence, 
and machine learning are noteworthy for the advances 
they represent, however. We are on the cusp of a new 
automation age in which technologies not only do things 
we thought only humans could do, but can increasingly 
do them at a superhuman level. In just the past year, 
a project by Google’s DeepMind and the University of 
Oxford has applied deep learning to a huge data set 
of BBC programs to create a lip-reading system that 
is substantially more proficient than a professional 
human lip-reader.1 Researchers at Stanford University 
have developed a deep learning system that is able 
to diagnose pneumonia from chest x-rays better than 
expert radiologists working alone.2 Robot “skin” made of 
a piezotronic transistor mesh developed by the Georgia 
Institute of Technology and covered in thousands of 
mechanical hairs can “feel” textures and find objects by 
touch.3 Companies are using advanced facial analysis to 
monitor emotional responses to advertisements and other 
digital media content, via a webcam.4 

AI is already being deployed in synthetic biology, cancer 
research, climate science, and material science. For 
example, researchers at Vanderbilt university have 
used computers to exceed the human standard in 
predicting the most effective treatment for major 
depressive disorders and eventual outcomes of breast 
cancer patients.5 

Three factors are driving the technological advances: 

  Machine-learning algorithms have progressed in 
recent years, especially through the development of 
deep learning and reinforcement-learning techniques 
based on neural networks. 

  Computing capacity is increasing exponentially 
and has become available to train larger and more 
complex models much faster. Graphics processing 
units, originally designed to render the computer 
graphics in video games, have been repurposed to 
execute the data and algorithm crunching required for 
machine learning at speeds many times faster than 
traditional processor chips. This computing capacity 
has been aggregated in hyper-scalable data centers 
and made accessible to users through the cloud. 

  Vast amounts of data that can be used to train 
machine learning models are being generated, for 
example through daily creation of billions of images, 
online click streams, voice and video, mobile 
locations, and sensors embedded in the Internet 
of Things. 

Formidable technical challenges still lie ahead. While 
machines can be trained to perform a range of cognitive 
tasks, they remain limited. They are not yet good at 
putting knowledge into context, let alone improvising, and 
they have little of the common sense that is the essence of 
human experience and emotion. They struggle to operate 
without a pre-defined methodology. They can replicate 
fugues in the style of Bach, but cannot yet understand 
sarcasm or love.6 

One of the biggest remaining technical challenges is 
mastery of natural language processing—understanding 
and generating speech. These capabilities are 
indispensable for numerous work activities but, despite 
great progress in areas such as machine translation, 
machines still have far to go to achieve human levels 
of performance. 

Beyond the development of technology, much work 
remains to be done integrating different capabilities into 
holistic solutions in which everything works together 
seamlessly. Combining a range of technologies will be 
essential for workplace automation, but engineering 
such solutions—whether for hardware or software—is a 
difficult process.

BUT WILL AFFECT EMPLOYMENT: A BRIEF RECAP OF OUR PRIOR RESEARCH 
In our January 2017 report, A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity, 
we noted that automation technologies such as advanced robotics and artificial intelligence 
are powerful drivers of productivity and economic growth which can help create economic 
surpluses and increase overall societal prosperity. Key findings of that report include: 

  Automation could accelerate the productivity of the global economy by between 0.8 and 
1.4 percent of global GDP annually, assuming that human labor replaced by automation 
rejoins the workforce and is as productive as it was in 2014. Automation on its own will 
not be sufficient to achieve long-term economic growth aspirations across the world; 
for that, additional productivity-boosting measures will be needed, including reworking 
business processes or developing new products and services. Nonetheless, the 
productivity growth enabled by automation can ensure continued prosperity in aging 
nations and provide an additional boost to fast-growing ones.25 

  For companies, the deployment of automation can deliver benefits in the form of labor 
cost savings, but also in myriad other performance-enhancing ways. It can enable firms 
to get closer to customers and predict maintenance needs, sharply reducing the cost of 
operations in some activities and extending the life of existing capital assets. Automation 
can also increase scale and speed. Nissan, for example, has halved the time it takes 
to move from final product design to production thanks to an automated system, while 
BMW has reduced machine downtime by 30 to 40 percent—effectively generating fresh 
economies of scale with minimal investment—through AI-enabled condition-based 
maintenance.26 Exhibit 1 compares the estimated potential performance and labor cost 
reduction benefits from automation for a number of key processes within some sectors. 
These findings are based on estimates of potential in case studies informed by our work 
with industry. 

  Overall, our analysis suggested that roughly 50 percent of the time spent on activities 
that people are paid almost $15 trillion to do in the global economy have the theoretical 
potential to be automated by adapting currently demonstrated technology—in other 
words, the technical capabilities already exist, although an integrated solution to 
automate each particular activity might not yet have been developed nor deployed. We 
estimated the potential for technology to automate the more than 2,000 work activities 
in about 800 occupations across the economy, by adapting currently demonstrated 
technologies. (We examined work activities individually rather than whole occupations, 
since occupations consist of a range of activities with different potential for automation). 
Certain categories of activity are more susceptible to automation than others.27 While 
less than 5 percent of occupations can be fully automated, about 60 percent have 
at least 30 percent of activities that can technically be automated (see illustration, 
“Automation: A global force that will transform economies and the workforce”). 

  Our automation analysis found significant variation among sectors of the economy, 
and among the occupations within those sectors. For example, almost one-fifth of 
the time spent in US workplaces involves predictable physical activity and is prevalent 
in such sectors as manufacturing and retail trade. Accordingly, these sectors have a 
relatively high technical potential for automation by adapting currently demonstrated 
technologies. Even within sectors, there is considerable variation. In manufacturing, for 

25 Even at historical rates of productivity growth, economic growth could be nearly halved as a result of this aging 
trend. Global growth: Can productivity save the day in an aging world? McKinsey Global Institute, January 
2015.

example, occupations that have a large proportion of physical activities in predictable 
environments such as factory welders have a technical automation potential above 
90 percent, whereas for customer service representatives that potential is less than 
30 percent. 

  Technical feasibility is an essential element of automation but four other factors also 
influence the timing, which explains in part why our overall analysis of automation 
adoption and the impact on employment to 2030 can vary among countries. The other 
factors are economic and social: the cost of developing and deploying automation 
solutions for the workplace—that is actually developing integrated solutions for 
specific use cases; labor market dynamics including the supply, demand, and cost of 
human labor; the net economic benefits of automation, which include performance 
benefits beyond labor substitution such as higher throughput, raised productivity, and 
heightened safety; and regulatory and social acceptance. Labor market dynamics in 
particular plays an important role in the national variations around automation adoption, 
since wage rates vary widely by country, even for similar occupations. The relative cost 
of automation compared with the cost of labor will affect adoption: if qualified workers 
are in abundant supply and significantly less expensive than automation, this could be 
a decisive argument against automation in that situation. Consequently, in the period 
to 2030, we expect advanced economies, with wage levels that are relatively higher, to 
adopt automation earlier than many emerging economies, especially if adoption requires 
expensive hardware solutions. That said, our automation modeling does consider the 
continuing improvement in automation technologies’ capabilities over time, as well as 
decreasing costs.

AUTOMATION COULD REPLACE 9 TO 26 PERCENT OF THE WORK HOURS IN 
OUR SIX FOCUS COUNTRIES BY 2030 
Our automation model applies the factors listed above to a range of scenarios, bookended 
by two scenarios around the earliest adoption and latest adoption we modeled. It is not our 
intention to predict the timing but to provide a range, and these two edge case scenarios 
may turn out to be extreme. However, they do enable us to model a spectrum of outcomes. 

While about half of all work activities globally have the technical potential to be automated 
by adapting currently demonstrated technologies, according to our prior research on 
automation, this will not happen overnight. Taking into account the technical, economic and 
social factors affecting the pace and extent of automation, described above, the proportion 
of work actually displaced by 2030 will likely be lower. We estimate that up to 30 percent 
of current work activities could be displaced by 2030, with a midpoint of 15 percent, or the 
hours of about 400 million full-time equivalents. Indeed, the range of outcomes is particularly 
wide in 2030 in our model; in the event of late automation adoption, the percentage of 
work activities displaced by 2030 would be close to zero. Among countries, too, especially 
between advanced economies and emerging ones, the range is wide. Exhibit 2 highlights 
both how we arrived at our range of automation scenarios, and the modeling we used 
for estimating scenarios for future labor demand, which we describe in detail in the 
following chapter.

For the six countries we use as exemplars in this report, the hours that could be automated 
by 2030 in the midpoint adoption case range from 26 percent of the hours worked in 
Japan to 9 percent in India (Exhibit 3). Developed countries Germany (24 percent) and the 
United States (23 percent) are not far behind Japan, followed by China (16 percent) and 
Mexico (13 percent). In general, wage rates are the biggest determinant of the difference 
in automation scenarios among countries; higher wage rates make automation more 
economically attractive. In addition, the mix of activities, which is related to the mix of sectors 
and occupations, also affects the modeled rate of automation. Among the main differences 
between emerging and advanced economies is the importance of agriculture in the former. 
In Germany and Japan, manufacturing also has high automation potential. That said, 
emerging economies could leverage automation technologies aggressively in an effort to 
leapfrog their economic development. China, for example, has fewer robots per worker than 
the global average, but received nearly one-third of all robot shipments in 2016.28 

At the other extreme of the scenarios we modeled, in our latest adoption scenario, less than 
0.5 percent of work hours globally will be automated by 2030, and advanced economies will 
account for the large majority of them.

Automation will displace workers with different educational attainment across 
a wide range of occupations 
Just as there is a wide variation in automation’s impact on countries and sectors, so, too, its 
effect on specific occupations will vary. Those professions highly dependent on the work 
activities we identified as most susceptible to automation—physical work in a predictable 
environment, or data collection and processing—are likely to be the most affected, 
especially if automation adoption occurs earlier, which we anticipate to be the case in 
countries with high wages such as Japan, Germany, and other advanced economies. By 
comparison, occupations that require application of expertise, interaction with stakeholders, 
management and coaching of others, or a high degree of social and emotional response will 
be less susceptible to automation in the period to 2030. 

Occupations incorporating significant amounts of physical work in predictable environments 
including production workers and  building and grounds cleaners, as well as office support 
(such as clerks and administrative assistants), are likely to face significant displacement 
of their activities by automation, while doctors, health aides, and other care providers and 
professionals including engineers and business specialists are less likely to experience as 
much displacement. 

The current level of educational requirements for occupations tends to be correlated with 
the likelihood that their activities can be automated. The technical automation potential for 
occupations requiring less than a high school diploma is 55 percent, whereas for those with 
a college degree, that potential is far lower, at just 22 percent. Occupations requiring some 
post-secondary education generally include work activities that are less automatable than 
those requiring a high school diploma and some experience, and so on (Exhibit 4).

•••

Countries and companies have compelling reasons to embrace automation, since the 
technologies will give a much-needed boost to productivity in the global economy. 
Depending on the pace of adoption, however, automation technologies in the workplace 
could displace workers in a wide range of sectors; in our most aggressive scenario for early 
adoption, almost one-third of work hours in the global economy could be automated by 
2030—although other, later adoption scenarios have less dramatic outcomes in that time 
frame. Economic and social factors beyond technical feasibility affect adoption, and these 
could lead to strong variations in adoption rates among sectors and countries. Under these 
circumstances, what will be the future of work? Will the global economy create enough 
additional jobs to offset those lost to automation, regardless of when adoption takes place? 
And if so, what sort of jobs will those be, requiring which skills, and paying what wages? In 
the next two chapters, we highlight findings of our analysis of future labor demand and the 
complex workforce transitions that automation will likely set in motion.

For centuries, the arrival of new technology in the workplace has sparked workers’ fears—
and, sometimes, violent backlash. Already in 1589, England’s Queen Elizabeth I refused to 
grant a patent to a stocking frame invented by William Lee because she was supposedly 
concerned about the effect on hand knitters.29 In the early 19th century, textile workers in 
Britain and France smashed automated looms in their factories and printers struck to protest 
the arrival of steam-powered presses.30 

Leading thinkers in the past, from David Ricardo to Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes, 
raised concerns about the effect of technological change on employment, and opinion polls 
show that anxiety has come to the fore again, amid rapid advances in robotics and artificial 
intelligence.31 A number of prominent academics and technologists argue that the latest 
wave of automation technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, will 
be particularly disruptive to the workforce.32 

In this chapter, we examine the historical impact of technology on employment, skills, and 
wages. History does not necessarily repeat itself, but it does provide valuable context 
and possible lessons for the future of labor demand in a time of automation. Among those 
lessons are that technological innovation in the past has enabled the creation of many 
more new jobs than it has destroyed, raising productivity, spurring sustained increases in 
living standards, and bringing about a shift in the balance of work and leisure. However, 
the transition has not always been smooth: for example, real wages stagnated for nearly 
50 years in 19th century England during the Industrial Revolution there, and only picked up 
again at a time of substantial social policy reforms. Charles Dickens among other novelists 
used the harsh realities of everyday life for displaced and other workers as material for 
his works. History also shows that robust aggregate demand and economic growth are 
essential for job creation. New technologies have raised productivity growth, enabling firms 
to lower prices for consumers, pay higher wages, or distribute profits to shareholders. This 
stimulates demand across the economy, boosting job creation.

1989.

30 The most celebrated anti-technology protests were conducted by “Luddites” in Nottingham, England, in 
1811, but they were not alone. French textile workers staged an uprising in a silk factory in Lyons in 1831 
known as the revolt of the Canuts. Fernand Rude, La Révolte des canuts 1831–1834, La Découverte, 2001. A 
strike by Times of London newspaper printers in 1814 linked to the introduction of steam presses was quelled 
only after the paper’s owners promised to keep on printers. Elizabeth L. Eisenstein, The printing press as an 
agent of change, Cambridge University Press, 1980. 

31 Political economist David Ricardo worried in the early 19th century that machines would make labor 
redundant, while Karl Marx in the 1850s foresaw an era when the means of labor would be transformed 
by “an automatic system of machinery.” In 1930, John Maynard Keynes coined the term “technological 
unemployment” to describe a situation in which innovation that economized on the use of labor outstripped 
the pace at which new jobs could be created, in a “temporary phase of maladjustment.” David Ricardo, On 
the principles of political economy and taxation, 1817; Karl Marx, Grundrisse: Foundations of the critique of 
political economy, 1858; John Maynard Keynes, “Economic possibilities for our grandchildren,” in Essays in 
Persuasion, Macmillan 1933.

2. LESSONS FROM HISTORY ON 
TECHNOLOGY AND EMPLOYMENT 



2. Lessons from history on technology and employment McKinsey Global Institute34

LARGE-SCALE SECTOR EMPLOYMENT DECLINES HAVE BEEN MORE THAN 
OFFSET BY OTHER SECTORS EMPLOYING WORKERS 
Since the First Industrial Revolution began in England in the 18th century, the economies 
of Europe, the United States, and other countries have undergone two profound waves 
of structural change. Mechanization enabled a revolution in agriculture and in industry, 
prompting a migration of workers from the countryside to cities. A second structural shift 
has occurred in the past 60 years as the share of manufacturing employment has declined 
in some countries even as growth in service sectors accelerates.33 

The employment shifts accompanying this process of structural transformation have been 
very large. In the United States, for instance, the agriculture share of employment declined 
from 58 percent of total employment in 1850 to 2.5 percent of employment today (Exhibit 5). 
In just 40 years, between 1880 and 1920, the share of agricultural employment declined 
25 percentage points. During the same decades, other sectors were being transformed by 
mechanization and electrification as well: the share of miners and household workers, for 
example maids and servants, also declined, although these shifts affected fewer workers. 
Since 1960, when the second wave of structural transformation began, manufacturing fell 
from 27 percent of total US employment to 9 percent today, as automation and global trade 
transformed manufacturing and as demand for services exploded. 

The patterns are broadly similar in other countries, although there are some notable 
differences in the pace. China’s shifting sector mix in recent years has been especially rapid: 
agricultural employment fell as a share of total employment by 32 percentage points in just 
25 years, from 60 percent in 1990 to 28 percent in 2015.34 In Mexico, the agriculture share 
of employment declined from 52 percent in 1960 to 13 percent in 2015, although in contrast 
with China, the decline has been gradual and continuous across decades. In Japan, 
agricultural employment declined from a 31 percent share of total employment in 1960 to 
3.5 percent in 2015, while manufacturing’s share of total employment dropped from its peak 
in 1973 of 25 percent to 13 percent in 2015. 

Throughout these large shifts of workers across occupations and industries, overall 
employment as a share of the population has generally continued to grow. New industries 
and occupations emerged to absorb workers displaced by technology, although as we 
discuss below, the transition has not always been smooth. 

Magnitude of potential job dislocation from automation through 2030 is 
not unprecedented 
When we compare historical sector employment to potential labor displacement from our 
automation model, we see that even in the earliest automation scenario, future rates of labor 
displacement from automation within specific sectors are not unprecedented. For example, 
our analysis shows that a number of sectors in different countries, including agriculture 
in China, Germany, and Japan, and manufacturing in the United States, have declined by 
30 percent and more over a period of 15 years. Our analyses of scenarios of automation 
displacement over the 15 years from 2016 to 2030 are within the same range (Exhibit 6).

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE SPARKS RISING PRODUCTIVITY AND 
AGGREGATE EMPLOYMENT 
History shows that the adoption of technological innovation can act as a powerful stimulus 
on the economy and jobs. The overall effect of mechanization has been to create jobs on an 
unprecedented scale. Machines allow workers to produce more, thereby raising productivity 
and (eventually) wages, and lowering the price of goods for consumers. These twin effects 
unleash new demand for all goods and services. In addition, as firms gain scale, they require 
more managers, accountants, and other office workers. 

This dynamic is the reason that aggregate employment has grown over the long term, 
even as the size of the workforce has grown. In the United States, for example, female 
employment almost doubled as a proportion of working-age women from 32 percent in 
1950 to 60 percent in the late 1990s before falling back to 57 percent today. Yet this major 
shift did not reduce overall employment. Indeed, employment grew: the total number 
of people employed in the United States more than doubled from 65 million in 1960 to 
152 million in 2017, according to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Similar trends 
have occurred in other countries. 

Technology enables productivity growth, raises incomes, and stimulates new 
consumer demand 
Evidence of the economy-wide positive correlation among technology, productivity, and 
employment can be seen in the aggregate data across countries. Within an industry, 
machines and automation can sometimes contribute to employment declines. For instance, 
in the United States, one recent study found that every industrial robot deployed results in 
the reduction of six human workers within the surrounding metropolitan area.35 However, 
when looking at the total economy, we see the opposite effect: rising productivity (often 
from technology) is usually accompanied by employment growth, not decline. This is 
because automation raises productivity, which in turn increases incomes of workers and/or 
shareholders. Higher incomes are spent, creating demand for goods and services across 
the economy.36 

When there has been a tradeoff between employment growth and labor productivity 
growth, it has been short-lived. Looking at the United States since 1960, for example, our 
analysis shows that employment and productivity both grew in 79 percent of individual 
years, while productivity grew while employment declined in 12 percent of years. But 
both employment and productivity grew in 95 percent of rolling three-year periods and 
100 percent of rolling 10-year periods. This phenomenon is also seen in other countries. 
In China, employment and productivity both increased in 77 percent of individual years 
but 98 percent of the 10-year periods between 1960 and 2016. In Germany, which saw 
unemployment rise after reunification, employment and productivity grew in 68 percent of 
individual years but 81 percent of rolling 10-year periods (Exhibit 7).

Even as productivity growth leads to rising incomes, technological innovation can also 
reduce prices and increase the quality of goods and services.37 This combination can cause 
demand for a product to soar, resulting in higher employment even within the sector itself. 
The Ford Model T provides one historical example. The assembly line dramatically improved 
the productivity of the process of manufacturing automobiles. Exhibit 8 shows that over 
a six-year period, the number of Model Ts produced per worker annually nearly tripled, 
from eight to 21. The surge in productivity, combined with increasing economies of scale, 
enabled Ford to reduce the price from $950 in 1909 to $440 in 1915. As a result, the number 
of cars sold increased 30-fold, and employment rose from 1,655 to 18,892.38

TECHNOLOGY DISPLACES SOME WORK BUT CREATES NEW JOBS, 
SOMETIMES IN UNFORESEEN WAYS 
It is easy to see which jobs are being destroyed by technology, but difficult to imagine 
which jobs will be created by it. Telephone switchboard operators have gone the way of 
lamplighters in the 19th century, but how many of them, lamenting the loss of their jobs, 
could have imagined the development of the smartphone—and the huge global industry 
employing tens of millions of people that has sprung up around it? More than 50 years 
ago, Joseph Schumpeter coined the phrase “creative destruction” to describe this age-old 
phenomenon in which the emergence of new technology “destroys” jobs by rendering them 
obsolete, and “creates” new jobs in their wake.39

Not only does technology create new occupations, it can also change existing occupations 
in unpredictable ways. After ATMs were introduced in the United States, for example, the 
number of bank tellers actually rose, as banks competed to provide higher-quality services 
to customers and the role of tellers changed from dispensing cash to providing broader 
advice and services. The reduction in the number of tellers per branch enabled banks to 
open more branches and make retail banking more convenient for customers, which drove 
the demand for more tellers.40 From 1991 to 2007, the number of ATMs and tellers in the 
United States both increased. However, that trend reversed as Internet banking and the 
2008 financial crisis resulted in cutbacks in bank branches and tellers. 

To better understand the pattern of job creation and destruction, we conducted case 
studies of two technologies in the United States—personal computers and automobiles—
to estimate the number and types of jobs lost to the new technology and the number of 
new jobs created. In both cases, our research reveals that while some work activities 
declined, sometimes rapidly, new types of work activities were created. The net impact of 
both technologies was highly positive, creating new jobs that made up 10 percent of total 
employment over four decades. 

The personal computer enabled the creation of 15.8 million net new jobs since 
1980, accounting for 10 percent of employment 
Computer-related industries such as computer and data processing services and computer 
and related equipment manufacturing have been growing rapidly since the 1970s. Microsoft 
and Apple were founded in that decade. Laptop computers came on the market in the early 
1980s, and this century has seen the rapid rise of smartphones and tablets. 

The growth of computers has generated significant employment: in the United States, 
we estimate that computers have enabled the net creation of 15.8 million jobs since 1970 
(Exhibit 9). We arrive at this figure by tallying employment gains and losses in different 
sectors and occupations. We find that in total, we can identify 3.5 million jobs destroyed by 
the introduction of computers, including those in typewriter manufacturing, secretarial work, 
and bookkeeping. But at least 19.3 million were created in a wide range of occupations 
and industries. 

When digital editing made it easier and more efficient for authors to type and then directly 
edit their own work, computers eliminated the need for people specialized in editing 
and re-typing documents. Employment for typists and secretaries fell significantly, by 
1.4 million between 1990 and 2015, even as the overall US workforce grew. The number of 
bookkeeping clerks also declined, by an annual average of 3 percent in the same period, as 
accounting moved from physical books to accounting software, resulting in nearly 900,000 
fewer jobs. 

But many new jobs were also created. These include jobs in the computer manufacturing 
industry and supplier industries (such as semiconductors), as well as employment in 
occupations enabled by computers (IT systems administrators, computer scientists in other 
industries), and in occupations that use computers (customer service call centers, which 
barely existed before computers, and ecommerce). Of this total, only about 1 percent of net 
new jobs came directly from the computer manufacturing industry and only 3 percent came 
from supplier industries. 

40 Ibid. James Bessen, Learning by doing, 2015. 



41Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute

A larger share of employment gains has come in professions enabled by computers 
(18 percent of net employment created). This includes the entire computer software and 
services industry, with companies such as Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft. This industry 
employs three million people in the United States, including software and app developers, 
computer scientists, and managers and office workers. 

Because of the multitude of applications of the computer, over 75 percent of net 
employment generated has been in occupations that use computers. For example, 
employment of computer scientists in finance, manufacturing, business services, and 
other industries grew rapidly, by an annual average of about 7 percent, between 1980 
and 2015. In the same period, employment of financial managers and specialists able to 
use spreadsheets to track and analyze large amounts of company data grew by about 
3 percent annually on average (see Box 2, “The impact of personal computer and Internet 
technologies on information analysts”).

Box 2. The impact of personal computer and Internet technologies on 
information analysts 

1 Under information analysts we have included the following Bureau of Labor Statistics occupations: credit 
analysts, budget analysts, financial analysts, operations research analyst, economists, market researchers 
and survey researchers, and management analysts.

In theory, at least, many information analysts might have been replaced by the rise of the 
Internet, which makes collecting data and information vastly more efficient, and computers 
that enable rapid and complex computations. After all, much of their work in the 1980s, 
before these technologies were widespread, has since been automated.1 

In fact, the opposite has happened. Computers and the Internet automated activities such 
as basic mathematics and information gathering, yet the number of information analysts 
soared nonetheless. As computers became more efficient, the cost of obtaining high-quality 
information dropped. Rather than decreasing demand for analysts, this stimulated the 
appetite for more insightful and low-cost analysis, and the number of analysts quintupled 
from around 400,000 in 1980 to about two million today (Exhibit 10). 

The jobs of analysts have changed as well. With information and data more easily 
accessible, analysts can focus on making sense of—and sharing—information rather than 
gathering it.

As computer adoption increased, computer use was correlated with higher wages; 
employees in these occupations often acquired new skills to use computers, and could 
demand higher wage premiums.41 For example, graphic designers took over the jobs of 
typesetters and started doing a wider range of tasks. Wages increased accordingly as they 
learned how to use new software and developed higher value skills.42 

The automobile’s largest employment effect has been in enabled industries 
The introduction of the automobile created 6.9 million net new jobs in the United States 
between 1910 and 1950, based on our estimates.43 This is equivalent to 11 percent of the 
US workforce in 1950. This includes 7.5 million jobs created, and 623,000 jobs destroyed. 
Workers displaced by the automobile include manufacturers of wagons, carriages, 
harnesses and saddles, and of railroad equipment and carriages, as well as supplier 
industries such as horse breeders and metal work occupations, and enabled industries 
such as livery services and message boys. 

Ten times as many jobs were created in a host of new occupations. About 10 percent were 
within the auto manufacturing industry (Exhibit 11). Three times as many jobs were in the 
automotive supply chain, including metal parts manufacturers, warehouses and logistics, 
and wholesalers. An even larger share of jobs was created in enabled industries and 
occupations that use the automobile. Enabled industries include auto dealerships, auto 
repair, gas stations, and convenience stores, and these account for around 30 percent of 
net new jobs created. Utilizer industries, meanwhile, include transportation and logistics 
occupations, and account for about 25 percent of employment generated. 

If we had extended our analysis beyond 1950, we would have seen the continuing 
transformative impact of the automobile on the economy and society. Building of the US 
interstate highway system began in the 1950s, transforming logistics networks. This in 
turn gave rise to the concept of the “family vacation,” long-haul car trips and demand for 
roadside attractions, motels, and campgrounds. Drive-in movies and restaurants, shopping 
malls on the edges of towns, and parking lots sprang up. The automobile also enabled 
growth in suburbs, as workers could commute to jobs from locations outside urban public 
transportation networks. 

THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED HAS DECLINED, WHILE LEISURE TIME 
HAS RISEN 
While past technological disruptions did not reduce the amount of work available to 
people, they nonetheless had one significant effect: a decline in the average number of 
hours worked per week—and conversely an increase in the amount of leisure enjoyed by 
individuals. Already in 1930, John Maynard Keynes predicted the advent of greater leisure: 
“For the first time since his creation man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem—
how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, 
which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably 
and well.”44 

In hindsight, Keynes was right: the average number of hours worked each week by 
employed workers has declined significantly in the past 150 years, giving workers more 
time for leisure. In 1870, workers in Germany, Sweden, and the United States averaged 
between 62 and 70 hours each week; in the United Kingdom, which was already shifting

from agriculture to industry, the average worker put in 57 hours per week (Exhibit 12). By 
2015, these figures had fallen by roughly half, to around 35 hours in Germany, Sweden, and 
the United Kingdom and 38.6 hours in the United States. Hours worked have continued 
to decline as the workforce shifted from manufacturing to services in the past 50 years. 
In OECD countries, the average hours work declined to 36 hours in 2015 from 42 hours 
between 1960 and 1980.45 This trend is especially pronounced in Australia, Denmark, 
Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Sweden.

The decline in average hours worked reflects the productivity improvements that have 
compounded over the years, allowing people to work less per week and yet still support 
growing economies. Differences between countries reflect different labor policies and social 
institutions governing the number of expected hours of work per week and vacation days. In 
the early 20th century, labor unions in the United States and in Europe pushed for national 
policies to cap the work week at 40 hours (which eventually became an International 
Labour Organization standard). In European countries such as France and Germany, a 
second wave of working-hour reductions took place in the 1980s and 1990s; in France, the 
government lowered the official work week to 35 hours—and today there is some evidence

that French people would work more if they could.46 Since 1960, the total hours worked has 
declined by 26 percent in Germany, 8 percent in Italy, and 7 percent in France. 

The decline in average hours worked also reflects the steady rise of part-time employment 
across countries. The highest proportion of part-time work is in the Netherlands 
(39 percent of employed persons), the United Kingdom (24 percent), and Germany and 
Japan (22 percent).47 Part-time work is often preferred for a variety of reasons by students, 
caregivers, and people nearing retirement, but also by some employers in markets where 
rigid labor market policies make full-time hiring economically unattractive. In the past 
decade, the number of people in the United States and Europe who earn money in the 
independent workforce—as freelancers, independent contractors, self-employed, and 
workers in the “gig” economy—has grown, to an estimated 162 million.48 Many of these 
individuals work less than a full-time schedule. 

As leisure time increases, people spend money on hobbies, entertainment, and other 
personal services, giving rise to entire new industries that in turn create jobs. Skiing, golfing, 
tourism, crafting, and do-it-yourself home projects are a just a few industries that have 
sprung from the new leisure economy. The number of jobs involved is significant: globally, as 
many as 292 million people are employed directly or indirectly by tourism—one in every ten 
jobs on the planet.49 

THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE ON WAGES AND SKILLS 
Adjusting the economy to new technological disruptions may take time, and can have 
significant repercussions for both skills and wages. In the first half of the 19th century, 
during the First Industrial Revolution in England, the steam engine and other technologies 
increased the productivity of unskilled workers and enabled them to undertake work 
previously carried out by higher-skill, and higher-paid, workers including craftsmen and 
artisans. Across the economy, mechanization raised output per worker. However, real 
wages stagnated for roughly 50 years, from 1790 until 1840 (Exhibit 13). During this period, 
first noted by economist Friedrich Engels in 1845, profits as a share of national income 
rose and the labor share of income declined.50 After 1850, real wages began rising in line 
with productivity increases, and by the late 1800s wage growth exceeded productivity 
growth. But for nearly half a century, wage growth was nil and real living standards of 
workers declined. The plight of some workers provided material for Charles Dickens’s bleak 
depictions in his novels, and led the English poet William Blake to decry factories as “dark, 
satanic mills.”51 The turnaround in the relationship between wages and output came at a 
time of substantial reform of existing structures including the right to unionize, limitations on 

46 An MGI survey of 16,000 Europeans in eight countries showed that a majority was willing to make tradeoffs, 
including working more hours per week in exchange for more income and better services. This willingness to 
increase working hours was especially pronounced in France, where the workweek was officially lowered to 
35 hours from 2000. A window of opportunity for Europe, McKinsey Global Institute, June 2015.

2, September 1995.

48 Our research has found that 20 to 30 percent of the working-age population in the United States and Western 
Europe works independently, including many who do so part-time. The majority, 70 percent, say they do so 
out of choice, with the remainder doing so out of necessity. Independent work: Choice, necessity and the gig

child labor, the introduction of public high schools, urban planning to improve public health, 
elimination of debtors’ prison, and the extension of the right to vote to landless workers.52 

The growing mechanization led to a shift in the skills of the workforce and affected semi-
skilled artisans negatively. Economic historians have documented the consequences for 
previously well-paid workers such as hand-loom weavers, whose income tumbled in the 
1820s, leading to immiseration of many, even as the invention of automated looms lifted 
other, unskilled workers out of poverty.53 At the same time, the share of unskilled labor in the 
British workforce increased, from 20 percent in the late 16th century to nearly 40 percent 
in the early 19th century.54 This “deskilling” of the workforce occurred in agriculture and 
industry alike, prompted by land concentration that enabled mechanized agriculture and the 
shift from artisans’ workshops to factory production in industry. During this period there was 
also some growth in the share of skilled workers such as machine erectors and operators, 
who were needed to facilitate the Industrial Revolution. 

More recently, academic research shows that local labor markets, including in the United 
States, have taken years to adjust to trade shocks from competition from China, with wages 
and labor-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining 
elevated for at least a full decade after the trade shock started.55 Some research also

suggests that increasing structural unemployment of non-college US whites of the past two 
decades—driven by automation and offshoring in manufacturing, among other things—may 
have contributed to rising morbidity rates.56 

Whether the experience of technological disruption in the past is relevant for economies in 
the future can be debated. In Chapter 4 of this report, we present new analysis of the impact 
of automation today on the demand for different types of skills and discuss the potential 
impact on wages. Even if the particulars of the historical experience turn out to differ from 
conditions today, one lesson seems pertinent: although economies adjust to technological 
shocks, the transition period is measured in decades, not years, and the rising prosperity 
may not be shared by all. 

AUTOMATION TODAY: COULD THIS TIME BE DIFFERENT? 
Despite the reassuring lessons from history on the long-run impact of automation on 
employment, some technology experts argue that automation today will not behave like 
previous technology waves. They cite a number of reasons that the future may bring more 
disruption to workers than in the past, including the ability of machines to perform work 
activities requiring cognitive capabilities, the rate of progress in new innovations, and a 
potential future in which machines teach themselves to improve at particular tasks without 
much human intervention.57 Many economists, however, tend to view automation as the 
next wave of technological advancement and point out that an equilibrium between the 
supply and demand of jobs in labor markets has always been reached historically, even if the 
transition period may be difficult.58 

In part, the discord between the two points of view may be caused by the lack of a common 
language: what exactly could be different about automation compared with previous 
technologies? What time frame are we considering? In our research we looked at a range 
of arguments on both sides and examined the evidence for both the scope of automation’s 
impact and its nature across multiple dimensions. This framework is useful for disentangling 
the different elements of technological disruption and assessing the ways in which today’s 
technology may—or may not—have a different impact than in the past. 

We conclude that in many respects, the impact of automation on employment today is 
not likely to be different than in the past, particularly if we look back centuries, to the First 
Industrial Revolution in the late 1700s. But we have identified two ways in which automation, 
robotics, and AI could diverge from earlier waves of technology disruption: the speed at 
which scientific advances are being made, if the accelerated rate of progress in machine 
learning and AI continues, and the potential to displace a higher share of the workforce in 
a relatively short period of time, particularly if the adoption of automation is rapid across 
multiple sectors of the economy.

Rate of technological innovation 
Could be faster than the past 
In Chapter 1 we noted the rapidity of recent technological innovation as a result of the 
development of deep learning and reinforcement-learning techniques based on neural 
networks; the availability of exponentially increasing computing capacity that is accessible 
to users via the cloud; and the sheer volume and variety of data generated that can be 
used to train machine learning models. Advocates of the argument that automation today is 
fundamentally different in its scope point to this acceleration of innovation as evidence of a 
real break with the past. 

Those who disagree, however, point to Moore’s Law, named for Gordon Moore, a co-
founder of Intel, who in 1965 noted that the number of transistors incorporated in a 
computer chip would approximately double every 24 months—which became the basic 
business model for the semiconductor industry for the following decades.59 The shrinking of 
transistors in semiconductors improved computing speed and capacity and helped usher 
in the internet era, as well as the mobile phone revolution and the cloud. However, the rate of 
progress in shrinking transistors has slowed, and some scientists project that without a new 
computing model, future advances may run out. Moreover, AI veterans point to previous 
eras when what seemed to be fast-moving advances in AI gave way to frustrating lulls. AI 
dates back to the 1950s, when Alan Turing suggested that computers could communicate 
as well as humans and Princeton students including Marvin Minsky and Dean Edmonds 
built the first artificial neural network using 300 vacuum tubes and a war-surplus gyropilot. 
After the initial excitement, funding slumped in the 1970s as research backers—primarily 
the US government—tired of waiting for practical AI applications and cut appropriations for 
further work. Another lull followed in the 1990s.60 

Our view is that the recent technical advances, enabling machines to read lips or X-rays 
more proficiently than human experts, are indeed remarkable and that if this pace of 
innovation continues rather than encountering a new AI “winter,” the rate of automation 
innovation could indeed be faster than in the past. If so, the potential disruption of workforce 
models and displacement of labor could be greater than past technological revolutions. 

Rate of technological adoption 
Faster than 100 years ago, but no evidence of acceleration in recent decades 
Even if technological innovations are occurring more rapidly, the impact on workers 
will be different only if the diffusion and adoption of new technologies also accelerates. 
Some researchers say this is the case, pointing to examples such as landline telephones, 
electrification, or the automobile. Indeed, while it took almost a century for landline phones 
to reach saturation, or the point at which new demand falls off, mobile phones in some 
markets reached that point in just 20 years and smartphones in even less time.61 One 
commonly found reference is the speed with which certain online videos on YouTube or 
smartphone games such as Angry Birds or Pokemon Go reach a certain threshold of 
downloads—50 million, 100 million, or more.62 Based on measures of gross numbers, 
for example, of people adopting a technology, you could say that adoption rates have 
accelerated. However, it is also worth considering adoption rates when measured 
using percentages.

2. Lessons from history on technology and employment McKinsey Global Institute50

Looking at only the last 60 years, our review of the historical rates of adoption of 25 previous 
technologies shows that the time from commercial availability to 80 percent adoption has 
tended to fall within a relatively constant range: between approximately eight and 28 years. 
For 50 percent adoption, the range is five to 16 years. The technologies reviewed date back 
to TVs in the 1950s, and include recent examples of cell phones, customer relationship 
management software, and lithium-ion cell batteries. This range of times for adoption was 
observed for both hardware-based technologies that are capital-intensive and require 
physical installation; and technologies that are available purely online. Technologies with 
the fastest adoption rates include stents, airbags, MRIs, TVs and online air booking, while 
slower adoption categories include dishwashers and pacemakers from the 1960s, and 
cellphones in the 2000s. Even highly popular and widely-used social media applications do 
not achieve a high level of adoption faster than technologies in previous eras. Facebook is 
one example: it was launched in 2004 and quickly achieved worldwide success. Yet even 
by mid-2016, when it had about 1.7 billion users globally, it was still far from full adoption, 
even outside China.63 Moreover, it was not the first social network, and so the adoption 
period could be calculated as being even longer—since the advent of the first modern 
social network, Six Degrees, which launched in 1997, or Classmates.com, which launched 
in 1995.64 

Our view is thus that there is no evidence that technological adoption has yet accelerated 
over the last 60 years, when measured in percentages, although, not surprisingly, diffusion 
is faster than it was for technologies introduced in the early 20th century. 

Breadth of sectors in which work can be automated 
Not different from the past 
Some commentators say that today’s automation is different from the past because it has 
the potential to transform work in multiple sectors simultaneously. They argue that the 
largest technological disruptions of the past have been the move out of agriculture or, more 
recently, from manufacturing into services. Advocates of the “this time things are different” 
argument point to the pervasiveness of automation technologies as being different, in that 
they will affect multiple sectors of the economy—from finance to retail to manufacturing to 
transportation—simultaneously.65 

As points of comparison, one can consider the application of some technologies in the 
past, such as electricity or computers, which also transformed work across multiple sectors 
of the economy simultaneously. Electrification transformed household lighting, heating, 
and refrigeration; it enabled stores and factories to open for longer hours; and it gave birth 
to mass production. Similarly, computers transformed business services, finance, and 
retail and gave birth to the Internet and mobile computing. The steam engine drove the 
Industrial Revolution, upending numerous sectors from weaving to printing, for example. 
Between 1910 and 1950, successive waves of innovation also proved highly pervasive, from 
automobiles to assembly lines. 

Our view is that little is new about the breadth of impact of automation technologies. 

Share of jobs in the economy that be automated by 2030  
Could be higher than past technologies if adoption is rapid 
Even if past technological innovations transformed work in multiple sectors of the economy, 
today’s automation could affect a larger share of work. Proponents of this view point out 
that some sector employment shifts have been extremely large—for example, the rapid 
transitioning out of agricultural employment in China, or the steep decline in US agriculture in

the 20th century. The potential impact on demand for current work activities in some sectors 
as a result of automation today could likewise be very large. Viewed over a 15-year period, 
our automation model suggests that roughly half of the existing work in countries such as 
Germany, Japan, and the United States could be displaced by 2030 if automation adoption 
is at the most rapid end of our modeling. In the past, also looking at 15-year periods, our 
analysis shows that as much as 30 percent of jobs were displaced in historical episodes—in 
other words, lower than our most rapid automation scenario but not of a completely different 
order of magnitude. 

Our view is thus that, if automation adoption is very rapid, it could potentially displace a 
greater percentage of work in some advanced economies in the next 15 years than we have 
seen in the past. 

Types and complexity of tasks that can be automated 
Every wave of automation affects more complex tasks 
Alongside the scope of automation’s impact, its very nature has sparked discussion about 
differences between technological change today and in the past. One frequently-cited 
argument concerns the type of tasks that AI in particular now can accomplish with prowess, 
from driving trucks to creating music and art to playing championship Go. The power of 
algorithms to take on activities requiring cognitive capabilities and creativity is held up as a 
fundamental break with previous technologies.66 

Skeptics point out, however, that this is not the first time that machines have been able 
to carry out tasks requiring cognitive capabilities. Every new wave of automation seems 
remarkable at the time. From the 1980s, with the birth of computerized spreadsheets, 
machines have taken on ever more sophisticated tasks that previously required human 
brainpower, from manipulating large quantities of data and alphabetizing lists or doing 
complex calculations to anticipating the words your fingers are about to type on a 
smartphone. While the tasks themselves have changed, our view is that the ability of 
machines to acquire such capabilities is not in itself new. While significant progress has 
been made in specific “narrow” AI applications, formidable multi-decade-long technological 
challenges must still be overcome before machines can match human performance across 
the range of cognitive activities and approach “artificial general intelligence”—which would 
indeed be a break with historical precedent. 

Skill bias of technical change 
Today’s automation could complement both high- and low-skill workers 
Technological innovation has affected workers in different ways in the past. As already 
noted, the steam engine and other technologies introduced during the Industrial Revolution 
in Europe and the United States in the 19th century increased the productivity of unskilled or 
low-skill workers and enabled them to undertake work previously carried out by high-skill, 
and higher-paid, workers including artisans such as hand-loom weavers. In the academic 
literature, technological change was thus considered to be biased toward enabling low-skill 
workers at the expense of high-skill ones. 

In our era, the opposite has happened: computers and factory-floor robots have tended to 
increase the productivity and complement the work of high-skill workers, while machines 
have substituted for the programmable and routine tasks that had been undertaken by 
low-skill workers, including those working on assembly lines or as switchboard operators.67 

66 See, for example, the interview with Andrew Ng and Neil Jacobstein,”How artificial intelligence will change 
everything,” The Wall Street Journal, March 6, 2017.

67 David H. Autor, Frank Levy, and Richard J. Murnane, “The skill content of recent technological change: An 
empirical exploration,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics, volume 18, number 4, November 2003; David 
Hounshell, From the American system to mass production 1800-1932: The development of manufacturing 
technology in the United States, JHU Press, 1985.



2. Lessons from history on technology and employment McKinsey Global Institute52

This is known as skill-biased technical change. Some economists view the effects of 
technological change and technology-enabled globalization in recent decades as a 
significant driver of inequality.68 

We do not have firm evidence yet on whether automation today will tend to be more skill-
biased or unskill-biased in its impact. Our analysis of how automation will affect skills, 
detailed in Chapter 4, suggests that workers of all skill and educational levels will be 
affected. Some technologies might enable lower-skill workers to replace higher-skill ones—
such as nurses who can perform some of the more routine tasks of doctors with the aid of 
diagnostic tools. Other technologies will complement high-skill workers and enable them 
to command even greater power in the marketplace—for instance surgical robots or AI 
algorithms that can suggest new investment strategies. 

Impact on high-wage vs. low-wage work 
Both will be affected 
A final dimension on which technological change could be different today is its impact on 
workers at different wage levels. One of the frequently-cited concerns about automation 
is that machines could replace activities of high-wage jobs previously considered “safe,” 
including experts in financial services, some types of doctors, and lawyers. 

While our analysis of automation’s impact on wages, also in Chapter 4, suggests that a 
range of high-wage occupations could be affected, there is ample historical precedent 
for this, including the hand-loom weavers in 19th-century England who suffered a steep 
decline in their livelihoods after the arrival of mechanized looms, which allowed lower-wage 
and lower-skill workers to produce more cloth, faster, and less expensively.69 We therefore 
conclude that today’s automation is unlikely to be different from the past on this dimension. 

•••

In 1930, at the height of the Great Depression, John Maynard Keynes wrote, “We are 
suffering, not from the rheumatics of old age, but from the growing-pains of over-rapid 
changes, from the painfulness of readjustment between one economic period and another.” 
As many do today, he saw the speed of technological change as something formidable, 
an era of progress and invention incomparable to any that had come before—yet also as a 
time of painful transition for many. In the 1960s, a US national commission on technology, 
automation, and economic progress established by President Lyndon B. Johnson 
concluded that, “the basic fact is that technology eliminates jobs, not work. It is the 
continuous obligation of economic policy to match increases in productive potential with 
increases in purchasing power and demand. Otherwise, the potential created by technical 
progress runs to waste in idle capacity, unemployment, and deprivation.”70 The question 
for us today is whether, this time, the transitions will be larger and more painful than ever, 
and indeed how demand for human labor will evolve. In this chapter, we have described 
the historical evidence showing that employment remains strong even in periods of 
technological ferment. In the following chapters, we look at the trends that can create 
demand for tens of millions of new jobs in the global economy over the next decade and 
more, even as robotics and AI increasingly make their way into our daily work lives, and what 
the implications will be for sectors, occupations, skills, and wages.

While automation will displace some workers and transform occupations, we also know that 
new and additional work will be created in the next decade and beyond. What is less clear 
is how job growth net of automation will vary by occupation, and under what conditions 
there will be enough new jobs to offset the work that is lost as robotics, artificial intelligence, 
and other technologies assume a greater role in the workplace. Predicting all the jobs that 
will exist in the future is an impossible task, yet even without a crystal ball, it is possible to 
identify some sources of future labor demand. 

In this chapter, we discuss two different analyses that shed light on these questions. To 
understand some of the occupations and types of jobs likely to be in demand in 2030, we 
model seven specific global trends that we expect will be significant drivers of job creation. 
To inform the impact of automation on aggregate employment, we conduct a second 
analysis using the McKinsey Global Growth Model, which is a multi-country macroeconomic 
model. This exercise allows us to model the dynamic effects of automation on productivity, 
employment, and GDP growth in different scenarios. Automation has the potential to raise 
productivity growth and GDP growth, but our analysis reveals that a key factor in whether 
this will be achieved without large adverse effects on employment and wages is how quickly 
displaced workers are reemployed in other jobs. 

Both analyses reach broadly similar conclusions: although some workers will be displaced 
by automation, other occupations will grow. While in the long-term the economy can adjust 
to provide enough work for everyone, automation will prove challenging for tens of millions of 
workers globally who will need to switch occupations. Depending on how societies manage 
this transition, unemployment could rise in the medium-term and wages could be eroded. 
Both the impact of automation and potential new sources of labor demand will play out 
differently from country to country. 

SEVEN GLOBAL TRENDS THAT WILL HELP SHAPE THE FUTURE OF WORK 
In seeking to identify potential sources of labor demand to 2030, we started with a long list 
of trends and then prioritized seven for deeper analysis, based on high-level initial estimates 
of their potential for job creation (see Box 3, “Our analysis of seven trends that will contribute 
to future labor demand”). While there are many scenarios and sources of potential labor 
demand we have not included, the seven trends we focus on in this report have the potential 
to create demand for hundreds of millions of workers globally in the years to 2030, albeit 
with significant variations among countries. 

For each trend, we model both the direct impact on employment and the indirect impact. 
By direct jobs, we mean employment created in a sector itself (for instance, increased 
spending on cars would create direct employment in the automobile manufacturing sector). 
Indirect refers to employment created in all the sectors that supply goods and services to 
the direct sector (for automobiles, indirect sectors would include spare parts, paint, leather, 
etc.). We do not include induced effects, since some are captured directly by our rising 
consumption trend.

labor demand 

1 Our estimates of potential labor demand from each driver exclude growth in employment 
from population growth until 2030.

future of work in Europe’s digital front runners, McKinsey & Company, October 2017.

3 Ibid. Jeffrey Lin, “Technological adaptation,” May 2011.

We examine potential labor demand created between 2016 and 2030 as a 
result of our seven trends, and compare that to the amount of work that could 
be displaced by automation. Sizing methodology varies by trend; however we 
capture direct and indirect jobs that could be created from each of our seven 
catalysts, take into account the decline in hours worked per person, and factor 
in globalization of work.1 

For each occupation and sector, our incremental labor demand nets out 
automation and other productivity gains. We then compare that incremental 
labor demand with the reduction in labor demand due to automation against 
a projected 2030 baseline of employment. This uses the model we developed 
for our January 2017 report on automation, which also modeled ranges for the 
pace of technology development, and for automation adoption.2 

As well as calculating direct and indirect labor demand from our select trends, 
we identified key occupations that will increase, and compare those with the 
occupations in which work could decline as a result of automation. 

For three of the seven—investment in infrastructure, investment in buildings, 
and investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency—we examined 
two scenarios: a “trendline” scenario in which spending follows the observed 
trends across countries and a “step-up” scenario, in which labor demand 
increases as a result of societal and policy choices. For a fourth trend, 
the increasing shift to market of services that were long done without 
remuneration, we only examine a step-up scenario that assumes rising female 
participation in the workforce. 

Our analysis offers a static view of the potential labor demand that could 
be created from the seven trends and does not factor in supply-demand 
dynamics and feedback from factors such as changes in wage levels. (For 
a more dynamic view, we used the McKinsey Global Growth Model, as we 
discuss later in this chapter). The labor demand that our seven trends could 
generate is potential, and whether this potential is captured will depend 
on the choices and investments made by businesses, policy-makers, and 
workers. The scenarios we construct do not take into account any sources 
of labor demand outside of our seven trends. We do not model entirely new 
industries, occupations, and activities that could be invented in the future, in 
part enabled by technology; one study suggests that on average, 0.5 percent 
of the workforce has been working in “new jobs” per year.3 We do not take into 
account sectoral shifts in industries that are not directly related to automation 
or these seven trends, such as the rise of e-commerce in retail. We also do not 
model changes in work structure, such as the growth of the gig economy, or 
activities within an occupation that could change as a result of technological 
innovation. A more detailed discussion of our methodology can be found in the 
technical appendix.

Rising incomes in emerging economies will create large-scale new labor 
demand as spending increases on consumer goods, health care, and education 
Rising GDP per capita generates higher spending on consumer goods and services, health 
care, and education, especially in emerging economies, and is the largest driver of labor 
demand we have identified (Exhibit 14). Prior MGI research has found that rising per capita 
consumption will generate about three-quarters of global consumption growth in the period 
from 2015 to 2030, with population growth accounting for the remaining 25 percent.71 The 
expanding consuming classes in emerging economies will drive most of this increase. As 
incomes rise, consumers will spend disproportionally more on discretionary goods and 
services such as automobiles, leisure, and accommodation and food services, but they will 
also increase their non-discretionary spending on essentials such as food and clothing.72 
We estimate that this higher consumer expenditure could create between about 250 million 
and 280 million new full-time equivalent jobs, net of automation, across the 46 countries in 
our model. The growth due to rising incomes can mitigate automation’s expected toll on 
workers in retail and accommodation and food services; retail salespeople, food preparation 
workers, and waiters see some of the largest boosts from higher consumer spending. 

While this spending will create labor demand locally in sectors such as manufacturing, 
retail, accommodation and food services, as well as personal services, it will also create 
labor demand in other countries that export goods and services to these countries. We 
assume that a proportion of demand for tradable goods such as apparel and furnishing will 
continue to be served by countries rich in natural resources or with strong manufacturing or 
service sectors. For the purposes of simplifying our modeling, we assume current shares of 
global exports to remain constant; our model assumes that a country such as Germany will 
continue to serve its 2014 share of 18.5 percent of all automotive exports in 2030.73 

Higher GDP per capita is also generally correlated with higher expenditures in health care 
and education. Access to health care, defined as the number of care providers (such as 
physicians) per capita, could increase, especially in fast-growing emerging economies such 
as India that currently have poor access to health care. We estimate that greater access to 
health-care providers alone at all levels, including physicians and medical assistants, could 
increase labor demand by 26 million to 43 million jobs (64 percent direct jobs in health-care 
provision and 36 percent indirect jobs in other sectors).74 Demand for health-care providers 
could increase the most in developing countries such as India and China with the highest 
economic growth, although this may be contingent on the necessary provision of funding for 
health care by governments and consumers.

categories in line with observable cross-country trend lines. See the technical appendix.
73 World Trade Organization, June 2017. 
74 Similar to consumer expenditure, the numbers are modeled around observable trends between health-care 

employment and economic growth. It is important to note that the creation of these jobs will depend on

In education, as with health care, economic development typically raises expenditures, 
with a rise in gross enrollment rates, particularly at secondary and tertiary levels, and falling 
student-teacher ratios as quality improves. Our analysis suggests that these continuing 
improvements could create demand for up to 37 million jobs (78 percent direct jobs in the 
education sector and 22 percent indirect jobs in other sectors) globally by 2030, especially 
in fast-growing emerging economies. We compared gross enrollment rates and student-
teacher ratios of students in primary education and conducted regression analyses against 
GDP per capita. Using demographic projections to estimate the number of students by 
country in 2030, we use our projections for gross enrollment rate and student-teacher 
ratio to infer the potential labor demand for teachers and support staff across each 
educational level. 

Education as a creator of labor demand is most important for countries such as India, 
which has low enrollment rates, particularly at secondary and tertiary levels, high student-
teacher ratios, and high GDP per capita growth. In other countries including China, where 
demographic trends are likely to have a smaller impact on labor demand in primary and 
tertiary education, increases in gross enrollment rates for secondary education and 
decreasing student-to-teacher ratios could imply an overall positive impact on labor demand 
in education on an aggregate level. In advanced economies with aging populations, such as 
Germany and Japan, there will be limited increase in labor demand from education as the 
relative share of students in the overall population declines. However, as with health care, 
the creation of these jobs would depend on the allocation of sufficient funding from public, 
private, and philanthropic sectors. 

The global trend of aging populations will create new and additional labor 
demand for health care 
The global population is continuing to rise and will likely reach 8.5 billion people by 2030.75 At 
the same time, the population in many countries, both developed and developing, is aging: 
by 2030, there will be at least 300 million more people aged 65 and above than there were in 
2014.76 The aging trend is particularly acute in countries such as China, Germany, Italy, and 
Japan; by 2030, about 25 percent of their population will be over 65, if current fertility rates 
and immigration trends continue. This aging trend  is less significant in developing countries 
with younger populations such as India and Nigeria, which are experiencing a demographic 
dividend, but it is also not restricted to advanced countries and China. Brazil, for example, 
also has an aging population.77 

As people age, their needs and spending patterns change—in particular, spending on health 
care. For example, spending on hospital care for an 85-year-old American is more than five 
times higher than for those 19 to 44 years old.78 We estimate that shifts in demographics 
could create incremental demand for 51 million to 83 million workers globally (55 percent 
direct and 45 percent indirect), especially for health care occupations that focus on taking 
care of the elderly, such as home health aides, personal care aides, nursing assistants, and 
so on.79 (As with all the estimates of incremental labor demand in this chapter, this figure is 
net of automation, which will displace work including in health care, according to our model). 
In countries with aging populations such as Japan or China, our model suggests that aging 
and related health-care needs could drive the creation of between 10 and 15 percent of net 
new labor demand.

3. Jobs gained: Scenarios for employment growth McKinsey Global Institute60

Technology development and deployment will create additional employment 
As technology development continues apace, the technology sector is expected to keep 
growing rapidly, and this in turn will create incremental labor demand to develop and deploy 
technology. The scale of this employment will be modest, however. Today, an estimated 
2.9 million people are employed in the US high tech sector, but this is only 1.9 percent of the 
workforce. In Germany, about 2.4 percent of the workforce is in a high-tech occupation. 

Higher consumer spending on technology products and services, which typically rises 
as incomes increase, and larger outlays by businesses that adopt technology to improve 
productivity and improve output as they grow, are driving the increased spending on 
software, hardware, and services. We modeled consumer and enterprise technology 
spending per capita with rising GDP per capita across countries in 2014. Assuming that 
the correlation holds, we estimate that by 2030 technology spend could increase by 
$1.7 trillion to $2 trillion of which about 70 percent would be on information technology 
(IT) services. This includes hardware/software support, outsourcing, IT consulting, 
implementation, and internal IT services.80 This increased spending on technology will 
create demand for 20 million to 46 million incremental workers (55 percent direct and 
45 percent indirect) globally, net of automation. They will be a mix of high-skill workers such 
as software engineers and electrical engineers as well as medium-skill workers including 
web developers and electronic technicians. While IT services jobs such as computer 
support specialists will remain largely local, demand for technology hardware and especially 
software will likely be served by the global players, for example China, Germany, India, the 
Netherlands, and the United States. More than half of all global tech jobs could be created 
in these five countries. Of these, the largest demand will likely land in China and India, with 
up to 13 million and six million jobs respectively. Both large economies are expected to go 
through significant digitization in the next decade and beyond. 

Investment in infrastructure and buildings can create new labor demand, 
particularly in our step-up scenario 
Infrastructure and buildings are two areas of historic underspending that may create 
significant additional labor demand if action is taken to bridge infrastructure gaps and 
overcome housing shortages. We modeled two scenarios: one in which annual investment 
follows the observed trends across countries and one in which significant additional 
investment is made to fill gaps in infrastructure and real estate.  

Global infrastructure systems have not kept up with demand and housing shortages persist 
in many countries. In critical areas of infrastructure such as transportation, water treatment, 
and power grids, years of neglect are catching up with countries around the world. MGI 
has found that, from 2016 to 2030, the world needs to invest about 3.8 percent of GDP in 
economic infrastructure, or an average of $3.3 trillion per year, just to support expected 
rates of growth, with emerging economies accounting for some 60 percent of that.81 In real 
estate, as many as 330 million urban households in emerging and advanced economies live 
in substandard housing or are financially stretched by housing costs.82 

80 IT services includes work outsourced to companies such as Accenture and Infosys, but does not include 
consumer services such as Google or Facebook.

Under our trendline scenario, in which investment in infrastructure and buildings continues 
to follow patterns we have observed across countries, we note that spending on both of 
these increases as countries develop economically. Thus, if countries were to increase their 
spending on the current trajectory as they develop, our model shows that up to 53 million 
gross new jobs could be created by continued spending on buildings, and up to 34 million 
on infrastructure. Yet considerably more could be done than matching the investment levels 
of other countries. Any additional efforts would consequently stimulate increased labor 
demand, especially for middle-wage jobs that will otherwise be particularly affected by 
automation in some advanced economies. 

In our step-up scenario, we assume that the infrastructure gap has been closed, and that 
infrastructure and building spending in 2030 is subsequently higher to sustain this higher 
level of infrastructure stock and investment. We used infrastructure stock averages across 
countries and real estate stock averages in the United States as a proportion of GDP to 
estimate the infrastructure and housing investment needed in 2030 to keep pace with 
projected economic growth.  

This increased spending could create demand for an incremental 76 million to 134 million 
workers from added investments in building structures and 38 million to 72 million 
incremental workers from added investments in infrastructure. As with health care and 
education, the creation of those jobs will depend on the allocation of necessary investments 
by the private and public sector. About 30 to 40 percent of this labor demand could 
come from India, which has currently under-invested in infrastructure, is going through 
a process of large-scale urbanization, and would need to invest a significant amount to 
keep pace with an ambitious target of 6.5 percent annual growth in GDP until 2030. The 
currently unproductive nature of the construction sector in  some emerging economies 
such as Nigeria and Indonesia, coupled with low wage rates that may slow the adoption of 
automation technologies, contribute to the labor-intensity of this sector. China has already 
made significant investments in infrastructure over the past decade and our model shows 
that it may not need as much incremental investment in 2030. Developed economies 
including the United States and Germany could also invest in building new and repairing 
or re-building existing infrastructure, creating additional employment opportunities in the 
construction sector, particularly for middle-wage jobs. 

Investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency 
We similarly modeled two scenarios of labor demand for investment in new energy sources 
and improving energy efficiency, depending on whether spending follows current trends or 
is accelerated. The energy landscape is shifting rapidly as the cost of renewable energies, 
such as wind and solar, falls sharply. A range of new technologies, from smart electricity 
meters to Internet of Things sensors in oil rigs and advanced leaching techniques in mines, 
is transforming both the production and the consumption of resources.83 The global policy 
environment for energy has been shifting: with the conclusion of the Paris Agreement in 
December 2016, countries around the world pledged to take measures that would keep the 
global temperature rise this century below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.84 
The International Energy Agency estimated in 2015 that to reach this goal could take up to 
$16.5 trillion of investment by 2030, including increasing the share of renewables and by 
making buildings, transportation, and technologies more energy efficient. 

83 Ibid. Beyond the supercycle, McKinsey Global Institute, February 2017.
84 While the United States has announced it will withdraw from the Paris Agreement, many other signatory 

countries and even local governments in the United States have said they will continue to support it and meet 
the emission reduction targets that it established.



3. Jobs gained: Scenarios for employment growth McKinsey Global Institute62

Governments including those in India and China are already spending more heavily on 
renewable energy and climate adaptation measures. India, for instance, has announced 
its intention to increase its share of renewable power to as much as 40 percent by 2030.85 
Overall, our modeling indicates that moving to renewable energy and raising energy 
efficiency at current trends could contribute up to seven million new jobs globally in 2030, 
under our trendline scenario, and an additional four million to seven million under our 
step-up scenario. (These jobs are incremental to the increase in employment in the power 
sector driven by GDP per capita growth, which is modeled in our rising incomes driver 
discussed above.) 

In the transition to new energy sources, we model the potential job creation as countries 
shift their capacity mix for electricity generation. Making these transitions will require 
significant investments in manufacturing, construction, and operations and maintenance 
of solar panels, wind turbines, and other equipment. Shifts in capacity mix create jobs in 
two ways. First, large amounts of fixed investment are needed to increase the capacity 
for the growing new energy source, creating jobs in manufacturing, construction, and 
installation. Second, jobs may also be created in the decreasing energy sources through 
decommissioning of fossil fuel and other generation facilities, as some countries decide to 
shut down nuclear plants. Jobs associated with the ongoing operations and maintenance 
of electricity generation are largely variable with capacity, so job levels here will depend on 
relative labor intensity of operations and maintenance between energy types. Renewable 
manufacturing is enjoying a remarkable period of productivity growth—across three 
leading renewables manufacturers, employees declined by 65 percent on average per 
gigawatt shipped in 2010 to 2014. If these productivity gains continue at an aggressive rate, 
renewables manufacturing is likely to be a comparatively less labor-intensive part of the 
renewables value-chain. 

To attain the international goal of avoiding a rise of more than two degrees Celsius, the UN’s 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has calculated that CO2 concentrations in the 
earth’s atmosphere need to be stabilized at 450 parts per million. That will require targeted 
policy choices, including accelerated transitions to renewables and increased spending 
on energy efficiency measures, both in industry and in housing. This in turn could have a 
significant impact on job creation. In our step-up scenario, using data from McKinsey & 
Company’s Energy Insights, we modeled a more ambitious shift into renewables and higher 
investment in energy efficiency, which would create an additional four million to seven million 
jobs globally.86 High productivity and further automation potential in energy reduce the 
opportunity for energy to have a transformative impact on the jobs story in many countries; 
in the United States, less than 1 percent of all full-time equivalents in 2014 were in utilities 
and mining. But major investments in renewable energy will be crucial to meeting global 
climate change goals, which could create middle-wage jobs along the way. 

“Marketization” of unpaid work could create new jobs 
Today, much work done in households—from childcare to cooking and cleaning—is unpaid 
and disproportionately performed by women. At least some of this work could be shifted 
to paid employment through daycare or pre-kindergarten schooling programs and senior 
care programs. Rising female labor participation rates could be one way to prompt this shift, 
which economists call “marketization”; social decisions to expand government-supported 
programs could be another (and those programs in turn might enable higher female labor 
force participation). In recent years, we have seen the rise of digital “sharing economy” 
platforms that enable consumers to purchase many household and personal services more 
conveniently and cheaply, including meals ordered online and delivered by hand, thereby

86 This modeling does not include an estimate of other issues related to climate change that could cause 

potential for incremental labor demand, such as reconstruction and carbon capture and storage.



63Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute

increasing demand. Academic research has found that such platforms result in an increase 
in employment in the industry, both for traditional workers providing those services and for 
the newly self-employed workers on the platform.87 The marketization of previously unpaid 
housework is already prevalent in some advanced economies, especially in urban areas. 
For example, more than 90 percent of three-year-olds are enrolled in preschools in France 
and Sweden, most of which are funded by the government. In comparison, the rate is about 
70 percent in the United States and less than 15 percent in India.88 

Shifting unpaid housework and childcare to paid employment could boost the number of 
women in the workforce globally, if governments decided to invest in these areas (such as by 
providing universal preschool and paid family leave). Women currently account for half of the 
world’s working-age population but generate only 37 percent of global GDP, and in some 
regions of the world—including India, other parts of South Asia, the Middle East and North 
Africa—their contribution to regional output is considerably lower still. At the same time, 
about 75 percent of the world’s total unpaid care is undertaken by women, including the vital 
tasks that keep households functioning, such as childcare, caring for the elderly, cooking, 
and cleaning. This unpaid work amounts to as much as $10 trillion of output per year, 
roughly equivalent to 13 percent of global GDP.89 In our analysis, we observe the average 
amount of unpaid time currently spent on childcare, adult care, cooking, and cleaning 
using time use surveys. As these unpaid activity hours move to the marketplace, we expect 
labor demand to increase for them. While productivity gains will reduce the net number of 
hours worked, we estimate that between 51 million and 89 million incremental jobs globally 
could be created from this step-up scenario of shifting currently unpaid domestic work to 
paid employment. 

JOBS OF THE FUTURE: IMPACT OF NEW LABOR DEMAND VS. AUTOMATION 
The seven trends we selected for our analysis provide us with indications about types of 
occupations that will be in demand to 2030, even net of automation of activities within those 
occupations. At the same time, our automation modeling highlights occupations that could 
decline, if the current activities within those occupations that are automated are not replaced 
by other activities. The patterns differ among countries. One of the key differentiating factors 
is wage rates, since our model assumes that automation adoption will generally be more 
rapid in countries such as Germany and Japan, with relatively higher wages, than in India, 
China, or Mexico, where wages are lower. But there are also differences among emerging 
economies depending on whether populations are aging and the occupation mix across 
sectors, among other factors. 

Exhibit 15 shows the top five occupations that will grow in the United States based on 
each of the seven trends described above  before accounting for displacement due to 
automation. These are primarily direct additions, for example registered nurses related 
to aging, or construction laborers and carpenters from the building out of infrastructure. 
But the list also includes indirect additions, such as accountants, customer service 
representatives, and lawyers, who will see greater demand as support functions within the 
health-care industry feel a boost from increased spending due to aging.

Advanced economies have a similar pattern of job growth and declines 
In advanced economies, we identify six broad groups of occupations that will experience 
growth in labor demand from our trends, although the size of the increase will depend on 
country and on scenario. For example, in our step-up scenario, the demand for builders and 
construction workers rises considerably (Exhibit 16). Workers in occupations in the following 
groups spend considerable time on work activities that are among the least susceptible to 
automation based on our analysis, as they require human capabilities including social and 
emotional interaction, higher-level logical reasoning, creativity, and application of expertise 
that machines for now are less capable of accomplishing. The occupational groups that 
generally grow as a result of our drivers, even net of automation, are: 

  Care providers: that is, doctors, nurses, home health aides and others in caring 
occupations who will be in greater demand as a result of rising health-care spending, 
both from increased prosperity and from aging. Given the disproportionate cost of health 
care for the elderly, aging is expected to be the predominant driver of increased health-
care employment. Countries with aging populations such as Japan and China will see 
a sharp increase in occupations that work closely with seniors, for example nurses, 
nursing assistants, personal care aides, and home health aides. 

  Professionals, defined as white-collar occupations that require academic training and 
expertise in a specific industry or functional area. These include accountants, engineers, 
and scientists. Most of these occupations cut across a wide range of sectors. While 
generally less automatable than other job types, certain supporting occupations such as 
paralegals and scientific technicians may face high automation. 

  Technology professionals. Technology experts will be in continued demand 
everywhere as automation is increasingly adopted, although the total numbers remain 
quite small compared with other occupations. Occupations will include IT workers 
such as computer scientists and software developers, who typically have college 
educations, but also occupations such as web developers and electronics technicians, 
which only require a secondary education. That said, many of these latter occupations 
involve activities that are more automatable than technology workers with higher levels 
of education. 

  Builders. In this category we have included architects, surveyors, and cartographers, 
as well as construction occupations and maintenance and repair workers, such as 
construction laborers, electricians, carpenters, and plumbers. Even though construction 
laborers primarily do physical work, their activities are mostly in unpredictable settings, 
and hence not as highly susceptible to automation by 2030. 

  Managers and executives also cut across all sectors and cannot easily be replaced by 
machines, as much of their work involves interacting with and managing stakeholders. 
However some of their more routine activities will be automated, such as collecting 
information, analyzing data, or preparing reports. 

  Educators. School teachers and others will see a significant increase in demand, 
especially in emerging economies with young populations such as India. Childcare 
workers and early childhood educators will also grow under our step-up scenario in 
which more childcare is shifted to paid providers. 

  “Creatives”: Rising incomes in emerging economies will create more demand for leisure 
and recreational activities. This in turn will create demand for artists, performers, and 
entertainers, although the total numbers will remain relatively small.

By contrast, our analysis suggests that, in advanced economies, other occupations will 
see a net decline by 2030, with more work automated than created by our seven trends, 
assuming they do not add non-automated activities. These include: 

  Some customer interaction jobs, including hotel workers, travel agents, entertainment 
attendants, and cafeteria workers. 

  Office support jobs, including information clerks, payroll processors, and 
administrative assistants. 

  Jobs carried out in predictable settings. These are among the most susceptible 
to automation and include factory workers, material moving machine operators, 
transportation workers, and installation and repair workers. 

It is important to note that even occupations that may have a net decline due to automation 
will not disappear: rather, their numbers could shrink from today’s levels in the next 15 years. 
For instance, even though some of the current activities of food preparation and serving 
workers could be automated (for example, by ordering kiosks in fast food restaurants), and 
about one-fifth of their hours worked could be automated under our midpoint adoption 
scenario, there could still be demand in the United States for more than three million of them. 

Developing countries see net job growth in nearly all occupational groups 
The picture is rather different in rapidly growing and low-income countries such as India, 
where we see net job growth in nearly every occupational category. This is for two reasons: 
low wages mean delayed adoption of automation, and relatively high GDP growth creates 
jobs across the economy, including in predictable environments that are among the most 
affected in advanced economies. For example, production workers would rise 34 percent in 
India under our step-up scenario, compared with a 28 percent decline in the United States 
and a 56 percent drop in Japan. 

Middle-income countries such as China and Mexico also have net job growth in a range 
of occupations under our scenarios that in advanced economies experience declines. 
This is the case with the category of workers who are primarily engaged in customer 
interaction, such as entertainment attendants, and food-service workers. These types 
of occupations will remain in high demand in emerging economies including China, as a 
result of rising consumption from an increasingly prosperous consuming class. However, in 
Mexico, the potential growth is not as large as in India, reflecting the lower GDP growth and 
higher wages. 

WILL THERE BE ENOUGH WORK IN THE FUTURE? 
The public debate in many countries over automation can quickly focus on the existential 
question of whether there will be enough jobs for workers in a future marked by automation. 
We can see from history that such fears have so far been unfounded: over time, labor 
markets have adjusted to changes in demand for workers from technological disruptions, 
although in some eras real wages have remained depressed for some time. We address 
this question of whether there will be enough work in the future through two different but 
complementary sets of analyses. The first is based on our model of new and additional labor 
demand and automation described above, using the select trends we have identified, and 
provides only a partial view. For the other analysis, we used a macroeconomic model of the 
economy that incorporates the dynamic interactions among various factors.

Both analyses point in the direction that, in most scenarios, there can be enough new job 
creation to offset the impact of automation. But a larger challenge will be ensuring that 
workers have the skills and support needed to transition to new jobs. Countries that fail to 
enable and smooth these transitions could see rising unemployment and depressed wages. 

Outcomes will vary significantly by country, depending on four factors 
We find a significant difference of likely outcomes among countries, with four factors largely 
influencing the extent to which enough new jobs will be created to offset those displaced by 
automation. The four factors are: 

  Wage levels. Advanced economies will likely adopt automation in the workplace earlier 
and faster than emerging economies since their wages are relatively higher, making the 
business case for automation stronger. (Our model assumes that automation begins to 
be adopted only when its cost reaches parity with the cost of human labor). Advanced 
economies will therefore likely see the largest impact from automation in the next 
15 years. 

  Demand growth. Economic growth is essential for job creation. While it may sound 
obvious, economies that are stagnant or growing only slowly create few, if any, net new 
jobs. Countries with the most rapid GDP growth rate per capita will have higher growth 
rates of consumption and spending, thus stimulating  greater proportional increases in 
labor demand. Slower-growing economies will create jobs at a slower rate. Advanced 
economies have much lower projected rates of GDP growth than developing countries, 
reflecting aging workforces and also less rapid productivity growth. Developing countries 
such as India and China are projected to have much higher GDP per capita growth rates, 
which will contribute to job creation. Furthermore, innovation and entrepreneurship often 
underlie the creation of new business models and work activities, another catalyst of 
job growth. 

  Demographics. The outcome of automation and future labor demand will play out 
very differently in countries with a young and rapidly-growing population, such as India, 
compared with countries that have a shrinking population and workforce, such as 
Japan. Countries with a growing workforce have a potential “demographic dividend” that 
will lift growth. However, rapid growth of the population will bring millions more young 
people into the workforce, creating considerable pressure to expand formal employment 
opportunities. While the impact of automation will be less, given lower wage rates in 
these countries, automation will make this already considerable challenge more difficult. 
In Germany and Japan, by comparison, aging is reducing the working-age population, 
which reduces the need for economic growth and the potential impact of automation. 

  Mix of economic sectors. The automation potential of national economies differs 
among countries depending on the structure of their economies and, within the 
economy as a whole, on the mix of sectors, occupations, and their constituent work 
activities. Japan, for example, has a higher automation potential than the United 
States because the weight of certain sectors that are highly automatable, such as 
manufacturing, is higher in Japan; 17 percent of jobs in Japan are in the manufacturing 
sector compared with 9 percent in the United States. And within the manufacturing 
sector itself, Japan is more susceptible to automation because a larger proportion of the 
jobs involve tasks that can be more easily automated, such as production. 



3. Jobs gained: Scenarios for employment growth McKinsey Global Institute70

These factors combine to create different outlooks for the future of work in each country. In 
general, countries with similar characteristics across these four factors could see broadly 
similar outcomes from automation adoption, albeit with nuances for cultural and other 
differences. Some clusters are apparent. For example, developed countries with aging 
populations and high wages that will accelerate automation adoption—such as Germany, 
Italy, and Japan—could follow a similar trajectory, as will developed countries with younger 
populations, such as Canada, France, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United 
States. Across the Middle East, countries such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United 
Arab Emirates share similarities on demographics and automation adoption and, to a lesser 
extent, on GDP per capita. Developing countries with the youngest populations, including 
Egypt, Kenya, and Nigeria, will face similar challenges to grow aggregate demand, given 
their fast-growing workforce.  

Our scenarios of new and additional labor demand, net of automation, while 
incomplete, suggest ample job creation to 2030 
We compare the number of jobs created by the seven selected trends identified above with 
the number of jobs expected to be displaced by automation. We are conscious that this 
exercise paints an incomplete picture. While our seven trends model the major sources of 
new labor demand, they do not account for induced job demand creation nor the creation 
of novel work activities and occupations. One research study has found that, each year, 
roughly 0.5 percent of the US labor force is employed in an occupation that did not exist 
in the prior year—in other words, performing an entirely new set or combination of work 
activities. By 2030, this would imply that 9 percent of the US labor force could be employed 
in occupations that do not exist today.90 Just as many occupations today, such as search 
engine optimization, app designers, and website designers, would have been impossible 
to imagine in the pre-Internet era, we cannot foresee the new occupations that will arise in 
the future.  

In order to address the question, “Will there be enough work in the future?,” we compare the 
net effects of jobs displaced by automation, jobs created by the seven trends, the creation 
of new work and other unsized labor demand, and demographic changes in labor force 
size. Even limiting our estimates of new and additional job creation to the select factors 
that we model, we find that our focus countries could generate enough labor demand to 
offset the impact of automation and take into account changes in the size of labor forces.91 
Nevertheless, our modeling from the seven trends indicates that the transition toward 2030 
looks quite different depending on the country (see Exhibit 17). 

For instance, Japan is rich but projected to grow slowly to 2030. It faces the combination of 
slower job creation coming from economic expansion and a large share of work that can be 
automated as a result of high wages and the structure of its economy. However, Japan will 
also see its workforce shrink by 2030 by four million people. In the step-up scenario, and 
considering the jobs in new occupations we cannot envision today, Japan’s net change in 
jobs could be roughly in balance.

91 Our results are broadly in line with prior research by McKinsey & Company in nine northern European digital 

“front-runner” countries. This research suggests that technology diffusion contributed 0.4 to 0.6 percentage 
points, or around 30 percent, to GDP growth between 1990 and 2016 in the nine countries. Digital technology 
replaced jobs at a rate of about 120,000 jobs a year between 1999 and 2010, and boosted employment by 
around 200,000 jobs a year, creating positive net employment of 80,000 jobs per year. More than half of the 
new jobs were high-skill. Shaping the future of work in Europe’s digital front-runners, McKinsey & Company,

Like Japan, the United States and Germany also face significant workforce displacement 
from automation by 2030, but their projected future growth—and hence new job creation—
is higher. However, the United States has a growing workforce. In the step-up scenario, and 
considering new occupations that may arise, it is roughly in balance. Germany’s workforce 
will decline by three million by 2030, and it will have more than enough labor demand to 
employ all workers. 

At the other extreme is India: a fast-growing developing country with relatively modest 
potential for automation over the next 15 years, reflecting low wage rates. Our analysis 
finds that most occupational categories are projected to grow in India, reflecting its strong 
economic expansion. However, India’s labor force is expected to grow by 138 million 
people by 2030, or about 30 percent. Employing these new entrants in formal sector jobs 
will require job creation on a much larger scale than in the past. Automation will make 
this challenge more difficult; some fear “jobless growth” will make the challenge greater. 
However, our analysis suggests that India can create enough new jobs to offset automation 
and employ new entrants, for example by undertaking the investments in our step-
up scenario. 

China and Mexico have higher wages than India, and so are likely to see more automation. 
China still enjoys robust economic growth and will have a shrinking workforce; like Germany, 
China’s problem could be a shortage of workers. Given net job creation as well as declining 
labor forces, China and Germany may need to explore different options such as accelerating 
automation adoption or immigration in order to fulfill the expected creation of growing future 
labor demand. Mexico’s rate of future economic expansion is more modest than China’s, 
and its workforce will grow by 15 million by 2030. Like the United States and Japan, our 
results suggest that Mexico may need the extra job creation from the step-up scenario plus 
innovation in new occupations to make full use of its workforce. 

Our macroeconomic modeling highlights the critical importance of rapid 
reemployment of workers displaced by automation 
The analysis of net job creation given expected automation rates and the seven trends is an 
informative but incomplete exercise, even after adjusting for labor supply changes and the 
creation of new occupations. This is because the analysis above does not take into account 
dynamic interaction among the trends, such as the impact of automation investment and 
automation-related unemployment on GDP growth rates or economy-wide average wage 
rates. Thus, to develop a perspective on the potential net impact of automation and job 
creation potential of the economy, we use a general equilibrium model in order to triangulate 
our results with the analysis from the seven trends (see Box 4, “Modeling the economic 
impact of automation”). 

The overall result of the general equilibrium model is the same as the result from the seven 
trends: it shows that labor markets will generally be flexible enough to absorb the workers 
displaced by automation. Furthermore, like the outcome of the analysis from the seven 
trends, differences arise between countries in the expected transition toward 2030. The 
general equilibrium model points toward a strong distinction in the expected transition 
between the advanced economies and the emerging economies we focus on in this report. 



73Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute

In advanced economies, all scenarios result in full employment by 2030, but the 
transition may include a period of higher unemployment and wage adjustments 
For the three advanced economies we focus on in this report—Germany, Japan, and 
the United States—economies are flexible enough to absorb most if not all the displaced 
workers by 2030 in all reemployment scenarios. The pace at which displaced workers are 
reemployed is critical: lower reemployment leads to higher medium-term unemployment, 
while in the highest reemployment scenario, the labor displaced by automation will be 
reemployed fast enough such that the unemployment rate does not rise (Exhibit 18). 

Automation will also have a wage impact. Our modeling results in a temporary increase 
in wages in all reemployment scenarios because of increased productivity as a result of 
automation. But, as with the unemployment rate, wages will also depend on the pace of 
reemployment. In the lower reemployment scenarios, wages fall in the long-run in response 
to high medium-term unemployment. This leads to a lower labor share of income, as 
the gains of automation in this scenario primarily accrue to capital owners, not laborers. 
Conversely, in the highest reemployment scenario, wage growth is expected to persist, 
and thus the decades-long trend of declining labor share of income slows or even reverses 
by 2040. 

Box 4. Modeling the economic impact of automation 

1 The structure of the model is anchored in the academic literature on economic growth models. For details see 
Shifting tides: Global economic scenarios for 2015–25, McKinsey & Company, September 2015.

We used McKinsey & Company’s Global Growth Model to model the dynamic impacts 
of automation on the economies of our six focus countries.1 This is a supply-side general 
equilibrium macroeconomic model that covers more than 100 countries with data from 
1960 through 2015.

In the model, we directly included three factors by which automation affects economic 
growth: labor displacement, resulting in workers losing their jobs; capital investment needed 
to implement the automation technologies; and an increase in productivity growth, as firms 
employ more capital per worker. These inputs to the Global Growth Model are derived 
from our automation research. To calculate the impact on productivity, we estimate the 
implied productivity growth that would be needed to maintain constant total output with 
fewer workers, under the rationale that firms would not adopt the new technology unless it 
produced at least the same level of output. In reality, this is likely to be an underestimate of 
the impact. Our experience working with firms and our prior automation research shows 
that automation often results in higher quality output and significantly higher level of output 
as well. 

We also model how quickly displaced workers are employed in new jobs, or the 
reemployment rate. Not every displaced worker will enter unemployment; some will have the 
skills and the opportunity to transition quickly into a new role at the same company or with a 
new firm. Indeed, each year millions of US workers leave a job and find a new one. Between 
2013 and 2015, 66 percent of displaced workers in the United States found a new job by 
the end of the period; 49 percent of workers displaced between 2007 and 2009, during the 
financial crisis, were reemployed by the beginning of 2010. 

We model four reemployment rate scenarios—low, medium, high, and full reemployment. 
The reemployment rates modeled differ by country and are estimated from literature and 
adjusted for labor market flexibility factors. 



3. Jobs gained: Scenarios for employment growth McKinsey Global Institute74

In emerging economies, automation’s impact on employment is smaller than in 
advanced economies 
The impact of automation is lesser in China, India, and Mexico than in the advanced 
economies we focus on, according to our simulation. First, automation rates are expected 
to be lower, leading to smaller percentages of displaced workers, lower levels of capital 
investment, and smaller productivity increases. As such, unemployment is not expected to 
rise significantly, nor are modeled wages or GDP growth sensitive to the automation effect 
under any of the reemployment scenarios. 

For more detailed analysis of each of our six focus countries, see the country impact section 
starting on page 91. 

•••

Automation will displace jobs around the world by 2030, but in our analysis demand for 
certain types of labor—from care providers to builders—will also increase, spurred by the 
rising consumer class in emerging economies and the growing health-care needs of aging 
populations in nations from Germany and Italy to China and Japan, among other trends. Our 
dynamic modeling of the US and other economies suggests that enough new jobs will be 
created to return to full employment by 2030, but the transition could be difficult. Depending 
on the rate at which displaced workers are reemployed, the unemployment rate could rise in 
the short- to medium-term, and wages may fall thereafter. Moreover, our analysis highlights 
differences between the sorts of jobs that will be lost from automation, and those that will be 
gained from a range of trends. Even if there is enough work to go around in 2030, millions 
of individuals may need to find new jobs and possibly acquire new skills. We examine these 
trends in the next chapter.

Midcareer retraining will be a major challenge

The combination of labor displacement by automation and changing demand for 
occupations that we have outlined in the previous chapters will have enormous implications 
for individual workers. We estimate that 60 million to 375 million individuals around the world 
may need to transition to new occupational categories by 2030 , in the event of midpoint or 
early automation adoption (although that number would be negligible in 2030 in our edge-
case slow automation adoption scenario). Nearly all jobs will involve a shifting mix of tasks 
and activities. 

Within occupations, the mix of activities and the capabilities required will skew toward 
more personal interactions and more advanced levels of cognitive capabilities. Educational 
requirements will also change: net of automation, a greater share of jobs in the future will 
likely require higher levels of educational attainment. In advanced economies, that includes 
increasing demand for jobs that currently require a college degree (or other advanced 
training). At the same time, employers and workers may need to take a more fine-grained 
approach to identify skills that are the most important. 

Our results also suggest that income polarization in advanced economies including 
the United States could be exacerbated.92 We do not dynamically model how wages 
might change for individual occupations by 2030, but based on current wages, we find 
that in most advanced countries, middle-wage jobs may decline the most as a result of 
automation. Growing occupations in these countries will tend to be either those that are less 
remunerative, for example, retail salespeople or childcare workers, or quite the opposite: 
highly paid jobs, such as software engineers. In developing economies including China, 
however, we see the opposite trend. Here the strongest job growth will likely be for middle-
wage occupations, including service and construction jobs. 

THE MIX OF ACTIVITIES WITHIN OCCUPATIONS WILL CHANGE 
For nearly all occupations, automation will change the mix of activities that humans perform, 
as some tasks are taken over by machines or software. Over time, occupational definitions 
may change, as the boundaries between different occupations become blurred. Already, 
physician assistants and registered nurses carry out many tasks that doctors used to do, 
such as handling routine cases or giving shots. For their part, doctors now write up memos 
and enter data rather than dictating to assistants. 

With automation, such shifts may become more pronounced, although the specifics will 
vary by country. In Germany, workers of the future will likely spend more time on activities 
that require applying expertise (+2.9 billion full-time equivalent hours), interacting with 
stakeholders (+1.5 billion hours), and managing people (+1.4 billion hours), and less time 
on predictable physical activities (-2.6 billion hours), collecting data (-2.5 billion hours) and 
processing data (-2.1 billion hours), where machines already exceed human performance 
(Exhibit 19). In other words, many of the rote activities that have dominated the workplace 
in the post-industrial age will be taken over by machines. Work activity will shift to human 
interaction and working in unpredictable environments—and will also require increasing 
application of expertise. Similar shifts will occur in other high-wage, advanced economies.

employment and earnings,” in Handbook of Labor Economics, Volume 4, Orley Ashenfelter and David E.

4. Implications for skills and wages McKinsey Global Institute78

In India, much of the projected growth in activity hours will be in physical activities, driven 
by demand for construction work, particularly in the step-up scenario. China, which 
has higher levels of existing infrastructure and building development, will still see some 
growth in physical activities. However, most of the growth will be in activities similar to its 
advanced-economy counterparts, such as interacting with stakeholders and applying 
professional expertise. 

This shifting set of activities has implications for the capabilities that will be needed for 
future work. Exhibit 20 shows how US workers will need to upgrade their mastery of the 18 
performance capabilities we used for our automation modeling. 

More work activities will require social and emotional skills and advanced cognitive 
capabilities, such as high-level logical reasoning—capabilities that are required today for 
only a relatively limited number of jobs. This will be a challenge for education, training, and 
skill assessment models, which for now do not always emphasize “soft skills” such as social 
and emotional reasoning and sensing.

4. Implications for skills and wages McKinsey Global Institute80

Additional jobs will often require a higher level of performance across many capabilities. For 
instance, machines will be able to perform work activities requiring basic levels of retrieving 
information and understanding natural language—but jobs requiring higher levels of these 
capabilities will grow. In advanced economies, physical capabilities will be less in demand 
as a percentage of the activity hours demanded in the economy. In developing economies 
such as India, given the increase in demand for physical activities, demand for physical 
capabilities will accordingly grow as a percentage of the new activity hours demanded. 
The shift in activities and underlying capabilities required will touch almost all jobs in the 
economy, to varying degrees—but especially in advanced economies. As one example, the 
work of retail salespeople in these economies could change significantly; about 20 percent 
of their current work activities could be automated in the midpoint scenario. The rote 
aspects of the job such as processing transactions and gathering product information may 
be automated. Retail workers instead may turn their attention to the more people-focused 
side of the job: greeting customers and answering questions, for example, or suggesting 
new products. 

The capability shift is not limited to front-line jobs. Many workers in occupations with high 
educational requirements who spend much of their time collecting and processing data 
could experience a significant shift in their work activities. Financial managers, for example, 
could spend less time monitoring cashflow or approving expenditures, and instead 
have time to focus on more managerial functions such as supervising employees and 
advising others on business matters. Professionals of all stripes are quickly realizing the 
growing importance of “soft skills”—although understanding the implications of numerical 
calculations will continue to be important. On LinkedIn, the professional networking site, for 
example, professionals are increasingly developing and marketing themselves around these 
softer skills, which are less automatable (Exhibit 21).93

This changing nature of activities and capabilities has important implications for the 
requirements and aims of job training, which will be particularly relevant in times of transition. 
For example, as activities requiring basic levels of performance are automated in the United 
States, training efforts will need to focus on capabilities for which automation is more 
challenging, such as social and emotional capabilities. Increasingly across occupations, 
workers will be valued for strong interpersonal skills and advanced reasoning. As these 
skills are often developed through guided experience, workers will likely spend more time 
being coached in apprentice-like environments. The workers of the future will still need to 
apply expertise and judgment, so training to promote fluency with and understanding of 
information will remain important. 

GROWING JOB CATEGORIES HAVE HIGHER EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
THAN THE WORK DISPLACED BY AUTOMATION 
Across our six focus countries, a greater share of jobs in the future—accounting for both the 
effects from automation and the additional labor demand from the seven trends—are likely 
to demand increased levels of education (Exhibit 22).94 

Defining and measuring the skills required to perform well in any job is a difficult and 
imprecise task. In our modeling, we look at several different measures of workforce skills. 
First, we consider the formal educational requirements of each occupation: secondary 
school degree, Associate’s, Bachelor’s, and graduate degrees. Educational requirements 
by occupation are fairly well standardized globally and allow for cross-country comparisons. 
However, even within an occupation, there will be a range of degrees that existing workers 
have obtained; we focus on the educational levels that are typically required.95 We also look 
at how activities within occupations will change, which gives some indication of the types 
of skills that will be more or less in demand, and we consider the capabilities required to 
perform those activities—such as cognitive skills, creativity, social and emotional skills. 
Other definitions of skills and credentials are equally valid and important, but are beyond 
the scope of this report. Many practitioners and researchers today focus on unbundling 
traditional degrees into well-defined credentials that can be obtained by demonstrating 
mastery of specific skills. This is particularly attractive for midcareer workers who cannot 
afford to spend years earning a traditional degree, or who have accumulated valuable 
experience on the job. Some credentials are for quite narrow skills: programming in a certain 
computer language, or mastering one specific type of mechanical expertise.96

94 We do not model changing skill requirements for occupations, and assume that educational requirements for 
an occupation in all countries are the same as in the United States. See technical appendix for details.

95 Economists note the general trend of “degree inflation.” For instance, in the United States, while 80 percent of 
job openings for executive assistants list a bachelor’s degree as a requirement, fewer than half of existing EAs 
have that degree. See Peter Capelli, Will college pay off? A guide to the most important financial decision you’ll 
ever make, PublicAffairs, 2015.

83Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute

In advanced economies, demand for work currently requiring completion of 
secondary school or less will likely decline 
In advanced economies, our model shows a common pattern of educational requirements. 
Occupations that currently require only completion of secondary school or less, including 
jobs such as office clerks, hand packers and packagers, and tellers, are most likely to be 
affected by automation and have a net reduction in labor demand, based on the factors we 
have modeled (Exhibit 23). 

Not all jobs in these categories will disappear, but in 2030, demand for the activities they 
currently perform will be lower in all of our modeled scenarios. In contrast, occupations 
requiring a college or graduate degree will see the most growth as a percentage of jobs 
in the economy. Occupations that require training on top of a traditional post-secondary 
degree (for example, career, technical, vocational training) or two-year associates’ degree

have a mixed outlook. As a share of jobs in the economies, countries such as Japan will 
see increased demand for associates’ and equivalent degrees, primarily from middle-skill 
health-care occupations such as nurses and paramedics. Meanwhile, countries such as 
Germany will see decreased demand, primarily because of a greater share of automatable 
office support jobs such as clerks and secretaries. 

The relative growth of jobs requiring higher educational attainment is not a new 
observation.97 Nor is the increase of skill requirements necessarily a break from historical 
trend: the manufacturing revolution saw increased need for literacy training that spawned 
movements toward secondary education including the High School Movement in the United 
States, which we discuss in the next chapter. 

However, many of the middle-income jobs of the past that required only a secondary 
education or less, and minimal training, will likely face significant displacement in an 
automated world. These jobs include heavy truck drivers and office clerks, both of which 
have high technical potential for automation over our modeled time horizon, and whose 
current middle-level wages raise the economic incentives to deploy automation. Many 
additional jobs requiring low and middle levels of educational attainment could be created, 
driven particularly by the caring economy, such as the rise of nurses and nursing assistants. 
However, for many jobs that require no or only secondary education, the additional future 
labor demand will not fully make up for the jobs displaced by automation. This would mean 
that many displaced workers would need to retrain and/or raise their educational levels to 
gain employment in one of the in-demand occupations. 

The seven trends we modeled alone suggest that overall new demand for work currently 
requiring a college degree could be sufficient to balance the reduction in demand 
for work activities lost to automation in occupations requiring college completion, in 
the United States, as well as in Germany (where the net modeled demand for these 
occupations increases). 

However, that does not obviate the need for college and advanced degree holders to 
retrain, as their activities will change. Some will switch to jobs that require a similar level 
of educational attainment, but very different skills. The coming wave of technology 
deployment, bolstered by advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, has 
significant potential to automate work activities previously thought to be the exclusive 
domain of highly-trained humans. In the midpoint automation scenario, 13 percent of the 
current work activities performed in occupations that require college or advanced degrees 
in the United States could be displaced. Even within a given field, certain occupations will 
fare better than others. In the United States, for example, the high-skill job of application 
software developer has large net additional demand (we model nearly ten times as many 
jobs created as displaced). Meanwhile certain technology support jobs including computer 
systems administrators and support specialists may see a cooling of demand, because 
a substantial portion of their current activities have relatively high technical automation 
potential. Similarly, in US financial services, the varied skills required of management 
analysts could see high demand, while financial managers and securities sales agents 
could face substantial automation of their current work activities with limited sources of 
new demand. 

97 For example, MIT economist David Autor has credited the trend to productivity boosts from information 
technology that magnifies the productive power of cognitive functions, which is often central to higher-skill 
work. Ibid. David H. Autor, “Why are there still so many jobs?” summer 2015. In the United States, about two-
thirds of jobs from Baby Boom retirement require more than a secondary school education. Jamie Merisotis, 
America needs talent: Attracting, educating, and deploying the 21st century workforce, Rosetta Books, 2015; 
see also, Anthony Carnevale et al., “Good jobs that pay without a BA,” Georgetown University Center on 
Education and the Workforce, 2017.



85Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute

Workers displaced by automation may need to invest time to acquire new skills, either 
through formal education or other training programs. Conversely, jobs themselves may 
need to be redesigned to accommodate an influx of new workers with less sector-specific 
training and overall education. The transitions could be varied and lead to friction in the 
labor market and potentially higher unemployment in the short-run. But other steps could 
be taken to make markets function better. For example, defining job requirements, as well 
as providing training and certification, based on specific skills, could improve the matching 
of labor supply and demand, as these skills can be much more fine-grained than traditional 
educational degrees, and can often be acquired in less time than finishing a multi-year 
degree program. 

While some workers who are displaced by automation will be able to find a job in a similar 
function and with similar educational requirements (for example, a displaced cashier finding 
a new job as a retail salesperson), many will not, and will need to gain additional skills, which 
may or may not actually raise their educational level. This is discussed in a subsequent 
section of this chapter. 

Additional job creation in our step-up scenario could help mitigate some of the impact of 
automation, with additional investment in infrastructure, buildings, and energy transitions 
potentially creating new work for workers with low and mid-level educational attainment. In 
all, in the United States, we estimate additional demand for mid-skill labor of up to 1 million 
jobs, net of automation, in the step-up scenario. Demand for occupations requiring post-
secondary education also increases in the step-up scenario. Engineers and cost estimators 
will be brought in to develop infrastructure projects, for example, and various professionals, 
from accountants to research analysts, will also see increased demand. 

In developing countries, the largest number of new jobs will be those requiring 
secondary education or technical skills 
In emerging economies, the rate of job growth is highest for occupations that require a 
college degree or more, but the absolute amount of job growth is highest for occupations 
with a secondary education diploma. 

In China, for instance, occupations currently requiring college and advanced degrees will 
see increased demand—in the case of those with college degrees, this could be as high 
as 22 million additional net jobs under our step-up scenario. However, the largest absolute 
number of jobs created—almost 60 million in the step-up scenario—currently require only 
a secondary school diploma, with significant increased demand for retail salespeople, 
nursing assistants, childcare workers and others according to our analysis. Despite the 
dual threat of automation (particularly for manufacturing, which makes up about 19 percent 
of employment in China) and other increasing productivity, significant demand will be 
created for lower-skill work, primarily due to rising prosperity. Also, jobs with low educational 
attainment requirements in these countries are generally lower wage, and are thus less 
economically attractive to automate. 

India, meanwhile, will see the largest new demand net of automation for workers with a 
secondary education. According to our analysis, as many as 100 million new jobs could 
be created for Indians with secondary education—even after accounting for the effect of 
automation—as rising prosperity will create a surge of new labor demand for construction, 
retail, and health care and education jobs, among others. The largest countries in the 
developing world, in short, should not have a shortage of labor demand across any 
education level, but the significant increase in work requiring completion of secondary 
education indicates a need for India to upgrade its school system.98 

98 In 2011, only 40 percent of Indian adolescents attended secondary school (Grades 9-12), compared to more 
than 95 percent who attended primary school. The World Bank, Education in India, September 20, 2011.

TENS OF MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS GLOBALLY WILL NEED TO SWITCH 
OCCUPATIONAL CATEGORIES, AND MAY REQUIRE TRAINING TO DO SO 
Our findings shed some light on the potential size of the worker transitions that will be 
necessary in the years to 2030—and the immense training efforts that will be necessary 
as the nature of some work changes. We estimate that up to 75 million workers may have 
to switch occupational categories and/or educational levels in the midpoint automation 
scenario (Exhibit 24).99 If automation technologies are developed and adopted sooner, 
those numbers grow rapidly; in the earliest automation adoption scenarios that we analyze, 
as many as 375 million people may need to change occupational categories and/or 
educational levels. However, our step-up scenarios reduce our estimates of the number 
of people needing to make these types of transitions, with additional labor demand trends 
offsetting more job displacement from automation within occupational categories. Not 
shown on the exhibit, in the slowest automation scenario, the number of required transitions 
is significantly reduced (almost negligible in most countries).

Some of these people who are displaced will seek new education and many will need new 
skills. People will also need to learn new skills within their occupations as activities change, 
particularly where those activities are augmented by automation. As a point of calibration, 
in our rising incomes trend, we project that between 190 million and 205 million students 
will be in tertiary education in 2030.100 In the fastest automation scenario that we model, 
the number of people that will need to transition between 2016 and 2030 is almost double 
that number. 

These transitions could surface frictions in the labor market, for reasons ranging from lower 
wages to cultural and gender bias, but also present new opportunities for work and job 
growth. For example, men could find opportunities to retrain into jobs in which women have 
dominated in some countries, such as nursing in the United States, and vice versa.101 

WAGE POLARIZATION MAY CONTINUE IN SOME ADVANCED ECONOMIES
Middle-wage jobs have felt the impact of automation in the past decades in the United 
States, creating a polarization phenomenon. Modeling the potential impact of automation, 
we find that this polarization could continue and become exacerbated in advanced 
economies—but not universally. Indeed, one of our findings is that the potential wage impact 
of automation and future labor demand could vary considerably among countries. We also 
find that any polarization of wages is not due solely to skill gaps; some of the additional 
demand for middle-skill jobs are in those that are currently paid low wages in countries such 
as the United States. 

In advanced economies, high-wage occupations see the most growth net 
of automation 
Academic literature examining the recent impact of technology on wages has found that 
a distinct pattern of “hollowing” or a decline in middle-skill and middle-wage jobs with 
growth in high- and low-wage occupations (see Box 5, “Our prior research on income and 
equality trends”).102 

Our analysis is based on current average wages for each occupation in each country. 
Modeling wages over time by occupation based on the dynamics of labor supply and 
demand is outside the scope of this study, beyond the top-down analysis of wage impact 
that we described in the previous chapter. Nonetheless, our examination of job growth at 
different current wage levels offers some indications of what the future may hold. 

In the United States and Germany, in our trendline labor demand and midpoint automation 
scenarios, occupations in the top 30 percent of average current wages experience net job 
growth by 2030 (Exhibit 25). This holds for the United States even in the modeled step-
up scenario; in the step-up scenario for Germany, rising need for jobs such as nursing 
assistants is expected to increase demand for middle-wage jobs. The largest declines are in 
jobs in the middle of the wage distribution. Occupations in the lowest 30 percent of wages 
decline, but this reflects the net impact of modest growth in low-wage occupations such 
as retail salespeople, and declining occupations such as hand packers/packagers and 
cafeteria cooks. 

100 Based on analysis conducted with World Bank tertiary education data.
101 Our analysis suggests that future labor demand on an aggregate basis will not have a gender bias. Automation 

overall will affect jobs that are traditionally male-dominated, as in manufacturing, but also jobs that are 
traditionally female-dominated, such as food services or accommodation. New jobs with a traditional male 
bias such as construction work will be created, as will jobs such as nurses that have traditionally been 
dominated by women.

2 Poorer than their parents? Flat or falling incomes in advanced economies, McKinsey Global Institute, July 2016.

The trends we identify in this report for both low- and 
middle-wage jobs and high-wage, high-skill jobs overlap 
with some of the structural shifts in the labor market in the 
past few decades that we have examined in prior reports. 
Among our findings: 

“Superstar” effects and the hollowing of the middle. 
Digitization has already affected the occupational and skill 
mix of the US workforce. Since the 1980s, employment 
in both low-skill and high-skill jobs has increased, while 
middle-skill jobs have declined. With many routine 
production and assembly tasks being automated, most 
of the growth at the low-skill end of the spectrum has 
been in occupations such as restaurant workers, home 
health-care aides, security guards, maintenance workers, 
and other roles that provide in-person services that are 
less susceptible to automation. At the same time, idea-
intensive sectors have been capturing a larger share of 
the overall corporate profit pool. There is now a premium 
on creative and cognitive tasks that improves overall 
productivity of highly skilled workers. The result is an 
increasingly two-tiered labor market.1 

Flat and falling incomes in advanced economies. 
With only occasional exceptions, most income groups in 
advanced economies have experienced steady income 
advancement since World War II, but that changed 
abruptly in the past decade. Between 2005 and 2014, our 
research found that about two-thirds of income groups 
had either flat or falling market income (wages and 
capital), although in some countries including the United 
States government taxes and transfers cushioned the 
blow for disposable income. While economic recession 
and slow recovery after the global financial crisis were 
a primary cause, other long-run factors—including a 
decline in the wage share of GDP, aging, and shrinking 
household size—will continue to weigh on incomes in the 
future. The decline in wage share has taken place despite 
rising productivity, suggesting that productivity and 
incomes have become disconnected. The distribution 
of this wage share among different income segments 
has also been uneven: since 1993, households in the 
uppermost income segments in the countries we looked 
at received a growing share of the total wages, even as 
the share for low- and middle-income segments has 
either stagnated or fallen.2

In the United States, the pattern of polarization is clearer if we look at the net job growth by 
wage decile (Exhibit 26). The top two deciles experience significant new demand for labor 
net of automation, primarily driven by an increase in demand for high-skill professionals, 
including technology and medical professionals. The effects of aging and, in the step-up 
scenario, professionalization of unpaid work also create growth at the lower end of the 
wage spectrum, around the 20th percentile. This is driven by growth in nursing assistants, 
teaching assistants, and personal care aides, among others. 

In our model, the step-up scenario involving increased spending on such areas as 
infrastructure, real estate, and energy transitions can help create more growth in middle-
wage (as well as low-wage) jobs. For example, in the United States, increased infrastructure 
and real estate spending can create additional demand for labor in construction, skilled 
craftspeople, and technical production jobs, which are middle-wage jobs. The increased 
professionalization of unpaid services would also add jobs for middle-wage work in 
countries like Germany through increased demand for nursing assistants and childcare 
workers. These types of jobs could help produce some of the additional labor demand to 
offset activities that could be automated, in particular, providing demand for middle-wage 
jobs in advanced economies.

4. Implications for skills and wages McKinsey Global Institute90

In developing countries, middle-wage occupations could experience 
strong growth 
The potential wage trend picture is quite different in emerging economies. In India, 
occupations at all wage levels are boosted by demand from rising prosperity, while the 
economy will largely be shielded from automation because of lower wages. In China, our 
scenarios show that middle-wage jobs will rise similarly. Across both countries, the main 
occupations that are driving this growth in middle-wage jobs involve customer interaction. 
Job growth is particularly pronounced for cashiers and retail salespeople, which are 
middle-wage jobs in these markets. While in the developed world many of these jobs may 
be automated, in India and China, wages are low enough that automation rates will likely 
be constrained in the 2030 timeframe (modeled at under 10 percent). The story is a positive 
one for wage advancement and the development of the middle class: in India, for example, 
if farmworkers (with annual salary of $1,752) find themselves out of a job because of 
productivity improvements, many new and more highly-paid services jobs will sprout up in 
hosting (average wage of $2,204), and for retail salespeople ($4,101). 

In these developing countries, the challenge will be to continue to create more high-wage 
work opportunities for high-skill workers, and move a greater proportion of workers into 
higher wage jobs. While India will have high demand for high-wage work, this type of work 
in China is more susceptible to automation compared with other developing countries, 
according to our model, primarily because of higher wage rates. Computer support 
specialists and law clerks, two high-wage occupations, have an automation potential in the 
midpoint adoption scenario of 34 percent and 35 percent, respectively. Overall, then, while 
developing countries may have less to worry about when it comes to creating labor demand 
to offset the effects of automation in the near term, policy makers and business leaders may 
want to focus on the creation of more gainful and desirable employment.103 

•••

Work will change in the next decade and beyond, with significant implications both for 
skill requirements and wages. While our research suggests that these trends will play out 
differently among countries, some commonalities are apparent. One is that educational 
requirements and performance capabilities, including for soft skills such as social 
and emotional reasoning, will become ever more important. In advanced economies 
including the United States, middle-wage workers could continue to see a shrinking 
pool of opportunities as automation outpaces new job creation. As many as 375 million 
individuals around the world will need to switch occupational categories. Providing retraining 
opportunities at scale will be imperative. What should the policy priorities be in this changing 
workplace? In the following chapter, we look at how the transitions brought about by 
automation can best be managed.

In the following section, we highlight scenarios for

occupations that could arise. For the automation of

mainly on past experience, and a step-up scenario that 
considers, among other things, increased investment 
in infrastructure, buildings, and energy efficiency that 
countries may choose to make. Based on the net 
impact of automation versus future labor demand 
growth by occupation, we estimate the number of 
workers who may need to change occupational 

categories, and the possible implications for 
educational attainment and wages.

These charts should not be taken as forecasts or 
predictions. Rather, they illustrate a range of possible 
outcomes. The scenarios we assess in this report 
may overstate or understate the actual impact of 
automation on work and future labor demand. For 
example, if automation adoption is more rapid than 
even our earliest adoption scenario, this could 
mean that more work would be automated than we 
estimate. On the other hand, automation might boost 
productivity growth more than we have modeled, and 
this could lead to stronger aggregate demand growth 
and more job creation across the economy than we 
have modeled. Box E2 on page 21 discusses the 
many factors that could change our results for any 
individual country.

China
China’s shift out of agriculture into manufacturing and services is likely to continue and, as incomes continue 
rising, consumption will increase. With its aging and shrinking workforce, China will benefit from embracing 
automation to increase productivity and meet projected 2030 labor needs.

stronger case for early automation adoption, while medium GDP growth creates sufficient labor demand in 
most scenarios. Health-care needs from aging and increased consumer spending will drive most job creation.

India
India is expected to continue industrializing as its economy shifts away from agriculture. As GDP per capita 
continues to expand amid rapid growth of the labor force, many of India’s jobs of the future will be driven by 
construction and the consumption habits of the expanding middle class.

Japan
Japan’s sector mix and relatively high wages will  speed automation adoption, while relatively slow GDP per 
capita growth could dampen labor demand. The decline in the working-age population will act as a 
countervailing force, but a step-up scenario of job creation will be needed to sustain future employment.

Mexico has a young population and a growing workforce. Mid- to low-wage levels may slow automation 
adoption, while comparatively low GDP growth may temper growth in labor demand. The step-up scenario will

Automation adoption will likely be significant in the United States, even as steady projected GDP per capita 
growth drives new labor demand. While labor demand will enable employment of displaced workers in the

5. MANAGING THE WORKFORCE 
TRANSITIONS 

Brace yourself. All countries will face large-scale workforce transitions over the next 15 years 
as automation displaces some workers and labor demand shifts. Enabling and smoothing 
these transitions will be a significant challenge for policy makers and business leaders. 
Some policy choices could substantially improve the employment outcomes, including 
speeding reemployment. Indeed, it may take a Marshall Plan-scale initiative of sustained 
investment by the public and private sectors in new training models and workforce transition 
programs to address all the social, political, and economic issues that automation will raise. 

In this chapter, we discuss four priorities that could make a critical difference: maintaining 
robust economic growth to support job creation; scaling up workforce retraining and 
skill development programs, particularly for midcareer workers; improving labor market 
dynamism; and providing income and transition support to displaced workers. We 
explore some of the choices that could be considered and cite examples of successful 
interventions. These ideas should not be taken as exhaustive or prescriptive, but rather as 
prompts to spur discussion and new ideas. Specific choices will vary based on country 
circumstances and societal choices. 

MAINTAINING ROBUST ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INNOVATION TO SUPPORT 
JOB CREATION 
The starting point is an economic one: sustaining robust aggregate demand growth is 
essential for enabling employment growth. Economies that are not expanding do not create 
new jobs. Indeed, the experience of the past decade has underscored the lingering negative 
employment effects of insufficient demand. 

Appropriate fiscal and monetary policies can be deployed to ensure that demand 
growth is vibrant, and it goes beyond the scope of this report to catalog the appropriate 
macroeconomic policies. Nonetheless, the importance of sustaining demand growth 
cannot be overemphasized. Much has also been written about potential ways to encourage 
innovation and entrepreneurship, from investments in research and development 
and human capital, to investment capital, and lowered barriers to entry for innovative 
businesses.104 Supporting innovation and technological diffusion is critical, including the 
adoption of automation technologies themselves, as these advances are the fundamental 
source of long-run productivity, growth, and prosperity, as well as the creation of new 
business models, occupations, and work activities. To do so will require an effective and 
balanced system for encouraging the development and deployment of intellectual property, 
a high-skill scientific and engineering workforce, and public or private funding for basic 
research and its commercialization. New business creation, start-up communities, and 
dynamic firm entry and exit are also essential.105 For small cities that lack a diversified 
economy and where the principal employer leaves, more holistic economic revival plans 
are needed.106

104 See, for instance, Brad Feld, Startup communities: Building an entrepreneurial ecosystem in your city, Wiley, 
October 2012 and Enrico Moretti, The new geography of jobs, Mariner Books, March 2013.

105 See Making it in America, McKinsey Global Institute, June 2017.

5. Managing the workforce transitions McKinsey Global Institute106

Actions can be taken not only at the national level, but also locally. MGI studies of cities 
around the world, along with a growing body of academic research, illustrate the vast 
differences in economic growth and prosperity that arise among cities and regions of the 
same country.107 The last 20 years of globalization and technological change have resulted 
in many communities in the United States and Europe suffering large-scale job losses—but 
some of these communities have also shown that reviving growth through knowledge-
based economies is possible. A common pattern emerges: harnessing intellectual capital, 
often found in universities, with private sector R&D and local governments willing to ensure 
workforce training to meet the new demand.108 

Many policymakers, in both advanced and developing countries such as India, worry 
about “jobless growth.”109 Since the 2008 global financial crisis, it has become clear that 
not all sources of GDP growth have an equal impact on employment creation. Growth in 
industries that are heavily capital-intensive or those that are highly automated will not have 
the same impact on job creation. To support broad-based job creation, some countries may 
provide incentives to labor-intensive service sectors, such as health care, education, and 
construction. Targeted initiatives may also be used. Catalyzing public and private investment 
for infrastructure, including the housing and commercial buildings needed in urbanizing 
countries in the developing world, not only supports long-term economic growth but also 
has the potential to create large-scale employment in the near-term. Supporting measures 
to shift energy to renewable sources, manage and mitigate climate change, and boost 
energy efficiency through increased digitization of the sector likewise have global economic 
benefits while boosting near-term employment. The step-up scenario we outline in Chapter 
3 reflects the potential impact of these types of “no-regret” initiatives; we estimate that 
roughly 150 million to 300 million jobs could be created incrementally on top of the trendline 
scenario jobs as a result. Importantly, these initiatives create many middle-skill jobs, such as 
those for electricians, carpenters, crane operators, and other trades. 

In prior research, we examined the critical role of migration and gender parity, both of which 
amount to low-cost ways to boost aggregate demand in the short- and medium-term. For 
example, as much as 70 percent of population growth in urban areas going forward could 
come from migration—with key challenges on how migrants can be integrated effectively.110 

SCALING UP JOB RETRAINING AND WORKFORCE SKILL DEVELOPMENT 
Providing job retraining and enabling individuals to learn marketable new skills throughout 
their lifetimes will be a central challenge for some countries over the next decade and 
beyond. As we have shown in this report, hundreds of millions of people will likely need to 
find new jobs as automation advances, and even more will need to learn new skills, including 
how to work seamlessly with machines. 

In recent years, some countries have experienced significant challenges in trying to create 
the conditions in which workers displaced by globalization and technology quickly find 
new high-quality employment. The result for many individuals has been a series of lower-
wage jobs with limited opportunities for advancement and lower rates of labor market

participation.111 The social consequences can be dire.112 The challenge for the next decades 
will be to create effective workforce retraining programs at scale. This could require actions 
by policy makers, business leaders, and educators, as well as individuals. 

History offers examples of large-scale programs to improve the skills 
of workers 
At a time when millions of individuals will need new skills, public funding for job training 
programs is falling in many countries (Exhibit 27).113 Between 1993 and 2015, spending on 
workforce training programs as a percent of GDP fell from 0.08 percent to 0.03 percent in 
the United States, while Japanese spending dropped from 0.03 percent to 0.01 percent. In 
Germany—still one of the larger spenders—outlays for training fell from 0.57 percent of GDP 
to 0.2 percent. 

Nonetheless, we can find examples of societies, past and present, which have chosen 
to invest in education and workforce training, with impressive results. The United States 
provides examples of two at-scale investments in the past century: the US High School 
Movement (1910 to 1940), which made attending secondary school the norm for all children, 
and the 1944 GI Bill, which enabled millions of returning war veterans to obtain a tertiary 
education (see Box 6, “The US High School Movement and the GI Bill dramatically raised 
educational attainment of American workers”). Academic researchers have found that the 
sizable human capital increases enabled by these programs account for a measurable 
share of the rise in incomes over those decades, creating a large and increasingly affluent 
American middle class.114 

More recently, Singapore implemented an innovative form of support aimed at upgrading 
skills as part of its efforts to promote growth and competitiveness in 23 industries.115 
Through the “SkillsFuture Initiative,” introduced by the Ministry of Education in January 
2016, the government provides all Singaporeans aged 25 and above credit of about $400, 
to pay for approved work-skills related courses. More than 18,000 such courses are 
available, and as of December 2016, more than 120,000 people—some 4 percent of the 
resident population aged 25 and above—had used the initiative to take courses, more than 
60 percent of them over 40.116 

Businesses can play a significant role in training and retraining workers 
Companies also have a significant role to play in training and retraining workers. This goes 
beyond a purely social role or sense of civic responsibility: business leaders will be on the 
front lines of automation and will have the earliest and most detailed knowledge about what 
types of skills they will need as they move to adopt the technologies. In the United States, 
some companies are working directly with education providers to give employees an 
opportunity to raise their educational and skill levels (see Box 7, “Some US companies are 
working with educational providers, even as spending on corporate training declines”). 

111 See, for instance, David H. Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon H. Hanson, “The China shock: Learning from labor-
market adjustment to large changes in trade,” Annual Review of Economics, volume 8, October 2016.

112 In the United States, for example, some studies show declining life expectancy for white US citizens under 
age 50, reflecting a surge in death from suicide, drug addiction, and alcoholism. Anne Case and Angus 
Deaton, “Rising morbidity and mortality in midlife among white non-Hispanic Americans in the 21st century,”

The US High School Movement (1910 to 1940) propelled 
a sharp increase in high school enrollment and graduation 
rates, making a high school qualification the norm.1 

In 1910, most students left education after primary school 
to work in agriculture or other low-skill jobs. Those who 
attended high school did so primarily to gain entrance to 
college. However, the economy had begun producing 
large numbers of jobs in cities that demanded a formal 
education beyond primary school. This demand led to a 
grassroots movement: more high schools were built and 
the curriculum shifted from teaching skills “for college” 
to skills “for life.” Vocational (including commercial), 
technical or manual, and industrial courses were rapidly 
incorporated into most high school curricula. 

Secondary school enrollment increased spectacularly, 
from 18 percent in 1910 to 73 percent in 1940. Graduation 
rates for 17-year-olds rose from 9 percent to 51 percent in 
the same period (Exhibit 28). 

Higher educational attainment had an impact on 
incomes. On an aggregate level, national incomes per 
worker grew annually at a 1.48 percent average from 1929 
to 1982. One study attributes 28 percent of the economic 
growth to human capital accumulation and technological 

progress, with changes at the secondary school level 
being quantitatively the most significant driver to the 
increased educational stock of Americans in the first 
three-quarters of the 20th century.2 

The GI Bill of 1944, created to help integrate World War II 
veterans back into civilian life, was instrumental in making 
a college education mainstream.3 Studies estimate 
that 1.4 million people-years of undergraduate training 
had been lost because of the war.4 The bill provided 
all veterans dedicated payments of tuition and living 
expenses to attend high school, college, or vocational 
or technical school. By 1956, just under eight million 
veterans had used the GI Bill educational benefits, with 
2.2 million attending colleges or universities and an 
additional 5.6 million engaging in some kind of training 
program.5 In all, just over half of all veterans tapped the 
education benefits in some form, greatly exceeding the 
government’s projections.6 Veterans accounted for as 
many as 49 percent of all enrolled students at colleges 
and universities—and created demand for growth of a 
world-class university system.7 

The GI Bill also changed perceptions about college 
attendance, making it accessible to the average person 
and not simply reserved for an elite.

7 More than 10,000 youths have graduated globally from one such program, “Generation,” founded by the McKinsey Social Initiative, a non-

Commission. See Rana Foroohar, “US workforce: paying young Americans to learn the right skills,” Financial Times, June 15, 2017.

Spending on corporate training in the United States has 
been declining for decades, along with public spending 
on workforce training (Exhibit 29).1 

Against that background, some employers have begun 
offering educational assistance and programs to their 
workforces to fill current gaps in skills needed or in 
response to a looming number of retirees. For example, 
AT&T has partnered with Georgia Tech to provide 
opportunities for all employees to enroll in the university’s 
online computer science program, which AT&T helped 
set up. AT&T’s move was aimed at bridging a skills 
gap: internal projections suggested that 95 percent of 
the 135,000 employees in its technology and services 
unit would need training in STEM subjects—science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics—whereas 
only 50 percent had such training in 2013.2 AT&T offers 
scholarships to all employees to attend classes, pays 
tuition, and enables employees who did not go to a brick-
and-mortar university to improve their technical skills. In 
2014, about 18 percent of the 1,268 students enrolled in 
Georgia Tech’s computer science master’s program were 
AT&T employees.3 

Walmart, the world’s largest private-sector employer with 
a global workforce of nearly 2.5 million, is conducting 
training and retraining of its US employees in-house, 
through its Walmart Academy. This is one of the largest 
employer training programs in the United States. The 
company expects to train more than 225,000 associates 
by the end of 2017, using both experiential, on-the-floor 
training and traditional classroom instruction.4 

Other companies offer broader educational assistance 
for employees to attain any degree, whether it is linked to 
the company or not. For instance, Starbucks has entered 
a partnership with Arizona State University that provides 
an opportunity for all eligible employees to earn their 
bachelor’s degree with full tuition coverage all the way 
to graduation through ASU’s online degree program.5 
Amazon, through its Career Choice program, reimburses 
95 percent of tuition, fees, and materials of its hourly 
associates with as little as one continuous year of tenure 
for a wide array of accredited degree programs.6 

Some employers are working together with educators 
to train young workers for jobs in high-growth areas 
including technology, health care, and customer service.7

111Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute

Traditionally, educational degrees—especially in the fields of science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics (STEM)—have acted as a signal of talent for job hiring. 
Lacking other markers of skills, many employees focused on whether candidates have 
multi-year, expensive degrees. As the workplace evolves, however, more granular and 
varied definitions of skills are emerging as critically important markers, more so even than a 
college education in some cases. This focus on an individual’s skills rather than educational 
credentials is gaining momentum with companies, state governments, and nonprofit 
organizations. Markle Foundation, for example, has begun an initiative in Colorado to foster 
skills-oriented hiring, training, and education. Among companies supporting it, Microsoft 
has announced a grant of more than $25 million to support the program, known as Skillful.117 

One intensive approach to corporate training programs merges on-the-job training with 
formal education through apprenticeships. These programs exist in many countries, 
although participation and graduation rates vary (Exhibit 30).

5. Managing the workforce transitions McKinsey Global Institute112

Apprenticeships primarily benefit youth newly entering the workforce. Germany’s “dual-
system” apprenticeship program combining work- and school-based learning is the 
best known, and prepares students for a successful transition to full-time employment. 
Beginning in secondary school, students choose a vocational or a college-preparation 
track. Traditionally, this allocation was done through student test scores, but today there is 
more flexibility. Vocational students spend part of their time attending high school, learning 
the basic curriculum, and part of their time working and earning at an employer. The system 
offers qualifications in a broad spectrum of professions and adapts to the changing needs of 
the labor market. 

A major strength of the dual system is the high degree of engagement and ownership on 
the part of employers, although a web of checks and balances at the national and local 
levels ensures that the short-term needs of employers do not distort broader educational 
and economic goals.118 The system has produced impressive results: about one-third of 
German students are educated in the apprenticeship system, which is a widely respected 
career path. 

Like Germany, Switzerland also has a robust apprenticeship pipeline—indeed, nearly 
70 percent of Swiss high-school students choose vocational training. In this track, students 
rotate between school and workplace settings, and receive a salary throughout their 
training.119 Some studies show that students in Switzerland who opt into vocational training 
over general education on average attain higher lifetime earnings.120 

Germany’s apprenticeship system is being emulated by other countries. For instance, 
German auto manufacturers in the United States now offer apprenticeships (although the 
program remains small). South Korea has adopted the apprenticeship model at scale (see 
Box 8, “South Korea’s Meister schools apprenticeship system”).

Box 8. South Korea’s Meister schools apprenticeship system 

1 Ministry of Education, South Korea.

South Korea has one of the highest university enrollment rates in the world, but 
unemployment rates for graduates have been high, even as small- and medium-sized 
businesses cannot fill openings for manual and other jobs. The government studied the 
German and Swiss apprenticeship systems and transformed a subset of existing vocational 
schools into “Meister” ones. (Meister is German for a skilled craftsman.) Students graduate 
with the equivalent of two years’ work and/or community college experience. To provide 
incentives, the Korean government pays the students’ tuition, room, and board. 

The program is still relatively young, but already bearing fruit: Meister schools have 
produced significantly higher employment rates among their graduates, more than 
90 percent, compared with less than 65 percent for college graduates. College enrollment 
rates have fallen in favor of vocational qualifications as a result.1

Educators have a role to play in adjusting school curricula for the 
automation age 
While automation will be a major challenge to workers already in jobs, it also will have 
implications for how future generations of workers are trained, involving adjustments to 
school curricula and education systems more broadly. Curricula will need to adapt to 
provide students with the skills necessary for a dynamic, technology- and increasingly 
service-oriented labor market, particularly in countries and industries where automation 
technologies are likely to be adopted most quickly. Several changes will be required. 

First, demand will increase for workers to develop and deploy technology, or interpret and 
act on the data analytics that these technologies can produce, yet there may not be enough 
workers with the skills to meet this demand, for instance, for data scientists.121 STEM 
subjects will be crucial for the workforce. Early education in subjects such as statistics, to 
help students understand an increasingly data-driven world, where experiments are a key 
source of insight, will be vital. Some countries including Estonia and the United Kingdom 
have introduced computer coding into primary and secondary education. Coding classes 
in these countries start as early as age five or seven, with an introduction to necessary 
fundamental concepts (such as gaining an understanding of algorithms) and coding skills 
such as logic and the creation and debugging of simple computer programs.122 However, 
a strong liberal arts education to go alongside the high tech workplace skills could also be 
required for the “new collar” jobs of the future.123 

Our analysis has shown that an increasing percentage of activities that workers will do in 
the future will be in categories such as managing and leading other people and interacting 
with others, which require skills such as social and emotional sensing and reasoning, and 
applying creativity and collaborative problem-solving. These skills are often not part of the 
formal curriculum in traditional school programs. Another finding from our research is that 
automation and other factors, including globalization, independent work, and companies 
crossing sector boundaries, will require all workers to change what they do over time. This 
puts a premium on a set of meta-skills, around agility, flexibility, grit, and learning how to 
learn. Teaching such qualities is a challenge for all educational systems. 

Third, educational institutions will need to adapt to the evolving demands of the labor market 
to ensure that critical job skills are being taught. Unless they become more responsive 
to labor market demands, educators risk creating an ever-larger disconnect between 
education and employment. This disconnect is already visible in some surveys. In a 
McKinsey survey in 2012, only 50 percent of youths said they believed their post-secondary 
studies improved their employment opportunities, and only 43 percent of employers 
reported being able to find enough skilled workers. Moreover, 39 percent of employers said 
a skills shortage was a leading reason for entry-level vacancies. However, a big majority of 
education providers (72 percent) said they believed new graduates were ready to work.124

Richard Wilson, “Computer programming will soon reach all Estonian schoolchildren,” Ubuntu Life, May 4, 
2014; Computing programmes of study. Key stages 1 and 2, UK Department of Education, September 2013. 
It is also important to note that the aims of introducing coding into early education are not to teach specific 
computer languages, which change constantly in their popularity, but rather computational thinking.

Several measures can reduce or correct disconnects among education providers, 
employers, and students. Providing actionable data is one. Students need to know that 
curricula will provide them with relevant knowledge and work skills, and be able to select the 
best courses and institutions to achieve their desired educational outcome. In one survey, 
less than 50 percent of students said they had a solid understanding of which disciplines 
lead to professions with good job openings and wage levels.125 

Finally, the digital age itself has brought a multitude of possibilities for new ways of learning, 
both within the educational system and outside. Digital learning resources are more flexible 
in terms of their timing and content than traditional classroom training, and programs can 
adjust content for individual students to optimize their learning outcomes. For individuals, 
online degrees can be more advantageous from a cost perspective than degrees from 
traditional colleges and universities, particularly in the United States where tuition costs are 
rising faster than overall inflation. Some massive open online courses (MOOCs) are free and 
have helped expand access to educational content for those outside traditional educational 
institutions. At Coursera, for example, half of students are from developing countries, and 
about 60 to 70 percent of users are employed but preparing for better jobs, while 15 percent 
are unemployed. Most are between ages 22 and 45.126 MOOCs present a promising 
channel for at-scale distribution of educational content at low cost and have potential to help 
ease future workforce transitions. However, their educational impact at scale remains to 
be seen.127 

IMPROVING LABOR MARKET DYNAMISM 
Workers in countries with more fluid labor markets find work more quickly and obtain jobs 
that are a better fit; this will blunt potential increases in unemployment as automation is 
adopted. For now, there are significant information asymmetries in the workforce, with poor 
job matching: companies struggle to find the people they need, and people cannot find the 
opportunities for which they are best qualified. Both policy changes and new digital tools 
can help address this challenge. 

Labor market fluidity has been declining within advanced economies 
In advanced economies, there is evidence that labor markets are becoming less dynamic, 
with fewer people switching jobs.128 One striking example is the United States, which has 
experienced a decline in job reallocation rates since the early 1980s (Exhibit 31).129 The 
root causes of this decline are not fully understood, but include an aging workforce that 
is less likely to change jobs, declining rates of new business formation, lower geographic 
mobility (see next section), and increasing regulations, licensing, and more intense 
training requirements that have made it harder to join some professions.130 Removing 
overly burdensome occupational licensing and restrictions, ensuring that benefits are not 
lost in moving from one employer to another, and easing the process and financing for 
entrepreneurs to start new firms and for existing firms to innovate are all part of the solution.

Improving geographic mobility can enhance labor market fluidity 
While our analysis does not look at the intra-country geography of job loss and job growth, 
it is clear that increasing the geographic mobility of the workforce will aid the transition. 
Yet labor mobility has declined steadily in many advanced economies.131 In the United 
States, geographic mobility has declined since the 1980s (both within and between states), 
reversing the increased mobility that was a characteristic of the US labor market earlier in the 
20th century.132 Whereas about 3 percent of workers relocated across state lines each year 
prior to 1990, that figure has steadily fallen to closer to 1.5 percent today, suggesting that 
geographic labor mobility halved within less than 30 years. In Europe, despite the ambition 
of creating free movement of people, mobility across borders is still complicated, especially 
for services, in which regulating the cross-border posting of workers remains subject to 
political disagreements and different labor market regulations. In the European Union, 
overall, about 17 million people, or 3 percent of the population, have taken advantage of the 
free movement possibilities to live in a different EU country, although the annual flow is one 
tenth of that, about 0.3 percent of the population.133 

Improving geographic mobility may require regulatory change as well as incentives. One 
major obstacle to internal mobility is the cost and availability of housing. Academic literature 
has shown that residential mobility is positively correlated with worker reallocation rates and 
the efficiency of job matching.134 Lack of information on job opportunities in other areas, 
family ties, and different job licensing requirements are also deterrents, as are legal hurdles 
such as land-use laws, different eligibility standards for public benefits, state and local tax 
regimes, and even basic property law rules.135 

131 Developing countries are experiencing massive migration of workers from rural areas to urban areas as they 
urbanize and industrialize.

International mobility is a controversial topic in some political arenas, but the skill 
mismatches we have identified as a consequence of automation and new labor demand 
will not stop at national borders. Our research on global migration has found that the 
world’s 247 million cross-border migrants contributed 9.4 percent of global GDP, or roughly 
$6.7 trillion worldwide in 2015—more than $3 trillion above their contribution had they 
remained in their home countries.136 More than 90 percent of these cross-border migrants 
moved voluntarily, usually for economic reasons, while refugees and asylum seekers who 
tend to attract the most public attention make up the remainder. 

Digital platforms can make labor markets more transparent and improve 
job matching 
Digital platforms offer an efficient way to improve the information available to individuals 
about job opportunities, and to companies about job candidates. By improving information 
signals, job platforms such as LinkedIn, Indeed.com, and Monster.com can speed and 
improve the process of matching individuals to jobs, thereby fostering fluidity. These 
platforms allow individuals to post their entire resume and showcase their work, displaying a 
rich set of credentials and skills other than simply their educational record. But transparency 
cuts both ways: other platforms, such as Glassdoor.com, enable prospective employees to 
find out more about their potential employers, including salary information and anonymous 
reviews by current employees. MGI has estimated that up to 540 million individuals could 
potentially benefit from online talent platforms, with as many as 230 million shortening 
search times between jobs, reducing the duration of unemployment. Up to 60 million people 
could find work that more closely suits their skills or preferences, and an additional 50 million 
could shift from informal to formal employment.137 

Companies can benefit from using digital technologies to transform recruiting, training, 
and managing talent as well. Companies that adopt these tools are discovering that better-
informed decisions about human capital produce better business results. On average, our 
analysis finds that companies could see a 275 basis point increase in their profit margins.138 
In addition, talent platforms could improve signaling about the skills that are actually in 
demand. As this information shapes decisions about education and training, the supply of 
skills in the economy could adjust more quickly and accurately over time. 

Creating more flexible work options may enhance reemployment of 
displaced workers 
The workplace is changing, with the rise of more flexible forms of independent work, 
including independent contractors, freelancers, self-employed individuals, and people 
working in the “gig” or “sharing” economy. MGI finds that 20 to 30 percent of the working 
age population in Europe and the United States already earn income through independent 
work—and that 70 percent of those say they do so out of preference, not because they 
cannot find a traditional job. Moreover, the number of people choosing to work outside 
traditional jobs may rise.139 Digital platforms such as Upwork, Freelancer.com, HourlyNerd, 
Uber, Lyft, TaskRabbit, eBay, and Airbnb offer vast new markets and lower the barriers to 
entry, thereby removing some of the risk for those who want to be their own boss. 

Independent work may offer solutions as well as new challenges. Among the benefits, it can 
enable many people currently not employed to work in flexible ways that suit their needs. 
It is particularly attractive for care-givers, retirees, students, and others who need flexible 
schedules. For the unemployed, independent work may provide a critical bridge to keep 
earning income while seeking employment. But as independent work grows, questions

surrounding benefits, income security measures and other worker protections become 
more prominent and need to be addressed. Key policy recommendations of the United 
Kingdom’s Taylor Review in July 2017, for instance, included recommendations to expand 
the definition of “worker,” extend minimum wage standards, and ensure that benefits such 
as holiday and sick pay cover independent workers.140 

PROVIDING TRANSITION AND INCOME SUPPORT TO WORKERS 
Job losses cause economic stress, as well as physical, emotional, and psychological 
distress. A wide body of academic research has found correlations between extended 
unemployment and declines in physical and mental health. Studies have even shown poorer 
academic outcomes among the children of the long-term unemployed.141 Other research 
has documented the stagnation in market incomes, and increasing wage polarization, 
in many developed markets.142 Both policy makers and business leaders have a role to 
play in supporting workers as they transition between jobs to avoid long-term negative 
consequences and to ensure that they receive adequate incomes. 

Actively supporting workers in job transitions 
A range of measures can speed the transition of workers between jobs, beyond improving 
labor market dynamism, job matching, and retraining and skill development. Most countries 
have labor agencies focused on providing assistance to the unemployed. In many, the focus 
is mainly on doling out benefits and reducing fraud. Germany provides an example of a 
nation that overhauled its labor force system—and reduced high unemployment as a result. 
In 2003, when the country was still struggling with the legacy of reunification, it adopted the 
“Hartz reforms,” based on recommendations of a labor market commission. The lower-
wage segment of the labor market was liberalized, and a new category of jobs was created 
with employers paying a low flat rate for employees, who work a limited number of hours per 
week, exempt from social security and tax contributions. 

The move created millions of “mini-jobs,” whose wages were then supplemented by welfare 
payments. In addition, the local labor market agencies were restructured. Case workers 
are assigned to every unemployed individual, with strong incentives to successfully place 
their clients into jobs. Skills assessments are performed, and training is provided if needed. 
These reforms helped reduce the unemployment rate from 10 percent in 2003 to below 
4 percent today and, at the same time, increased Germany’s share of the working-age 
population in employment by 10 percentage points. While these reforms have returned 
more individuals to work, there is controversy over the impact on the post-unemployment 
earnings of workers.143 

To ensure that workers develop the skills needed for the working world of the future, 
the German labor agency is now planning to put a greater emphasis on counseling. It is 
currently piloting innovative online and offline counseling services directed at students, the 
unemployed, but also employees in jobs which are massively impacted by digitization. The 
hope is that better individual orientation about job market trends and future opportunities 
will smooth the transition to a digital economy, without a large net loss of jobs and 
corresponding increase in unemployment.

In Denmark, employers and governments work with unions to maintain the country’s 
“flexicurity system,” which combines active labor market policies with flexible rules for 
hiring and firing and high levels of benefits for unemployed individuals (up to 90 percent for 
the lowest paid workers). They also offer active job counseling, including career guidance, 
training or education to all unemployed individuals, and offer all workers access to 
numerous vocational training programs. This creates a labor market environment of flexible 
employment and job security. Notably, firms and unions get together to identify skills needs, 
agree on wages and enshrine rights to paid leave for training. Some studies suggest that 
similar collaborative efforts between employers and unions can play an important role in 
raising skill levels, including in the United States, and are already doing so in some cases.144 

Neighboring Sweden has a system for retraining midcareer workers through private sector 
“job-security councils.” Employers pay into these councils, which provide financial support 
and job counseling to laid-off workers, with the aim of helping them get back to work as 
soon as possible. Personal counselors help workers with their resumes and steer them into 
classes in their fields or other fields.145 

Supporting worker incomes may also be necessary 
Our research indicates that millions of individuals will likely need to transition to new 
occupations—and identifies the risk that wages may become stagnant or even decline for 
middle and lower-skill occupations that have a large supply of potential workers but might 
have reduced demand, particularly in developed economies. Supporting incomes in both 
cases may have an economic rationale. Consider that in 1914, Henry Ford announced that 
he would begin paying his employees $5 per day, more than twice the average wage for 
automakers, and reduce the work day from nine hours to eight, at a time when the 60-hour 
work week was the standard in American manufacturing. He explained that “unless an 
industry can so manage itself as to keep wages high and prices low, it destroys itself, for 
otherwise it limits the number of its customers. One’s own employees ought to be one’s own 
best customers.”146 

Two forms of income support need consideration in the age of automation. First are 
payments such as unemployment insurance to provide income to workers during training 
or transitioning between jobs. Yet unfortunately, the amount of public resources devoted to 
supporting worker transitions—including on unemployment benefits—has been declining 
in most countries (Exhibit 32). Given the large workforce transitions we see in the decades 
ahead, re-evaluating this trend could be necessary.

math, and communications skills. Thomas A. Kochan, David Finegold, and Paul Osterman, “Who can fix the

In addition, however, wages may be under pressure in a wide range of jobs as economies 
transition to new forms of work. A range of options exists for addressing these income 
effects. Some employers can choose to pay higher wages and better benefits, recognizing 
the value that their workers are producing. In addition to societal responsibility, these 
companies may be motivated by competition for talent and an interest in reducing employee 
turnover. In the United States some companies have unilaterally raised minimum wages they 
pay.147 In Europe, companies have traditionally paid more attention to stakeholders such as 
workers, in part because of unionization and regulatory choices; in Germany, for example, 
worker representatives sit on corporate boards under 1976 “codetermination” legislation 
and play an important role in shaping wage and benefit policies, as well as overall corporate 
strategy. There are also policy options for providing income support to workers to ensure 
that they remain active consumers. Minimum wages are widely deployed throughout the 
world, and there are moves to raise them, including in US cities such as Seattle.148 While 
some studies have shown that increasing minimum wages can raise employment, the issue 
is actively debated. Other forms of income support, such as “earned income tax credits” 
and wage subsidies, provide incentives for people to work. These measures attempt to 
provide income support without discouraging people from working. Pilot projects are 
underway in a number of countries to test the idea of paying a universal basic income (see 
Box 9, “Experimenting with universal basic income”). 

In recent decades, the long-standing correlation between rising productivity and wage 
growth has broken down in some countries, such as the United States. The cause of this 
shift is unclear. But policy makers are considering new ways to ensure that wages are 
linked to rising productivity, so that prosperity is shared with all. Some have suggested 
that minimum wages should be indexed to measures of productivity. In another specific 
example, Singapore has a program that supports corporate investments in productivity 
on condition companies share the gains from productivity improvements with low-wage 
workers.149 Between 2010, when the program was launched, and 2013, more than 800 
projects were launched, most of them by small and medium-sized enterprises, which will 
benefit 53,000 workers once completed. Their wage increases are more than 10 percentage 
points above the national average. 

•••

In the new era of automation, governments and businesses will need to undertake a 
balancing act between embracing the technology, which will boost productivity and 
economic growth, and at the same time addressing the complex transitions it will create. 
Ensuring robust demand growth and economic dynamism is a priority: history shows that 
economies that are not expanding do not generate job growth. Upgrading workforce skills 
and creating opportunities for midcareer job retraining will also be essential, at a time when 
spending on these has been declining in most countries, and labor markets will need to 
become more dynamic and adaptable to changing work needs and patterns of worker 
redeployment. A final priority is reassessing and strengthening transition and income 
support for workers caught in the cross-currents of automation. Each of these priorities 
on its own presents a challenge, and all together may require a Marshall Plan-like initiative, 
involving clear focus and investment. In the concluding chapter, we examine the implications 
for policy makers, business leaders, and individual workers.

Box 9. Experimenting with universal basic income 

1 Basic income as a policy option: Can it add up? OECD, May 2017.

Universal basic income (UBI) consists of giving a periodic 
cash payment to all individuals without a means test or 
work requirement, to cover basic living costs. Some see it 
as a policy to address the challenges of a jobless future in 
which automation has resulted in mass unemployment. 

Advocates say the assurance of a minimum standard of 
well-being encourages people to switch jobs and take 
more entrepreneurial risks, and supports consumption 
for those in low-paying work. Others point to the high 
costs and difficulties in giving cash transfers, particularly 
in developing countries. The potential costs are high, 
particularly in developed markets. An OECD study found 
that large tax revenue increases would be needed in most 

countries to finance a basic income at meaningful levels.1 
Opponents say that there is no assurance that these 
payments would lead to increases in innovation and that 
UBI could undermine productivity by discouraging work. 
Other arguments question the assumption of planning for 
mass unemployment rather than attempting to enable the 
mass redeployment of labor. 

A number of pilots of UBI have been conducted or are 
now underway around the world that may shed light 
on the impact that this program has on incentives, 
work, and welfare (Exhibit 33) in developing and 
developed countries.

Automation will be a powerful motor of future economic growth, but the challenges it 
presents for workforce transitions are sure to be very substantial. Policy makers, business 
leaders, and individual workers will need to be flexible, creative, and even visionary as they 
look to harness these rapidly-emerging technologies and ensure that the time of automation 
is a productive and prosperous one. A range of outcomes is possible, from one in which 
economic growth and productivity grow strongly, creating myriad new jobs, as automation 
is adopted rapidly, to one marked by slow automation adoption, weak economic growth and 
low net job growth. 

Faced with the scale of worker transitions we have described, one reaction could be to try 
to slow the pace and scope of adoption in an attempt to preserve as much of the status quo 
as possible. But this would be a mistake. Although slower adoption might limit the scale 
of workforce transitions, it would curtail the contributions that these technologies make 
to business dynamism and economic growth. Automation technologies and in particular 
artificial intelligence are the key to finding solutions for many important societal challenges in 
fields ranging from climate science to health care. We should embrace these technologies, 
but also address the workforce transitions and challenges they bring. To do this, there are 
a number of imperatives and priorities for governments, business, and individuals. In this 
concluding chapter, we highlight a number of them.

GOVERNMENTS MUST MAKE WORKFORCE TRANSITIONS AND JOB 
CREATION A MORE URGENT PRIORITY 
Managing the coming workforce transitions with foresight is not just a question of smart 
policy. Automation’s power to lift the productivity of national economies has the potential to 
accelerate productivity and economic growth and improve lives. Governments can support 
the development and deployment of these technologies, for example through investments 
in basic and applied research, as well as through building out digital infrastructure. Ensuring 
positive employment outcomes will require a laser focus on retooling the workforce, 
stepping up support for workers in transition, and improving how local and national labor 
markets function. Societies can choose to transform the coming labor market disruptions 
into an opportunity rather than a pitfall. 

As daunting as the task may seem, history shows us that governments, across the globe, 
when faced with monumental challenges, can rise to the occasion for the well-being of their 
citizens. As we have seen, the US High School Movement and GI Bill were instrumental in 
raising the education of the US workforce and countries such as Germany have shown that 
revamping labor market agencies and support for workers in transition is not only possible 
but can also dramatically reduce unemployment. Such examples highlight the importance 
of executing targeted policy decisions swiftly and clearly. 

Yet in the last few decades, investments and policies to support the workforce have eroded, 
not been enhanced. Public spending on labor force training and support has fallen in most 
countries. Educational models have not fundamentally changed in 100 years; we still use 
systems designed for an industrial society to prepare students for a more dynamic, rapidly-
changing knowledge economy. Unions are on the decline. Government data collection 
on the growing independent workforce and new ways of working is fragmented. It is now 
critical to reverse these trends. A new “Marshall Plan” for the workforce is needed. Priorities 
include the four areas for action discussed at length in Chapter 5, but also the following: 

6. PRIORITIES FOR GOVERNMENT, 
BUSINESS, AND INDIVIDUALS 



6. Priorities for government, business, and individuals McKinsey Global Institute124

  Radically scale midcareer training opportunities to make lifelong learning a reality. 
Lifelong learning has long been talked about reverentially in policy circles, but the new 
age of automation will be the time when large-scale application of it will be needed more 
than ever. Flexibility and adaptability will be the new workforce mantras, as machines 
both replace some human activities and—probably more frequently—fundamentally 
change them. Recent examples of effective large-scale retraining of midcareer workers 
are few and far apart. For the future, more short-term and targeted training for people will 
be needed, especially for those in midcareer who will be looking to develop new skills 
even if they keep their jobs. 

  Modernize educational systems for the 21st century. Our analysis of the 
performance capabilities most in demand in the new age of automation shows the 
critical importance of technology skills, but also of teamwork, creativity, communication, 
and social and emotional skills. Schools in many countries continue to adhere to 
a culture of education that remains rooted in 19th century notions of teaching and 
learning. Governments and educators can use digital technologies to change that, for 
example creating more individual learning paths for students. Several countries including 
Germany and Switzerland continue to show that apprenticeships can be a powerful and 
successful approach to teaching technical skills. While university education has grown 
in popularity and lost its elitist reputation in many countries, many tertiary educational 
institutions have not focused sufficiently on the needs of the labor market or of the 
graduates entering it. Publishing job placement of graduates and similar data could 
help both employers looking for recruits and potential students trying to decide on their 
course of study. Singapore has shown through its SkillsFuture Initiative that individuals 
can be supported and motivated to continuously acquire new skills. Finally, governments 
could encourage, identify, and co-finance innovative pilot programs that address known 
skills gaps among workers, post-secondary students, and youth—and then scale the 
ones that work. 

  Expand transition support measures for workers. Denmark, Germany, and Sweden, 
among others, have shown the importance of focusing labor agencies on reemployment 
and the acquisition of new skills, rather than simply on handing out unemployment 
benefits or controlling for fraud. Best practice requires a cultural shift of sorts, one that 
nudges workers to take a more active role in their own retraining and provides tools for 
them to be successful. Mobility can be an important part of that transition process, and 
in the United States, at least, it was long prized. However, mobility within borders has 
slowed in advanced countries including the United States, and mobility across borders 
faces new hurdles globally as countries revisit immigration policies and practices. 
Reducing the barriers to mobility—which include legal ones alongside prohibitive 
housing costs—will need to be a policy priority. And governments should not lose sight 
of the cardinal importance of increasing economic mobility and opportunity for all 
citizens. That means universal access to quality education, good neighborhoods, and 
basic healthcare. 

  Create income support measures consistent with the new wage realities. 
Since 1970, market wages and productivity growth have diverged in some advanced 
economies including the United States, and income inequality has grown. With the 
advent of the new automation age, it is important to begin national discussions on 
whether we can assume that everyone who works can support a decent standard 
of living. A healthy consumer class is essential for both economic growth and social 
stability. Income supplementation programs already exist in certain countries, such 
as the earned income tax credit in the United States, and some countries are testing 
universal basic income programs or raising minimum wages; more could follow suit, to 
provide fact-based findings that can inform the debate.

  Make job creation and worker re-deployment a national priority. A broad range 
of incentives exists for businesses to invest in capital and research and development. 
Something similar is needed to encourage investment in human capital. In addition, 
governments could assess the impact on job creation of their policies and investments, 
much as they currently assess the impact of policies on the environment. Companies 
could be encouraged to invest in worker training and redeployment through tax and 
other incentives, just as they often are for their research and development investments; 
in some countries, that will mean reconsidering tax codes that provide subsidies 
(through interest) for investments in capital while taxing labor. The step-up scenario 
in this report showed the value in job-creation terms of raising public—and, with it, 
private—investment in infrastructure, affordable housing, and energy efficiency and 
climate change. Such investment will need to go hand-in-hand with other backing for 
job creation, including supporting entrepreneurship and small business creation by 
streamlining regulations and revisiting personal bankruptcy laws that discourage risk-
taking, for example. 

  Modernize data collection on the labor market. Government surveys of households 
and employers are the gold standard of national economic data. But these are time-
consuming. In today’s dynamically changing world, governments need to supplement 
these surveys with real-time data on the adoption of automation technologies, 
job openings, labor market dynamism, skills in demand, and how individuals are 
coping with job transitions.150 The need for better data amounts to an opportunity for 
government statistics agencies to collaborate with online sources of data, including 
job boards, professional sites such as LinkedIn, and private tech companies, to obtain 
a more detailed and accurate picture of jobs, skills, wages, and individual mobility and 
career moves. 

BUSINESS LEADERS SHOULD EMBRACE AUTOMATION AND AI WHILE 
CAREFULLY MANAGING WORKFORCE TRANSITIONS 
Business leaders also have much to gain by early adoption of automation technologies, 
enabling performance benefits such as quality and speed, as well as greater efficiency and 
productive use of all factors of production. But businesses will also be on the front lines of 
the workplace as it changes. Successful adoption of automation will require companies 
to re-imagine their entire business processes to take advantage of automation’s benefits, 
rather than mechanically attempting to automate individual activities using current 
processes. As part of that review, they will need to reevaluate their talent strategies and 
workforce needs, considering how workers can be redeployed to other jobs, and where 
new talent may be required. Many companies are finding that it is in their self-interest—
as well as important for societal responsibility—to train and prepare workers for a new 
world of work. Some companies are already working with external education providers or 
conducting in-house training—but many more could follow suit. 

  Accelerate deployment of automation and AI. For CEOs in all industries and 
countries, developing an automation and AI strategy should be a priority. So far, few firms 
have deployed at scale. In an MGI survey of 3,000 AI-aware C-level executives, across 
10 countries and 14 sectors, only 20 percent said they use any AI related technology 
in a core part of their businesses. Many firms say they are uncertain of the business 
case or return on investment. A review of more than 160 use cases shows that AI 
was deployed commercially in only 12 percent of cases.151 But companies that ignore 
these technologies do so at their peril: the gap in performance between early adopters

of digital technologies in general and AI in particular is widening. In the MGI survey, 
early AI adopters have higher profit margins. Our case studies in retail, electric utilities, 
manufacturing, health care, and education highlight automation and AI’s potential to 
improve forecasting and sourcing, optimize and automate operations, develop targeted 
marketing and pricing, and enhance the customer experience.  

  Redesign businesses processes to unlock productivity gains. Since the IT 
revolution began in the 1990s it has been clear that capturing the value from new 
technologies requires reimagining how the business operates, rather than mechanically 
applying automation to the current mix of activities and processes. Capturing the full 
opportunities offered by automation will require companies to conduct a thorough review 
of business processes and workflows and assess where automation could improve 
performance the most. That in turn requires companies to develop or acquire the talent, 
discipline, and know-how to implement the sort of changes that will be needed to 
harness the full potential of automation. 

  Rethink organizational design. Automation adoption is a process that will not happen 
overnight, and the workplace norm for years to come will be people working alongside 
machines. This has profound implications for the way companies and their workforce are 
structured and organized. Until recently, for example, powerful manufacturing robots that 
can lift or weld have been kept well away from humans, often in cages, because of the 
risk of accidents. But today’s robots can work intelligently and safely alongside humans. 
Such machine-human and machine-machine environments will become more pervasive, 
and that in turn will require workflows to change. Successfully rethinking organizational 
design will ensure that work is not only more productive and takes advantage of the new 
technical possibilities available, but that it will become more meaningful and rewarding 
for people, as the rote aspects of their jobs are taken over by machines, freeing them 
to use more innate human qualities including social and emotional reasoning and 
personal interaction. 

  Build core digital and analytics capabilities. Companies that successfully adopt the 
latest automation and AI technologies typically already have strong digital capabilities. 
Indeed, our analysis shows that companies that are early adopters of AI are also 
digital leaders. There is no shortcut to creating a strong digital base. Companies will 
need to build the supporting digital assets, big data and analytics capabilities to make 
automation and AI a success. This includes building the data ecosystem and adopting 
the right advanced analytic techniques and tools.152 

  Adapt talent strategy and manage workforce transitions. Business leaders will 
need to ensure that the talent their companies require to transition to more automated 
operations is in place. This will involve a combination of recruiting automation-savvy 
professionals, as well as retraining workers to play new roles. Determining the right mix 
of current talent, redeployed talent, and new talent from outside the company will require 
careful consideration. In the new era, STEM talent and data scientists will be increasingly 
important—and could provide a lasting competitive advantage. But filling new technical 
positions is expensive and time-consuming because we have not been turning out 
enough skilled professionals to keep up with the demand. In the United States, for 
instance, data scientist shortages are already appearing.153 

152 See The age of analytics, McKinsey Global Institute, December 2016.

127Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute

  Consider partnerships for talent development. Some companies are turning to 
partnerships to develop the skills needed in their workforce and help smooth transitions. 
As we noted in Chapter 5, some companies have begun to establish partnerships with 
universities and other educational institutions to provide training and skill development 
in their workforces. This enables large-scale retraining, without creating the staff and 
overhead to manage it internally. Such partnerships may become more common as 
companies adopt automation at scale. In the future, as technical talent shortages 
increase, corporate partnership with universities and colleges may become more 
frequent as companies seek to develop a reliable pipeline of scarce technical talent. 
In other sectors, such as health care and manufacturing, there are many examples of 
companies partnering with local community colleges to shape and create the curricula 
for specific degree programs. Similar collaborations might increase the availability of 
data scientists and other technology-related professionals. 

INDIVIDUALS MUST PREPARE FOR LIFELONG LEARNING AND 
EVOLVING CAREERS 
Individuals will need to be prepared for a rapidly evolving future of work. Acquiring new skills 
that are in demand and resetting intuition about the world of work will be critical for well-
being. Workers everywhere will need to reexamine traditional notions of where they work, 
how they work, and what talents and capabilities they bring to that work.  

  Embrace a “startup of you” mentality. In the rapidly changing future of work, 
individuals will be in charge of their own destiny more than ever. The days of planning 
to have one employer for life are long gone. All individuals will need to adopt a more 
entrepreneurial approach to navigating through the world of work and managing their 
careers. Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn, calls it the “startup of you” approach.154 
Individuals will become more proficient and comfortable with navigating a more digital 
job search and managing their personal profiles. 

  Acquire the skills that will be in demand and embark on a journey of lifelong 
learning. As machines perform a wider range and variety of tasks, individuals will need 
to put more focus on developing the skills that humans excel at. As we have described 
in this report, the activities in nearly all occupations will change, with more time spent 
on those activities that require social and emotional skills, team work and collaboration, 
creativity, and higher levels of communication and logical reasoning. Both governments 
and businesses have a role to play in providing individuals with better information on the 
skills and jobs in demand. Educators play a part as well. Secondary school students in 
most countries receive inadequate instruction and guidance on how to plan a career in 
today’s workplace, and even less so for a workplace that is rapidly evolving. Ultimately it 
will be up to individuals themselves to think carefully about what skills will be needed and 
how they can demonstrate those skills to employers. 

  Prepare for a world of digital job search. Digital platforms for matching people with 
jobs and assessing skills are rapidly becoming the norm for hiring.155 Individuals will 
need to use these technologies if they are to be competitive in the job market. In the 
short term, this means putting time and care into building a personal online presence. 
To stand out, they will need to showcase their experience, establish expertise by joining 
groups or posting content, and build their professional networks. Workers could also 
benefit from understanding and participating in the innovations around skills-based 
training and credentials that could accelerate their career trajectories. Individuals without 
formal education credentials may be able to differentiate themselves through their online 
reputation via recommendations from former customers or employers.

6. Priorities for government, business, and individuals McKinsey Global Institute128

  Consider new ways of working. Not only do most people now cycle through multiple 
employers throughout their careers, but many are moving beyond the traditional full-
time (or part-time) job altogether. As many as 30 percent of workers in the United States 
and Europe earn part or most of their income through independent work—that is, 
freelance activities, self-employment, or through rapidly expanding digital gig or sharing 
platforms.156 More than 70 percent of those individuals say that they prefer independent 
work and they report higher satisfaction with many aspects of their work-life than people 
with traditional jobs, including not only flexibility, but also opportunities for advancement, 
creativity and variety in their work, and even more security in their income. Roughly half 
of independent workers supplement their income from traditional jobs (or pensions) with 
these activities. In a world where wages are depressed for people without the skills in 
demand, independent work offers an opportunity to enhance incomes and branch out 
into new areas. 

Ultimately, automation may force us all to reassess basic notions of work. In capitalist 
economies, individuals earn most of their income through applying their labor; except for 
the disabled, all of us are born with an endowment of labor from which to earn income, but 
only a privileged few are born with capital. In many decades hence, the value of this labor 
may be diminished if we reach a state in which machines can do a large share of the work. 
For workers around the world, policy makers, and business leaders—and not just social 
scientists who specialize in socio-economic paradigms—that should give pause for thought, 
and be a spur for action. 

•••

Automation represents both hope and challenge. The global economy needs the boost to 
productivity and growth that it will bring, especially at a time when aging populations are 
acting as a drag on GDP growth. For companies, the technologies can lift productivity and 
profits to new heights. For society as a whole, machines can take on work that is routine, 
dangerous, or dirty, and may allow us all to use our intrinsically human talents more fully and 
enjoy more leisure. Yet even as we benefit, our societies will need to prepare for complex 
transitions ahead, as machines replace workers in many areas. Our research suggests that 
it may be time to refocus the current anxious debate about automation toward issues of 
demand growth, and how to manage the inevitable transitions created by automation. The 
task at hand is to prepare for a more automated future by emphasizing the skills that will be 
needed and ensuring dynamic job creation. The technology is advancing rapidly; the policy 
choices should not tarry.

This appendix provides details on the methodology employed in our research in the 
following sections: 

1. Work hours that could be automated 

2. Labor demand drivers 

3. Macroeconomic analysis 

4. Skills and wages analysis 

5. Glossary of automation technologies and techniques 

1. WORK HOURS THAT COULD BE AUTOMATED 
This report continues and adapts the methodology and findings of the January 2017 
McKinsey Global Institute report, A future that works: Automation, employment and 
productivity. A full methodology of that work is detailed in its technical appendix; we will 
provide only a brief summary here and how it is applied in this report. 

In that report, the technical potential for automation of the global economy  and projected 
adoption rates are determined by an analysis of the underlying work activities for each 
occupation, covering 46 countries. It uses databases published by institutions including 
the World Bank and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics 2014 O*Net database to break down 
about 800 occupations into more than 2,000 activities, and determines the performance 
capabilities needed for each activity based on the way humans currently perform them. 
The report further breaks down activity into 18 capabilities and assesses their technical 
automation potential. This framework is informed by academic research, internal expertise, 
and industry experts. Our report focuses on 2016–30, and thus takes the automation 
adoption percentage through 2030. Much of the occupational data, at the time of original 
analysis, was harmonized through 2014. We adopted the simplification of referring to 2016 
as the starting point of the analysis, and projecting in 2014 data (such as occupational mix) 
into 2016 baseline (for example, automation adoption percentages).

In this report, we use these findings to size the number of jobs that could be automated 
by 2030. We make an assumption that each hour of work that could be automated will 
result in proportional job loss, for example if 10 percent of current work activity hours in an 
occupation will be automated, then 10 percent of jobs in that occupation will be displaced. A 
priori, it is unclear if this assumption is conservative or aggressive. Based on what we have 
seen historically, we expect in many cases that the result of activities being automated will 
be a redistribution of efforts on other existing or new activities. However, it is also possible 
that with automation, existing work processes could be radically overhauled and reduced 
in complexity, reducing labor demand even further beyond automation potential of current 
activities. We have not modeled these countervailing effects.

TECHNICAL APPENDIX 



Technical appendix McKinsey Global Institute132

To calculate the work hours automated in 2030, we multiply the automation adoption 
percentage by the size of the labor force in 2030. By doing this, we assume that the 
occupation mix of the economy and the underlying work activities in each occupation in 
2030 are the same as today. This is a conservative assumption, because in reality, we would 
expect that jobs will not be added back at the same occupation mix and that new jobs will 
be added in less automatable sectors. 

To estimate the size of the 2030 labor force, we use population projections from the United 
Nations, labor force participation projections from the International Labour Organization, 
and the natural unemployment rate for OECD countries. For countries outside the OECD, we 
use the maximum unemployment rate of either 2007 or 2012 to adjust for the effects of the 
2008 global financial crisis on unemployment. 

2. LABOR DEMAND DRIVERS 
Our work examines the labor demand created by seven catalysts. We selected these seven 
from a shortlist of 20 after conducting high-level sizing calculations to estimate their potential 
to create labor demand by 2030. 

For catalysts that include a per capita metric, such as spend on automobiles or number of 
health-care professionals, we include population growth through 2030 based on projection 
from the United Nations. 

We capture direct and indirect jobs that could be created from each catalyst, take into 
account the decline in hours worked per person, and factor in globalization of work. Our 
model offers a static view of the potential labor demand that could be created from the 
seven drivers and does not factor in supply-demand dynamics and feedback from factors 
such as changes in wage levels. It estimates potential labor demand; whether this potential 
is captured will depend on the choices and investments made by businesses, policy-
makers, and workers. The scenarios we construct do not take into account any sources of 
labor demand outside of our seven drivers that could play an important role in determining 
the future of work. We do not model entirely new industries and occupations that could 
exist in the future, in part enabled by technology; studies have shown that on average, 
0.5 percent of the workforce has been working in “new jobs” per year in the past couple 
of decades.157 We do not take into account sectoral shifts in industries that are not directly 
related to automation, such as the rise of e-commerce in retail. We also do not model 
changes in work structure, such as the growth of the “gig” economy, or activities within an 
occupation that could change as a result of technological innovation.

Gross Domestic Product projections 
Increased prosperity is the underlying driver of many (but not all) of the labor demand 
sizings. Given the static modular modeling approach that we have taken, we have taken 
GDP per capita growth as an input to our driver models. 

We use the McKinsey Global Growth Model (GGM) projections. The GGM is a global 
macroeconomic model that tracks long term economic trends and generates projections 
under a range of scenarios. For the inputs to our labor demand modeling, we use the GGM’s 
baseline scenario where available. For countries that the GGM does not model and for 
Japan and Mexico, we use projections from Oxford Economics. See Exhibit A1 for the GDP/
capita projections in use. 

Job multipliers 
For drivers of labor demand in which we are modelling an increase in spend, we use job 
multipliers from input-output tables to calculate the number of jobs created through each 
additional dollar of spend. In many drivers based on linear regression analysis (for example, 
rising consumer spending), the general sizing approach for the number of jobs created 
incremental to 2014 levels is captured in the following formula: 

To take into account projected increases in productivity between 2014 and 2030, we adjust 
2014 job multipliers for projected productivity gains (from factors other than automation) to 
create a 2030 job multiplier. 

For all labor drivers, we calculate indirect jobs using indirect job multipliers from McKinsey 
input-output tables based on source data from the World Input-Output Database, making 
adjustments as necessary informed by expert input. 

To avoid double-counting, we remove particular indirect multipliers if they may overlap 
with our drivers. For example, we exclude all indirect effects in healthcare, education and 
construction, since we have sized these drivers independently. This may undercount job 
creation in these areas.

Globalization of trade 
For drivers that include tradable goods and services, we use data from the International 
Trade Organization and IHS Global Insight to model level of imports and exports in our 46 
country set. In drivers with global trade, we model both locally- and globally-driven labor 
demand. We keep this model of global trade constant between today and 2030, as shifts 
in globalization are beyond the scope of our analysis. This approach would result in an 
underestimation of job creation in countries whose global export shares in 2030 would be 
greater than today’s shares, and similarly overestimation of job creation in countries whose 
share of global exports in 2030 would be lower than today’s. 

Trendline and step-up scenarios 
For three of our seven drivers—infrastructure, residential and commercial buildings, energy 
transitions and efficiency—we model two scenarios. These are a trendline scenario, based 
on the observed patterns across countries that vary by factors such as GDP per capita, 
and a step-up scenario, which is based on further changes that could boost labor demand 
above the trendline scenario. For our seventh driver, the marketization of previously unpaid 
work, we have only modeled a step-up scenario. We describe the assumptions for these 
scenarios in the relevant sections below. 

Catalyst 1: Rising incomes 
Our rising incomes driver represents increase in consumer spending as well as overall 
spending on health care and education that results from increased prosperity (that is, rising 
GDP per capita) in countries. We have taken GDP per capita projections as an exogenous 
input to our modeling for all drivers related to change in spend. 

For consumer spending, we use univariate regression analysis to identify spending trends 
by category using 2014 GDP per capita and 2014 consumption per capita data for the 
46 countries in our model. While GDP per capita changes from 2014 to 2030 as the 
independent variable, we model change in spend by category for accommodation and food 
services, automobiles, clothing, financial services, food, household goods, leisure goods, 
leisure services, and utilities. (We exclude some categories of consumer spending to avoid 
double counting, such as public transport, which could overlap with our infrastructure 
driver). An adjustment is made across categories to cap overall consumption, to ensure 
that our regression analyses do not imply a major shift in consumption per capita. To do 
this, we scale overall consumption to a low and high scenario, based on consumption per 
capita projections from the GGM. We then multiply the 2014 and 2030 spend by 2014 and 
2030 job multipliers, respectively. The productivity-adjusted 2030 job multiplier accounts 
for an increase in productivity, which drives some consumption categories to have negative 
job growth in countries where productivity growth outstrips demand growth, such as the 
agriculture sector in India. Additionally, we use indirect job multipliers to capture the demand 
created in other sectors that supply to these sectors. 

Goods and services modeled under rising incomes are determined to be tradable or non-
tradable, and the labor demand for those which are tradable is distributed according to 2014 
levels of global trade. 

Given the discrepancies between countries in funding models for education and health care, 
these drivers have been sized separately from the rest of consumer spending, despite some 
proportion of education and health care spending being funded directly by consumers. For 
both these sectors, we model the full sector, which would include that funded by consumers 
as well as public and private sector funding. 



135Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute

We see a trend towards increased numbers of jobs in education as GDP per capita rises. 
We model this relationship through univariate regressions on student-teacher ratios and 
gross enrollment rates across primary, secondary, and tertiary levels using 2014 data for 
all 46 countries in our model. We also capture the effect of aging populations; if there is low 
population growth and the population is aging, this decreases education jobs, and vice 
versa. The general formula we use is: 

We use this to model projected education jobs in 2030, then subtract the number of jobs in 
2014 to size the incremental labor demand in education. We then use indirect job multipliers 
to capture jobs created in other sectors that are suppliers to the education sector. 

Catalyst 2: Health care: Rising incomes and aging 
In addition to rising incomes increasing demand for jobs in health care, aging populations 
in many countries will likewise raise health-care demand. We model these effects of rising 
incomes and aging together to avoid double-counting the increase in healthcare jobs. 

The change in the number of health-care jobs is modeled through bivariate linear regression 
with 2014 GDP per capita and aging (share of population over 65 in 2014) as independent 
variables and health-care professionals per 1000 people in 2014 as the dependent variable 
for all 46 countries in our model. We use this trendline to model the increase in health-care 
professionals as GDP per capita increases and population ages from 2014 to 2030 levels. 
We include all parts of the health-care delivery sector including hospital care, home care, 
nursing homes, and other support roles. We then use indirect job multipliers to capture jobs 
created in other sectors that are suppliers to the health-care sector. 

Catalyst 3: Development and deployment of new technology 
We identify trends between rising GDP per capita and spend on information technology. For 
enterprise IT spend, we find that a country’s GDP is correlated with the amount spent on 
hardware, software, and IT services. For consumer technology spend, we consider only the 
hardware and software components of spend, and find that the richer the population (i.e. 
the higher GDP per capita) the higher spend on technology goods. We use univariate linear 
regression analyses to find a relationship between 2014 GDP per capita as the independent 
variable and each category of IT spend per capita in 2014 (including consumer and 
enterprise spending) as the dependent variable across all 46 countries. These categories 
of IT spend are then multiplied by productivity-adjusted job multipliers for 2014 and 2030 
to calculate net new jobs. All data is based on historical baselines from Gartner’s Market 
Databook published in the first quarter of 2017.158 Finally, we use indirect multipliers to 
capture jobs created in sectors supplying to the IT sector.

As the consumer technology element of rising incomes is captured within this driver, we 
omit it from the rising incomes driver. Likewise, since telecommunications and electric 
utilities are captured in the infrastructure driver, we did not consider increase in technology 
infrastructure spend as part of our technology definition in order to avoid double-counting. 
Finally, this driver assumes technology spend growth according to current trends and thus 
does not consider the scenarios of extraordinary technology spend that are possible in 
more rapid automation scenarios. 

Catalyst 4: Infrastructure investment 
In our trendline scenarios for infrastructure investment, we conduct univariate regression 
analyses with GDP per capita as the independent variable and infrastructure spend per 
capita as the dependent variable on 2014 cross-country data. From this, we estimate 
infrastructure spend in 2014 and in 2030, using GDP per capita projections. These 2014 
and 2030 infrastructure spend numbers are then multiplied by 2014 and 2030 job multipliers 
for the construction sector, respectively, to estimate jobs in each year. 2030 job multipliers, 
as with other catalysts, are calculated using productivity growth as discussed below. The 
difference is the incremental addition of new infrastructure jobs between 2014 and 2030.

In our step-up scenario, we model a step-up in which countries have increased their 
infrastructure stock to a global benchmark of 70.5 percent of total GDP. This results in 
higher run-rate infrastructure spending in order to attain and maintain the infrastructure 
70.5 percent benchmark, accounting for both GDP growth (accelerated in our step-up 
scenario) and depreciation. In all, this amounts to between $4 trillion and $4.5 trillion 
annual spending for economic infrastructure (transport, water, and power) compared 
with $2.1 trillion to $3 trillion in the trendline scenario. We assume annual non-automation 
productivity increases ranging from 1.5 percent to 4.8 percent in some emerging market 
countries based on historical trends (1.5 percent in China, 4.8 percent in Kenya, Nigeria, 
and the Philippines, and no productivity increases elsewhere). By the same method as the 
trendline scenario, we multiply 2014 and 2030 spend by job multipliers for the construction 
sector to estimate gross new jobs. Included in the ranges of our step-up scenario estimate 
are additional annual non-automation productivity increases in the remaining emerging 
market countries of 2.5 percent. This productivity adjustment would better indicate the 
range of possible outcomes in emerging market countries; in advanced economies, given 
low historical growth in productivity, we do not assume non-automation productivity will 
increase even in the low range of the step-up scenario. Finally, we use indirect job multipliers 
to capture jobs created in sectors that supply the construction sector. 

Catalyst 5: Residential and commercial buildings 
As with infrastructure, we have modeled two scenarios for residential and commercial 
buildings. For the trendline scenario, we again conduct univariate regression analyses, 
just as we did for infrastructure. For the step-up scenario, we model an increase of stock 
in structures to a US benchmark of 2.3 times that of total GDP, in line with data from the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis, and adjust downward for double-counting with infrastructure, 
inclusion of industrial structures, and spending on equipment outside of the construction 
sector. This amounted to $8.2 trillion to $9.8 trillion annual spending for buildings and 
structures (including residential, commercial and industrial structures) compared with 
$3.8 trillion to $5.5 trillion in the trendline scenario. As with the infrastructure catalyst, we also 
apply 1.5 to 4.8 percent productivity growth assumptions in select countries in the trendline 
scenario, and 2.5 percent annual non-automation productivity increase to remaining 
emerging market countries in the low range of the step-up scenario. 



137Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute

Catalyst 6: Energy transitions and efficiency 
The energy transitions driver captures the potential job creation due to the shift in mix of 
electricity generation. The potential increase in jobs in electric power generation due to 
increase in demand for power is captured in the utilities category of consumer spending 
driven by rising incomes. We avoid double counting by isolating the mix shift effect in 
this driver. Using McKinsey modeled scenarios for gigawatt (GW) capacity in 2030, 
we multiply projected GW capacity by a jobs per GW multiplier across manufacturing, 
decommissioning, fuels, construction/installation, operations and maintenance by energy 
type (such as solar, coal, gas). Given the rapid and hard-to-predict changes in productivity 
across the renewables value chain, we model a minimum scenario in which rapid 
productivity growth continues, and a maximum scenario in which productivity gains plateau. 
To model a step-up scenario, we increase the GW capacity shift more heavily towards 
renewables targets that could help slow global temperature increases to two degrees 
Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This increased shift results in greater numbers of jobs 
created to change the energy generation mix by country. 

We model potential spend on energy efficiency using estimates from the International 
Energy Agency’s 2014 World energy investment outlook report. We use two scenarios 
that the IEA models: a “New Policies Scenario” and a “450 Scenario.” In the New Policies 
Scenario, which is grouped with our other trendline drivers, “energy demand and supply 
projections reflect energy policies and measures that have been adopted as of early 2014, 
as well as other commitments that have been announced, but not implemented, taking a 
cautious view of the extent to which these may be realized.”159 For our step-up analysis, we 
use the IEA’s 450 Scenario which “plots an emissions-reduction path for the energy sector 
consistent with the international goal to limit the rise to long-term average temperatures to 
two degrees Celsius.”160 In both scenarios, we use job multipliers to estimate the number of 
incremental jobs associated with the increase in spend that the IEA projects between 2014 
and 2030, and use indirect multipliers to capture jobs created in other supplying sectors. 

Catalyst 7: Marketization of currently unpaid work 
We model the marketization of currently unpaid work solely as a step-up labor demand 
driver. We use local time-use surveys to understand the amount of time spent in various 
countries on unpaid domestic work including cooking, cleaning, childcare and elder care. 
We decrease the time spent on these activities in each country using a linear coefficient 
between the minimum and maximum values across countries. We then make assumptions 
around productivity gains in each activity through professionalization to estimate the 
potential for new labor demand creation. 

3. MACROECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
We used McKinsey’s Global Growth Model to dynamically model the US economy. Given 
both the unemployment and productivity effects of automation, we use the model to 
determine the GDP growth needed to return the economy to full employment by 2030. 

Of the automation effects modeled, we directly included four channels by which automation 
affects the economy: unemployment displacement, capital investment, total factor 
productivity growth, and reemployment rate. Three of the four channels are outputs from 
the MGI automation model. We take the unemployment displacement as the midpoint 
displacement directly from the automation model; capital investment as the solution cost 
given in the automation model; and total factor productivity as the implied productivity 
growth from automation that would at the minimum result in constant total output. 

159 World energy investment outlook, International Energy Agency, 2014.
160 Ibid.



Technical appendix McKinsey Global Institute138

Besides the outputs from the automation model, we also included a fourth channel, 
the reemployment rate, which describes how displacement actually translates into 
unemployment. Not every displaced worker will enter unemployment; some will have the 
skills and the opportunity to quickly transition into a new role. We define the reemployment 
rate as the percentage of displaced workers expected to return to work within the year; the 
remaining displaced workers enter unemployment. 

On top of the four channels, we modeled four different labor market scenarios. Each 
of the four scenarios used a different reemployment rate—low, medium, high, or full 
reemployment—to describe conditions such as labor market flexibility, labor market slack, 
skills and geographic mismatch, etc. that could influence the rate at which displaced 
workers return to work. For the United States, we used a 25 percent reemployment rate in 
the low scenario, 49 percent reemployment rate in the medium scenario (the reemployment 
rate of displaced workers in January 2010), 66 percent in the high scenario (the 
reemployment rate of displaced workers in January 2016), and 100 percent reemployment 
in the full reemployment scenario. The modeled unemployment displacement and capital 
investment by country were held constant in all scenarios. For example, in the United 
States, the modeled unemployment displacement was 23 percent by 2030, and expected 
automation capital investment $145 billion by 2030. The reemployment rates for each of the 
labor market scenarios differed by country and were estimated from literature and adjusted 
for labor market flexibility factors. 

The GGM first forecasts a baseline future without taking into account the effects of 
automation. It then uses the inputted unemployment displacement, capital investment, 
total factor productivity growth, and reemployment rate, and dynamically propagates these 
effects of automation throughout the modeled economy. The forecasted unemployment 
rate, GDP growth rate, and average wage rates from the GGM are to be interpreted by their 
deviation from the baseline state as a directional range of scenarios for several possible 
future states. 

4. SKILLS AND WAGES ANALYSES 
In this analysis, we look at the net impact of (i) automation and (ii) labor demand creation at 
an occupation level, to understand which occupations could see high levels of demand vs. 
decline by 2030. 

Baseline for skills and wages analyses 
The baseline for our skills and wages analyses is the 2014 employment levels by occupation, 
adjusted for the effects of automation and our labor demand drivers. Elements of the 
economy in which we have not sized growth (such as defense) remain at 2014 levels of 
employment; new occupations that do not currently exist do not show in this baseline. 

Mapping new labor demand and automation to jobs 
Our automation modeling is mapped to each of the 820 occupation codes used by the 
US Bureau of Labor Statistics for all of the 46 countries in our model. We multiply the 
percentage automation adoption rate in 2030 for each occupation by the size of each 
occupation in 2030 (which is assumed to be the same percentage of labor force as in 2014). 
This provides us with a projection of how the employment levels in jobs will be affected by 
automation in 2030. 



139Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute

To model the countervailing effect on labor demand creation, we map our drivers of demand 
according to a list of associated occupations on a driver-by-driver basis. Most drivers map 
to a specific sector, in which case we allocate incremental new jobs according to today’s 
mix of jobs within a specified sector. In drivers that affect a narrower range of jobs, we 
create more customized mappings to reflect reality. For example, for energy transitions and 
efficiency, we map potential labor demand increase to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 
categorizations of “green jobs” and to the relevant jobs in fuels. Based on the sector of each 
direct job added, additional indirect jobs are created based on the specified job multipliers 
for a country. Indirect jobs are created according to the mix of their sector. 

Combining these two calculations, we compare the total jobs displaced by automation 
based on our 2030 baseline (today’s occupation mix, scaled in proportion with the growth 
of labor force) to the jobs added by our drivers to 2030. To calculate a percentage growth or 
decline, we divide this net change by today’s employment level for the occupation. 

Skills and educational categorizations 
Our analyses take training requirements for jobs as a proxy for skill requirements. The five 
educational categories used in our analyses are: less than secondary, secondary, associate 
degree, bachelor’s degree and advanced degree. These classifications map to the five 
job-zones defined by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ O*Net and take into account 
educational degrees, amount of training required, and years of experience necessary in 
order to qualify for a given job. Associate degrees are more common in the United States 
than in the rest of the world and usually require two years of study. 

To optimize for consistency across our modeling and data quality, we use these educational 
requirements from the O*Net classification across all 46 countries. This simplifying 
assumption is limiting in cases in which there are discrepancies among countries, but we 
find that requirements are broadly similar: the educational requirement to be a doctor is 
typically an advanced degree in most countries. 

Wage assumptions 
In our analyses on the effects of automation and new labor demand on wages, we keep 
wages constant at 2014 levels; chemical engineers, economists and lawyers were in the 
highest decile of wage earners in 2014 in the United States, where they remain for our 
analyses in 2030. 

In reality, we would expect wages to adjust to shifts in response to automation and new 
labor demand. There could also be additional economic effects on wages, such as 
Baumol’s cost disease, or policy effects such as minimum wage legislation. Modeling 
these effects on wages is beyond the scope of our analysis, so we exclude them in favor of 
keeping wages constant at 2014 levels. While we thus cannot say anything definitive about 
wage shifts and are limited in any commentary on inequality, our approach allows us to 
identify relative shifts between high-wage and low-wage occupations.

AND MCKINSEY RESEARCH

A labor market that works: Connecting 
talent with opportunity in the digital age 
(June 2015) 
Online talent platforms are increasingly 
connecting people to the right work 
opportunities. By 2025 they could add 
$2.7 trillion to global GDP, and begin to 
ameliorate many of the persistent problems in 
the world’s labor markets. 

Global growth: Can productivity save the 
day in an aging world? (January 2015) 
Without action, global economic growth 
will almost halve in the next 50 years. This 
MGI report offers a solution: a dramatic 
improvement in productivity. 

Urban world: The global consumers to 
watch (March 2016)
Dramatic demographic shifts are transforming 
the world’s consumer landscape. MGI’s 
research find just three groups of consumers 
are set to generate half of global urban 
consumption growth from 2015 to 2030.

A blueprint for addressing the 
global affordable housing challenge 
(October 2014)
A third of urban dwellers—1.6 billion people 
—could struggle to secure decent housing 
by 2025. Here are four approaches that 
could help. 

A future that works: Automation, 
employment, and productivity 
(January 2017) 
This MGI report explores the potential uses of 
automation in multiple industries and its effects 
on employment and productivity. 

Independent work: Choice, necessity, and 
the gig economy (October 2016) 
This report examines all the ways people are 
earning income, as well as the challenges that 
independent work presents. 

Digital America: A tale of the haves and 
have-mores (December 2015) 
While the most advanced sectors, companies, 
and individuals push the boundaries of 
technology use, the US economy as a whole is 
realizing only 18 percent of its digital potential. 

Bridging global infrastructure gaps 
(June 2016)
Global infrastructure systems are straining to 
meet demand, and the spending trajectory 
will lead to worsening gaps. But there are 
solutions to unlock financing and make the 
sector more productive.
