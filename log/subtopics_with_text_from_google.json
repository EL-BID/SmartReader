by unlocking their people s potential Automation and artificial intelligence AI are transforming businesses and will contribute to economic growth via contributions to productivity They will also help address moonshot societal challenges in areas from health to climate change At the same time these technologies will transform the nature of work and the workplace itself Machines will be able to carry out more of the tasks done by humans complement the work that humans do and even perform some tasks that go beyond what humans can do As a result some occupations will decline others will grow and many more will change While we believe there will be enough work to go around barring extreme scenarios society will need to grapple with significant workforce transitions and dislocation Workers will need to acquire new skills and adapt to the increasingly capable machines alongside them in the workplace They may have to move from declining occupations to growing and in some cases new occupations This executive briefing which draws on the latest research from the McKinsey Global Institute examines both the promise and the challenge of automation and AI in the workplace and outlines some of the critical issues that policy makers companies and individuals will need to solve for Automation and AI are not new but recent technological progress is pushing the frontier of what machines can do Our research suggests that society needs these improvements to provide value for businesses contribute to economic growth and make once unimaginable progress on some of our most difficult societal challenges In summary Beyond traditional industrial automation and advanced robots new generations of more capable autonomous systems are appearing in environments ranging from autonomous vehicles on roads to automated check outs in grocery stores Much of this progress has been driven by improvements in systems and components including mechanics sensors and software AI has made especially large strides in recent years as machine learning algorithms have become more sophisticated and made use of huge increases in computing power and of the exponential growth in data available to train them Spectacular breakthroughs are making headlines many involving beyond human capabilities in computer vision natural language processing and complex games such as Go These technologies are already generating value in various products and services and companies across sectors use them in an array of processes to personalize product recommendations find anomalies in production identify fraudulent transactions and more The latest generation of AI advances including techniques that address classification estimation and clustering problems promises significantly more value still An analysis we conducted of several hundred AI use cases found that the most advanced deep learning techniques deploying artificial neural networks could account for as much as 3 5 trillion to 5 8 trillion in annual value or 40 percent of the value created by all analytics techniques Exhibit 1 Deployment of AI and automation technologies can do much to lift the global economy and increase global prosperity at a time when aging and falling birth rates are acting as a drag on growth Labor productivity growth a key driver of economic growth has slowed in many economies dropping to an average of 0 5 percent in 2010 2014 from 2 4 percent a decade earlier in the United States and major European economies in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis after a previous productivity boom had waned AI and automation have the potential to reverse that decline productivity growth could potentially reach 2 percent annually over the next decade with 60 percent of this increase from digital opportunities AI is also being used in areas ranging from material science to medical research and climate science Application of the technologies in these and other disciplines could help tackle societal moonshot challenges For example researchers at Geisinger have developed an algorithm that could reduce diagnostic times for intracranial hemorrhaging by up to 96 percent Researchers at George Washington University meanwhile are using machine learning to more accurately weight the climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AI and automation still face challenges The limitations are partly technical such as the need for massive training data and difficulties generalizing algorithms across use cases Recent innovations are just starting to address these issues Other challenges are in the use of AI techniques For example explaining decisions made by machine learning algorithms is technically challenging which particularly matters for use cases involving financial lending or legal applications Potential bias in the training data and algorithms as well as data privacy malicious use and security are all issues that must be addressed Europe is leading with the new General Data Protection Regulation which codifies more rights for users over data collection and usage A different sort of challenge concerns the ability of organizations to adopt these technologies where people data availability technology and process readiness often make it difficult Adoption is already uneven across sectors and countries The finance automotive and telecommunications sectors lead AI adoption Among countries US investment in AI ranked first at 15 billion to 23 billion in 2016 followed by Asia s investments of 8 billion to 12 billion with Europe lagging behind at 3 billion to 4 billion Even as AI and automation bring benefits to business and society we will need to prepare for major disruptions to work Our analysis of more than 2000 work activities across more than 800 occupations shows that certain categories of activities are more easily automatable than others They include physical activities in highly predictable and structured environments as well as data collection and data processing These account for roughly half of the activities that people do across all sectors The least susceptible categories include managing others providing expertise and interfacing with stakeholders Nearly all occupations will be affected by automation but only about 5 percent of occupations could be fully automated by currently demonstrated technologies Many more occupations have portions of their constituent activities that are automatable we find that about 30 percent of the activities in 60 percent of all occupations could be automated This means that most workers from welders to mortgage brokers to CEOs will work alongside rapidly evolving machines The nature of these occupations will likely change as a result Automation will displace some workers We have found that around 15 percent of the global workforce or about 400 million workers could be displaced by automation in the period 2016 2030 This reflects our midpoint scenario in projecting the pace and scope of adoption Under the fastest scenario we have modeled that figure rises to 30 percent or 800 million workers In our slowest adoption scenario only about 10 million people would be displaced close to zero percent of the global workforce Exhibit 2 The wide range underscores the multiple factors that will impact the pace and scope of AI and automation adoption Technical feasibility of automation is only the first influencing factor Other factors include the cost of deployment labor market dynamics including labor supply quantity quality and the associated wages the benefits beyond labor substitution that contribute to business cases for adoption and finally social norms and acceptance Adoption will continue to vary significantly across countries and sectors because of differences in the above factors especially labor market dynamics in advanced economies with relatively high wage levels such as France Japan and the United States automation could displace 20 to 25 percent of the workforce by 2030 in a midpoint adoption scenario more than double the rate in India Even as workers are displaced there will be growth in demand for work and consequently jobs We developed scenarios for labor demand to 2030 from several catalysts of demand for work including rising incomes increased spending on healthcare and continuing or stepped up investment in infrastructure energy and technology development and deployment These scenarios showed a range of additional labor demand of between 21 percent to 33 percent of the global workforce 555 million and 890 million jobs to 2030 more than offsetting the numbers of jobs lost Some of the largest gains will be in emerging economies such as India where the working age population is already growing rapidly Additional economic growth including from business dynamism and rising productivity growth will also continue to create jobs Many other new occupations that we cannot currently imagine will also emerge and may account for as much as 10 percent of jobs created by 2030 if history is a guide Moreover technology itself has historically been a net job creator For example the introduction of the personal computer in the 1970s and 1980s created millions of jobs not just for semiconductor makers but also for software and app developers of all types customer service representatives and information analysts Partial automation will become more prevalent as machines complement human labor For example AI algorithms that can read diagnostic scans with a high degree of accuracy will help doctors diagnose patient cases and identify suitable treatment In other fields jobs with repetitive tasks could shift toward a model of managing and troubleshooting automated systems At retailer Amazon employees who previously lifted and stacked objects are becoming robot operators monitoring the automated arms and resolving issues such as an interruption in the flow of objects While we expect there will be enough work to ensure full employment in 2030 based on most of our scenarios the transitions that will accompany automation and AI adoption will be significant The mix of occupations will change as will skill and educational requirements Work will need to be redesigned to ensure that humans work alongside machines most effectively Automation will accelerate the shift in required workforce skills we have seen over the past 15 years Demand for advanced technological skills such as programming will grow rapidly Social emotional and higher cognitive skills such as creativity critical thinking and complex information processing will also see growing demand Basic digital skills demand has been increasing and that trend will continue and accelerate Demand for physical and manual skills will decline but will remain the single largest category of workforce skills in 2030 in many countries Exhibit 3 This will put additional pressure on the already existing workforce skills challenge as well as the need for new credentialing systems While some innovative solutions are emerging solutions that can match the scale of the challenge will be needed Our research suggests that in a midpoint scenario around 3 percent of the global workforce will need to change occupational categories by 2030 though scenarios range from about 0 to 14 percent Some of these shifts will happen within companies and sectors but many will occur across sectors and even geographies Occupations made up of physical activities in highly structured environments or in data processing or collection will see declines Growing occupations will include those with difficult to automate activities such as managers and those in unpredictable physical environments such as plumbers Other occupations that will see increasing demand for work include teachers nursing aides and tech and other professionals As intelligent machines and software are integrated more deeply into the workplace workflows and workspaces will continue to evolve to enable humans and machines to work together As self checkout machines are introduced in stores for example cashiers can become checkout assistance helpers who can help answer questions or troubleshoot the machines More system level solutions will prompt rethinking of the entire workflow and workspace Warehouse design may change significantly as some portions are designed to accommodate primarily robots and others to facilitate safe human machine interaction The occupational mix shifts will likely put pressure on wages Many of the current middle wage jobs in advanced economies are dominated by highly automatable activities such as in manufacturing or in accounting which are likely to decline High wage jobs will grow significantly especially for high skill medical and tech or other professionals but a large portion of jobs expected to be created including teachers and nursing aides typically have lower wage structures The risk is that automation could exacerbate wage polarization income inequality and the lack of income advancement that has characterized the past decade across advanced economies stoking social and political tensions Most countries already face the challenge of adequately educating and training their workforces to meet the current requirements of employers Across the OECD spending on worker education and training has been declining over the last two decades Spending on worker transition and dislocation assistance has also continued to shrink as a percentage of GDP One lesson of the past decade is that while globalization may have benefited economic growth and people as consumers the wage and dislocation effects on workers were not adequately addressed Most analyses including our own suggest that the scale of these issues is likely to grow in the coming decades We have also seen in the past that large scale workforce transitions can have a lasting effect on wages during the 19th century Industrial Revolution wages in the United Kingdom remained stagnant for about half a century despite rising productivity a phenomenon known as Engels Pause PDF 690KB after the German philosopher who identified it In the search for appropriate measures and policies to address these challenges we should not seek to roll back or slow diffusion of the technologies Companies and governments should harness automation and AI to benefit from the enhanced performance and productivity contributions as well as the societal benefits These technologies will create the economic surpluses that will help societies manage workforce transitions Rather the focus should be on ways to ensure that the workforce transitions are as smooth as possible This is likely to require actionable and scalable solutions in several key areas There is work for everyone today and there will be work for everyone tomorrow even in a future with automation Yet that work will be different requiring new skills and a far greater adaptability of the workforce than we have seen Training and retraining both midcareer workers and new generations for the coming challenges will be an imperative Government private sector leaders and innovators all need to work together to better coordinate public and private initiatives including creating the right incentives to invest more in human capital The future with automation and AI will be challenging but a much richer one if we harness the technologies with aplomb and mitigate the negative effects James Manyika is chairman and

trapped in a room with its mate looks uncannily like a dog well maybe a mutant dog with a canary yellow body and a proboscis sticking out where its head should be The robot confidently scurries to the door raises itself to the perfect height and then uses its appendage to press down the handle Pulling open the door the robot allows its mate to be first across the threshold before the two of them make their dash for freedom Such is the content of a short video by Boston Dynamics that has gone viral since it was released in February Reactions to it on social media have ranged from amusement soon they ll be opening our fridges and stealing our beer to alarm this is how we die It is the latest evidence of recent remarkable advances in robotics and artificial intelligence robots can now perform backflips and ride bicycles and machines empowered by AI are able to analyze X ray images better than expert radiologists and to teach themselves to play the ancient game of Go better than world champions Yet the dog clip is also powerful because it conjures up a more worrisome vision of robots on the loose beyond the control of us humans Thus it plays into a powerful angst laden contemporary narrative about technology and the future of work and maybe even of mankind itself What really are the risks from this new wave of technology And will the opportunities these advances bring with them outweigh those risks To address such questions about the future it is useful indeed necessary to look to the past Technology has for centuries both excited the human imagination and prompted fears about the effects Back in 1589 Queen Elizabeth I of England refused to grant a patent to a stocking frame invented by one William Lee because Her Majesty was concerned about the effect of the contraption on the livelihoods of those who knitted stockings by hand The Luddite weavers in Britain and silk workers in Lyons France famously staged revolts in the early 19th century against new automated looms that threatened their skilled and well paid jobs And in the realm of fiction imagination has run riot since the Czech writer Karel Capek coined the word robot from a Slavic word for work in his 1920 play Rossum s Universal Robots a k a RUR which ends with the destruction of mankind As one of Capek s characters explains Robots are not people Mechanically they are more perfect than we are they have an enormously developed intelligence but they have no soul For 100 percent of continuous 10 year periods in the United States technologically driven productivity gains have gone hand in hand with rising employment Almost a century later that same concern about soulless hyper intelligence infuses not just movies like The Matrix and mind bending video series like Philip K Dick s Electric Dreams but also warnings about AI and its potential consequences expressed by Elon Musk and the late Stephen Hawking among others Back in the 1950s the German philosopher Martin Heidegger fretted about the risk that humans would become enslaved by the technologies we rely on With the rise of machines able to mimic many human traits from speech albeit still falteringly to facial recognition already significantly more accurately than humans that time appears to be much closer Yet when we switch from philosophy to economics we find a very different story a long historical record of innovation that shows technological change has been overwhelmingly positive for productivity and surprisingly benign when it comes to employment Job displacement has occurred in waves first with the structural shift from agriculture to manufacturing and then with the move from manufacturing to services Throughout productivity gains generated by new technology have been reinvested and the GDP bounce from that productivity eventually raises consumption and on balance increases the demand for labor In McKinsey s research we have sought to quantify this trend and its net impact in several ways For example we looked at the very big picture what happened to employment as productivity grew over the past 50 years We found no tradeoff between the two for 100 percent of continuous 10 year periods in the United States technologically driven productivity gains have gone hand in hand with rising employment Even when measured in one year snapshots productivity and employment have risen together four years in five The personal computer provides an iconic case to support the compatibility of technological progress with job growth We measured how many jobs were lost and how many gained in the United States between 1980 and 2015 as a result of the diffusion of computer technology Several hundred thousand bookkeepers and auditing clerks secretaries and typists did lose their jobs But the overall balance was strongly positive the desktop laptop computer created more than 19 million jobs in industries ranging from computer hardware to enterprise software to online retail sales against the loss of about 3 5 million jobs a net gain of 15 7 million That figure amounts to 18 percent of all the net U S employment created in the period almost one in five jobs Something similar happened with the invention of the automobile which destroyed the horse and buggy business but gave rise to a wealth of new sometimes unimagined products from petroleum based synthetic rubber to motels That said we ignore those left along the way at our peril For the many workers who are displaced painful transitions are a reality In Britain during the industrial revolution starting in about 1800 wages of the masses stagnated for almost a half century despite a strong surge in productivity that enriched the owners of capital a phenomenon often referred to as Engels pause because it was first noted by the German philosopher who co authored with Karl Marx The Communist Manifesto Wages picked up again as the fruits of productivity gains eventually trickled down to workers But eventually can be a long time the Luddites fears were not entirely unfounded And once again today the link between productivity gains and wage growth seems bent if not broken U S median hourly compensation rose only 11 percent from 1973 to 2016 even as hourly labor productivity grew by 75 percent While it is natural to focus on labor displacement through technology one element often overlooked in the discussion of the future of work is the number of jobs that are neither lost nor gained but fundamentally changed for reasons that are hard to predict History again provides some examples When ATMs became as common as vending machines in the 1970s the number of bank tellers actually increased That s because the new technology reduced the costs of processing individual transactions giving the banks incentives to open more branches to meet local demand for other financial services The tellers primary tasks changed from cashing checks and taking deposits to providing advice and selling securities mortgages and the like To be sure this tale is not yet complete with the rise of online banking the demand for tellers has again waned and so their numbers have thinned especially after the 2008 financial crisis But modern economies are nothing if not dynamic and the only certainty is change There s a similar story to be told about jobs and information technology Thanks to the internet and some ingenious software anyone can now dig up information at the blink of a cursor Yet the need for data analysis has exploded even as the need for data gathering clerks and the like has plummeted And so the number of information analysts of the genus homo sapiens has quintupled since 1980 to about two million today This largely comforting history isn t much help in determining whether this time will be different To the point the rise of ever more sophisticated technologies especially artificial intelligence that can be brought to bear on any number of tasks is likely to usher in a new age of rapid workforce transitions The McKinsey Global Institute recently estimated that in our fastest automation adoption scenario as many as 375 million workers worldwide or about 14 percent of the global workforce will need to switch occupational categories by 2030 in order to avoid obsolescence Even if the pace of adoption is slower as in our midpoint scenario some 75 million workers will need to switch occupational categories in the next 10 to 15 years Among the work most vulnerable to automation jobs that require routinized physical activity in a predictable setting and collecting and processing data Some aspects of the current technological transformation seem in line with that of previous eras the rise of computers for example and earlier epochs of technical change such as the diffusion of the steam engine that transformed work across multiple sectors of the economy simultaneously Every new wave of automation seems remarkable at the time and AI is not the first technology to chip away at cognitive tasks Since the birth of computerized spreadsheets in the 1980s machines have tackled ever more sophisticated problems that previously required human brainpower Still other aspects of the new technologies do seem qualitatively different from previous waves of innovation The rate of technological change today is strikingly rapid and while hard to measure appears to be accelerating Consider in this regard the development of deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques based on neural networks the exponential increase in computing capacity made available through the cloud and the sheer volume of data that can be generated These advances are driving AI for example enabling the development of autonomous vehicles but also heralding breakthrough applications such as a heightened ability to diagnose disease with non invasive techniques Accordingly the share of jobs that could be automated could also be larger than historical precedents suggest The future of work looks set to be not a tale of machines replacing humans but of machines complementing humans in the workplace That said we see no evidence to date suggesting that the time it takes for new technologies to be diffused throughout the economy is shrinking Looking at a range of high value technologies over the past 60 years from airbags to MRI machines to smartphones we find that the pace of adoption hasn t changed It still takes between 5 and 16 years to reach 50 percent adoption and 5 to 28 years to reach 80 percent adoption Even highly popular social media applications do not beat this clock Facebook for example was begun in 2004 and had attracted more than 2 2 billion followers 13 years later but the untapped market remains vast Consider too that new technology is rarely applied to a blank canvas a variety of economic and social factors play a big role in determining the pace of adoption They include the cost of developing and deploying the hardware and software labor market dynamics the regulatory environment and social acceptance Computer algorithms in state of the art technology aircraft can do just about anything asked of them without a helping hand but we still insist on humans in the cockpit for peace of mind And who wants to be cared for in a hospital solely by a robot We remain disconcerted by the uncanny valley the term coined by the Japanese robotics guru Masahiro Mori to characterize that unsettling feeling people may experience when facing humanoid robots Indeed for tech luminaries ranging from the MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson to the former Google chairman Eric Schmidt the future of work looks set to be not a tale of machines replacing humans but of machines complementing humans in the workplace The rise of AI and the ascendance of self learned algorithms whose logic can be hard to explain pose some arguably unique problems A recent report from a who s who of experts on the malicious use of AI lists a number of the darkest scenarios from political manipulation through hyper personalized disinformation campaigns to a major increase in sophisticated computer hacking attacks For now AI pioneers including Google DeepMind s chief executive Demis Hassabis are clear that while machines are proving formidable in specific areas such as games we remain a long way away from the time when they will have mastered a general artificial intelligence enabling them to think and act like humans And a number of groups including Stanford University s AI100 with which I am associated are trying to look ahead to study and anticipate how AI will affect the way people live work and play long into the future The challenges here for policymakers and business leaders worldwide are significant We will need to institute retraining of workers on a scale we have not seen for generations We will need to rethink and adapt our social systems to help hundreds of millions of workers affected by the new technologies hopefully handling it better than we have handled globalization in providing both new forms of income and job transition support We will need to find ways to tame the wilder unpredictable side of AI For their part CEOs will need to rethink their organizational structures and processes to take advantage of the technologies and the performance enhancing effects they can have or risk ending up in the recycle bin of business history While all of this may seem intimidating it is still the best way forward We should embrace automation technologies for the productivity benefits they bring even as we deal proactively with the workforce transitions that will accompany adoption Given that demographic trends increased longevity low birth rates are rapidly increasing the dependent population our societies really need that productivity boost Beyond the prosperity and employment these technologies will create there will be other societal benefits new moonshots as we use the power of AI to tackle daunting problems from cancer to climate change We can already see one of the key challenges that of worker retraining or reskilling as some like to call it advancing to the top of the corporate agenda and in some countries also receiving renewed political attention In our recent work on the skills that will be needed by the workforce we found that demand will rise sharply not just for technological skills of all kinds but also for social and emotional skills that is leadership and empathy with customers as well as for higher cognitive skills linked to creativity and complex information processing Business leaders tell us that they believe finding the right talent to help implement automation is critical to their future financial performance and they expect companies to take the lead in the skills upgrade that is required Some firms are already putting in place large scale retraining initiatives AT T is using external education providers including for example Udacity At SAP the German enterprise software company the focus is on in house efforts to create learning journeys for thousands of employees including engineers who need to acquire softer skills as their roles change to service customers directly Walmart has set up more than 100 academies in the United States that provide hands on training for positions that include customer service managers and online grocery pickup While welcome these disparate retraining efforts are barely a start Given the scale of the occupational and skill shifts that we see coming in the next decade much more will need to be done and not just by business Governments and educational establishments working together with philanthropic foundations will of necessity be part of the mix Foundations have the advantage of being able to test innovative programs as pilots and will not face the disadvantage of concern that workers with new skills will subsequently jump ship for a new employer As a starter governments will need to reverse the 20 plus year decline in spending on labor related services no small task in light of tight government budgets and in the United States reflexive opposition to government intervention They will also need to be more flexible in order to adapt to the rapidly changing workplace Mobility is one key yet labor markets have become markedly less dynamic in recent years In the United States for example job reallocation rates have declined by 25 percent since 1990 This is the time to test ideas such as portable benefits that are owned by workers and not tied to particular jobs or companies Technology itself can help facilitate greater mobility especially digital platforms turbocharged by AI that enable matching of people to jobs But we also need to rethink some basic assumptions In order for changing jobs across sectors to become a common practice companies will need to agree on definitions and qualifications for specific skills And a major debate is overdue about credentialing Today higher education encourages the world to judge graduates by their subject knowledge rather than by their skills in problem solving and creative thinking skills that will be especially valuable in an AI enhanced workplace More than anything we need to prepare for this new era in which humans must work alongside smart machines far more intensively President Lyndon Johnson was prescient in this regard writing a half a century ago Automation is not our enemy Our enemies are ignorance indifference and inertia Automation can be the ally of our prosperity if we will just look ahead if we will understand what is to come and if we will set our course wisely after proper planning Back then nobody other than science fiction writers could have imagined robot dogs opening doors and escaping to wherever those androids from Blade Runner found refuge But LBJ s words resonate planning for change has never been

generally rises Erik Brynjolfsson Director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital EconomyThe rapid pace of technical advances and the increasing feasibility of automation has created questions about the future of work and its potential for displacing workers Estimates of the scale of threatened jobs over the next decade or two range from 9 to 47 according to a 2016 White House research report This is defined as those working in jobs where more than 70 of their activities can be automated On average nearly one half 46 of work activities in the country are currently automatable Share of Jobs with Highly Automatable Skills by EducationMost of this risk is concentrated among lower paid lower skilled and less educated workers Workers earning below 20 per hour face a greater than 80 chance of displacement More than two out of five workers without a high school degree have job skills that are considered highly automatable These projections should raise concerns about the ability of communities to tackle existing issues of social equity and affordable housing that could be exacerbated by automation Share of Jobs with High Probability of Automation by Occupation s Median Hourly WageJob tasks that are most susceptible include predictable physical tasks which make up 8 of all work tasks data processing 16 processing and data collection 17 On the other end of the spectrum work that either involves managing others 7 or applying expertise 14 proves the least susceptible However even these jobs aren t immune to some degree of automation This magnitude of shifts in work activities over multiple decades is not unprecedented The share of U S farm employment fell from 40 in 1900 to 2 in 2000 while the share of manufacturing employment fell from approximately 25 in 1950 to less than 10 in 2010 In both cases new activities and jobs were created that offset those that disappeared What may be unprecedented is the pace of the change and scale of people affected That said a decline in immigration to the United States and the aging population decline in the share of the working age population will open economic growth gaps at the same time that we re seeing job disruption due to automation We will see large scale shifts in workplace activities over the next century and these trends are already underway These shifts are inherent in automation technologies and also a consequence of a shifting labor demographic Millennials who already constitute the largest workforce population in the U S are demanding greater flexibility and autonomy than previous generations Building an educated workforce and rethinking our educational and training programs is the most critical task in preparing for the future of an automated world says Erik Brynjolfsson director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy and co author of The Second Machine Age Work Progress and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies Individuals will be required to have not only coding skills he says but also more diverse math reading interpersonal and creative skill sets According to the National League of Cities The Future of Work in Cities report nearly all 95 of the 11 6 million jobs that have been created since the last recession required some postsecondary education While science technology engineering and math STEM skills are emphasized many employers are also looking for primary and secondary educational systems to address gaps in workplace competencies like teamwork problem solving and communication STEM skills may power new technologies but the soft skills of collaboration critical thinking and interpersonal skills are vital components of the jobs likely to endure automation The balance of these skills will remain essential to prepare students with the human digital capabilities they will need As more restaurant orders are automated and shopping moves further online humans who work in these retail sectors will be expected to provide the customer with something extra something social to shift toward selling more personalized or unique experiences what the experts call the commodification of experience New technology and peer to peer platforms as well as a greater emphasis on personal craftsmanship and human ability have fueled the growth of a creative class of individuals capable of marketing their work from home This emphasis will likely continue to spread across the lower skilled labor market where individuality and a personal touch are valued and where services cannot be outsourced or easily automated Cities should encourage entrepreneurship and reduce barriers to innovation For example they can limit the number of occupational licenses necessary or streamline the process to get new licenses The 21st century worker will need a lifelong learning mindset to be successful and use digital resources to enable digital skills development The nation will need to reverse its declining investment in our workforce if we are going to sufficiently prepare people for future jobs in an era of automated work Scholarship Sacramento Valley Vision based in Sacramento created a comprehensive online platform of local scholarships for students who live in the Sacramento region to help address the growing costs of advanced education tuition at four year public colleges is up 33 since the 2007 08 school year They have identified approximately 350 000 in local scholarship funds in Sacramento County Since the program s inception in 2013 it has reached more than 1 000 students and their families with scholarship education and one on one and group mentoring Degrees At Work in Louisville In 2010 Louisville made a citywide commitment to add 55 000 college degrees 40 000 bachelor s and 15 000 associate degrees to its workforce by 2020 They first targeted the lowest hanging fruit the more than 90 000 local adults who had already completed some college coursework Degrees At Work aims to help 15 000 working adults earn degrees by 2020 working with local companies that have stepped up to provide tuition reimbursement college advising and flexible schedules for their employees Long Beach Internship

Local Government CommissionLGC Board LoginVideoAre the robots coming for government jobs According to Bill Eggers the answer is yes sort of Eggers who runs Deloitte s Center for Government Insights said at a Nov 29 FCW event on government modernization that 20 to 30 percent of all work activities will soon be automatable thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence He pointed to a Deloitte study of the federal workforce that found 4 3 billion hours are spent each year on a wide range of task and activities A huge share of those hours is devoted to essentially moving paper he said while relatively little time goes to coaching and other sorts of human activities But the study also found that four out of five of the most labor intensive activities have either a medium or high automation potential Eggers said That could allow for reductions in certain parts of the workforce he noted but it also frees up time for critical higher value work and the chance to deliver better service by giving the human workforce AI powered support Studies have repeatedly shown Eggers said that it s the human machine pairing that gives the best results he said The full video of

Bremmer warns the audience about the dangers of automation at an Intelligence Squared U S debate Can we all agree that Google Duplex demo was eerie A robot posing as a human being scheduled a reservation over the phone We all knew artificial intelligence was coming but it was breathtaking to hear software come to life Before we go any further let s get our terms straight Automation and artificial intelligence are not the same thing According to Dave Evans Automation is software that follows pre programmed rules Artificial intelligence is designed to simulate human thinking Automation in this context refers to the impact of artificial intelligence on tasks that only humans can perform today Even if you re skeptical of Google Duplex in light of the current backlash Alexa has made her way into millions of homes Amazon and Google are proving the value of artificial intelligence to consumers Apple still has a ways to go with Siri While Alexa won t take down the government there was a recent debate about the impact of automation on democracy that s worth watching Intelligence Squared U S features debates about current events Each episode puts forward a provocative motion like Automation Will Crash Democracy Two teams of two debate the motion There are polls conducted at the beginning and at the end of the debate A team wins by persuading audience members to change their opinion Ian Bremmer and Yascha Mounk argued for the motion insisting automation will crash democracy Andrew Keen and Alina Polyakova argued against the motion It s unclear whether the middle class can survive an AI revolution It could leave very few jobs for the masses In this scenario the rich would end up with even more power And without a middle class it s hard to sustain a healthy democracy Not scary enough for you Tech pioneers like Elon Musk and Bill Gates have spoken out about the dangers of artificial intelligence Although Gates thinks Musk should take it down a notch Musk is so concerned that he co founded OpenAI The nonprofit which he also chairs researches artificial intelligence to make the technology safer and more accessible Ian Bremmer one of the debate s participants recently published a bestselling book titled Us vs Them The Failure of Globalism Even though the motion didn t reference China Bremmer invoked the country for good reason Bremmer insists the US could be at a disadvantage Right now it s either Silicon Valley or it s China Those are the drivers of automation Since the actual government drives innovation in China they can leverage the technology and advance it The United States government doesn t have that level of control over its technology sector Moreover based on the recent Facebook hearings it s hard to imagine the US government confronting the threat of automation in a meaningful way Mounk fears a consolidation of power So I think that there s two different ways in which democracy might come under pressure The first is that there s going to be enclaves of very rich people who actually own all of the productive material in society which is the machines and robots and so on being asked to give up more and more money in order to finance that nice universal basic income scheme Throughout the debate he derides universal basic income as a program that can easily be abused Mounk thinks democracy is far fetched in this new world We ve only ever had democracy in the time period from the French Revolution until today when political leaders needed citizen armies when we could rely on average citizens to stand up to defend the country against enemies abroad and to keep the peace at home He believes the rich will protect themselves with their own robot armies and no longer need the middle class The counterarguments from Andrew Keen and Alina Polyakova were more optimistic Keen is an entrepreneur and author Polyakova is a fellow at the Brookings Institute They believe regulation will provide the proper guard rails for innovation That s why they reject all the doomsday scenarios that could result from automation Polyakova also has faith in new industries if we look at every technological revolution we see far more jobs created or people transitioning into a different industry versus just mass unemployment It s easy to hold the AI revolution up to the industrial revolution but it s different While I believe automation will create new jobs the current rate of change is so unprecedented it s hard to compare it to the past Both sides of the debate agree regulation can thwart many of the potential threats of automation It s unclear where the United States will find the political will to respond given its current legislative gridlock The artificial intelligence revolution will challenge America s system of government but it s still worth wondering can democracy survive Find out which team won the debate Watch it here Follow Theo on Twitter or go to Hit Start Media to listen

Darrell M West is author of the Brookings book The Future of Work Robots AI and Automation In Edward Bellamy s classic Looking Backward the protagonist Julian West wakes up from a 113 year slumber and finds the United States in 2000 has changed dramatically from 1887 People stop working at age forty five and devote their lives to mentoring other people and engaging in volunteer work that benefits the overall community There are short work weeks for employees and everyone receives full benefits food and housing 1 The reason is that new technologies of the period have enabled people to be very productive while working part time Businesses do not need large numbers of employees so individuals can devote most of their waking hours to hobbies volunteering and community service In conjunction with periodic work stints they have time to pursue new skills and personal identities that are independent of their jobs In the current era developed countries may be on the verge of a similar transition Robotics and machine learning have improved productivity and enhanced the economies of many nations Artificial intelligence AI has advanced into finance transportation defense and energy management The internet of things IoT is facilitated by high speed networks and remote sensors to connect people and businesses In all of this there is a possibility of a new era that could improve the lives of many people 2 Yet amid these possible benefits there is widespread fear that robots and AI will take jobs and throw millions of people into poverty A Pew Research Center study asked 1 896 experts about the impact of emerging technologies and found half of these experts 48 percent envision a future in which robots and digital agents will have displaced significant numbers of both blue and white collar workers with many expressing concern that this will lead to vast increases in income inequality masses of people who are effectively unemployable and breakdowns in the social order 3 These fears have been echoed by detailed analyses showing anywhere from a 14 to 54 percent automation impact on jobs For example a Bruegel analysis found that 54 of EU jobs are at risk of computerization 4 Using European data they argue that job losses are likely to be significant and people should prepare for large scale disruption Related Technology Innovation How artificial

February 14 2019 Technology Innovation What is artificial intelligence Darrell M West Thursday October 4 2018Meanwhile Oxford University researchers Carl Frey and Michael Osborne claim that technology will transform many sectors of life They studied 702 occupational groupings and found that 47 percent of U S workers have a high probability of seeing their jobs automated over the next 20 years 5 A McKinsey Global Institute analysis of 750 jobs concluded that 45 of paid activities could be automated using currently demonstrated technologies and 60 of occupations could have 30 or more of their processes automated 6 A more recent McKinsey report Jobs Lost Jobs Gained found that 30 percent of work activities could be automated by 2030 and up to 375 million workers worldwide could be affected by emerging technologies 7 Researchers at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD focused on tasks as opposed to jobs and found fewer job losses Using task related data from 32 OECD countries they estimated that 14 percent of jobs are highly automatable and another 32 have a significant risk of automation Although their job loss estimates are below those of other experts they concluded that low qualified workers are likely to bear the brunt of the adjustment costs as the automatibility of their jobs is higher compared to highly qualified workers 8 Related Books Going

2015While some dispute the dire predictions on grounds new positions will be created to offset the job losses the fact that all these major studies report significant workforce disruptions should be taken seriously If the employment impact falls at the 38 percent mean of these forecasts Western democracies likely could resort to authoritarianism as happened in some countries during the Great Depression of the 1930s in order to keep their restive populations in check If that happened wealthy elites would require armed guards security details and gated communities to protect themselves as is the case in poor countries today with high income inequality The United States would look like Syria or Iraq with armed bands of young men with few employment prospects other than war violence or theft Yet even if the job ramifications lie more at the low end of disruption the political consequences still will be severe Relatively small increases in unemployment or underemployment have an outsized political impact We saw that a decade ago when 10 percent unemployment during the Great Recession spawned the Tea party and eventually helped to make Donald Trump president With some workforce disruption virtually guaranteed by trends already underway it is safe to predict American politics will be chaotic and turbulent during the coming decades As innovation accelerates and public anxiety intensifies right wing and left wing populists will jockey for voter support Government control could gyrate between very conservative and very liberal leaders as each side blames a different set of scapegoats for economic outcomes voters don t like The calm and predictable politics of the post World War II era likely will become a distant memory as the American system moves

disappearing but they are transforming as artificial intelligence machine learning and advanced robotics tackle more roles in the workplace Policymakers should act now to help New Yorkers prepare for the changes that are coming to the world of work by Matt A V ChabanTags automation new york state economic opportunity workforce opportunity innovation economy tech middle class jobs projectIt has taken decades for New York State s economy to rebound from the effects of offshoring and globalization From Buffalo and Rochester to Binghamton and Riverhead the state has shed hundreds of thousands of jobs particularly in manufacturing and related industrial sectors and upstate job growth has been comparatively slow Yet in the years ahead New York State will need to contend with an even more powerful and fast moving economic force automation Machine learning robotics and artificial intelligence are poised to bring about massive changes to a much larger swath of the economy in the years ahead sweeping not just through factory floors but office towers hospital wards and main streets Automation has the potential to displace workers in a growing range of occupations as varied as bookkeepers and x ray technicians paralegals and food prep workers The result is that both traditional and emerging industries will be transformed with significant effects on New York s workforce This research provides the first comprehensive look at the automation potential of every occupation statewide and in each of New York s ten regions Our study finds that New York State is less susceptible to automation than the nation as a whole But it also reveals that more than 1 2 million jobs in the state about 12 percent of the state s workforce could be largely automated using technology that exists today These are jobs in which 80 percent or more of their associated tasks could be done by machines To be clear automation is not expected to eliminate all or even most of these jobs Indeed this analysis shows that there are only about 24 740 jobs in the state that are 100 percent automatable As with other major economic transformations such as the Industrial Revolution the dawn of electricity and the Internet age some jobs will disappear many will be created and in the end most will simply change There is immense potential for jobs across New York to be transformed Statewide the equivalent of 41 2 percent of all job tasks could be performed by machines in the coming decade On this score New York is actually better off than the nation where 51 percent of all job tasks could be done by machines according to an analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute on which this report is based This is not to suggest that 41 percent of jobs in the state will be eliminated that is simply the scope of job responsibilities that could change as more of today s work whether taking orders entering data or even driving is done by machines The potential for automation is spread fairly evenly across the state Of all regions the automation potential is highest in Western New York where 44 5 percent of all job tasks could be done using existing technology Other regions with high automation potential include Central New York 44 4 percent the North Country 44 3 percent the Mohawk Valley 43 8 percent and Long Island 43 7 New York City has the lowest potential for automation as detailed by the Center in a January report just 39 percent of jobs in the five boroughs stand a high likelihood of being automated But other regions also have a comparatively lower potential for automation such as the Capital Region 42 percent and the Hudson Valley 42 2 percent 1 This research part of our Middle Class Jobs Project a research initiative funded by Fisher Brothers and Winston C Fisher also finds that the jobs that offer New Yorkers a foothold in the economy and a gateway to the middle class are the ones most threatened by automation Such is the case with the state s roughly 155 000 food preparers and servers including fast food workers the largest group whose tasks are highly susceptible to automation 87 percent of their job tasks could be automated It s also the case for the state s 124 000 accounting and bookkeeping clerks 86 percent automation potential and the 181 000 who drive tractor trailers delivery trucks and buses 78 to 85 percent automation potential Additionally there are 112 000 stock clerks and 34 000 dishwashers whose jobs are all roughly 86 percent automatable Even among the state s 20 000 chief executives computers will be able to perform 25 percent of their work in the coming decades That s a notch more vulnerable than the state s 211 000 janitors since machines are predicted to do only 22 percent of all custodial tasks although smart mops could well become part of the job We also conclude that the strongest effects are on lower and middle income jobs the first rungs of the state s economic ladder where the impact of automation is likely to be significant Among the 100 most automatable occupations in the state with at least 1 000 workers 68 percent make less than 40 000 per year while 31 percent make between 40 000 and 80 000 annually and only one of those positions crane operators makes more In total the equivalent of 186 billion wages could be impacted by automation Precisely because it will be difficult to predict exactly which jobs will be impacted by automation and where policymakers business leaders and educators across New York have all the more reason to start preparing now In many parts of the state the same communities that have struggled with the loss of industrial and manufacturing jobs are likely to confront even greater challenges in the years ahead Meanwhile areas that have benefited from new jobs in industries like restaurants and retail will not be immune to the forces of automation Preparing New York State for the future of work is a job that starts today Automation and the Empire StateThe effects of automation will be felt in every corner of the state although some regions rely more heavily on highly automatable jobs In evaluating the likelihood that a machine could perform each job s component tasks this analysis reveals which occupations are most likely to be augmented and supplanted in the decades to come One key factor in determining automatability is the prevalence of work that is highly routine whether physically or cognitively Where job tasks are more variable relying on interpersonal relationships and quick judgement calls humans continue to have the edge The effects of automation may no longer be confined to the factory floor but production occupations remain the most susceptible to displacement That s a major reason why Western New York where manufacturing still accounts for almost 1 in 10 jobs is the state s most vulnerable region The average job in the nine regions excluding New York City is about 10 percent more likely to be automated than it is in the five boroughs although rates for every region remain below the national average New York City with a large number of workers in high touch healthcare jobs managerial positions customer service and the creative economy is the region of the state least vulnerable to the effects of automation That said more than one third of the state s most highly automatable jobs are in New York City more than 454 000 in total However four regions across the state are home to more than 100 000 highly automatable jobs and all ten regions have at least 20 000 jobs that are highly automatable This includes 182 650 in Long Island 116 330 in the Hudson Valley 105 200 in Western New York 80 470 in the Finger Lakes 72 770 in the Capital Region 57 800 in Central New York 40 990 in the Southern Tier and 22 080 in the North Country The most automatable jobs in each region are relatively consistent statewide as the breakdown below reveals Close to 2 percent of the state s workforce is employed in food preparation and serving jobs including fast food and those jobs are spread across the entire state The same goes for jobs filling orders or driving delivery trucks As a result automation is likely to transform not only those regions with a traditional reliance on manufacturing but other parts of the state that have seen the service sector expand significantly over the past two decades Automation in New York State Region by Region All statewide data is for 2017 regional data 2016 the most recent years available Capital RegionCentral New YorkFinger LakesHudson ValleyLong IslandMohawk ValleyNew York CityNorth CountrySouthern TierWestern New York Additional details about automatable jobs can be found here Statewide Capital Region Central New York Finger Lakes Hudson Valley Long Island Mohawk Valley New York City North Country Southern Tier Western New York While some regions are more dependent on certain fields for employment every region of the state has large numbers of workers in similar occupations In addition to food preparation and serving jobs including fast food which are prevalent statewide and highly automatable there are thousands of New Yorkers in every region employed in personal care which is quite resilient to automation retail which is only somewhat durable and bookkeeping which is rather vulnerable All of these jobs may change significantly as new technology is developed and adopted but most workplaces will still need help with this work and someone will have to perform it The result is that the skills required to access even entry level opportunities may increase even as humans continue to hold most of the jobs that exist today Many of the state s most automatable occupations are also expected to add jobs over the next decade although an increased pace of technology adoption could change this Such trends may appear to counter the headlines of kiosk filled McDonald s restaurants and Shake Shacks and autonomous Tesla built tractor trailers although some of these changes are already underway The tipping point for many jobs may well be more than a decade out however the growth of jobs in highly vulnerable industries only underscores the urgent need to prepare the state s workforce for the changes to come There are some regional variations The persistence of manufacturing jobs which account for 9 percent of all jobs in Western New York and 6 percent in Central New York could help explain why both are relatively more vulnerable than New York City 2 percent the Capital Region 4 percent and the Hudson Valley 3 4 percent Long Island s large share of jobs that are at least 50 percent automatable may have some correlation with a higher number of office administrative positions which are almost one in five jobs in Nassau and Suffolk counties That compares to one in six on average in the state and in New York City The five boroughs also employ a lower number of workers in transportation fields 4 9 percent than is typical in the rest of the state 5 3 percent Indeed all manner of factors not just economic or technical could determine whether a business decides to replace some or all of its workers with machines It is not just a matter of how soon fully autonomous dishwashers can be developed but if it would be worth paying to buy and maintain such a machine when most human dishwashers make minimum wage In other cases the complexity of job tasks is a key determinant while accounting clerks whose job tasks consist largely of routine data entry are highly vulnerable to automation accountants are the second largest highly resilient occupation in the state There are also political factors powerful unions have kept subway and train conductors employed despite automatability rates approaching 95 percent and social ones There are some 151 380 waiters in the state the 11th largest profession and just over three quarters of their work 76 9 percent is automatable Yet many people go out to eat as a special treat and value the human connection that a server provides and restaurants may find that humans are more effective at upselling a second round of drinks than any robot However some venues and businesses like airport terminals and fast food outlets have demonstrated a willingness to make this shift leading to the even higher automatability of fast food workers and the heightened risks for the entry level positions with the lowest barriers to entry Although relatively few of the fastest growing occupations in New York State are highly automatable the vast majority of growing fields will experience major changes The average automation potential of the 50 fastest growing occupations is nearly 39 percent This approaches the statewide average and is a reminder of just how much most jobs will change with two in five job tasks able to be done by machines instead of people in the near future Jobs in Major Occupational Categories That Are at Least Half Automatable All statewide data is for 2017 regional data 2016 the most recent years available As a result New Yorkers will require a new level of tech fluency to be prepared for the jobs of tomorrow many of which will become augmented by computers robots artificial intelligence and machine learning For example retail workers may need to manage Internet connected point of sale and inventory management systems and build advanced customer profiles while personal care workers may need to update client records using their smartphones or set up remote doctor visits via FaceTime Critical thinking adaptability and the ability to learn new tools will be crucial for most workers in the future as it should be now for the policymakers educators and business leaders responsible for preparing for the coming world of work The promise of automation is as great as any perceived peril but only if New Yorkers are ready to tackle these new and evolving occupations Photo Credit Franck V

00 34 143Z BusinessThe British government is keen to recognise the importance of artificial intelligence AI and automation in ensuring the long term future success of UK industry In line with this it has acknowledged that one of its grand challenges is putting the UK at the forefront of the AI and data revolution In fact comments from Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond have suggested that large swathes of government activity will soon be performed by AI and automation to free up time for human civil servants Automating some aspects of government jobs will result in savings and efficiencies However there are concerns that public sector workers will be at risk of losing their jobs to AI and automation in the next decade Think tank Reform estimated early last year that 250 000 of the UK s five million public sector workers risk losing jobs to AI and automation in the next 15 years Speaking to a House of Lords committee in 2017 Hammond said The government is looking at how it can apply artificial intelligence There are very significant areas of government activity which involve relatively low level decision making which will be highly susceptible to AI probably over a relatively short period of time which does present the tantalising possibility of being able to drive some real productivity enhancement in the delivery of government processes The truth is that automation in the public sector is already developing at a rapid pace New initiatives range from implementing AI and automation into day to day bureaucratic tasks such as form filling and applying for patents to using facial recognition technologies to verify the identity of individuals entering the UK But it s time to stop viewing AI and automation as an existential threat to our livelihoods Far from replacing people AI and automation will transform the workplace as menial tasks and some non routine jobs are digitalised through AI and process automation enabling greater efficiency while taking away some of the strain of day to day tasks In its industrial strategy report the UK government rightly realised we are at one of the most important exciting and challenging times in the history of global enterprise Importantly that report highlights that Britain is well placed to benefit from this new Industrial Revolution This digital revolution will be powered by humans increasing reliance on AI and automation Set to impact almost every sector of British industry AI and automation is here to stay Organisations are turning to digital transformation to boost innovation and enhance user experience and AI and automation will play a major role in this change While some jobs may disappear or evolve along the road to automation there is considerable opportunity for innovation and change AI and automation can give government departments both at the national and local level much faster access to sophisticated insights Combining this technology and big data will allow them to make better decisions more quickly for a greater number of citizens This ability to rapidly adapt to and drive new innovations is part of what allowed Britain to prosper and develop so quickly during the first industrial revolution After all as the government goes on to note in the industrial strategy report We are an open enterprising economy built on invention innovation and competition We have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business with high standards respected institutions and the reliable rule of law We have achieved near historic levels of employment We are a crossing point for the world because of our geographic position the English language our strong ties our openness to ideas and our vibrant culture Driving an automated future offers a wide range of benefits Not least is the prospect of boosting productivity across all of Britain s leading industries from high tech post industrial manufacturing through to the creative industries sector The UK s industrial strategy has already identified the four grand challenges in the years ahead as artificial intelligence and big data clean growth the future of mobility and meeting the needs of an ageing society Astute investments in AI and automation can enable huge productivity boosts UK consumers are already beginning to recognise that more organisations are embracing this technology and the advantages it can offer including within the public sector In fact after surveying 2 000 UK consumers on their attitudes towards AI and automation in government last year OpenText found that two thirds of UK citizens 66 per cent believe this technology will be introduced into government services within 20 years with 16 per cent claiming that this could happen in the next two years The same poll revealed less fear and uncertainty about the introduction of AI and automation in government than many headlines suggest The majority of those surveyed were not concerned about the implementation of this technology in government with over a quarter 26 per cent going as far as claiming AI and automated technologies would be able to make better decisions than most elected representatives though they would prefer for final decisions to be made by a human Many respondents recognised the immediate benefits of the technology A fifth 20 per cent felt that updating processes by bringing in AI and automation would lead to less admin and form filling Additionally 24 per cent pinpointed reduced waiting times as a major advantage while 19 per cent thought that there would be fewer errors in government as a result of the effective implementation of AI and automation This research shows increasing acceptance of AI and automation as a method to improve services but Britain still has some way to go to fully embrace its potential The UK ranked lowest 16 per cent across the countries surveyed when asked if AI and automated technology would be working in government in the next five years showing more hesitance around its uptake than countries such as France 24 per cent the Netherlands 28 per cent and the USA 22 per cent AI and automation will transform the workplace and bring a wide range of benefits to all sectors including the public sector With the potential to increase the speed efficiency and effectiveness of a wide range of government services AI and automated technologies cannot be ignored While the technology already exists the key challenge over the next few years will be gaining trust amongst both public sector

data management and workforce infrastructures But few agencies have the potential to feel that impact like the Office of Personnel Management Tasked with bringing more IT and cybersecurity talent into the government at a time when both are in high demand globally the agency must also navigate the fundamental reshaping of the government s civilian workforce which is increasingly being fueled by the emergence of technologies like artificial intelligence and automation In its Federal Workforce Priorities Report released last week OPM estimates that 45 percent of work activities could be automated today based on technology available in 2016 and five percent of all federal jobs could be done completely by machines That leaves the agency at a crossroads in how it shapes the future of the federal workforce and the services it will provide said Don Kettl a professor at the University of Maryland s School of Public Policy and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution This will not be your mother and father s OPM by the time we are done for sure he said The idea of managing an OPM purely on the basis of trying to create rules to make the existing system work will be a pretty bad fit for the system we know we are going to need To capitalize on a seismic change in the nature of work combined with a shrinking federal workforce the Trump administration and OPM have proposed an initiative to reskill some existing federal workers to into higher value work activities jobs while leveraging automation technology to streamline administrative functions As part of the PMA the Office of Management and Budget and its Office of Federal Procurement Policy will identify three areas suited for automation and develop pilots for them by the first quarter of 2019 By the second quarter of 2019 OMB will develop a plan to reskill federal workers impacted by automation efforts while an OPM pilot will assess the skills those employees will need The results of those pilots could be pivotal for agencies looking to stretch their budget said Mallory Barg Bulman vice president of research and evaluation at the Partnership for Public Service Bulman said a January 2018 report conducted by the Partnership and the IBM Center for The Business of Government found federal entities like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Air Force were already leveraging AI to gain efficiencies in how they collect data and navigate acquisition rules and regulations Federal agencies are looking for ways to do more with less she said The places where we ve seen it be successful are places where agencies have taken routine and tedious tasks and really found ways to automate it But even with the capabilities and resources gained by automation the emphasis placed on employee skills and the ability to recruit and retain those employees becomes greater and that s where OPM s role in reskilling and training becomes even more pronounced The truth is providing opportunities for training can really be a profound retention tool Bulman said When we looked at the Best Places to Work in the Federal Government scores for the Senior Executive Service members particularly those who were new to the SES and on the younger end training was the most powerful predictor of their intent to stay But because the PMA tries to tackle government s most difficult challenges in order to modernize it Kettl said OPM s role will be paramount We try to think broadly about the strategic role of government and the strategic transformation of its workforce to make that happen This is a very big deal he said It s something that s very important very fundamental and something that will require a very fundamental rethinking of the role of OPM in particular along the way New studies shed light on the job security of certain government jobs in an increasingly digital age Automation has already altered several industries and it s only a matter of time before it transforms more of them Given that many governments continue to grapple with tight budgets and suppressed staffing levels it s worth considering whether they might one day rely more on automation and technology to carry out tasks performed by humans Recent studies have shed some light on what this might look like particularly in the public sector Automation has already made some forays into government Kirke Everson a KPMG intelligent automation consultant cited chatbots utilized in call centers as an example He suggested that automation could soon replace personnel who perform repetitive back office tasks such as eligibility checks and other procedures following a defined set of rules Government is ripe for automation Everson says But if it requires a large amount of judgments or human interaction maybe you don t start there In the U K an estimated 861 000 public sector jobs could be automated by 2030 according to an analysis by Deloitte and Oxford University Administrative and operative roles which account for 27 percent of the public workforce were identified as having the highest probability of being automated These types of jobs are already declining and the report projects their numbers in the U K to fall further from 87 000 in 2015 to only 4 000 by 2030 A separate Oxford University study examined U S job occupations deeming about 47 percent of total employment in both government and the private sector to be at risk of computerization Some public sector roles considered most vulnerable included library workers postal service clerks and transportation inspectors all positions with highly repetitive tasks Many of the other occupations researchers identified were especially common in transportation These included bus drivers and subway or streetcar operators as well as highway maintenance workers tablecaption font size 11px margin bottom 30px line height 1 2em important The probability of computerization ranges from 0 to 1 with higher values representing more tasks potentially completed by computers Numbers shown for predominately public sector occupations Source The Future of Employment How Susceptible are Jobs to Computerisation by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A Osborne But does this mean large numbers of public employees will one day be out of work Historically industrialization and improvements in technology haven t caused higher long term unemployment It s unknown whether this time will be any different though with economists offering different predictions for automation s effects Neil Reichenberg who heads the International Public Management Association for Human Resources views it more as a shift It s not so much cutting staff as it is moving people to more strategic higher level work he says While technology has already reshaped countless occupations across just about every segment of the economy it hasn t yet prompted the complete elimination of many types of jobs Consider teachers who employ greater use of educational software programs in classrooms These and other types of public employee positions haven t vanished but they do require greater tech skills than in years past Although some might associate automation with armies of robots it s computers that are most responsible for redefining work these days A recent Brookings Institution report assessed digitization or the degree of computer skills and related knowledge typically required of various occupations Several public sector jobs that required few digital skills in 2002 now mandate at least mid level proficiency of computers or other devices Parking enforcement workers and compliance officers for example might have relied entirely on paper records not long ago Today the Brookings data suggests digital skills for these occupations have jumped considerably over the past decade Source Brookings analysis of O Net OES and Moody s data In some ways automating various aspects of jobs could prove to be more difficult in the public sector than in the private sector Unions Reichenberg says will likely oppose efforts expected to result in job losses Last year the union membership rate for government workers was more than five times that of the private sector Still if automation offers governments ways to cut costs without sacrificing quality of services they ll likely consider it Resources remain limited Revenues aren t expected to grow much and total state and local government employment is still below levels reached a decade ago In some jurisdictions automated processes or technologies could enable governments to provide services that otherwise wouldn t be available It s inevitable Reichenberg says If you look at the way we do work today technology is going to play a major role This story was originally

agenda as one of three priorities to be discussed at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires Will its impact be the same across the globe What jobs will be most affected What new skillsets will be required But above all how can governments prepare and what role can Multilateral Development Banks play All four leading regional development banks recently came together in Washington to present some key perspectives regarding the jobs of the future which can be found in the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives Here are a few worth considering On the one hand Emerging Europe Developing Asia Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean are witnessing how robotics automation and artificial intelligence are lowering costs and increasing productivity providing an opportunity for accelerated growth Countries like Estonia have taken the lead in digital technology youth in Nigeria and Ethiopia are harnessing technology to boost yields in agriculture in Vietnam and Bangladesh Information and Communication Technologies ICT is boosting the service industry and across Latin America and the Caribbean smartphone adoption is expected to reach beyond 70 by 2020 On the other hand as a result of this new wave of technological advances known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution a series of myths emerge that it is important to clarify Myth 1 All regions will be impacted in the same way The truth is that technology will be adopted at varying speeds depending on the region s economic development and demographic trends An aging population in Emerging Europe will face different challenges than Africa where 12 to 15 million young people enter the job market each year Myth 2 Mass unemployment is unavoidable The truth is that the jobless rate will be lower than originally expected Mass unemployment is unlikely to become a reality But the shifts in job opportunities will certainly require flexibility and access to new training tools which may in turn be provided by technology itself Myth 3 Automation will replace all human jobs and tasks The truth is that automation only takes place where it is both technically and economically feasible A human workforce will still be required in most sectors particularly those such as health and education At the same time it would be foolish to ignore the genuine threats of unemployment and increased income inequality that the rapid expansion of new technology will generate Above all as Multilateral Development Banks the question we need to be asking is how can governments ease the transition What can governments do to ensure that the largest number of people possible benefit from this transition Policymakers can take four actions to ease the adoption of technology while mitigating potentially adverse effects on jobs and incomes Multilateral Development Banks certainly have their own role to play not only by acting as think tanks for initiatives on how to capitalize on new technologies and mitigate their negative effects but also in coordinating global or regional policy responses strengthening partnerships between policymakers and employers to jointly identify and address challenges Our products and services will need to adapt A recent IDB health project in the Dominican Republic which uses drones to link remote rural clinics with hospital laboratories is a prime example of this Change will also take place within our workforce Outsourcing the IDB s human resources department from Washington to Costa Rica to ensure efficiency and reduce costs was certainly a step in the right direction It is important that we take the time to seriously identify the opportunities and risks the 21st century global job market presents so that together we can help shape the future of work In the meantime we must also remain relevant for our customer base and at the forefront of innovation Whether we succeed or not is up to all of us Downlaod the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives hereFiled Under Beyond

2019 Watson InstituteEditor s Note Facing the Future of Work Facing the Future of Work In the last few years it has felt like every big election has focused on jobs and the threats they supposedly face from trade from immigrants and most accurately from technology No wonder Until recently the forecasts were almost unanimously grim The robots were coming we were told and they d soon make us humans redundant In the summer of 2015 the Atlantic captured the panic with a cover story titled A World Without Work which warned that the moment when machines make workers obsolete may finally be arriving Then on March 18 of this year a self driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Tempe Arizona and the conversation began to shift Suddenly the fear that humans would soon be superfluous started to seem a little less likely Around the same time the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released a new study that gave intellectual and statistical heft to this idea Yes automation will supplant some workers the report found But not nearly as many as we once thought and not nearly as soon As a result what exactly we should expect work to look like in the future has now become a lot more complicated and the discussions about it much more nuanced Which is why Foreign Policy has devoted this special issue to making sense of the emerging reality While the questions still outnumber the answers a few themes have started to surface As Molly Kinder argues in Learning to Work With Robots new technologies will create both winners and losers Artificial intelligence won t eliminate human labor in some cases it will even produce new jobs But automation is rapidly changing the nature of work and governments must help workers adapt Ryan Avent explores this idea further In Then They Came for the Lawyers he shows how manual laborers won t be the only ones forced to contend with a shifting workplace AI will also change the lives of doctors teachers and other professionals Adaptation is key but it s not the only task ahead of us In Protect Yourself Before You Wreck Yourself Michael Lind warns that retraining workers won t be enough governments must also reshape their trade policies to reflect the new era Of course despite the new developments and the strategies meant to deal with them automation still poses plenty of risks In Closing the Factory Doors Christina Larson shows how automated factories by replacing human textile and other light manufacturing workers may deprive poor nations of a traditional route out of poverty But the key point is that the news is far from uniformly bad FP s Ravi Agrawal shows how the much criticized gig economy is proving a boon for the developing world see Why India Gives Uber 5 Stars And as FP s Rhys Dubin reminds us in There s No Such Thing as a Stable Career constant change has been a fact of life for as long as there has been work to do just ask lectors and longshoremen Indeed just about the only factor that has remained the same is humans ability to adjust to new circumstances and generally make their lives better in the process Big changes are coming and plenty of them But there s no reason to think we won t weather them in typical fashion by working smart and working hard Jonathan Tepperman is the editor in chief of Foreign Policy Twitter j teppermanThe past year s 100 most

productivity by 15 percent Several years ago Google s People Analytics division launched Project Aristotle to understand the components of productive teams embracing research that groups are more creative than individuals Private sector businesses are automating tedious tasks augmenting workers with artificial intelligence technologies reskilling and upskilling their workforces focusing on employee wellness and hungrily recruiting talent Government will have to catch up Perhaps nowhere is the gap between the public and private sector greater than in workforce management Most public sector organizations are still locked into decades old employee policies such as rigid job classifications lockstep pay and a reliance on seniority as a substitute for capability The reality is that government agencies are increasingly called upon to address society s most complex challenges while using workforce approaches rooted in the distant past The good news Change is possible and beginning to happen A new Deloitte study explores some of the ways the nature of government work the public workforce itself and the workplace it occupies will all need to continue to evolve Work New technologies can transform the capabilities of a government worker Artificially intelligent chatbots for example can perform triage on citizen questions freeing human attention for less routine queries The Army s recruitment chatbot SGT STAR does the work of 55 recruiters answering 94 percent of questions A Deloitte analysis of AI s potential found that automation could save the federal government as much as 1 2 billion hours of work annually What AI doesn t automate it can enhance Child welfare caseworkers who according to one study spend just 9 percent of their time with children but 37 5 percent of their time on paperwork could use technology to auto populate documentation freeing time for visits AI also can correlate hospital truancy and arrest records to flag children in danger Some restaurant health inspectors already analyze big data to identify likely candidates for inspections In Chicago for instance tests found 24 percent more critical violations and on average isolated dangers from the food system a week earlier For effective work redesign it s helpful to adopt a two pronged strategy of zooming in and zooming out A zooming in approach hones in on individual tasks and processes that have the most potential to be optimized through automation Zooming out entails looking at the bigger picture to define what work redesign means for entire job classifications departments and the organization as a whole Workforce Specialists in fields like cybersecurity agile development and artificial intelligence are not likely to commit decades to one government position and if they did they d still need to swap into the tech sector periodically to sharpen their skills That s why some government technology programs are taking a tour of duty approach letting private sector experts serve in the public sector for a few years on specific projects without locking them into a lifetime of government work At the federal level the General Services Administration s 18F digital services agency the Oak Ridge Institute for Science Education and the Presidential Innovation Fellows program all help government solve problems with temporary outside hires At the state level Michigan s Cyber Civilian Corps a volunteer group of cybersecurity professionals from the private sector and academia as well as government can be called upon if the governor declares a cyber emergency And long term government workers don t need to be stuck in one place A talent cloud can prepare for unexpected staffing needs by identifying in advance workers with special skills and applying them to tasks suited to their expertise Canada is experimenting with letting multiple agencies dip into a talent cloud and hire workers for specific missions Workers keep their union membership rights and benefits but may be called into service by any agency Workplace Empirical science rarely guides hiring But management is becoming more data driven Applying the newest science on team building personal efficiency and employee wellness to government agencies can upgrade the workplace to better attract retain and utilize talent Insights from studies of the composition and functioning of effective teams can inform decisions about using talents more effectively Organizational network analysis for example can use metadata from emails and other sources to map communication patterns in organizations accurately predicting individuals who will be high performers detecting unsatisfied employees six months before they actually quit and identifying leadership behaviors that correlate with success Modern workplace wellness programs are also extremely impactful Improving employee wellness can reduce lost work days increase retention and fuel productivity After the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center provided a physician and nurse case manager for employees it saw an 80 percent decline in lost work days over six years for a cost savings of 1 5 million In short the future of government work will require a level of dynamic workforce management far beyond the current practices of the public sector The potential for government agencies to unlock more human capital potential and make the public sector a magnet for talent is enormous As Buffalo s former mayor demonstrated to bring the right people together you have to know what it takes to make a project succeed Local governments are using internet surveys to better gauge residents needs Some states are finding ways to make rules easier to navigate and less costly for business while continuing to protect the public s interests The amount of missing and unusable public sector data is stunning Every jurisdiction should be comparing itself with its peers to identify problematic practices increase productivity and reduce costs It s all too easy for team members to misunderstand something Effective leaders know the value of the pre brief Our mission is to help leaders in multiple sectors develop a deeper understanding of the global economy Our flagship business publication has been defining and informing the senior management agenda since 1964 Our learning programs help organizations accelerate growth by unlocking their people s potential Higher costs and rising demand have driven rapid increases in spending on core public services such as education healthcare and transport while countries must grapple with complex challenges such as population aging economic inequality and protracted security concerns Government expenditure amounts to more than a third of global GDP budgets are strained and the world public sector deficit is close to 4 trillion a year At the same time governments are struggling to meet citizens rising expectations Satisfaction with key state services such as public transportation schools and healthcare facilities is less than half that of nonstate providers such as banks or utilities Governments need a way to deliver better outcomes and a better experience for citizens at a sustainable cost A new paper by the McKinsey Center for Government MCG Government productivity Unlocking the 3 5 trillion opportunity suggests that goal is within reach It shows that several countries have achieved dramatic productivity improvements in recent years for example by improving health public safety and education outcomes while maintaining or even reducing spending per capita or per student in those sectors If other countries were to match the improvements already demonstrated in these pockets of excellence the world s governments could potentially save as much as 3 5 trillion a year by 2021 equivalent to the entire global fiscal gap Alternatively countries could choose to keep spending constant while boosting the quality of key services For example if all the countries studied had improved the productivity of their healthcare systems at the rate of comparable best performers over the past 5 years they would have added 1 4 years to the healthy life expectancy of their combined populations That translates into 12 billion healthy life years gained without additional per capita spending It s imperative that governments find a way to unlock that productivity opportunity The challenge is that until now there s been limited progress on measuring government productivity even though productivity is a well established and vital measure of the performance of national economies and private sector businesses As a result it is difficult for governments to gauge the true return on spending and debate is often focused on how to increase inputs and not the quality of outputs Governments typically find it challenging to identify improvement opportunities by learning from other countries or from other regions or sectors within the same country To help close this gap MCG built a comprehensive database and benchmarking methodology the Government Productivity Scope to start to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of government expenditure MCG applied the tool across 42 countries that together make up 80 percent of global GDP focusing on seven sectors healthcare primary secondary and tertiary education public safety road transport and tax collection The research was supplemented with insights from more than 50 interviews with government leaders and more than 200 case studies This paper presents the first version of MCG s analysis which we will continue to extend and refine in dialogue with government leaders and academic experts The initial findings point to dramatic differences in countries relative productivity Even among comparable countries with very similar outcomes the least efficient government currently spends more than twice as much per unit of output as its most efficient peer And while most countries have struggled to contain spending growth in every sector MCG found examples of governments that have reduced expenditure per unit while experiencing improved outcomes These differences point to a tremendous opportunity for governments to boost productivity save money and achieve better outcomes for citizens To realize that opportunity though governments need to deepen their functional capabilities in four key areas finance commercial digital technology and data analytics and talent management As MCG shows pioneering countries have reimagined and strengthened these functions so they play a more strategic leadership role in pursuing efficiency and improving outcomes Across these areas those governments have adopted an ambitious structured approach to transform

impacts of rapid technological change and its impact on the future of work and the workforce in New Zealand It will help inform future government policy so that the opportunities presented by disruptive technologies for economic productivity and social prosperity can be realised and the risks managed The Commission s recent Low emissions economy report highlighted the need to harness the full potential of technology and innovation In this new mandate the Commission will provide recommendations that will help manage the likely impacts of rapid technological disruption and change more broadly on the future of work the workforce labour markets productivity and wellbeing says Director Judy Kavanagh We look forward to sharing our findings and recommendations through a series of short reports Ms Kavanagh says the Commission s work will be informed by the knowledge and insights of all sectors of the economy and society The Commission will be speaking with public bodies unions businesses academics and other interested parties to better understand the impacts of technological change on the future of work The terms of reference are available and anyone interested in the

August November 2019 Final report to Government 31 March 2020Our Deputy Chair Karen Chester gave a speech to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia CEDA WA on 17 July 2018 in Perth Jobs matter For almost all of us they are a source of income But they are also a source of self esteem of social interaction a feeling of purpose and even of community And the skills embedded in jobs remain principal drivers of increasing productivity and ultimately wages So when one opines on the future of work people tend to listen But perhaps when one is opining on the future of work today expectations of the listener are more akin to the BBC announcer of Monty Python s Flying Circus and now for something completely different When perhaps it s simply not so different And I guess that may well prove the damp squib hashtag for my talk today We know from history that soothsayers abound when it comes to opining on the future of work Indeed history is littered with the foretelling of a dystopia of jobless woe or a utopia of little need to work at all And the only universal truth seems to be that they were all wrong both happily and unhappily so The 20th century father of the fiscal stimulus John Maynard Keynes foretold in 1930 that In the 21st century a 15 hour work week will suffice as we turn instead to how to use freedom from pressing economic cares And yet despite significant productivity gains since the Keynes 1930 treatise we still all work on average around 40 hours a week In the late 1970s the historian Ian Turner presided over a major symposium on what new technologies would mean for the worker He predicted an imminent period of change as significant as the Neolithic or Industrial Revolutions To quote By 1988 at least a quarter of the Australian workforce would be made redundant by technological change And a similar adage we heard in 1982 from Barry Jones in his book Sleepers Awake technology and the future of work We all know that the late 1980s did see an exponential uptick in the common use of computers in workplaces and even more so in the 90s as the price of the humble computer plummeted But the foretelling of widespread redundancies of the Australian workforce were not seen For throughout the past 100 years it s been more a case of technology remaining the loyal friend not foe of the worker continuing to remove jobs that are often unpleasant physically tiring downright dangerous or just tedious think toll booth operator More recently we ve seen a plethora of papers and reports produced by think tanks academics consultants and platform giants touting analyses of jobs that could be lost as a result of the latest wave of technological change And that latest wave being the digital age and both the resultant automation and artificial intelligence Some of these reports seem to have settled on a nice big round figure of about 40 per cent of today s jobs now being at risk of automation over the next 10 to 20 years Now most of these reports stem from a seminal 2013 paper by Frey and Osborne where US data was used to predict job losses in the future But their approach left out a few things It did not take into account that new technologies can create new jobs Nor did it contemplate that not all tasks within an occupation can be automated or should be automated And we know that the rate of technological adoption will also depend a lot on consumer preferences do you want a robot cutting your hair and the actual cost or put crudely the business case of adoption Others in taking these factors into account suggest 9 of Australian workers are exposed to the risk of automation So a much smaller but not insignificant number And here I ll mention the must read paper by Melbourne University economists Jeff Borland and Michael Coelli Are the Robots Taking Our Jobs Their work lines up with the more considered studies in the US and Europe So let s look at the evidence a common sense thing to do when in the midst of a chorus of now for something completely different To test whether we have strayed into a world of lies lies and damned statistics And in looking at the evidence I ve drawn on some of the Commission s recent endeavour such as our Digital Disruption report 2016 and Shifting the Dial 2017 as well as the work of Jeff Borland and Michael Coelli and that of Bart van Ark of The Conference Board Overall the evidence suggests that labour markets have been pretty well resilient to shocks posed by new technologies of the past century and even the most recent modern bit Occupations skills and jobs come and they go No matter how transformative the technology be it the telephone electricity indoor plumbing refrigeration air transport the personal computer and today s digital No technology has removed people s capacity to work And in productivity terms all have been more transformative than the digital revolution so far with emphasis being on the so far And a bunch of measures suggest that technology is not having as large of an effect as expected at least not in our current modern times The rise of the New Digital Economy which encompasses mobile technology ubiquitous access to the internet and the world of the cloud is unquestionably changing lots of things But to date productivity is not one So much so that this has become known as the Productivity Paradox So whilst our low rate of multi factor productivity growth observed recently is not unique to Australia it has been observed across other countries too it represents something of a puzzle This is because it suggests that at least in aggregate our economies have not become any more efficient in producing things And we know the policy reasons why productivity may have slowed in Australia but this is notwithstanding our purported better ability to exploit information technologies One explanation for this is that there has been a change in the nature of technological progress That recent technologies characterised by some as dramatic have been minor compared to those in the previous century The other explanation one offered by Bart van Ark and perhaps one of intuitive appeal is that whilst we still see rapidly declining ICT prices along with a shift from ICT investment to ICT services perhaps the new digital economy is still in its installation phase And we shouldn t expect to see the productivity dividend until it truly enters the deployment phase This makes sense when you see that in the US the contribution of the most ICT intensive industries to productivity growth has dropped markedly from 46 to 26 in the past decade 2007 16 And for the US and the UK it has even at times registered negative productivity growth in these sectors Which could suggest that the dividend only makes its way into the deployment and hopefully productivity dividend phase once users fully grapple with how to absorb technology effectively So returning to the evidence on the impact on jobs And we do know that there has been automation of many tasks in the workplace But arguably if technology was both disruptive and displacing replacing existing jobs without creating new ones we would expect to see a persistent upward trend in the unemployment rate And we don t Whilst routine manual and routine cognitive jobs have fallen as a proportion of jobs from 50 to 37 non routine manual and non routine cognitive jobs have increased from 42 to 53 Think child care aged care nursing office managers designers and engineers using software Most importantly the aggregate amount of work available to the Australian population on a per capita basis has not seen a decline since the 1980s when computers became common in the workplace The amount of work available has actually increased by about 14 since the early 1980s But that s not to say there hasn t been a lot of change in our workforce and the nature of work since the 1980s Since the 1980s the workforce participation rate for females has increased a lot by some 15 percentage points to now be just over 60 Marriage and even children are placing much less of a brake on economic participation of women Which is both a good thing for the economy and for women There has also been an increase in the incidence of part time jobs by some 25 percentage points since the late 1960s to now account for nearly one third of total employment around 35 in Australia And despite what some have suggested the pace at which workers are changing between jobs in the Australian labour market is not getting quicker Not only is there no evidence that more workers are being forced to work in short duration jobs but what is apparent is that the opposite has happened The proportion of workers in very long duration jobs more than 10 years has increased from just under 20 per cent in 1982 to around 27 per cent in 2016 Which is perhaps unsurprising when you also take into account the participation rate of older Australians 65 in age has risen steeply having nearly doubled in the past 30 years to now represent 12 of our workforce Also a good thing with our ageing population We do know that more workers today have multiple jobs now around 7 of workers And perhaps of much greater significance when workers do change jobs today more are changing occupations some 40 and industries over 50 And it was this modern day workforce reality that informed much of our thinking around the Commission s proposed changes to superannuation default arrangements in our current superannuation Inquiry And our thinking on what is needed from our tertiary education system which I ll return to later And whilst the gig economy is still in its infancy this has not translated yet to any increase in the proportion of the workforce being independent contractors Indeed this has not changed significantly since 2001 it s actually fallen a few percentage points from 20 per cent of employed persons in 2001 to around 18 per cent in 2014 So what does any of this mean or matter for public policy And perhaps here our focus should be two fold First on making sure there are no road blocks to our economy reaching the deployment phase of the digital or any technological age And second making sure we avoid a workforce of have and have nots in the benefits from the changes in the economy and ultimately jobs A sense of equality in the ultimate job productivity and wage dividend So let me pose a few policy questions Are we getting better at assisting transitioning workers We know that structural change whatever its source can result in considerable work and thus life disruption for the workers impacted unless we get the consequential skill adjustment right So have we gotten better in assisting displaced workers get the right skills to transition into new occupations and industries Recent work by the Commission on transitioning regional economies found that effectiveness of government in doing this is at best unclear Some programs found to be not well targeted automotive industry or create conflicting incentives Tasmanian forestry industry And why unclear use of data to simply track the impacted workers and decent evaluation of transitional assistance are largely missing in action Put simply we can and should be doing better Further it s a tad perverse that if the digital economy ultimately disrupts more jobs we do not use the data fuelling that economic activity to assist those disrupted We know of such endeavour in Germany using data to track the worker and the resultant human capital modelling which in turn better informs what requalification programs will deliver a better job transition to a displaced worker Are the right incentives in place to get the workers to the new jobs We know that jobs at least risk of automation jobs that require soft skills such as good old fashioned empathy account for the largest and growing part of our workforce And the latest metrics from the ABS brand new quarterly labour account experimental estimates reveal health care and social assistance as the largest employment sectors accounting for over 1 6 million jobs or 12 2 of all filled jobs This is largely a function of our demographic changes an ageing population women working more along with the NDIS arguably our single biggest social reform since Medicare The Commission s recent review of NDIS costs found that the NDIS workforce was not growing fast enough most regions require between a 50 per cent and 150 per cent increase in the disability services workforce Put simply for the foreseeable future 1 in 5 new jobs in Australia are projected to be for services for the NDIS Thus care is needed to ensure that the demand for these skills and workers is not frustrated by poor incentives The most notable as highlighted in our NDIS review being the need to ensure the pricing of these services allows this massive labour force response to occur Lest we have a program delivering disappointment and not services to the 475 000 Australians with eligible disabilities Is our education and training system fit for purpose for the workers of today and tomorrow Perhaps this is our biggest public policy must have when thinking of ensuring innovation and technology delivers not just more jobs but jobs for most That sense of equality in who shares in the ultimate job productivity and wage dividend And this was a question the Commission sought to ask and answer last year in our inaugural 5 yearly productivity review Shifting the Dial A policy roadmap for Australian Governments on what is needed to deliver on economic participation and productivity two of the three Ps population participation and productivity that matter most for economic growth and ultimately jobs and their real wages And we identified some fundamental fractures in our current education and training system First deteriorating results in subjects that matter for future work think science maths and reading the cognitive trifecta at school Second the VET system is a mess struggling to deliver relevant competency based qualifications Employers today are more satisfied with non accredited training courses 90 than VET 76 Third universities need to improve student employment outcomes delivering qualifications relevant to labour market needs and at a time relevant to the worker s needs Our key educational institutions seem more focused on research than student employment outcomes which is unsurprising given the notable absence of their skin in the game As manifest in 26 of students today not completing their undergraduate studies in less than 9 years Whilst undergraduate underemployment has more than doubled in the last decade to now reach just over 20 Currently the tertiary education system is set up against becoming a chef at age 40 or a dementia care worker at age 50 Retraining is currently inconvenient and expensive and the approach of educational institutions remains outdated and outmoded still emphasising a one career for life approach Which is not the modern day reality for many workers from the metrics cited earlier Taken collectively this unfortunate troika can only put at risk our capacity to deal with future labour market changes in an efficient and equitable way So we ve proposed a few things change for schools evidence and evaluation of what works with teaching for universities incentives be redressed around student employment outcomes and for work skills government to develop two things First tools for proficiency based assessment for skills rather than simply competency based assessment whether they can perform it at all And second a framework to facilitate independent accreditation of skills obtained agnostic of learning method Do current policy settings constrain us getting to and through the installation phase and on to realising benefits in the deployment phase of the digital economy Today s market power arguably resides in data and content The growth of the digital economy automation and artificial intelligence coupled with greater availability of data and algorithm advances will be key drivers of new business activity research endeavour products skills and jobs In short access and use of data and content will be the determining force in realising the economic benefits of the digital economy and artificial intelligence On data the Commission s report last year on Data Use and Availability proposed fundamental and novel changes to data availability and access policy to ensure it generates new economic opportunities and business opportunities driven by consumer needs and preferences A pro consumer and thus pro competition stimulus with the consumer in the drivers seat for their data held with business and government today And the good news is the Government s response to this inquiry has been one of can and will do The Government has committed to support the two most structurally significant recommendations First the passage of national legislation to remove barriers to data sharing and integration across major public interest data sets and create trusted user access And second the complementary legislated concept of a new general Right for Consumers to exercise joint control in the sharing and use of their data So it s now all down to getting the implementation right On content the Commission s Inquiry in 2016 on Intellectual Property Arrangements examined whether those arrangements meet the needs of the Australian economy And the short answer was no for copyright Currently Australia s copyright exceptions are too narrow and prescriptive do not reflect the way people today consume and use content and do not readily accommodate new legitimate uses of copyright material We found ourselves mired in the wrong debate of publishers clamouring for well protected profit for the purported benefit of local authors For access to content be it snippets of images maps pixels words song sounds is needed alongside data to actually do artificial intelligence But our arrangements unlike those in countries like the US South Korea and Israel pose a seemingly impenetrable barrier to AI being alive and well in our economy For in the absence of meaningful reform to copyright Australia will inevitably and demonstrably be a net importer of AI services and products And fair access to content also matters for education Now more than ever workers need flexible access to ongoing learning MOOCs are a key component of providing low cost and flexible access to ongoing learning And in consulting with the states on Shifting the Dial we were implored to think of the transitioning worker in NW Tasmania in our approach to ongoing skills acquisition especially for mature age workers Yet Australia s current system of copyright usage heavily constrain Universities TAFEs and schools from offering MOOCs So on a final note I ve failed dismally to foretell a future of dystopia or utopia and happily so but that doesn t mean that the deployment phase of the digital economy may yet still surprise us And in reflecting on the Inquiries that formed much of the Commission s endeavour over the last five years or so nearly all have dealt in some way shape or form with the now of work and thus the future of work And in doing so tried to view it through the lens of the needs of workers and students And through that lens it affords a sense of what policies new or tweaked will see our economy able to access the installation phase and realise the benefits of the deployment phase of any technological change And perhaps most importantly ensuring those phases see the benefits of jobs productivity and higher wages shared across the workforce Avoiding a world of technology driven haves and have nots Because that s what matters most for the future of work Follow OnSubscribeThank you for inviting me to speak with you here today In particular I want to thank the Productivity Commission and all involved in the Productivity Hub The previous presenters today have touched on a range of ideas for how we can face the challenge of improving our productivity in a changing world From technology and data to public services and the energy transition I m excited to see forward thinking people working on such a broad range of important topics I d like to commend you all and encourage you to keep up the good work My presentation today will focus on an issue that is at the heart of a productive economy how we approach the rapidly changing world of work I want to talk about how this fits with the overall economic strategy of the Government the core policy areas that we have identified to support New Zealanders in this process and the institutional settings required to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of the Future of Work Economic StrategyBy harnessing the potential of new technology and innovation educating and upskilling our workforce and incentivising research and development we can lift productivity and transition to an economy that is sustainable inclusive and productive That is this Government s overarching economic aim The lessons learned from the Future of Work Commission heavily influenced this Government s economic strategy We aim to shape an economy where we work smarter make better use of our resources ensure everyone who wants to work can work and ensure that the benefits of growth are spread across society In an article published this past weekend Rod Oram argued that we can rise to the immense challenge of making this a high value high wage economy over the next decade The global and local conditions for doing so are the most favourable ever I know there is an appetite among businesses and workers to take up this challenge and I couldn t agree more that the time is right to face up to this Boosting productivity across the economy will be one of the key drivers to improving New Zealanders living standards and wellbeing The Government will put this at the heart of what we do Our focus on lifting wellbeing will require a different approach and different measures of success We want to take a broader view of success and move beyond simple measures such as GDP which while an important measure of economic output does not tell the full story of peoples wellbeing We are working with our Confidence and Supply partner the Green Party on new sustainable development indicators to paint a fuller picture of how well off people are and how the Government can focus its resources best I have also instructed the Treasury to accelerate their work on the Living Standards Framework which measures the impact of policies on four capitals Human Social Natural and Financial Physical I intend to use this framework to inform the Budget process for Budget 2019 making it our first ever Wellbeing Budget By placing wellbeing at the heart of what we do we will be able to measure the extent to which our policies and investments are making real improvements to peoples lives Improving productivity is key to improving wellbeing By producing more from every hour worked businesses become more profitable incomes rise and workers wellbeing rises as time is freed up and purchasing power rises The challenge is how we achieve this The Changing World of WorkThis Government has come into office at an interesting time in New Zealand s economic story Technological advances are transforming our world for example through increased processing power and big data sensors remote work or smart devices The full effect of forces such as automation algorithms and globalisation are not yet known but we do know that they already are and will continue to be disruptive to what only 5 or 10 years ago we considered the status quo My thinking on this topic was shaped by the Future of Work Commission which I chaired for the Labour Party when we were in Opposition It was an ambitious undertaking that saw us engage with thousands of New Zealanders and experts from around the world It is hard to distil that work down to a few points but overall my takeaway is that there is an enormous possibility for us to have productive and fulfilling work over the coming decades But it will only happen if we prepare now We are facing a world where the change has been estimated by McKinsey Global Institute to be occurring at ten times the pace of the Industrial Revolution and 300 times the scale or roughly 3 000 times the impact Every aspect of our working lives is changing Whole jobs are disappearing and almost every job is being re shaped The very notion of what a job is has been challenged by the so called gig economy Advances in technology present both challenges and opportunities for this sometimes all at once For example a company which automates production of its products will experience productivity gains but there might be consequences for the company s workers What happens to those who are laid off How well positioned are they to quickly retrain Could their past training help them swiftly move into other work How can we benefit from changes to the nature of work while negating or limiting the disadvantages We cannot say with any certainty exactly what the world of work will look like but there are some core changes we can identify and the responses to them that are needed This represents both challenges and opportunities How we respond will drive the future of New Zealand s economy and shape how productive sustainable and inclusive our growth will be over the next few decades We all know the story of the New Zealand economy Over the past 20 years New Zealand has generally done well in the creating more part of the productivity equation GDP growth has averaged about 2 8 over that time compared to the OECD average of 2 1 But it s the other part of the equation the resources required to create more where we have been weak Of that headline growth about 1 7 can be attributed to growth in the volume of labour input or simply total hours worked In other words we required strong population growth and more people entering the workforce to ensure more hours were worked in order to increase production More people working is not a recipe for long term sustainable and inclusive growth The portion of that growth which can be attributed to getting more from each unit of labour in producing goods and services has been 1 1 of that 2 8 over the past 20 years that is we are one of the weaker performers in the OECD In fact our relatively low labour productivity growth over a long period of time means the level of labour productivity in New Zealand GDP per hour worked is about 20 below the OECD average The Productivity Commission has told us that New Zealand s shallow capital markets have meant low levels of investment of productive capital the stuff we need to invest in to help us create more from our available resources Our investment in non residential capital per person in the labour force in 2016 was 25 lower than the OECD average In order to get ahead in terms of headline growth we relied on more people coming here to work and those who were already here to enter work We are at a point where the level of labour productivity in New Zealand GDP per hour worked is around 30 below Australia We have to do something different In recent years the main growth drivers have been population growth and a run away housing market That is not a sustainable path and as those forces recede we need to move deliberately and with urgency to establish an economy that is based on a thriving productive sector We also have to ensure that the benefits of this growth translate into meaningful improvements to the living standards of many New Zealanders who missed out in recent years I spoke earlier about our Government s emphasis on wellbeing and delivering higher living standards for all New Zealanders We want to ensure the economy is delivering real benefits to peoples lives rather than simply pursuing growth for the sake of growth Our success in achieving this will largely be determined by how we respond to the challenges we face including New Zealand s productivity challenge With this in mind today I want to talk you through this Government s plan to ensure we are prepared to face the changes that are coming due to technological advances and the changing nature of work In responding to this our Future of Work report identified three core values to drive our response We need to be Inclusive offering opportunity and harnessing the talents of all Resilient to deal with the changes and shocks that are coming our way and Adaptable to be leaders of the change and shape it in line with our values There are a huge range of policy approaches and changes to the way we run our economy that are needed to meet these challenges and take the opportunities that will arise Our Tax Working Group and the reforms we are making to the Reserve Bank Act are an important part of setting the path to a more productive economy That focus on improving productivity is at the heart of the terms of reference for both these reviews Beyond these we had more than 63 recommendations in our report and you will be pleased I am not going to go through them all now I want to touch on just a few of the main themes Just TransitionIn the face of this rapid change it is essential that we have a just transition for those most affected We saw in New Zealand in the 1980s and 1990s the damage that can be done when major changes are made without enough thought or support given to those who face the immediate consequences In this instance I am using that phrase to primarily talk about two things one at a system level the other at a practical on the ground level The government has committed itself to the goal of a net zero carbon economy by 2050 This is an essential shift for New Zealand away from an economy that hastens climate change to one that is more sustainable and develops New Zealand s strategic advantages We will need to ensure this is a just transition where affected industries and communities are given the support to find new sustainable growth opportunities We are in the process of establishing an Independent Climate Commission which will have the job of establishing goals and targets Meanwhile under the leadership of Hon James Shaw a Green Investment Fund is being created to leverage private sector investment to support business developments that will support a low carbon economy Innovation science and research will have significant roles to play in this However New Zealand s total investment in Research and Development is only 1 3 of GDP about half the OECD average When the OECD issued its most recent assessment of the New Zealand economy last year this is what it had to say on R D Expenditure on R D is low as a share of GDP most notably in the business sector Collaboration between firms education and research institutions is low And its advice Increase fiscal support for business research and development Maintain or increase long term support for successful collaboration between research institutions and industry In the Coalition Agreement with New Zealand First we have set a target of hitting an R D spend of 2 of GDP in ten years That s more than a 50 increase in R D investment relative to GDP over that time and will make a significant contribution to improving our productivity Officials say that this is an ambitious goal We believe this can be done with the Government incentivising such vital work by the private sector Minister for Research Science and Innovation Megan Woods has already begun work on overhauling New Zealand s R D regime with Ministers set to discuss officials initial findings later this month We are committed in the first instance to restoring R D tax credits to give firms some certainty about their investments One other key investment identified in our Future of Work programme is in direct support of the technology sector and for businesses to make better use of new technology Research by Swedish academic and technologist Goran Roos found that 55 of New Zealand jobs are at risk due to technological advances and that countries likely to be least affected will be those with the highest levels of economic complexity This is just one of the reasons why it is important for us to diversify our skills base and look for more sustainable drivers of growth By putting the right policies and incentives in place the technology sector can be one of those economic drivers While technological advances present challenges to existing jobs we also have the opportunity to create new forms of work According to NZTech chief executive Graeme Muller only 14 percent of large NZ businesses have deployed any enabling technology for the Internet of Things despite 70 percent believing it will be strategically important for their business to do so Their concerns are largely around costs and changes in technology This Government wants to nurture an environment that gives businesses the confidence to take up new technology Minister Clare Curran is in the process of creating the position of Chief Technology Officer CTO who will report directly to the Prime Minister and Cabinet The CTO will be responsible for introducing and managing a National Digital Architecture and Digital Technology Roadmap They will also work with the wider industry to develop ingenuity and creativity in the ICT sector Our aim is for the ICT industry to be our second largest contributor to GDP by 2025 Learning For LifeThe other critical element of a just transition to this new world of work is how we support people to gain the relevant skills and knowledge We need to both support those workers whose jobs are under threat and prepare those who are yet to start working for the kind of labour market they are likely to enter New Zealand currently spends a fraction of what other countries do on active labour market policies Other countries around the world such as Singapore France and Germany have recognised that they need to both plan ahead for the changes but also provide greater support for people who are displaced by technological change The Future of Work was the catalyst for our three years free training and education policy One of this Government s key policies is to provide one year of free post secondary education or training gradually progressing to 3 years by 2025 In 2018 we will see 30 000 students enrolled in tertiary education courses and 50 000 in industry training without paying fees for their first year of education thanks to this policy This is extremely important for those whose jobs or future jobs are affected by automation and other technologies One aspect of this policy has not had a lot of attention which is for adults who have never trained or studied before They will be able to take up the three years free policy as it is rolled out This can be taken in short bursts or as complete re training This policy also covers the costs of those undertaking apprenticeships and aspects of industry training Because of the relative costs from 2018 this means two years free for apprentices right away For the next generation of people entering the workforce it is essential they are given the skills to be resilient and adaptable In the Future of Work Commission s time we heard from employer after employer that they were looking for people with what we once called soft skills the ability to collaborate be creative and solve problems These ideas lie at the heart of New Zealand s education curriculum but there is work to do to ensure they are developed for all our young people We will be embarking on a host of initiatives to see this happen including reform of our careers advice and guidance in schools to give all young people the opportunity to understand and experience the world of work This will be developed in close cooperation with business and training providers to create a more seamless transition from school to whatever comes next In January Employment Minister Willie Jackson announced the first of a series of initiatives to help give a group of young people who have fallen outside of the system sustainable work opportunities Sadly Maori and Pacifika young people are over represented among this group They are the most at risk of being excluded from the future of work and we need practical programmes that provide work experience to get them back into a training journey In the long term I believe we will need to radically alter the way we think about training and learning and work if we are to continue to lift productivity As the pace of technological change picks up we need to see ourselves as genuinely learning for life In many ways jobs will be events on that learning and training journey rather than the other way around This presents a series of challenges and opportunities for our education and training system that we will look at over the coming years There are of course many other areas of policy response that will contribute to our response to the Future of Work but I wanted to finish today on what systemic changes we will need to ensure we are leading the change rather than being passive recipients of it Active and Capable StateA critical element identified in our Future of Work report is that the state needs to be an active participant in how we shape the future of work It is important to note that by active I do not mean that it controls or dictates what happens but rather that we move beyond the tired and dangerous idea that we can simply leave the response to market forces to decide how New Zealand fares in the future world of work This means working alongside businesses to identify opportunities as noted above in the R and D and Tech sectors for example It means developing a new partnership between the Crown and Maori as the settlement of historic Treaty breaches comes to an end and opportunities for economic development emerge It also means being innovative and entrepreneurial when that is appropriate We are wanting public servants to co design with both politicians and the wider community what we can do to stay ahead of the curve A major example of this is the Provincial Growth Fund developed as part of our coalition agreement with New Zealand First This will see significant investments in the regions of New Zealand to grow sustainable and productive job opportunities The details of the Fund are to be released shortly and will provide some of the most significant development of our regions in decades These will be driven from the ground up with the Government as an active partner A New Social PartnershipIt is my strong belief that the most critical element to New Zealand succeeding in the Future of Work is a renewed social partnership between businesses workers and the government In the course of our Commission we saw examples in both large and small businesses of innovative approaches to this idea Air New Zealand s High Performance Engagement model is one useful example By involving workers in the full range of strategic decisions and change processes Air New Zealand has not only seen significant productivity benefits they have created far more harmonious workplace relations In a number of the new smaller technology businesses we have seen flat management structures and workplace democracy in action that is core to the way they run their businesses These companies give a significant voice to their employees and have seen productivity growth and improved workplace relations as a result We are working with MBIE and others to facilitate these approaches across a range of industries We can also see innovations happening in the way we work An example which has grabbed attention recently is Perpetual Guardian s decision to switch to trial a four day working week for five days pay The move was designed to improve workers wellbeing by giving them more time to spend with family and on other aspects of life with the expectation that this will enhance their productivity during the days they do work the same levels of output for fewer hours worked These are the kinds of practices that we need to see more of If we look at Germany as an example union members often sit on company boards as part of the decision making process ensuring that employee wellbeing is considered alongside high level corporate profit and financial targets It is unsurprising then that German workers on average worked the fewest hours annually in 2016 of all OECD countries with New Zealand workers on average doing 400 more hours every year This is possible because Germany s workers are also some of the most productive in the world I want to see New Zealand reach a point where we are able to work 400 fewer hours a year while producing more than we do today For us to get there we need to make the advances in productivity we have been discussing today Technological improvements will play a huge role in this One of my goals as Minister of Finance is to develop this new partnership at a system wide level to promote a combined work stream on how we can apply these lessons to other industries and sectors My parting challenge to the many public servants here today is to think about how we can do this across Government and break down some of the silos we have created to enable businesses and workers and their representatives to easily engage in such a partnership ConclusionI am most certainly not the first New Zealand politician to both highlight the challenge of low productivity nor to say that we will address it So the proof will be in what we actually do But we are in an environment that has change occurring at a pace and scale we have never seen before We have to take the opportunity now to capitalise on that to finally make the leaps that have so far eluded our country We have already made a start with the initiatives I have mentioned today I want us to re write our productivity story so that New Zealand becomes a leading example of a sustainable and productive economy in which everyone gets a share of economic success We have a long way to go but this Government is committed to tackling the long term challenges that this country has faced for many years I look forward to working with you on this journey Thank you CommentFor many people artificial intelligence conjures up images of sci fi movies and the future They see it as a threat to their jobs and sometimes even their safety but AI represents the biggest leap forward in terms of work productivity since the personal computer and few other industries can benefit from AI as much as government With AI we can change the way government works and help employees do their job better AI is already integrated into numerous cloud platforms and can be used to discover new information and deliver outcomes instantly I like to refer to this as practical AI AI has the potential to improve employee experiences by speeding up decision making and automating mundane and repetitive tasks Bringing machine learning to everyday work enables government agencies and departments to make better decisions faster because they do not have to hunt for data and aggregate it into a spreadsheet By building intelligence into platforms AI helps manage complex workflows and allows organizations to One way that AI will be applied in the workplace is automating service requests Most companies have an IT service desk as well as a customer support center These functions ensure that customers and employees receive help in a timely manner whether it is a request for a new computer a password reset or the status of a repair Manually triaging thousands of incidents or cases categorizing tasks and routing work can consume resources introduce human error and slow resolution In fact a new report from Accenture found that customer support functions spend up to 12 percent of their time categorizing prioritizing and assigning tickets Meanwhile AI accurately categorizes requests nearly instantly It eliminates the bottleneck created by agents having to manually assign categorize and route requests A full two days a week is wasted on manual administrative work according to the recent State of Work survey conducted by ServiceNow If an agency with 5 000 people automated those processes they could get 4 million work hours back a year Adding AI frees up employees to do the work they want to do spurring creativity Nearly half of respondents 48 percent said work levels increased by 20 percent or more after they adopted AI solutions Additionally 91 percent of executives say their skilled employees spend too much time on admin tasks and 93 percent believe that reducing mundane tasks unleashes employee creativity To properly implement AI solutions across government agencies we need to define which tasks are best suited for humans and which ones should be performed by AI The government has a term inherently governmental to describe work processes or decisions that must be done by government employees Contractors do much of the work in our government agencies but certain work is inherently governmental in nature As we move into an age defined by AI we need to identify and define the work processes and decisions that are inherently human We are going to increasingly work in a blended workplace with AI systems and humans working together to achieve a mission There are certain activities within any work environment that can only be performed or should only be performed by humans While there may be many more human activities designated as inherently human in the beginning I believe that as humans become more comfortable with the role of AI in the blended workforce less and less work will be designated as inherently human There will always be a need for humans to remain in charge from factual responsibility and liability aspects as well as from emotional and psychological ones We spend a third of our lives at work It shapes who we are how we feel and how we interact with the world so we must create great work experiences and this is what AI does AI creates work experiences that unleash productivity bringing out the best in us Rather than fearing machines stealing jobs we need to understand how AI will change the way government works though small but practical ways and prepare the

Washington Transformation Politics Policies Prospects a forum sponsored by the Summer Institute of Martha s Vineyard Hebrew Center Vineyard Haven MassachusettsI want to talk tonight about labor productivity growth Labor productivity is the amount of goods and services produced per hour spent on the job Increases in labor productivity again that s the amount of goods and services produced per hour on the job are a fundamental factor in determining how fast the economy grows and how fast the average standard of living grows And productivity growth can be influenced by government policy about which I also want to say a few words 1Labor productivity growth varies a lot from year to year but it is possible to discern longer historical periods with high or low productivity growth as shown in figure 1 For example labor productivity rose at an average annual rate of 3 1 4 percent from 1948 to 1973 whereas in the period 1974 to 2016 the average growth rate of productivity was about 1 7 percent That is to say that with the important exception of the information technology IT boom beginning in the mid 1990s the U S economy has been in a low productivity growth period since 1974 The record for the past five years has been particularly dismal How much does productivity growth matter A great deal The person who made that clear in an article published in 1957 60 years ago Professor Robert Solow is here tonight That is a pleasure an honor a joy and something of a difficulty for anyone wanting to talk about productivity and its growth in the presence of the master The reason the rate of productivity growth matters so much is that it is a basic determinant of the rate of growth of average income per capita over long periods 2 To understand that one needs to know only the trick of calculating how long it takes for a growing economy to double A good rule of thumb for calculating the time it takes labor productivity or anything else that is growing to double can be calculated by dividing 70 by the growth rate When labor productivity was growing at 3 1 4 percent per year during the 25 years from 1948 to 1973 it took 22 years for labor productivity to double Looking again at Figure 1 in the 42 years from 1974 to 2016 when labor productivity was growing on average at a rate of 1 3 4 percent it would have taken approximately 41 years for labor productivity to double There is a vast difference between the prospects facing the young in an economy where incomes per capita are doubling every 22 years and an economy in which incomes are on average doubling only every 41 years Now productivity statistics are imperfect in many respects for example capturing the value of the seemingly free apps we use on our smartphones is challenging And many of us who live in the modern age cannot believe that the iPhone has not fundamentally changed our lives It has certainly changed our lives to some extent and there is likely some underestimation of productivity growth in the official data But to figure out whether the current degree of data bias has reduced estimated growth we have to ask not whether there is bias but whether the bias has increased To a first approximation one could assume that the rate of bias is constant and does not account for the estimated decline in productivity growth and that we should not dismiss the slowdown as an artifact of measurement difficulties3 That is the conclusion most researchers reach but the data issue is not settled As Bob Solow famously said just before the increase in productivity growth of 1996 2003 the computer is everywhere except in the growth data And there are serious researchers who have made serious arguments that we will soon be seeing more rapid growth in the productivity data Factors determining productivity growth Clearly a key question for economic forecasters and even more so for U S citizens and indeed for the entire global economy is whether we should anticipate a return of the more rapid productivity gains experienced in the IT boom and for the quarter century after the end of World War II or should instead resign ourselves to tepid economic growth in future years And a central policy issue is whether government policies can help push the economy toward a higher productivity regime In this context it is useful to think of labor productivity growth as coming from three sources as shown in figure 2 First greater investment by firms in tangible equipment and structures as well as intangible investments such as software and product designs raise labor productivity Second improvements in labor quality or the capabilities of the workforce contribute as well through education training and experience Finally innovations yield more or better output from the same inputs the same capital and labor such as the introduction of the assembly line and computer aided product design I will consider the role that policy may play through each of these channels It is noteworthy that most of the recent drop in productivity is due to a lower contribution from innovation although weaker investment has played a role as well The contribution to labor productivity from labor quality has changed very little Innovation Our prospects for further significant technological innovations are hotly debated Some observers believe that we have exhausted the low hanging fruit on the productivity tree and in particular that efficiency gains from the use of IT have run their course 4 Other observers argue that we can reach fruit higher on the tree with each passing year These observers believe that innovation yields better tools such as 3 D printers and genetic sequencing equipment which themselves enable further technological advances 5 For what it is worth I believe the early signs of self driving cars the emergence of disease treatments based on genetics and the falling costs for conventional and alternative energy production suggest that we are continuing to innovate both in IT as well as in other parts of the economy One possibility is that we are in a productivity lull while firms reorganize to exploit the latest innovations it took decades before the full benefits of the steam engine electrification and computers were seen 6One way to ensure the vigor of innovation is to support research and development R D and here the recent record is mixed As shown in figure 3 R D spending in the United States softened during the Great Recession R D funded by U S businesses has since recovered However government funded R D as a share of gross domestic product is at the lowest level in recent history A great deal of the R in overall R D is government funded and not tied to a specific commercial goal The applied research built on this basic research ultimately yields productivity gains far into the future 7 Consequently the decline in government funded R D is disturbing To raise productivity and economic well being firms must adopt innovations that emerge from R D as quickly as possible This adjustment may occur as start ups introduce innovation to the market as existing innovative firms expand or as competing firms imitate the innovators Recent research suggests that all three of these channels which reflect the economic dynamism of businesses have been operating sluggishly of late New firms are not created as often as in the past innovative firms are not hiring or investing as aggressively as they once did and the diffusion of innovations is weak from frontier firms to trailing firms 8It is difficult to pinpoint specific policy actions that would address this decline in dynamism Broadly speaking however government policymakers should carefully consider the effects of regulations and tax policy on the free flow of workers capital and ideas Investment In recent years the contribution to labor productivity growth from investment has declined Business fixed investment rose roughly 2 1 2 percent per year on average from 2004 to 2016 compared with about 5 percent from 1996 to 2003 9 Some bright spots do exist Capital expenditure by leading IT companies Google Amazon and the like has soared since 2010 and investment in the energy sector has returned to life Nevertheless firms as a whole seem reluctant to invest This cautious approach to investment may in part reflect uncertainty about the policy environment By one measure U S policy uncertainty was elevated for much of the recovery subsided in 2013 and then rose again late last year underpinned by uncertainty about policies associated with health care regulation taxes and trade 10 Reasonable people can disagree about the right way forward on each of those issues but mitigating the damping effect of uncertainty by providing more clarity on the future direction of government policy is highly desirable particularly if the direction of policy itself is desirable Government investment can be an important source of productivity growth as well For example the interstate highway system is credited with boosting productivity in the 1950s and 1960s 11 That highway system and many other federally supported roadways waterways and structures have been neglected in recent years Indeed real infrastructure spending that is adjusting for inflation has fallen nearly 1 percent per year since 2005 12 This area of government investment deserves more attention Labor Quality Also important to raising labor productivity is investment in human capital workers knowledge and skills Such investment is a particular issue because most forecasts anticipate that the long rise in educational attainment both for college and high school may soon come to an end One area where policy may play a role is promoting educational access and readiness for groups for whom educational attainment is relatively low Recent research has shown a substantial return to public investment in early childhood education for economically disadvantaged groups Such programs increase high school graduation promote income over the life cycle for both participants and their parents and produce other socially beneficial outcomes such as greater health 13At the other end of the education process a college degree has long been considered a worthwhile investment and thus our society should promote access to and readiness for college among a broad range of individuals in particular through federal support for need based financial aid 14Lastly I will note that ultimately the return on the human capital embodied in our workforce is closely tied to public health A rise in morbidity or fall in longevity in the U S population is not a concern only for humanitarian reasons Workers too ill to perform at their potential represent lost productivity and welfare for society as a whole Research has shown just such a trend among prime age non Hispanic Americans without a college degree 15 More study is needed to determine what policies would help reverse this trend and government funding could likely assist the effort More broadly programs to promote clean air and drinking water are examples of public health policies that bolster the health and longevity of the present and future workforce as a whole Concluding remarks To conclude we return to the basic question How much does productivity growth matter The basic answer simple arithmetic says it matters a lot If labor productivity grows an average of 2 percent per year average living standards for our children s generation will be twice what we experienced If labor productivity grows an average of 1 percent per year the difference is dramatic Living standards will take two generations to double 16But fortunately when it comes to productivity we are not simply consigned to luck or to fate Governments can take sensible actions to promote more rapid productivity growth Broadly speaking government policy works best when it can address a need that the private sector neglects including investment in basic research infrastructure early childhood education schooling and public health Reasonable people can disagree about the right way forward but if we as a society are to succeed we need to follow policies that will support and advance productivity growth That is easier said than done But it can be done References Andrews Dan Chiara Criscuolo and Peter Gal 2015

Street and Constitution Avenue N W Washington DC 20551Productivity growth in the United States and other advanced economies has slowed sharply over the past decade If this slowdown persists it will mean more slowly rising living standards and more difficult fiscal challenges What public policies might quicken the pace of productivity growth in the U S We put that question recently to a panel of experts convened by the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy and the Initiative on Business and Public Policy Here are some of their suggestions One solution to the productivity slowdown on which there was broad consensus was the need to enhance competition Competition promotes productivity growth through increased incentives for innovation and through selection If firms have strong incentives to innovate many productivity boosting innovations will come to market Also when only the firms with the highest productivity survive while the least productive firms are forced to exit the market the average productivity will go up Jonathan Baker a lawyer and economist who teaches at American University s Washington College of Law believes that there is room to improve competition in the U S economy Market power is a problem in the U S economy it s plausible that growing market power has contributed to the productivity slowdown he explains Competition can be increased in a number of ways including by strengthening antitrust enforcement and by reforming the patent system so that patents are not used to shut out potential competitors while providing enough incentives for firms to invest in developing innovations Bronwyn Hall emerita professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley suggested that in some industries it s currently too easy to get a patent Most of us who look closely at the patent system think that the requirement for novelty is a little too low And so we do think there s room for reform in the patent area Occupational licensing is another area that might have room for improving competition There s been tremendous growth in this country in occupational licensing requirements And that s got to harm entry barriers and make it hard for people to move in and out of occupations And it s not just doctors it s things like cosmetologists a whole range of jobs says Baker It also is important to avoid policies that might stifle productivity Some of such policies have been popular in this year s political campaign If you think about the ongoing political campaign the policies that have been given a lot of attention include things like restrictions on trade and immigration These are not the kinds of policies you want to think about if you re going to think about enhancing productivity says Robert Barro a Harvard University economist Policies to increase the skills of the workforce are essential to raising productivity as well Isabel Sawhill a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution argued that policies that increase years of schooling might not be enough She stressed the importance of ensuring that those years of schooling actually translate into skills and knowledge She noted that more than two thirds of young adults today would fail to quality for military service because of lack of education drug addiction jail records and other shortcomings which also suggests that they may not have the capabilities to be very productive in the workplace Improving the allocation of funding to research and development is another area that might improve prospects for productivity growth over the long run Hall pointed out that the allocation of federal funding for basic science R D is skewed towards life sciences and argued that this isn t a great strategy We can t tell now what field of science will be useful in the future It s just like the stock market And so all we can do is have a portfolio that is more balanced in the basic science spending Related Books Kuznets beyond Kuznets By Saumik Paul 2018 Brookings Papers on Economic Activity Spring 2018 Edited by Janice C Eberly and James H Stock 2018 Dance of the Trillions By David Lubin 2018Finally economist Brad DeLong of the University of California at Berkeley suggested that policy focus on low hanging fruit those industries that subtract value from our economy rather than add to it One example of such a value subtracting industry is healthcare administration he believes Our doctors nurses and pharmacists do wonderful things but as Princeton s Uwe Reinhart likes to say you do the national income accounting and our healthcare administrators are about one eight as productive as German health care professionals because they re all working against each other either trying to get things covered or trying not to get things

Discounted ValueAppendix D The Expenditure Output ModelChapter 20 Economic GrowthSustained long term economic growth comes from increases in worker productivity which essentially means how well we do things In other words how efficient is your nation with its time and workers Labor productivity is the value that each employed person creates per unit of his or her input The easiest way to comprehend labor productivity is to imagine a Canadian worker who can make 10 loaves of bread in an hour versus a U S worker who in the same hour can make only two loaves of bread In this fictional example the Canadians are more productive Being more productive essentially means you can do more in the same amount of time This in turn frees up resources to be used elsewhere What determines how productive workers are The answer is pretty intuitive The first determinant of labor productivity is human capital Human capital is the accumulated knowledge from education and experience skills and expertise that the average worker in an economy possesses Typically the higher the average level of education in an economy the higher the accumulated human capital and the higher the labor productivity The second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change Technological change is a combination of invention advances in knowledge and innovation which is putting that advance to use in a new product or service For example the transistor was invented in 1947 It allowed us to miniaturize the footprint of electronic devices and use less power than the tube technology that came before it Innovations since then have produced smaller and better transistors that that are ubiquitous in products as varied as smart phones computers and escalators The development of the transistor has allowed workers to be anywhere with smaller devices These devices can be used to communicate with other workers measure product quality or do any other task in less time improving worker productivity The third factor that determines labor productivity is economies of scale Recall that economies of scale are the cost advantages that industries obtain due to size Read more about economies of scale in Cost and Industry Structure Consider again the case of the fictional Canadian worker who could produce 10 loaves of bread in an hour If this difference in productivity was due only to economies of scale it could be that Canadian workers had access to a large industrial size oven while the U S worker was using a standard residential size oven Now that we have explored the determinants of worker productivity let s turn to how economists measure economic growth and productivity To analyze the sources of economic growth it is useful to think about a production function which is the process of turning economic inputs like labor machinery and raw materials into outputs like goods and services used by consumers A microeconomic production function describes the inputs and outputs of a firm or perhaps an industry In macroeconomics the connection from inputs to outputs for the entire economy is called an aggregate production function Economists construct different production functions depending on the focus of their studies Figure 1 presents two examples of aggregate production functions In the first production function shown in Figure 1 a the output is GDP The inputs in this example are workforce human capital physical capital and technology We discuss these inputs further in the module Components of Economic Growth An economy s rate of productivity growth is closely linked to the growth rate of its GDP per capita although the two are not identical For example if the percentage of the population who holds jobs in an economy increases GDP per capita will increase but the productivity of individual workers may not be affected Over the long term the only way that GDP per capita can grow continually is if the productivity of the average worker rises or if there are complementary increases in capital A common measure of U S productivity per worker is dollar value per hour the worker contributes to the employer s output This measure excludes government workers because their output is not sold in the market and so their productivity is hard to measure It also excludes farming which accounts for only a relatively small share of the U S economy Figure 2 shows an index of output per hour with 2009 as the base year when the index equals 100 The index equaled about 106 in 2014 In 1972 the index equaled 50 which shows that workers have more than doubled their productivity since then According to the Department of Labor U S productivity growth was fairly strong in the 1950s but then declined in the 1970s and 1980s before rising again in the second half of the 1990s and the first half of the 2000s In fact the rate of productivity measured by the change in output per hour worked averaged 3 2 per year from 1950 to 1970 dropped to 1 9 per year from 1970 to 1990 and then climbed back to over 2 3 from 1991 to the present with another modest slowdown after 2001 Figure 3 shows average annual rates of productivity growth averaged over time since 1950 In recent years a controversy has been brewing among economists about the resurgence of U S productivity in the second half of the 1990s One school of thought argues that the United States had developed a new economy based on the extraordinary advances in communications and information technology of the 1990s The most optimistic proponents argue that it would generate higher average productivity growth for decades to come The pessimists on the other hand argue that even five or ten years of stronger productivity growth does not prove that higher productivity will last for the long term It is hard to infer anything about long term productivity trends during the later part of the 2000s because the steep recession of 2008 2009 with its sharp but not completely synchronized declines in output and employment complicates any interpretation While productivity growth was high in 2009 and 2010 around 3 it has slowed down since then Productivity growth is also closely linked to the average level of wages Over time the amount that firms are willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce If a few employers tried to pay their workers less than what those workers produced then those workers would receive offers of higher wages from other profit seeking employers If a few employers mistakenly paid their workers more than what those workers produced those employers would soon end up with losses In the long run productivity per hour is the most important determinant of the average wage level in any economy To learn how to compare economies in this regard follow the steps in the following Work It Out feature The Organization for Economic Co operation and Development OECD tracks data on the annual growth rate of real GDP per hour worked You can find these data on the OECD data webpage Labour productivity growth in the total economy at this website Step 1 Visit the OECD website given above and select two countries to compare Step 2 On the drop down menu Variable select Real GDP Annual Growth in percent and record the data for the countries you have chosen for the five most recent years Step 3 Go back to the drop down menu and select Real GDP per Hour Worked Annual Growth Rate in percent and select data for the same years for which you selected GDP data Step 4 Compare real GDP growth for both countries Table 2 provides an example of a comparison between Australia and Belgium Step 5 Consider the many factors can affect growth For example one factor that may have affected Australia is its isolation from Europe which may have insulated the country from the effects of the global recession In Belgium s case the global recession seems to have had an impact on both GDP and real GDP per hours worked between 2009 and 2013 though productivity does seem to be recovering Nothing is more important for people s standard of living than sustained economic growth Even small changes in the rate of growth when sustained and compounded over long periods of time make an enormous difference in the standard of living Consider Table 3 in which the rows of the table show several different rates of growth in GDP per capita and the columns show different periods of time Assume for simplicity that an economy starts with a GDP per capita of 100 The table then applies the following formula to calculate what GDP will be at the given growth rate in the future For example an economy that starts with a GDP of 100 and grows at 3 per year will reach a GDP of 209 after 25 years that is 100 1 03 25 209 The slowest rate of GDP per capita growth in the table just 1 per year is similar to what the United States experienced during its weakest years of productivity growth The second highest rate 3 per year is close to what the U S economy experienced during the strong economy of the late 1990s and into the 2000s Higher rates of per capita growth such as 5 or 8 per year represent the experience of rapid growth in economies like Japan Korea and China Table 3 shows that even a few percentage points of difference in economic growth rates will have a profound effect if sustained and compounded over time For example an economy growing at a 1 annual rate over 50 years will see its GDP per capita rise by a total of 64 from 100 to 164 in this example However a country growing at a 5 annual rate will see almost the same amount of growth from 100 to 163 over just 10 years Rapid rates of economic growth can bring profound transformation See the following Clear It Up feature on the relationship between compound growth rates and compound interest rates If the rate of growth is 8 young adults starting at age 20 will see the average standard of living in their country more than double by the time they reach age 30 and grow nearly sevenfold by the time they reach age 45 The formula for growth rates of GDP over different periods of time as shown in Figure 2 is exactly the same as the formula for how a given amount of financial savings grows at a certain interest rate over time as presented in Choice in a World of Scarcity Both formulas have the same ingredients Recall that compound interest is interest that is earned on past interest It causes the total amount of financial savings to grow dramatically over time Similarly compound rates of economic growth or the compound growth rate means that the rate of growth is being multiplied by a base that includes past GDP growth with dramatic effects over time For example in 2013 the World Fact Book produced by the Central Intelligence Agency reported that South Korea had a GDP of 1 67 trillion with a growth rate of 2 8 We can estimate that at that growth rate South Korea s GDP will be 1 92 trillion in five years If we apply the growth rate to each year s ending GDP for the next five years we will calculate that at the end of year one GDP is 1 72 trillion In year two we start with the end of year one value of 1 67 and increase it by 2 Year three starts with the end of year two GDP and we increase it by 2 and so on as depicted in the Table 4 Another way to calculate the growth rate is to apply the following formula Where future value is the value of GDP five years hence present value is the starting GDP amount of 1 64 trillion g is the growth rate of 2 and n is the number of periods for which we are calculating growth Productivity the value of what is produced per worker or per hour worked can be measured as the level of GDP per worker or GDP per hour The United States experienced a productivity slowdown between 1973 and 1989 Since then U S productivity has rebounded the current global recession notwithstanding It is not clear whether the current growth in productivity will be sustained The rate of productivity growth is the primary determinant of an economy s rate of long term economic growth and higher wages Over decades and generations seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita An aggregate production function specifies how certain inputs in the economy like human capital physical capital and technology lead to the output measured as GDP per capita Compound interest and compound growth rates behave in the same way as productivity rates Seemingly small changes in percentage points can have big impacts on income over time Answers to Self Check Questions20 2 Labor Productivity and Economic Growth by Rice University is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4 0

disruption of jobs experts say a wider array of education and skills building programs will be created to meet new demands There are two uncertainties Will well prepared workers be able to keep up in the race with AI tools And will market capitalism survive By Lee Rainie and Janna AndersonMachines are eating humans jobs talents And it s not just about jobs that are repetitive and low skill Automation robotics algorithms and artificial intelligence AI in recent times have shown they can do equal or sometimes even better work than humans who are dermatologists insurance claims adjusters lawyers seismic testers in oil fields sports journalists and financial reporters crew members on guided missile destroyers hiring managers psychological testers retail salespeople and border patrol agents Moreover there is growing anxiety that technology developments on the near horizon will crush the jobs of the millions who drive cars and trucks analyze medical tests and data perform middle management chores dispense medicine trade stocks and evaluate markets fight on battlefields perform government functions and even replace those who program software that is the creators of algorithms People will create the jobs of the future not simply train for them and technology is already central It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead Jonathan GrudinMultiple studies have documented that massive numbers of jobs are at risk as programmed devices many of them smart autonomous systems continue their march into workplaces A recent study by labor economists found that one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment to population ratio by about 0 18 0 34 percentage points and wages by 0 25 0 5 percent When Pew Research Center and Elon University s Imagining the Internet Center asked experts in 2014 whether AI and robotics would create more jobs than they would destroy the verdict was evenly split 48 of the respondents envisioned a future where more jobs are lost than created while 52 said more jobs would be created than lost Since that expert canvassing the future of jobs has been at the top of the agenda at many major conferences globally Several policy and market based solutions have been promoted to address the loss of employment and wages forecast by technologists and economists A key idea emerging from many conversations including one of the lynchpin discussions at the World Economic Forum in 2016 is that changes in educational and learning environments are necessary to help people stay employable in the labor force of the future Among the six overall findings in a new 184 page report from the National Academies of Sciences the experts recommended The education system will need to adapt to prepare individuals for the changing labor market At the same time recent IT advances offer new and potentially more widely accessible ways to access education Jobholders themselves have internalized this insight A 2016 Pew Research Center survey The State of American Jobs found that 87 of workers believe it will be essential for them to get training and develop new job skills throughout their work life in order to keep up with changes in the workplace This survey noted that employment is much higher among jobs that require an average or above average level of preparation including education experience and job training average or above average interpersonal management and communication skills and higher levels of analytical skills such as critical thinking and computer skills A central question about the future then is whether formal and informal learning structures will evolve to meet the changing needs of people who wish to fulfill the workplace expectations of the future Pew Research Center and Elon s Imagining the Internet Center conducted a large scale canvassing of technologists scholars practitioners strategic thinkers and education leaders in the summer of 2016 asking them to weigh in on the likely future of workplace training Some 1 408 responded to the following question sharing their expectations about what is likely to evolve by 2026 In the next 10 years do you think we will see the emergence of new educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers in the skills they will need to perform the jobs of the future The nonscientific canvassing found that 70 of these particular respondents said yes such programs would emerge and be successful A majority among the 30 who said no generally do not believe adaptation in teaching environments will be sufficient to teach new skills at the scale that is necessary to help workers keep abreast of the tech changes that will upend millions of jobs See About this canvassing of experts for further details about the limits of this sample Participants were asked to explain their answers and offered the following prompts to consider Several common expectations were evident in these respondents answers no matter how hopeful or fretful they were about the future of skills and capabilities training efforts It is important to note that many respondents listed human behaviors attributes and competencies in describing desirable work skills Although these aspects of psychology cannot be classified as skills and perhaps cannot be directly taught in any sort of training environment we include these answers under the general heading of skills capabilities and attributes A diversifying education and credentialing ecosystem Most of these experts expect the education marketplace especially online learning platforms to continue to change in an effort to accommodate the widespread needs Some predict employers will step up their own efforts to train and retrain workers Many foresee a significant number of self teaching efforts by jobholders themselves as they take advantage of proliferating online opportunities Respondents see a new education and training ecosystem emerging in which some job preparation functions are performed by formal educational institutions in fairly traditional classroom settings some elements are offered online some are created by for profit firms some are free some exploit augmented and virtual reality elements and gaming sensibilities and a lot of real time learning takes place in formats that job seekers pursue on their own A considerable number of respondents to this canvassing focused on the likelihood that the best education programs will teach people how to be lifelong learners Accordingly some say alternative credentialing mechanisms will arise to assess and vouch for the skills people acquire along the way A focus on nurturing unique human skills that artificial intelligence AI and machines seem unable to replicate Many of these experts discussed in their responses the human talents they believe machines and automation may not be able to duplicate noting that these should be the skills developed and nurtured by education and training programs to prepare people to work successfully alongside AI These respondents suggest that workers of the future will learn to deeply cultivate and exploit creativity collaborative activity abstract and systems thinking complex communication and the ability to thrive in diverse environments One such comment came from Simon Gottschalk a professor in the department of sociology at the University of Nevada Las Vegas The skills necessary at the higher echelons will include especially the ability to efficiently network manage public relations display intercultural sensitivity marketing and generally what author Dan Goleman would call social and emotional intelligence This also includes creativity and just enough critical thinking to move outside the box Another example is the response of Fredric Litto a professor emeritus of communications and longtime distance learning expert from the University of S o Paulo We are now in the transitional stage of employers gradually reducing their prejudice in the hiring of those who studied at a distance and moving in favor of such graduates who in the workplace demonstrate greater proactiveness initiative discipline collaborativeness because they studied online Other respondents mentioned traits including leadership design thinking human meta communication deliberation conflict resolution and the capacity to motivate mobilize and innovate Still others spoke of more practical needs that could help workers in the medium term to work with data and algorithms to implement 3 D modeling and work with 3 D printers or to implement the newly emerging capabilities in artificial intelligence and augmented and virtual reality Jonathan Grudin principal researcher at Microsoft commented People will create the jobs of the future not simply train for them and technology is already central It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead Seriously You re asking about the workforce of the future As if there s going to be one Anonymous scientific editorAbout a third of respondents expressed no confidence in training and education evolving quickly enough to match demands by 2026 Some of the bleakest answers came from some of the most respected technology analysts For instance Jason Hong an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University wrote There are two major components needed for a new kind of training program at this scale political will and a proven technology platform Even assuming that the political will and budget existed there s no platform today that can successfully train large numbers of people MOOCs Massive Open Online Courses have a high dropout rate and have serious questions about quality of instruction They are also struggling with basic issues like identification of individuals taking the courses So in short we can train small numbers of individuals tens of thousands per year using today s community colleges and university systems but probably not more Several respondents argued that job training is not a primary concern at a time when accelerating change in market economies is creating massive economic divides that seem likely to leave many people behind An anonymous scientific editor commented Seriously You re asking about the workforce of the future As if there s going to be one Employers either run sweatshops abroad or hire people in the first world to do jobs that they hate while more and more unskilled and skilled people end up permanently on welfare or zero hour contracts And the relatively job secure qualified people who work in the professions are probably a lot closer than they think they are to going over that same cliff The details of how they earn their credentials aren t going to be an issue Most participants in this canvassing wrote detailed elaborations explaining their positions though they were allowed to respond anonymously Their well considered comments provide insights about hopeful and concerning trends These findings do not represent all possible points of view but they do reveal a wide range of striking observations Respondents collectively articulated five major themes that are introduced and briefly explained in the 29 page section below and then expanded upon in more detailed sections Some responses are lightly edited for style or due to length The following section presents a brief overview of the most evident themes extracted from the written responses including a small selection of representative quotes supporting each point Some responses are lightly edited for style or due to length These experts envision that the next decade will bring a more widely diversified world of education and training options in which various entities design and deliver different services to those who seek to learn They expect that some innovation will be aimed at emphasizing the development of human talents that machines cannot match and at helping humans partner with technology They say some parts of the ecosystem will concentrate on delivering real time learning to workers often in formats that are self taught Commonly occurring ideas among the responses in this category are collected below under headings reflecting subthemes Most experts seem to have faith that rapid technological development and a rising wariness of coming impacts of the AI robotics revolution are going to spur the public private and governmental actions needed for education and training systems to be adapted to deliver more flexible open adaptable resilient certifiable and useful lifelong learning Educators have always found new ways of training the next generation of students for the jobs of the future and this generation will be no different Justin ReichJim Hendler a professor of computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute predicted The nature of education will change to a mix of models College education which will still favor multi year residential education will need to be more focused on teaching students to be lifelong learners followed by more online content in situ training and other such elements to increase skills in a rapidly changing information world As automation puts increasing numbers of low and middle skill workers out of work these models will also provide for certifications and training needs to function in an increasingly automated service sector Michael Wollowski an associate professor of computer science at the Rose Hulman Institute of Technology commented We will definitely see a vast increase in educational and training programs We will also see what might be called on demand or on the job kind of training programs We kind of have to as with continued automation we will need to retrain a large portion of the workforce I strongly believe employers will subscribe to this idea wholeheartedly it increases the overall education of their workforce which benefits their bottom line Nevertheless I am a big believer in the college experience which I see as a way to learn what you are all about as a person and in your field of study The confidence in your own self and your abilities cannot be learned in a short course It takes life experience or four years at a tough college At a good college you are challenged to be your best this is very resource intensive and cannot be scaled at this time Justin Reich executive director at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT Teaching Systems Lab observed Educators have always found new ways of training the next generation of students for the jobs of the future and this generation will be no different Our established systems of job training primarily community colleges and state universities will continue to play a crucial role though catastrophically declining public support for these institutions will raise serious challenges David Karger a professor of computer science at MIT wrote Most of what we now call online learning is little more than glorified textbooks but the future is very promising No matter how good our online teaching systems become the current four year college model will remain dominant for quite some time Online teaching will increase the reach of the top universities which will put pressure on lesser universities to demonstrate value One potential future would be for those universities to abandon the idea that they have faculty teaching their own courses and instead consist entirely of a cadre of less well paid teaching assistants who provide support for the students who are taking courses online A few respondents said already established institutions cannot be as fully successful as new initiatives Jerry Michalski founder at REX commented Today s educational and training institutions are a shambles They take too long to teach impractical skills and knowledge not connected to the real world and when they try to tackle critical thinking for a longer time scale they mostly fail The sprouts of the next generation of learning tools are already visible Within the decade the new shoots will overtake the wilting vines and we will see all sorts of new initiatives mostly outside these schooling academic and training institutions which are mostly beyond repair People will shift to them because they work because they are far less expensive and because they are always available Barry Chudakov founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp says education has been liberated because thanks to digital innovation everyone can embed learning continuously in their everyday lives He wrote The key to education in the next 10 years will be the understanding that we now live in a world without walls and so the walls of the school physical and conceptual need to shatter and never go up again In the hopefully near future we will not segregate schooling from work and real world thinking and development They will seamlessly weave into a braid of learning realization exposure hands on experience and integration into students own lives And again the experience of being a student now confined to grade school secondary school and university will expand to include workers those looking for work and those who want or need to retrain as well as what we now think of as conventional education One way we will break down these walls we are already doing so will be to create digital learning spaces to rival classrooms as places where learning happen s Via simulation gaming digital presentations combined with hands on real world experience learning and re education will move out of books and into the world The more likely enhancement will be to take digital enhancements out into the world again breaking down the walls of the classroom and school to inform and enhance experience An anonymous respondent echoed the sentiment of quite a few others who do not think it is possible to advance and enhance online education and training much in the next decade writing These programs have a cost and too few are willing to sacrifice for these programs More such arguments are included in later sections of this report Some respondents expressed confidence in the best of current online education and training options saying online course options are cost effective evolving for the better and game changing because they are globally accessible Those with the most optimism expect great progress will be made in augmented reality AR virtual reality VR and AI While some say 2026 will still be early days for this tech many are excited about its prospects for enhancing learning in the next decade Already today there are quite effective online training and education systems but they are not being implemented to their full potential Edward FriedmanEdward Friedman professor emeritus of technology management at the Stevens Institute of Technology wrote Already today there are quite effective online training and education systems but they are not being implemented to their full potential These applications will become more widely used with familiarity that is gained during the next decade Also populations will be more tech savvy and be able to make use of these systems with greater personal ease In addition the development of virtual reality AI assistants and other technological advances will add to the effectiveness of these systems There will be a greater need for such systems as the needs for new expertise in the workforce increase and the capacity of traditional education systems proves that it is not capable of meeting the need in a cost effective manner The president of a technology LLC wrote Training teaching are all going online partly because of high costs of campus education Richard Adler distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future predicted AI voice response telepresence VR and gamification techniques will come together to create powerful new learning environments capable of personalizing and accelerating learning across a broad range of fields Ray Schroeder associate vice chancellor for online learning at the University of Illinois Springfield commented It is projected that those entering the workforce today will pursue four or five different careers not just jobs over their lifetime These career changes will require retooling training and education The adult learners will not be able to visit physical campuses to access this learning they will learn online I expect that we will see the further development of artificially intelligent teaching specialists such as Jill Watson at Georgia Tech the virtual graduate assistant who was thought to be human by an entire class of computer science students I anticipate the further development and distribution of holoportation technologies such as those developed by Microsoft using HoloLens for real time three dimensional augmented reality These teaching tools will enable highly sophisticated interactions and engagement with students at a distance They will further fuel the scaling of learning to reach even more massive online classes Fredric Litto an professor emeritus of communications and longtime distance learning expert from the University of S o Paulo replied There is no field of work that cannot be learned totally or in great part in well organized and administered online programs either in traditional course formats or in self directed independent learning opportunities supplemented when appropriate by face to face hands on practice situations Tawny Schlieski research director at Intel and president of the Oregon Story Board explained New technologies of human computer interaction like augmented and virtual reality offer the possibility of entirely new mechanisms of education Augmented and virtual reality tools make learning more experiential they engage students with physical movement and they enable interactive and responsive instructional assets As these tools evolve over the next decade the academics we work with expect to see radical change in training and workforce development which will roll into although probably against a longer timeline more traditional institutions of higher learning Many respondents said real world campus based higher education will continue to thrive during the next decade They generally expect that no other educational experience can match residential universities capabilities for fully immersive person to person learning as well as mentoring and socializing functions before 2026 They said a residential university education helps build intangible skills that are not replicable online and thus deepens the skills base of those who can afford to pay for such an education but they expect that job specific training will be managed by employers on the job and via novel approaches Some say major universities core online course content developed with all of the new tech bells and whistles will be marketed globally and adopted as baseline learning in smaller higher education locales where online elements from major MOOCs can be optimally paired in hybrid learning with in person mentoring activities The most important skills to have in life are gained through interpersonal experiences and the liberal arts Human bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion empathy vulnerability and social emotional intelligence Frank ElavskyUta Russmann communications marketing sales professor at the FHWien University of Applied Sciences in Vienna Austria said In the future more and more jobs will require highly sophisticated people whose skills cannot be trained in mass online programs Traditional four year and graduate programs will better prepare people for jobs in the future as such an education gives people a general understanding and knowledge about their field and here people learn how to approach new things ask questions and find answers deal with new situations etc all this is needed to adjust to ongoing changes in work life Special skills for a particular job will be learned on the job Frank Elavsky data and policy analyst at Acumen LLC responded The most important skills to have in life are gained through interpersonal experiences and the liberal arts Human bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion empathy vulnerability and social emotional intelligence These skills are imperative to focus on as the future is in danger of losing these skillsets from the workforce Many people have gained these skills throughout history without any kind of formal schooling but with the growing emphasis on virtual and digital mediums of production education and commerce people will have less and less exposure to other humans in person and other human perspectives Isto Huvila professor at Uppsala University replied The difference between educating to perform and educating to make the future is the difference between vocational education and higher university education Spending four years at a university is not only about learning skills but about bildung self cultivation and socialising in a group that is capable of fostering collaboration much better than an ad hoc group of people But this does not mean that alternative means and paths of learning and accreditation would not be useful as complementary to the traditional system that has limitations as well Dana Klisanin psychologist futurist at Evolutionary Guidance Media R D wrote Educational institutions that succeed will use the tools of social media and game design to grant students access to teachers from all over the world and increase their motivation to succeed Online educational programs will influence the credentialing systems of traditional institutions and online institutions will increasingly offer meet ups and mingles such that a true hybrid educational approach emerges Will training for skills most important in the jobs of the future work well in large scale settings by 2026 Respondents in this canvassing overwhelmingly said yes anticipating that improvements in such education would continue However many believe the most vital skills are not easy to teach learn or evaluate in any education or training setting available today Dozens of descriptive terms were applied by respondents as they noted the skills capabilities and attributes they see as important in workers lives in the next decade The skills needed to succeed in today s world and the future are curiosity creativity taking initiative multi disciplinary thinking and empathy These skills interestingly are the skills specific to human beings that machines and robots cannot do Tiffany ShlainWhile coding and other hard skills were listed as being easiest to teach to a large group in an online setting soft human skills were seen by most respondents as crucial for survival in the age of AI and robotics Devin Fidler research director at the Institute for the Future predicted As basic automation and machine learning move toward becoming commodities uniquely human skills will become more valuable There will be an increasing economic incentive to develop mass training that better unlocks this value Susan Price a digital architect at Continuum Analytics commented Increasingly machines will perform tasks they are better suited to perform than humans such as computation data analysis and logic Functions requiring emotional intelligence empathy compassion and creative judgment and discernment will expand and be increasingly valued in our culture Tiffany Shlain filmmaker and founder of the Webby Awards wrote The skills needed to succeed in today s world and the future are curiosity creativity taking initiative multi disciplinary thinking and empathy These skills interestingly are the skills specific to human beings that machines and robots cannot do and you can be taught to strengthen these skills through education I look forward to seeing innovative live and online programs that can teach these at scale Ben Shneiderman professor of computer science at the University of Maryland observed Students can be trained to be more innovative creative and active initiators of novel ideas Skills of writing speaking and making videos are important but fundamental skills of critical thinking community building teamwork deliberation dialogue and conflict resolution will be powerful A mindset of persistence and the necessary passion to succeed are also critical Louisa Heinrich founder at Superhuman Limited commented Lateral and system thinking skills are increasingly critical for success in an ever changing global landscape and these will need to be re prioritised at all levels of education An anonymous technologist commented Programming and problem solving learning how to work with artificial intelligence and robotics will become more important and more and more workers will be replaced by software hardware based workers Automation will reduce the need for the current workforce and the divide between the upper class and the lower class will continue to eat the middle class Some who are pessimistic about the future of human work due to advances in capable AI and robotics mocked the current push in the U S to train more people in technical skills An anonymous respondent commented Teach a billion people to program and you ll end up with 900 000 000 unemployed programmers An anonymous program director for a major U S technology funding organization predicted We will see training for the jobs of the past and for service jobs The jobs of the future will not need large numbers of workers with a fixed set of skills most things that we can train large numbers of workers for we will also be able to train computers to do better Among the many other skills mentioned were process oriented and system oriented thinking journalistic skills including research evaluation of multiple sources writing and speaking understanding algorithms computational thinking networking and programming grasping law and policy an evidence based way of looking at the world time management conflict resolution decision making locating information in the flood of data storytelling using data and influencing and consensus building A few people mentioned that young adults need to be taught how to have face to face interaction including one who said they seem to be sorely lacking in these skills and can only interact with a cellphone or laptop Because so many intricacies of the workplace the human soft and hard are learned on the job respondents said they expect apprenticeships and forms of mentoring will regain value and evolve along with the 21st century workplace D Yvette Wohn assistant professor of information systems at the New Jersey Institute of Technology wrote Formalized apprenticeships that require both technical skills and interpersonal interaction will become more important Ian O Byrne an assistant professor of literacy education at the College of Charleston replied In the future we ll see more opportunities for online personalized learning This will include open online learning experiences e g MOOCs where individuals can lurk and build up capacity or quench interests I also believe that we ll see a rise in the offering of premium or pay content that creates a space where one to one learning and interaction will allow mentors to guide learners while providing critical feedback We will identify opportunities to build a digital version of the apprenticeship learning models that have existed in the past Alternative credentials and digital badges will provide more granular opportunities to document and archive learning over time from traditional and nontraditional learning sources Through evolving technologies e g blockchain this may provide opportunities for learners to document and frame their own learning pathways An instructional designer with 19 years of experience commented The pattern I m seeing is toward individualized learning almost on the level of tutoring or apprenticeship We ve seen again and again that the broader the audience focus the less the course seems to deliver As for what the skills of the future are they ll be specialized to their fields with a university degree assumed to be a certificate in the ability to learn more about a particular subject specialty You may get a degree in computer software development but the truth is that you still need to be taught how to write software for say the mortgage company or insurance company that hires you The key to the future will be flexibility and personal motivation to learn and tinker with new things As they anticipate the appearance of effective new learning environments and advances in digital accountability systems many of these experts believe fresh certification programs will be created to attest to workers participation in training programs and the mastery of skills Some predict that many more workers will begin using online and app based learning systems Charlie Firestone communications and society program executive director and vice president at The Aspen Institute replied There will be a move toward more precise and better credentialing for skills and competencies e g badging and similar techniques Employers will accept these more as they prove probative And online learning will be more prevalent even as an adjunct to formal classroom learning New industries such as green energy and telemedicine will increase new employment opportunities Despite all of these measures the loss of jobs from artificial intelligence and robotics will exceed any retraining program at least in the short run Sam Punnett research officer at TableRock Media wrote I suspect employers will recognize the new credentialing systems Particularly those certificates awarded for studies in emerging disciplines currently data science appears all the rage and those that reflect an upgrade of previously acquired skills Traditional credentials will continue to hold value but I believe they will be considered in light of a candidates perceived ability in learning how to learn The four year degree and subsequent graduate studies will continue to be less of a guaranty towards employment without work experience Certificates are being viewed more favourably and many universities are lagging in their connection between their pedagogies and working world requirements William J Ward a university communications professor DR4WARD commented Higher Education is doing a poor job of preparing students with the skills they need to succeed in the workforce Online and credentialing systems are more transparent and do a better job on delivering skills People with new types of credentialing systems are seen as more qualified than traditional four year and graduate programs Many workplaces place a higher value on real world work portfolios than they do on a degree or certification yet their hiring systems including AI bots programmed to scan resum s still use the commonly accepted credentials as a basis for interviewing candidates Some respondents hope to see change Schools today turn out widget makers who can make widgets all the same They are built on producing single right answers rather than creative solutions Jeff JarvisA software engineering and system administration professional commented The reliability of the traditional educational system is already being questioned in some fields it s considered common sense that certifications and degrees mean little and that a portfolio references and hands on interviews are much more important for assessing a candidate s ability The unfortunate reality is that many HR departments still post job listings saying degrees and certifications are required as a way of screening candidates Both of those cost a lot of money and neither mean a lot for a candidate s competence I hope this will change both job listings and quality of degrees certifications but don t see it happening soon Meryl Krieger career specialist at Indiana University Bloomington s Jacobs School replied Credentialing systems will involve portfolios as much as resum s resum s simply are too two dimensional to properly communicate someone s skillset Three dimensional materials in essence job reels that demonstrate expertise will be the ultimate demonstration of an individual worker s skills I see credentialing as a piece of a very complex set of criteria these will also incorporate an individual s ability to communicate and work with teams huge in employer requests for new employees which can more readily be documented and tracked through online portfolio tools than through traditional resume formats Thus the educational and training programs of the future will become in their best incarnations sophisticated combinations of classroom and hands on training programs The specific models will necessarily be responding to individual industry requirements Jeff Jarvis a professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism wrote Schools today turn out widget makers who can make widgets all the same They are built on producing single right answers rather than creative solutions They are built on an outmoded attention economy Pay us for 45 hours of your attention and we will certify your knowledge I believe that many not all areas of instruction should shift to competency based education in which the outcomes needed are made clear and students are given multiple paths to achieve those outcomes and they are certified not based on tests and grades but instead on portfolios of their work demonstrating their knowledge While the first three themes found among the responses to this canvassing were mostly hopeful about advances in education and training for 21st century jobs a large share of responses from top experts reflect a significant degree of pessimism for various reasons Some even say the future of jobs for humans is so baleful that capitalism may fail as an economic system The next themes and subthemes examine these responses A large share of respondents predicted that online formats for knowledge transfer will not advance significantly in the next decade The 30 who expressed pessimism were often deeply doubtful about the capabilities of current education systems to adapt to pivot to respond to new challenges as quickly as necessary Interestingly being able to adapt and respond to looming challenges was seen by nearly everyone in this canvassing as one of the most highly prized future capabilities these respondents especially agree that it is important and they say that our human institutions government business education are not adapting efficiently and are letting us down Many of them say that current K 12 or K 16 education programs are incapable of making adjustments within the next decade to serve the shifting needs of future jobs markets Among the other reasons listed by people who do not expect these kinds of transformative advances in job creation and job skill upgrading Some among the 70 of respondents who are mostly optimistic about the future of training for jobs also echoed one or more of the points above mentioning these tension points while hoping for the best Following are representative statements tied to these points and more from all respondents Thomas Claburn editor at large at Information Week wrote I m skeptical that educational and training programs can keep pace with technology Traditional models train people to equate what they do with who they are i e what do you want to be when you grow up rather than to acquire critical thinking and flexible skills and attitudes that fit a rapidly changing world Pamela RutledgeAndrew Walls managing vice president at Gartner wrote Barring a neuroscience advance that enables us to embed knowledge and skills directly into brain tissue and muscle formation there will be no quantum leap in our ability to up skill people Learning takes time and practice which means it requires money lots of money to significantly change the skill set of a large cohort B Remy Cross assistant professor of sociology Webster University commented Lacking a significant breakthrough in machine learning that could lead to further breakthroughs in adaptive responses by a fully online system it is too hard to adequately instruct large numbers of people in the kinds of soft skills that are anticipated as being in most demand As manufacturing and many labor intensive jobs move overseas or are fully mechanized we will see a bulge in service jobs These require good people skills something that is often hard to train online John Bell software developer and teacher at Dartmouth College replied Even today access to information is not the limiting factor in skills education for anyone who can go online While there have been generational gains in the developments of online communities a large scale educational experience either MOOC or on demand broadcasts will not be able to duplicate that Stowe Boyd managing director of Another Voice and a well known thinker on work futures discussed the intangibles of preparing humans to partner with AI and bot systems While we may see the creation and rollout of new training programs he observed it s unclear whether they will be able to retrain those displaced from traditional sorts of work to fit into the workforce of the near future Many of the skills that will be needed are more like personality characteristics like curiosity or social skills that require enculturation to take hold Individual training like programming or learning how to cook may not be what will be needed And employers may play less of a role especially as AI and bot augmented independent contracting may be the best path for many rather than a job Homesteading in exurbia may be the answer for many with forty acres and a bot as a political campaign slogan of 2024 Luis Miron a distinguished university professor and director of the Institute for Quality and Equity in Education at Loyola University in New Orleans wrote Bluntly speaking I have little confidence in the educational sector K 16 having the capacity and vision to offer high quality online educational programs capable of transforming the training needs of the wider society The most important skills are advanced critical thinking and knowledge of globalization affecting diverse societies culturally religiously and politically Pamela Rutledge director of the Media Psychology Research Center wrote The core assumptions driving educational content are not adapting as fast as the world is changing Traditional models train people to equate what they do with who they are i e what do you want to be when you grow up rather than to acquire critical thinking and flexible skills and attitudes that fit a rapidly changing world We have traditional institutions invested in learning as a supply side model rather than demand side that would create proactive self directed learners This bias impacts the entire process from educators to employers It is changing but beliefs are sticky and institutions are cumbersome bureaucracies that are slow to adapt New delivery systems for skills related to technology will be more readily accepted than traditional ones because they avoid much of the embedded bias Successful education models will begin developing mixed methods to leverage technology with traditional delivery and rewrite certification processes with practice relevant standards Justin Reich executive director at the MIT Teaching Systems Lab observed There will continue to be for profit actors in the sector and while some may offer choice and opportunity for students many others will be exploitative with a great er focus on extracting federal grants and burdening students with debt than actually educating students and creating new opportunities John Paine a business analyst commented The competing desires 1 to make educational activity available to all and 2 to monetize the bejeezus out of anything related to the internet will limit the effectiveness of any online learning systems in a more widespread context danah boyd founder of Data Society commented I have complete faith in the ability to identify job gaps and develop educational tools to address those gaps I have zero confidence in us having the political will to address the socio economic factors that are underpinning skill training For example companies won t pay for reskilling and we don t have the political power to tax them at the level needed for public investment in reskilling Furthermore we have serious geographic mismatches underlying discriminatory attitudes and limited opportunities for lower to mid level career advancement What s at stake are not simply skills gaps it s about how we want to architect labor benefits and social safety nets And right now we talk about needing to increase skills but that s not what employers care about It just sounds nice When computer science graduates from CUNY and Howard University can t get a job what s at stake is not skills training Among the future worker capabilities with the highest value in these respondents eyes are the ability to adapt or pivot and the motivation to up skill as needed Many respondents emphasized that the most crucial skill is that people have to learn how to learn and be self motivated to keep learning My biggest concern with self directed learning is that it requires a great deal of internal motivation And I am not confident that individuals will find their way David BersteinDavid Bernstein a former research director wrote The most important skills needed to succeed in the workplace will be flexibility and the ability to adapt and continuously learn My biggest concern with self directed learning is that it requires a great deal of internal motivation And I am not confident that individuals will find their way just as those who enter college today don t know what they want to be when they grow up often until after they graduate So everyone will still need some basic skills interpersonal communications basic arithmetic along with some general culture awareness so they can have that flexibility Any 3 year old can use their parent s smartphone or tablet without reading the manual What I worry about is how well they will adapt when they are 35 or 55 Calton Pu professor and junior chair in software at the Georgia Institute of Technology wrote The most important skill is a meta skill the ability to adapt to changes This ability to adapt is what distinguished Homo sapiens from other species through natural selection As the rate of technological innovation intensifies the workforce of the future will need to adapt to new technology and new markets The people who can adapt the best and fastest will win This view means that any given set of skills will become obsolete quickly as innovations change the various economic sectors precision agriculture manufacturing 4 0 precision medicine just to name a few Therefore the challenge is not only to teach skills but also how to adapt and learn new skills Whether the traditional programs or new programs will be better at teaching adaptive learning remains to be seen Cory Salveson learning systems and analytics lead at RSM US responded The nature of work today and in future is such that if people want to keep increasingly scarce well paying jobs they will need to educate themselves in an ongoing manner for their whole lives Some of these experts say those who aren t motivated to continue to learn and grow will be left behind Scott Amyx CEO of Amyx said online training is advancing and will continue to evolve but The education system is at an inflection point Many ambitious federal and state programs have fizzled to produce dismal to no statistical change in the caliber of K 12 education It s those less educated and less skilled who are most sensitive to technological displacement Online mediums and self directed approaches may be limited in effectiveness with certain labor segments unless supplemented by human coaching and support systems Beth Corzo Duchardt a professor at Muhlenberg College replied Self directed study is a variable that changes the alchemy of teaching and learning It is true that most online courses require self direction Indeed when I advise students I don t recommend that students take online courses unless they have demonstrated an aptitude for self direction But in person courses may also be self directed This works well for some students but not others Students who are self directed often have had a very good foundational education and supportive parents They have been taught to think critically and they know that the most important thing you can learn is how to learn And they are also are more likely to come from economic privilege So not only does the self direction factor pose a problem for teaching at scale the fact that a high degree of self direction may be required for successful completion of coursework towards the new workforce means that existing structures of inequality will be replicated in the future if we rely on these large scale programs Among the 30 of respondents who said they did not think things would turn out well in the future were those who said the trajectory of technology will overwhelm labor markets killing more jobs than it creates They foresee a society where AI programs and machines do most of the work and raise questions about people s sense of identity the socio economic divisions that already distress them their ability to pay for basic needs their ability to use the growing amount of leisure time constructively and the impact of all of this on economic systems It should also be noted that many among the 70 who expect positive change in the next decade also expressed some of these concerns The problem of future jobs is not one of skills training it is one of diminishing jobs How will we cope with a workforce that is simply irrelevant Jennifer ZickermanCory Doctorow activist in residence at MIT Media Lab and co owner of Boing Boing boingboing net responded It s an article of faith that automation begets more jobs than it displaces in the long run but this is a theory free observation based on previous automation booms The current automation is based on general purpose technologies machine learning Turing complete computers a universal network architecture that is equally optimized for all applications and there s good reason to believe that this will be more disruptive and create fewer new jobs than those that came before Glenn Ricart Internet Hall of Fame member and founder and chief technology officer of US Ignite said Up to the present time automation largely has been replacing physical drudgery and repetitive motion things that can and should improve the quality of people s work lives But in the next decade or two there is likely to be a significant amount of technological innovation in machine intelligence and personal assistants that takes a real swipe out of the jobs we want humans to have in education health care transportation agriculture and public safety What are the new jobs we want these people to have If we haven t been able to invent them in response to international trade pacts why are we sure we will be able to create them in the future Richard Stallman Internet Hall of Fame member and president of the Free Software Foundation commented I think this question has no answer I think there won t be jobs for most people a few decades from now and that s what really matters As for the skills for the employed fraction of advanced countries I think they will be difficult to teach You could get better at them by practice but you couldn t study them much Jennifer Zickerman an entrepreneur commented The problem of future jobs is not one of skills training it is one of diminishing jobs How will we cope with a workforce that is simply irrelevant The question isn t how to train people for nonexistent jobs it s how to share the wealth in a world where we don t need most people to work Nathaniel BorensteinNathaniel Borenstein chief scientist at Mimecast replied I challenge the premise of this question that humans will have to be trained for future jobs The jobs of the future are likely to be performed by robots The question isn t how to train people for nonexistent jobs it s how to share the wealth in a world where we don t need most people to work Paul Davis a director based in Australia predicted Whilst such programs will be developed and rolled out on a large scale I question their overall effectiveness Algorithms automation and robotics will result in capital no longer needing labor to progress the economic agenda Labor becomes in many ways surplus to economic requirements This shift will dramatically transform the notion of economic growth and significantly disrupt social contracts labor s bargaining position will be dramatically weakened The nature of this change may require the world to shift to a Post Economic Growth model to avoid societal dislocation and disruption John Sniadowski a systems architect replied The skill sets which could have been taught will be superseded by AI and other robotic technology By the time the training programs are widely available the required skills will no longer be required The whole emphasis of training must now be directed towards personal life skills development rather than the traditional working career based approach There is also the massive sociological economic impact of general automation and AI that must be addressed to redistribute wealth and focus life skills at lifelong learning Tom Sommerville agile coach wrote Our greatest economic challenges over the next decade will be climate change and the wholesale loss of most jobs to automation We urgently need to explore how to distribute the increasing wealth of complex goods and services our civilization produces to a populace that will be increasingly jobless in the traditional sense The current trend of concentrating wealth in the hands of a diminishing number of ultra rich individuals is unsustainable All of this while dealing with the destabilizing effects of climate change and the adaptations necessary to mitigate its worst impacts Some of these experts projected further out into the future imagining a world where the machines themselves learn and overtake core human emotional and cognitive capacities Timothy C Mack managing principal at AAI Foresight said In the area of skill building the wild card is the degree to which machine learning begins to supplant social creative and emotive skill sets This section features responses by several more of the many top analysts who participated in this canvassing Following this wide ranging set of comments on the topic a much more expansive set of quotations directly tied to the set of four themes begins on Page 40 Baratunde Thurston a director s fellow at MIT Media Lab Fast Company columnist and former digital director of The Onion replied Online training and certification will grow significantly in part due to the high expense of formal higher education along with its declining payoffs for certain occupations Why go 100 000 in debt for a four year university when you can take a more targeted course with more guaranteed income generation potential at the end From the employer perspective this type of learning will only grow We are creating a system of on demand labor akin to cloud based labor where companies provision labor resources at will and release them at will not by the year or month but by the job labor unit or small time unit including minutes The automation of human labor will grow significantly And having a workforce trained in discrete and atomizable bits of skills will be seen as a benefit by employers This of course is a terrible soulless insecure life for the workers but since when did that really change anything There will also be a parallel call for benefits professional development and compensation that smooths out the rough patches in this on demand labor life but such efforts will lag behind the exploitation of said labor because big business has more resources and big tech moves too fast for human scale responses of accountability and responsibility To quote Donald Trump Sad Doc Searls journalist speaker and director of Project VRM at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society wrote I don t expect the evolution of work in the connected world to require new educational and training programs Instead I expect we ll see much more adaptive forms of education especially of the self made kind Look at Linux and open source development The world runs on both now and they employ millions of human beings Many or most of the new open source programmers building and running our world today are self taught or teach each other to a higher degree than they are educated by formal schooling Look at Khan Academy and the home schooling movement both of which in many ways outperform formal institutional education The main qualification for programming work isn t a degree It s proven capability This model for employment of self and others will also spread to other professions By the way I don t like the term job It demeans work and reduces the worker to a position in an org chart The great educator John Taylor Gatto who won many awards for his teaching and rarely obeyed curricular requirements says nearly all attempts to reform education make it worse We are by nature learning animals We are each also very different both from each other and from who we were yesterday As a society we need to take advantage of that and nurture our natural hunger for knowledge and productive work while respecting and encouraging our diversity a fundamental balancing feature of all nature human and otherwise Jeff Jarvis professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism wrote At a roundtable on the future convened by Union Square Ventures a few years ago I heard this economic goal presented We need to see the marginal cost of teaching another student fall to zero to see true innovation come to education allowing change to occur outside the tax based and thus safe confines of public education I don t think we ll ever reach zero MOOCs are not the solution But we will likely see a radical economic disruption in education using new tools and means to learn and certify learning and that is the way by which we will manage to train many more people in many new skills Cory Doctorow activist in residence at MIT Media Lab and co owner of Boing Boing boingboing net responded There is for the immediate and medium term a huge shortage of IT talent of course especially security researchers and professionals In part this is driven by the legal and educational framework that takes a zero tolerance approach to the hacking that kids historically engaged in on their way to becoming security researchers If a kid today hacks her school s censoring firewall to look at a blocked site she is expelled and possibly arrested not streamed into an Advanced Placement computer science class We also have a poorly constituted math curriculum for understanding algorithms which is really understanding the statistics of machine learning models An earlier and more enduring focus on stats and statistical literacy which can readily be taught using current affairs for example analyzing the poll numbers from elections the claims made by climate change scientists or even the excellent oral arguments in the Supreme Court Texas abortion law case would impart skills that transferred well into IT programming and especially security Amy Webb futurist and CEO at the Future Today Institute commented Gill Pratt a former program manager of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA recently warned of a Cambrian Explosion of robotics About 500 000 years ago Earth experienced its first Cambrian Explosion a period of rapid cellular evolution and diversification that resulted in the foundation of life as we know it today We are clearly in the dawn of a new age one that is marked not just by advanced machines but rather machines that are starting to learn how to think Soon those machines that can think will augment humankind helping to unlock our creative and industrial potential Some of the workforce will find itself displaced by automation That includes anyone whose primary job functions are transactional bank tellers drivers mortgage brokers However there are many fields that will begin to work alongside smart machines doctors journalists teachers The most important skill of any future worker will be adaptability This current Cambrian Explosion of machines will mean diversification in our systems our interfaces our code Workers who have the temperament and fortitude to quickly learn new menu screens who can find information quickly and the like will fare well I do not see the wide scale emergence of training programs during the next 10 years due to the emergence of smart machines alone If there are unanticipated external events environmental disasters new pandemics and the like that could devastate a country s economy and significantly impact its workforce which might catalyze the development of online learning opportunities Mike Roberts Internet Hall of Fame member and first president and CEO of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN responded MOOCs and related efforts are in their infancy so yes there will be considerable expansion as more is learned about what works and what doesn t work These developments are contributing to a crisis of self confidence in higher ed where traditional scholarship is being challenged on many fronts including the basic definition of education Human brains are complex and it becomes tiresome to see simplistic approaches to education issues Generally an educated person possesses a level of knowledge about the world that allows him or her to use analytical skills induction deduction probability etc to arrive at conclusions that guide behavior The jury is very much out on the extent to which acquisition of knowledge and reasoning skills requires human interaction We now have empirical evidence that a substantial percentage half or more can be gained through self study using computer assisted techniques The path forward for society as a whole is strewn with obstacles of self interest ignorance flawed economics etc If one believes in the singularity it doesn t matter because human machine symbiosis will bury the problem Judith Donath of Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society replied A lot has been written about the need for STEM science technology engineering and mathematics education Here I want to focus on other areas 1 Teaching and Healing As computers robots and other machines take over many jobs we need to reposition the social status of jobs that involve interpersonal care day care teachers nurse elderly coach The issue is not just training but cultural re evaluation of teaching and healing as highly respected skills While technology can assist with this work we mustn t lose sight of the importance of human connections as an end in and of themselves 2 Craft and Repair For the benefit of both the individual and the environment we need to strongly support learning design craft building repair Few of us make anything we use from the building we live in to the objects we own and these things are mostly manufactured as cheaply as possible to be easily bought discarded and bought again in a process of relentless acquisition that often brings little happiness Education here should be integrated into everyday life not just for when one is in school E g much rental housing is in bad repair with tenants waiting weeks months years for even simple fixes a running toilet broken lights a hole in a wall Very easily accessible learning for how to fix these things themselves and making it economically rewarding in the case of a common good is a simple basic example of the kind of ubiquitous craft learning that at scale would be enormously valuable Some of this can be taught online a key component is also online coordination 3 An Informed Citizen What should people know what skills should they have to be informed participants in a democracy Certainly science and technology are important but we need to refocus liberal education not ignore it History in all its complexity Critical thinking how to debate how to recognize persuasive techniques how to understand multiple perspectives how to mediate between different viewpoints Key skill how to research how to evaluate what you see and read David Weinberger a senior researcher at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society said Judging from what we re seeing happening now on the web it seems likely that many of the innovative platforms will be peer to peer Sites like Stack Overflow for software engineers demonstrate a new moral sense that learning in private is selfish Public learning is becoming the norm Brad Templeton chair for computing at Singularity University wrote We will see the start of these technologies but they will not be widespread at the hard problem of adult retraining in 10 years Instead most focus will be on childhood education for the poorer sectors of the world The most important skill flexibility won t be taught easily this way but must become a focus of K 12 education John Markoff former senior writer at The New York Times said We have now passed through the first generation of MOOCs and a new generation of online learning technology is beginning to emerge Udacity is a good example of the trajectory Sebastian Thrun was one of the inventors of the MOOC concept After starting a company to pursue the idea he pivoted focusing specifically on skill oriented education that is coupled directly to the job market Vint Cerf vice president and chief internet evangelist at Google and an Internet Hall of Fame member noted The internet can support remote training and learning These need not be MOOCs Even mobiles can be sources of education I hope we will see more opportunities arising for sharing this kind of knowledge Marcel Bullinga trend watcher and keynote speaker futurecheck replied The future is cheap and so is the future of education I saw an ad already for 1 000 bachelor s level training with an app of course Schools and universities will transform in the same way as shops have done in the past 10 years from analog human first to digital mobile AI first New online credential systems will first complement then gradually replace the old ones The skills of the future Those are the skills a robot cannot master yet Leadership design human meta communication critical thinking motivating cooperating innovating In my black and white moments I say Skip all knowledge training in high schools Main teaching goal We enable you to survive in an ever changing world with ever changing skills and not yet existing jobs of the future We make you better than a robot We let you cooperate with robots We build your self trust We turn you into a decent polite social person And most importantly we do not mix education with religion never Anil Dash entrepreneur technologist and advocate AnilDash predicted These credentials will start to become widespread but acceptance and quality of the training programs will map to the existing systemic biases that inform current educational and career programs Henning Schulzrinne Internet Hall of Fame member and professor at Columbia University wrote Training programs have had the problem that short duration generic programs are often not very effective except as a way to incrementally add very specific skills learn how to operate the new industry specific tool X in a week to the existing repertoire The subject matter specific part of a B S degree in a technical or scientific field takes at least two years often more and these are high intensity full time years often without other responsibilities such as family mostly for students at an age where learning is still natural and easy A large part of this time is spent not in a classroom but becoming fluent through monitored practice including group work internships and other high intensity high interaction apprentice like programs It is hard to see how workers can afford to spend two years without income support while still fulfilling their adult responsibilities such as taking care of their family or elderly parents There are possibilities for adding limited skill sets to otherwise qualified workers e g the ability to program in Python for somebody who already has an economics degree increasing their ability to get their work done The MOOC style programs have shown themselves to be most effective for this delta learning for practicing professionals not turning a high school graduate into somebody who can compete with a college graduate Jamais Cascio distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future responded We will certainly see attempts to devise training and education to match workers to new jobs but for the most part they re likely to fall victim to two related problems 1 The difficulty of projecting what will be the jobs of the future in a world where the targets keep shifting faster and faster Jobs that seem viable may fall victim to a surprising development in automation see for example filmmaking new categories of work may not last long enough to support large numbers of employees 2 We re in an era of general purpose computing which means that our systems are not physically or procedurally limited to a narrow type of work Automation and semi automation e g self checkout stands don t need to completely eliminate a job to make it unable to support large numbers of workers As learning systems improve we will soon if we re not already be at a point where adaptive algorithms can learn new jobs faster than humans Kate Crawford a well known internet researcher studying how people engage with networked technologies wrote We clearly need new educational and training programs to address the deepening precarity of the labor market But to make it successful in that the right training could be developed to make it possible that everyone will have jobs is very unlikely Paul Jones clinical professor and director at the University of North Carolina replied We learn more today by training and information sipping than in the past Training is useful but not the end of education only a kind of education As for sipping you need not know the name of every bear to know you should avoid bears Yet the continual construction of knowledge and cultures requires more from us So far training formally as in Kahn Academy and Lynda com are unarguably effective for continual updates for basic skills No programmer or developer could keep up without the informal training of Stack Overflow Wikipedia hasn t destroyed bar trivia but it has made a dent in our conversational expertise Who played guitar lead on All or Nothing No need for debate A little information sip will let us know We re fine and informed but not educated or learned But what is left out Collaborative construction of knowledge in new areas deeper investigation into known areas and the discovery of entirely new areas of knowledge This is our challenge how to create wisdom from knowledge not just jobs from training and information Bob Frankston internet pioneer and software innovator commented This is a nuanced question We trained generations of people to be phone operators by making it easy to operate the phone aka dialing Today programming is increasingly become a trade The problem with many websites is not so much the training of the programmers as much as getting managers and C level people who understand the new concepts of a world being redefined by software And that s even more true for policymakers We need to think about co evolving work and workers And as always critical thinking will remain the biggest challenge Frank Pasquale author of The Black Box Society The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information and professor of law at the University of Maryland said The biggest danger for the United States educational system is premature vocationalism Rigorous science and humanities courses help students learn how to learn Skills training all too often does not Of course it can complement core academic courses and is likely to be part of a lifetime of learning for those switching occupations But turning high school and college into narrow vocational education programs would make their graduates more vulnerable to robotic replacement not less We need to invest in higher education shoring up support for traditional universities and colleges lest they eventually become bastions for reproduction of an elite leaving the rest of society to untested experiments or online programs Online learning is a good complement for existing colleges but cannot replace them Online only programs emphasize the upside of high tech approaches but rarely grapple with the downside Big data surveillance will track the work students do ostensibly in order to customize learning Get stuck on a lesson Just keep interfacing with a keyboard camera and perhaps haptic sensors Or perhaps IM some reserve army of tutorial labor via digital labor platforms like Mechanical Turk or TaskRabbit Want to prove you aren t faking exams Just let cameras record your every move and keystroke perhaps your eye movements and facial expressions too With new platforms Silicon Valley has lured some universities into giving away lectures for free The colleges think they re establishing good karma with the public but disrupters hope for a more chaotic endgame students deciding to watch free courses then proving their credentials to certifiers who give out badges to signify competence in a skill set The certifiers most likely won t be burdened with any of the teaching research community service counseling career or otherwise recreation social events extracurriculars or other long standing features of residential university communities They will just verify that student X can do task Y It could be a very profitable business If students pay less for actual instruction by experts they have more money to spend on badges This is the for profit model shift money away from instruction and amenities and toward administrator salaries and marketing Unburdened by legacy staff and faculty ed tech firms could muster a just in time workforce to develop new educational technologies Investors could continue unbundling the university into least cost providers of content units student surveillance and badge granting That vision may draw capital but it probably won t be attractive to many students There are serious worries about rapid centralization and reuse of student data by under regulated firms For instance black boxed instructional technology is often run by algorithms that can t be accessed by the students it is assessing Tom Ryan CEO of eLearn Institute Inc responded The degree and perhaps the prestige of the institution gets you the first interview but it is your ability to do good work that keeps the job and move s you to the next level How individuals develop the skills will be less important than having the skills As mastery learning evolves so will our performance based assessment systems providing universities and businesses a greater set of evidence and qualifications then is currently available Our traditional educational systems are burdened by legacy bureaucratic practices that don t contribute to mastery of learning and distract from great teaching and learning People in rural areas don t have physical access to a higher education campus or highly skilled trainers Current job responsibilities don t allow flexible work schedules to seek skills to improve their position K 12 teachers are constantly pulled from class time with students for professional development or during class are required to take attendance complete grade assessments fill out grade checks practice fire drills all degrading quality teaching time If online systems just removed these barriers they would be a great benefit but there is so much more these systems can offer Many of the new skills necessary for jobs of the future require digital skills to be successful Too often education leaders and politicians make unilateral decisions about the interaction between teacher and learner instead of building and maintaining an environment for great teaching and learning to take place Large school systems can t scale major improvements in current systems without leveraging the tools that society and industry are using to transform their practice Barry Chudakov founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp replied One serious drawback to fast tracking needed educational and training programs the people who are creating the jobs of the future have so little time to reflect and gain perspective on the people they will need and how adding these people to their corporate culture changes that culture These entrepreneurs are so busy building technology infrastructures filing patents testing beta incarnations of ideas and processes not to mention navigating the thicket of regulations and restrictions that surround many emerging technologies and industries that they simply don t have time to look around and see the implications of the changes their companies are creating In the near future we will explode the notion of education as a rite of passage for youth happening within the walls of an institution Educational institutions will not disappear but they will change in ways that make them almost unrecognizable by today s models Just as Pokemon Go lifts people out of their chairs into real world environments to explore imaginary captures we will change learning from a passive to an active dynamic experience Three dynamics that will affect all learning and retraining efforts 1 Newer tools are changing our sense of identity 2 We are moving from the fixed point of view that the book gave us to a multiple simultaneous narrative of flow in a networked environment 3 Again since what we think is what we think through we are applying that logic of visual presentation to our presentation and sense of self The first skill needed to succeed in the workforce of the future will be the ability to understand manage and manipulate data Everyone in a technology based profession will need to be a quant quantitative analyst or keep up with the quants Because all human processes and activities can now be quantified and there is considerable exploration and technology development in the application of quantification to everything from our sleep patterns and shopping habits to our emotions and online behaviors many new and important business models are emerging from quantification and the learning algorithms that drive it The second and much more important skill needed to succeed in the workforce of the future will be the ability to find meaning and value in data combined with the problem condition or opportunity the data is outlining Said simply the greatest skill will be the ability to think through the cloud of facts data experience and strategic direction that products and services require Design thinking or visual thinking will be a critical part of managing a data driven world Data mining and management can be taught effectively Thinking problem solving reflection and visioning are difficult to teach at scale Elisabeth Gee professor at Arizona State University and author of What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy commented First many jobs of the future won t require workers with a lot of training Second degrees and credentials have been increasingly promoted by institutions more driven by profit than an interest in preparing students in any meaningful way for employment If the government doesn t step in to restrict such institutions we ll continue to see students graduate with huge debt and little prospect of decent employment Lastly we don t need large scale training of workers we need real education not job focused and opportunities for people to pursue diverse pathways for career development and lifelong learning Patrick Tucker technology editor at Defense One and author of The Naked Future observed Online education offers the opportunity to gather data on student performance continuously or telemetrically What telemetric education offers is the opportunity to continuously and constantly evaluate a student to gain a much more comprehensive understanding of ability retention of information even how other behaviors and factors such as time of day other calendar items nutrition amount of time on Pokemon Go influence learning It offers a more true moving score Learning will become easier and much more of it will happen outside of school settings all of which will diminish the importance of schools and teachers as we know them today But platforms like Coursera can amplify the talents of gifted and effective instructors and reduce the cost of education in the coming decade for all Some schools and colleges will thrive and prosper at a level not seen in their history But they will do so only by transitioning away from today s classroom model toward something else like data driven skills workshops at the high school level and startup incubators or problem solving workshops at the college level We may be conflicted about replacing classes with platforms but if we are to be honest with ourselves we know that we can t prepare coming generations for the challenges of a technological and globalized economy the same way we prepared previous generations to be factory workers The greatest thinker of the 21st century whoever he or she is will understand more about how she thinks and learns than any student in any previous generation and all before ever stepping foot inside a schoolhouse Imagine for a moment the power of knowing beforehand how well you would perform on a test Laura Matzen of Sandia National Laboratory and some of her colleagues have demonstrated that the brain s electrical activity detectable via electroencephalogram EEG predicts how well studied material has been incorporated into memory and thus how well a subject will perform on memory tests Telemetric education also offers the opportunity for everyone to raise his or her hand and be heard That opportunity doesn t come easily in a crowded classroom especially not for women or minority students many of whom feel that if they ask the wrong question or display ignorance they ll confirm some unflattering broadly held perception about their social group David Golumbia associate professor of digital studies at Virginia Commonwealth University commented As an educator I am completely unconvinced by the current rhetoric that says our educational system is unable to meet the needs of current or future workforces This whole argument is a sham meant to attack the fundamental purpose and basis of education Most empirical evidence shows that the premises of this question are incorrect most high skilled jobs of the sort implied here have an oversupply of qualified talent We need more of an emphasis on the fundamental purpose of education not on skills Stephen Downes researcher at the National Research Council of Canada commented We will see educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers because for the most part mechanisms will be in place that enable them to train themselves Within 10 years we should be beginning to see that the idea of providing training education or training is misguided because it s overly expensive and less effective than self managed learning I find it interesting even that the question itself presumes that skills must be taught Which of these skills can be taught effectively via online systems It s not that the skills are taught per se but rather that the skills are learned A wide range of activities may enable skills to be learned especially multidisciplinary skills such as critical thinking or social interaction without specifically teaching those skills There are very few skills that require specific and personal instruction from an expert to learn frankly I can t think of any which means that within 10 years we should at least be able to countenance the possibility that all or nearly all educational programs may be automated Of course they will continue to require the time and participation of the individual learner and in many cases social interaction with other learners but the labor intensive learning industry we have developed to this point will not be required I see no major objections to this argument 1 It may be argued that personal interaction is required in order to get to know a student and therefore anticipate what they need However in 10 years it will be arguable and probably demonstrable that your own computer networks will know you better than any individual instructor could even an instructor who worked with you your entire life Sure there are disasters like the Facebook news stream but people are already amazed at how much Google knows about them And we know that with enough data analytics can outperform humans even in complex tasks 2 It may be argued that personal interaction is required in order to evaluate a student s level of achievement Most actual assessment not to be confused with multiple choice tests in school or professional programs is based on expert recognition The submitted behavior an essay performance in surgery piloting an aircraft in a simulation is not assessed according to whether a set of indicators is achieved this would possibly be a necessary but never a sufficient condition The expert looks at the overall behavior and assesses whether that competency has been met The expert is serving as a proxy for the community at large With modern communications technology this proxy is no longer required Through the course of any given day as a person goes through various activities they interact with dozens of other people either in person or through online interaction Each person responds to them in some way not by testing them but by for example engaging them in conversation asking questions following advice etc These responses over time form a comprehensive and constantly changing assessment of the person An anonymous postdoctoral fellow at Rice University s Humanities Research Center observed So much has been said and challenged over the past three decades about online education I d like to answer this by asking a different set of questions which address recent developments in robotics and artificial intelligence How will autonomous factories in Chicago U S share what they ve learned with factories in Pingdingshan China What credentialing system will self driving cars require How will artificially intelligent laborers learn the skills needed to run a household business government institution or political organization When will universities allow artilect nonhuman artificial intelligence students to enroll in their traditional undergraduate and graduate degree programs and how would students learn the more ephemeral skills like critical thinking from a thinking machine

about the transition to adulthood How have changes in the availability of stable jobs affected the likelihood that the children of working class parents will become middle class In many households

prevent long term disadvantage Several years after the official end of the Great Recession the U S still faces high levels of long term unemployment These workers face significant disadvantages from loss of earnings to the deterioration of skills high rates of poverty increased likelihood of divorce and deterioration of physical and mental health And the longer they remain unemployed the more

to support labour marketsJobs matter For almost all of us they are more than a source of income They provide opportunities for social interaction a source of self esteem or a feeling of purpose through making a contribution to a profession or community And the skills embedded in jobs are one of the principal drivers of increased productivity Effective labour markets do not stand still Occupations skills and jobs come and they go More than a century ago lamplighters icemen and telegraph operators fell into decline In the middle of the last century dunny men and bread delivery vans became a less familiar sight on our streets Towards the end of the century switchboard operators typists and TV repairmen became rarer and rarer Travel agents bank tellers and supermarket cashiers still exist as occupations but opportunities in these occupations are diminishing The falling cost of technology relative to wages was in part responsible for these shifts while for others new services simply superseded old ways of delivery No matter how transformative the telephone electricity indoor plumbing refrigeration or personal computing have been and in productivity terms all have been more transformative than the digital revolution so far no technology nor aggregation of them has succeeded in removing people s capacity and desire to work In fact history has shown that over the long run technology has been a friend to many employees removing jobs that are often unpleasant physically tiring dangerous or tedious Overall employment persistently grew despite these fundamental technology changes as did wage rates Critical to this adaptation were the skills delivered by the education and training system Moreover new technology and changing consumer preferences drove demand for new skills and jobs While the speed and magnitude of future change is contested even the most conservative estimates suggest that collectively automation the ageing of the population deferred retirement and the continued growth of the services sector will mean that the type of jobs and people s lifetime experiences in the labour market will change significantly in the coming decades Supporting Paper 8 SP 8 It would be possible to resist technology with rigid rules but productivity growth would be lacklustre and job outcomes would likely be no better Governments play a critical role in avoiding this scenario by creating a good quality and adaptive education and training system and the policy framework that allow labour markets to function well figure 3 1 That is it is essential to have policy settings that An objective assessment of Australia s labour market suggests that it is reasonably adaptable by international standards OECD 2016a 2017a But there are still prosperity enhancing reforms that could be made in the labour market The focus of this chapter is on skills formation because technology adoption use and diffusion the long run drivers of productivity require people with the right skills As an illustration the low cost of sensors computing power fast broadband the internet and the capabilities created through data analytics have made data a new major business resource General Electric once made washing machines Increasingly it has moved towards service provision using data to improve the efficiency of high cost machinery from jet engines to power generators Likewise mining once a classic employer of blue collar workers now requires white collar employees with the ability to interact with remotely managed or computer directed equipment These new business models require people with skills and an understanding of the IT systems in use There is additional value in improving skills formation from foundational to advanced because it gives people better job security income and job satisfaction These effects are not well measured in the official statistics but have major implications for prosperity and quality of life more broadly But the current skills system has fractures that put at risk its capacity to deal with the future labour market changes There are deteriorating results among school students The VET system is in a mess and is struggling to deliver relevant competency based qualifications sought by industry Leading segments of the university sector are more focused on producing research than improving student outcomes through higher quality teaching A fundamental quandary for some parts of the system as in primary school education is that failure to act early has consequences for people s job and lifetime outcomes that may only emerge many years later but are at that point largely irreversible This requires clear directional reforms with a long term focus Consequently governments need to act now and test the likely long run quality of outcomes from education by assessing peoples acquisition of academic and other skills while they are still in the system hence the relevance of PISA scores discussed below The system is poor at sharing data and using it to focus on improvements Only with an active commitment to improved data sharing can evaluation be properly used to refine policies based on evidence A focus on skills for future work does not mean that the other elements of a well functioning labour market are not important or do not need policy attention On the contrary the Commission has examined many of these aspects in recent years box 3 1 And there are still many reforms unaddressed that could shift the dial in productivity While this report focuses on the medium term governments should not forget areas of the labour market that could be improved with near immediate effect In particular the Commission Much of this research and the recommended reforms remain relevant to policies aimed at improving the functioning of the labour market In addition reforms in other parts of the economy can have positive impacts on the labour market Reforms to improve the functioning of cities such as better transport infrastructure and improved access to housing chapter 4 would also improve labour mobility within cities and the functioning of the labour market more generally Better population health raises labour force participation and productivity chapter 2 Indeed health care is an important complement to skills formation especially given the rising rates of debilitating chronic illnesses For many future jobs new skills and knowledge will be needed as part of the core competencies While some persist in characterising it as a curriculum based problem the emphasis being on increasing the number of students studying science technology engineering and maths STEM at a fundamental level all workers will need the skills to interact with digital technology regardless of whether they study physics to year 12 or not A range of soft skills such as communication empathy creativity and adaptability complement other harder skills and are useful to navigate changes in job requirements In short while an innovative economy requires the development and use of skills in many disciplines and at a variety of levels there is no skills related silver bullet In that context Australia needs a skills formation system that ensures people are work ready for the jobs on offer and that the education and training system not only develops the required skills efficiently and cost effectively but has a system of qualifications that are meaningful to employers when people seek work Everyone accepts that education and training in the early years of life is a vital part of that system box 3 2 But increasingly so too is a serious commitment to ongoing education and training including work based training in a labour market that is likely to increasingly involve major changes in tasks and occupations and sometimes even abrupt career shifts The focus of this chapter is on education and training starting from primary school and continuing through life But fundamental to learning during these stages is the experience of very young children Children are learning and developing from birth and before and the nature of interactions between a child the adults around them the environment and experiences to which the child is exposed all contribute to the child s early learning foundations This makes early childhood a period of both opportunity for enrichment and vulnerability to harm Family characteristics and environment are the strongest predictors of a child s development and outcomes later in life Research has highlighted the importance of the quality of the interactions between the child and their parents and others and how this provides the sensory stimulation affecting early brain development and later cognitive and social outcomes Formal educational programs prior to starting school can play a role in child development and education There are positive development outcomes for all children from about 3 years and above from taking part in quality preschool and ECEC programs There is evidence of immediate socialisation benefits for children increased likelihood of a successful transition into formal schooling and improved performance in standardised test results in the early years of primary school as a result of participation in preschool programs The benefits are even greater for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and can persist into adulthood The impact of ECEC on younger children is mixed However children from homes where the quality of care and the learning environment is below that available in ECEC are most likely to benefit from ECEC participation Source PC 2014b As the system designer and primary funder and supplier of formal education governments have to change what they do To achieve a better functioning education and training system geared to long run productivity improvement and manageable transitions in the nature of work governments need to The key premise running through these reforms is that skills formation is one of the central pillars for productivity improvement even if its benefits are not immediately realised While observations about the current state of the education system and outcomes are made in this chapter the aim is to look into the future taking account of emerging trends and consider what policies and decisions should be taken now to set Australia on a path to higher participation and incomes and improved prosperity and wellbeing A good school system ensures that people have the key foundational skills numeracy literacy analytical skills and the capacity to learn so that they can easily acquire knowledge throughout their lives And soft skills such as teamwork collaboration leadership and creativity are equally essential to adaptability and retention of employment In some critical areas there are signs that Australia s school system is not functioning well The above trends are worrying on a number of grounds First Australia s sustained decline in academic achievement as reported by the PISA results represents considerable lost opportunities for individuals in terms of their overall wellbeing as well as lost economic prosperity for society Second while Australia s performance in international studies have either stagnated or decreased high performing countries Singapore is an example close to home continued to improve despite their already elevated standing Third the declining or stagnating results have occurred during a time of considerable policy focus on schooling including funding increases These efforts have focused on changes to schools shares in funding as well as the quantum reviewing curriculums attempting to raise year 11 and 12 retention rates testing academic proficiency and an emphasis on STEM These input focused policy measures while desirable appear to be insufficient in achieving the overall objective strong foundational skills for all Raising student performance depends on the capabilities and practices of teachers and principals engagement with parents and the community the way schools run and the curriculum they use Thousands of educational researchers globally have looked at how to get good outcomes in schools and there have been over 40 Australian reviews on teacher education alone in the past decade including one undertaken by the Commission Common themes have emerged including the importance of workforce quality and proven teaching approaches Engaging with parents and the community altering school curriculum and ensuring targeting of funding are important complementary initiatives To improve student outcomes the policy consensus favours direct measures to address the effectiveness of the teaching occurring in schools see education evidence based below the quality of the school workforce and the quality of teacher education And for good reason as there are strong links between the ability and aptitude of individuals entering the teaching profession the quality of their training and their eventual teaching effectiveness Despite this there is evidence that literacy and numeracy levels of the pipeline of new school teachers have declined Unlike high performing countries Australia is not selecting the next generation of teachers from high performing school leavers Countries with high academic outcomes have tended to pursue deliberate policies to attract the most able people into teaching including offering salaries and working conditions that enable teaching to compete with other professions A related concern is that many teachers are teaching out of field that is they are barely if at all qualified in the disciplines they are teaching For example in information technology about 30 per cent of year 7 to 10 teachers have neither studied the subject at second year tertiary level or above nor been trained in teaching methodology for that subject at the tertiary level Teaching out of field not only affects students but anecdotal evidence suggests that it also contributes to teacher attrition Addressing the high levels of teaching out of field will require special recruitment efforts and targeted high quality professional development for existing teachers willing to acquire the knowledge and teaching skills in the relevant disciplines In the 2016 17 Budget the Australian Government announced a range of measures to improve teacher quality and teacher effectiveness which are consistent with the Commission s recommendations in the Schools Workforce study These include In May 2017 the Australian Government established the Review to Achieve Educational Excellence in Australian Schools to provide advice on how extra Commonwealth funding provided in the 2017 18 Budget should be invested to improve outcomes Some State Governments have also introduced measures to improve teacher quality and effectiveness including introducing minimum entry requirements for teacher training Anderson 2016 NSEA 2017 However measures that deal with the flow will only slowly address deficiencies in the stock Nevertheless the measurable performance indicators are alarming in a productivity as well as a personal welfare context Accordingly it is critical that efforts by governments to improve teacher quality continue to be monitored and rigorously assessed for outcomes given the accepted wisdom is that the quality of teachers is what sets high performing systems apart Progress on translating that wisdom into tangible outcomes could be assessed in the next five years possibly in the next Productivity Review Understanding what works best and for whom requires micro performance data that look into the classroom particularly at teaching practices to provide insights and evaluations into how to improve education outcomes across schools and students SP 3 discusses the benefits of comparative performance indicators All Australian governments and a large number of organisations invest considerable effort in collecting data and disseminating educational evidence Most of these data are collected for monitoring benchmarking and assessing performance in achieving objectives at the system level as well as promoting transparency and accountability and informing resource allocation top down But relatively few collections are for the purpose of evaluation such as identifying ways of improving student achievement bottom up Not only are there gaps in the evidence of the evaluation of policies programs and education practices greater understanding is needed on how to turn best practice into common practice on the ground Understanding how to successfully implement best practice is as important as evaluating what works best PC 2016g Without improving and applying evidence to policy making and teaching in schools and classrooms there is a substantial risk that increased resourcing of schools will continue to deliver disappointing outcomes Even small improvements in outcomes for all students from applying evidence to policy making in schools and classrooms would offer significant benefits to Australian families as well as for the capabilities and productivity of Australia s future labour force Australian governments should Teaching out of field should be addressed through targeted professional development of existing teachers willing to acquire the relevant knowledge Teacher salary differentials should also be used to overcome subject based teacher shortages To improve teacher effectiveness a more rigorous micro evidence base about what works in schools and how it should be implemented is required But existing laws mean that data sharing between governments is poor This should be the subject of institutional level reform as outlined in the Productivity Commission s recent inquiry reports into Data Access and the Education Evidence Base The next 5 yearly Productivity Review could assess the impact and effectiveness of policies to raise student performance outcomes At the heart of Australia s VET system is the objective of ensuring that employers can hire employees who are work ready VET plays a key role in providing training for nationally recognised qualifications in job related and technical skills NCVER 2007 NSW Department of Industry 2016 As simple as that objective appears realising it is not straightforward given the demands placed on the VET sector Not only does the system need to provide broad ranging job related training relevant to employers it must do so for a wide variety of students with very different needs It is expected to be a place where young people leaving school can pursue non academic pathways where workers can retrain and gain new skills to keep pace with a changing economy and where people marginalised by the traditional education system can get a second chance Oliver and Yu 2015 Despite its important but complex role the VET sector has been beset with a raft of problems leading to a sector characterised by rapidly rising student debt high student non completion rates poor labour market outcomes for some students unscrupulous and fraudulent behaviour on the part of some training providers These outcomes reflect a range of problems in the VET sector First the expansion of VET FEE HELP access after 2012 is a well documented example of how policy can fail if governments do not ensure proper policy design along with suitable regulatory oversight This policy failure has caused considerable uncertainty and reputational damage to the sector as well as diverting government resources and focus to develop new policies to repair the damage The Australian Government has announced a series of reforms that should start the process of returning confidence and stability to the sector Better oversight of providers and tighter controls on service users access to government funds under VET FEE HELP would have had administrative costs but could have helped avoid other costs that ended up being much larger PC 2016d Second existing training packages that is nationally endorsed training standards and qualifications do not always serve the needs of the employers and students The Commission has also found a lack of user focus in other publicly funded services such as the higher education system section 3 5 health services chapter 2 and public infrastructure chapter 4 Instead these training packages are sets of highly detailed and technical standards that have proliferated over the years yet at the same time take so long to develop that they can be out of date before they reach the end users As a result employers complain of qualifications that do not meet their needs and individuals find it hard to know where to obtain a quality training program Caplan 2016 in Beddie Hargreaves and Atkinson 2017 If training does not deliver what employers need employers are likely to not participate in accredited training and find other ways to skill their workers Beddie Hargreaves and Atkinson 2017 Survey evidence points to this already happening About half of all employers use unaccredited training with close to 90 per cent of those employers being satisfied with the training In contrast only 76 per cent of employers using the VET system to train workers in vocational qualifications were satisfied NCVER 2015 Third training packages are too specific to current job requirements They need to be broadened to ensure they also equip people with sufficient skills to adapt to changes in the workplace Being work ready does not need to be job specific Moodie 2015 Instead training packages could focus on core skills that are needed in most workplaces literacy numeracy digital and communication skills with the addition of technical skills for the sector as well as for a particular job Beddie Hargreaves and Atkinson 2017 Fourth declining VET student numbers at a time when university enrolments are increasing highlights a serious problem with the attractiveness of vocational training Noonan 2016 VET is funded by the Australian Government as well as State and Territory Governments While the Australian Government s overall funding has increased some State and Territory Governments contributions have declined Noonan 2017 Student fees have also significantly increased effectively shifting costs to the Australian Government and to students In an era of demand driven funding for universities the widespread availability of income contingent loans for these students combined with the prestige of a university qualification the VET sector struggles to compete with universities for some courses and qualifications In light of these and other problems the Commission s stakeholders raised a number of areas where VET could be reformed including the provision of more generic transferable skills ensuring youth have good career advice prior to entering VET and improving VET teacher capabilities and effectiveness All of these issues are critical to a well functioning skills formation system Above all the system s design should reflect the needs of its customers with regulators and providers adapting to meet that goal It is likely that the broad directions suggested by stakeholders will improve the VET sector but realising any benefit depends on the right design a recognition that users have diverse views about the details of any reforms and that implementation is a key to success Some stakeholders have urged a comprehensive re assessment of the VET system especially given concerns about the system s responsiveness to users declining student enrolments and the emergence of the universities as competing suppliers However undertaking a comprehensive assessment of the VET sector is beyond the scope of this inquiry though one may well be justified Nevertheless consistent with its thrust across all the themes in this inquiry the Commission has some over the horizon perspectives designed to stimulate innovation more broadly When a system is recovering from such disastrous intervention as has occurred here it is justifiable to concentrate resources on making it functional again but it is also important to make some investments in ideas for the future Consistent with this chapter s focus on the acquisition of skills as a contribution to higher productivity and individual wellbeing this section examines a potentially significant reform that provides employers with better signals of the level of proficiency of VET students In the VET system competency based assessments provide people with a qualification based on their ability to perform a task to a minimum standard Typically there is no grading of the relative performance of students Yet many dimensions of performance lie on a continuous scale speed reliability ability to switch between tasks organisational skills and problem solving capabilities The introduction of proficiency grading would Grading does not necessarily mean VET students would receive a traditional letter grade or a score out of 100 Some proficiency scales only introduce relative performance once a student is deemed competent for example competent with merit or distinction The term grading is used in this section more generally to indicate some level of relative proficiency Graded assessment has been used in Australia Gillis Clayton and Bateman 2008 Hancock 2014 Some governments Queensland and Western Australia piloted statewide systems in the early 2000s But the policy focus shifted to ensuring the quality of delivered courses and the effectiveness of teaching in the VET sector with grading no longer the emphasis Although some individual training providers in Australia have implemented graded assessment in an attempt to meet demands from end users for more detailed information about the quality of student performance approaches diverge widely Gillis Clayton and Bateman 2008 p 6 While introducing a graded proficiency system into vocational assessment would provide valuable information some parts of the sector are currently ill equipped to move to this system An Australian Government discussion paper on the quality of assessment in VET raised concerns about the capacity of VET teachers and assessors to consistently identify the competency of students much less deliver performance grading noting while there has been an effort to encourage VET practitioners to assess holistically it is generally agreed there remains room for improvement in this area Some learners have also raised concerns that assessment tasks were seen as too easy and people were let through who should not have been DET 2016 p 4 Given the current state of the sector it is unlikely that providers and governments together can immediately adopt a proficiency based grading system and certainly not across the full suite of vocational skills But since planning for such a systemic change will take some time it can and should start now In developing strategies to strengthen VET teacher and assessment quality the Australian Government in consultation with States and Territory Governments should examine how and where graded proficiency could be introduced There are grounds for the earlier adoption of a proficiency approach for those qualifications where employers and other educational institutions identify a pressing need for more granular assessment A comprehensive consultation process with employers training providers and students should be used to identify suitable areas for early adoption This would also provide lessons about the best pathways to developing proficiency based assessment more broadly An early mover advantage could be supported by initially not making proficiency based assessment mandatory but allowing it to arise from the employer demand Publishing and promoting successful early adopters would add value and help to extend the benefits The government role would be primarily directed towards validating the system for grading The Australian Government should develop tools for proficiency based assessment for skills where employers want to know how well an employee can perform a task rather than whether they can perform it at all The Australian Government in conjunction with State and Territory Governments and the Australian Industry and Skills Committee would initiate planning for proficiency based assessment processes The Australian Government should not compel vocational education and training VET providers to adopt proficiency based assessment Models would be the subject of employer and VET provider review with a process that supported early adopters to trial and deliver proficiency assessments Before their broader application an evaluation of the trials should be completed with wider consultation across employer groups and institutions To cope with the likely risks and pressures in the labour market the education and training system will need to be flexible enough to teach new skills quickly and efficiently This will probably mean that non formal and informal education including emerging forms of learning will play a larger role in the future skills formation of workers Developing skills and demonstrating competency will be important regardless of the method of learning But having an accepted currency for signalling credentials will be essential if genuinely new models for educational provision are to challenge higher cost traditional models of skills There are grounds to supplement current arrangements and provide recognition of skills and capabilities developed either outside the traditional learning system or from a variety of formal institutions or a combination of both Independent validation of learning is not new A driver s license is an exemplar it is issued for anyone demonstrating competency regardless of the method of learning 4 There is widespread acceptance that people are able to acquire driving skills without formal or paid instruction with confirmation of their skills by testing Not withstanding that the Australian qualification framework recognises prior learning this appears to mainly relate to fast tracking through formal educational courses rather than replacing those courses altogether 5 Further the current validation of informally acquired learning is typically undertaken by an educational institution These institutions are also involved in selling a competing product so are likely to face a potential conflict of interest when assessing the learner And often if the learner is deemed not yet competent in certain areas the institution can provide them with the training needed to make up the shortfall for a fee New forms of learning are emerging made possible by developments in technology In particular technology is reducing the time and financial costs of acquiring knowledge These new forms of learning are attractive to workers and employers Some institutions and businesses are acting unilaterally They are providing short modular affordable courses focused on the skills and capabilities that employers are seeking using online options to make it easier for people to combine work and training Examples include There are also opportunities for innovative work based learning that lead to professionally recognised qualifications in areas once seen as solely the domain of university based learning As part of the UK Trailblazer Apprenticeships program for example Price Water house Coopers PwC developed alongside 30 other employers a Higher Apprenticeship that recruits students directly from school After three years this leads to a professional qualification as either a Chartered Certified Accountant ACCA or Chartered Accountant ACA BIS 2013 Newton et al 2015 PwC 2017 This approach is feasible because the skills learned as an accountant are vocational in orientation and there is an independent test of capability to acquire recognition as an ACCA or ACA Moreover as in traditional trade apprenticeships the work that students undertake as part of their learning contributes to the output of the business which allows the course to be offered without the level of fees charged at universities The Australian Government has also been trialling the concept with PwC in Australia NCVER 2017 Singhal 2017 The credibility of these emerging education and training options is generally based on the reputation of the businesses and or the institutions involved For example the involvement of Google in the Udacity Android nanodegree provided sufficient credibility for Flipkart an Indian e commerce platform to hire these graduates without interview based on their nanodegree project and Udacity profile As a result the online model for provision of education from existing universities is likely to grow without any government role as will arrangements that involve commercial parties such as Google or PwC However there are impediments to the growth of genuinely new models for educational provision Consequently there is a gap between what is demanded flexible affordable and easily acquired skills and what is accepted as a universal signal of skills and ability in the labour market A framework or system that enables recognition of and trust in new types of learning is a missing element As outlined in The New York Times Free online courses won t revolutionize education until there is a parallel system of free or low fee credentials not controlled by traditional colleges that leads to jobs Carey 2015 p 1 The emerging education sector is well aware of the problem of acceptance and recognition in the jobs market for their products and are already seeking solutions These include universities awarding certificates nanodegrees and micro masters as outlined above digital badges similar in concept to scout badges and online platforms such as Degreed and Accredible acting as a central repository for modular learning Degreed plan to take this process one step further by creating a network of subject matter experts to assess learners skills along with standardised grading DeakinDigital based at Deakin University tests capabilities and issues credentials that certify people s ability in non technical areas such as problem solving and communication These solutions are in their infancy subject to proliferation hence lacking the credibility provided by large scale uptake and are yet to be understood sufficiently to serve as a signalling tool in the labour market Certification frameworks ensure the outcomes of an education system have value to society Traditional higher costs methods of learning such as a four year university degree or an apprenticeship have these regimes But the financial and time costs of these traditional methods are a major barrier to skills formation If Australia s education system is to be adaptive to the forthcoming labour market challenges it is necessary to have an education system that values these new models of learning A certification framework will go some way to doing this The proposed regulatory framework could involve any combination of Any system would require a rigorous independent and employer accepted assessment of the quality of learning Ideally a party without any training responsibilities would assess a person s skills using a validated approach to avoid a conflict of interest This model is more applicable to some fields than others For example IT and economics are disciplines in which skills are readily measurable and where it is possible to acquire knowledge assembled from low cost sources This validation framework would not be restricted to skills developed through MOOCs online video platforms or traditional educational institutions but could include any skills generated through other activities such as volunteering While designed to assist all workers particular groups may benefit more including youth entering the labour market women returning to the labour market after a break and older workers Currently the lack of a certification framework impedes the growth and acceptance of new models of skills formation reduces investment in education and training sustains an inefficient legacy model of providing skills and so leaves workers vulnerable to poor labour market outcomes which has an impact on the capabilities and productivity of Australia s labour force There are prospectively large gains to productivity and efficiency from supporting new models of learning The Australian Government should develop a framework to facilitate the independent accreditation of skills obtained through any learning method A capacity to assess and accredit skills and competencies acquired outside of traditional settings should be established and funded by the Australian Government For university level qualifications this may be the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency The Australian Government in conjunction with employers the Industry and Skills Committee and the Australian Skills Quality Authority should investigate areas of vocational education and training where an independent certification model could robustly test a person s skills Universities have always been relevant to skills formation but their role has grown from being a niche provider for a very small share of Australians to a system accessible to most and used by many In 2011 the share of the population aged 15 years and above with a bachelor s degree or higher 19 per cent was over nine times the figure for 1971 2 per cent This figure is even higher for younger cohorts with nearly 40 per cent of 30 39 year olds holding a bachelor degree or higher in 2016 In spite of or because of its recent growth in importance there are a range of structural challenges facing the university sector Just some of these risks include Most of these issues facing the university sector will not diminish over time either Indeed given current enrolment growth rates following the move to a demand driven university model it will not be too long before the university sector is the key vehicle for skills formation in the economy Meanwhile ongoing technological change is already disrupting university business models as the methods of acquiring and disseminating knowledge evolve such as the growth of MOOCs discussed above These changes are only likely to increase the scale and urgency of the challenges facing the university sector The Commission has concentrated on the value and impacts of universities teaching functions given the role that teaching plays in the development of workforce skills and knowledge figure 3 2 This approach aligns with the focus elsewhere in this report on improving the value of services for consumers such as patient focused health care in chapter 2 or user responsive road and city design in chapter 4 rather than addressing institutional issues with the providers A full discussion of university education and the policy options below is in Supporting Paper 7 SP 7 The range of different issues that the university sector faces including The additional issue of skills development and student outcomes is highlighted indicating the Commission s focus for the subsequent discussion University students do not always get great outcomes from their education First many students do not even complete their degrees In 2014 more than 26 per cent of students had not completed their degree program within nine years of commencing Having over a quarter of students not complete their qualifications represents a significant loss of resources for those students in time effort and money as well as for taxpayers Recently rates of short term attrition have also been trending upwards short term rates have risen from 12 5 per cent in 2009 to 15 2 per cent in 2014 Although these rates remain within their historically normal ranges and much of the increase reflects a few outlying providers they also do not yet include the long term effects of the shift to a demand driven system As proportionally more students enter university it is possible that more of them will be poorly prepared not only students who may not have done well in secondary school as measured by Australian Tertiary Admission Ranks or ATARs but also students with marginal attachment or engagement at university such as some mature age or part time students On the other hand the overwhelming majority of variation in attrition rates comes from individual factors such as student motivation or university level differences such that it is also possible there is no link between expanded access to university and rising attrition rates For those who do complete their degrees post graduation outcomes have been getting worse Full time employment rates for recent graduates have been declining even as the Australian economy has continued to grow figure 3 3 Many of those who do not work full time are not in that position by choice with the underemployment ratio among graduates at 20 5 per cent in 2016 compared with about 9 per cent in 2008 Graduate starting salaries have also been growing slower than wages across the broader economy declining from nearly 90 per cent of average weekly earnings in 1989 to about 75 per cent in 2015 As a proportion of those available for full time employment four months after completionaa Shaded areas indicate recessions Although long run unemployment remains low for those with a bachelor degree at 3 1 per cent in May 2016 this can hide a range of serious issues For starters unemployment is much higher for younger graduate cohorts at 6 5 per cent for 24 year olds Further over a quarter of recent graduates believed they were employed full time in roles unrelated to their studies to which their degree added no value To the extent that someone without a costly university education could have undertaken these roles this can then have cascading employment and income effects down the skills ladder Many employers are also not satisfied with the quality of recent graduates with about one in six supervisors saying that they were unlikely to consider or would be indifferent to graduates from the same university University students are also not satisfied with the teaching in their courses figure 3 4 Australian universities continue to perform poorly on student satisfaction measures relative to the United Kingdom or the United States Of course the problems in student outcomes are often not the fault of the universities nor the education they provide The inherent capabilities and choices of students are vitally important to their future while labour market conditions and mere chance are also decisive Percentage of students who did not give a positive rating 2016The percentage of university students who did not give a positive rating for a range of different course satisfaction measures According to the student responses on eight measures Not withstanding the critical role of their teaching function universities tend to given pre eminence and prestige to their research functions The selection process and career development of academics generally depends more on their research results and publication numbers than on their teaching ability Indeed even where staff have an interest in teaching excellence teaching focused roles have a poor reputation and are not seen as conducive to career progression surveys indicate that while over 80 per cent of academics think that effectiveness as a teacher should be highly rewarded in promotions less than 30 per cent think it actually is rewarded In turn universities are encouraged to recruit research centric staff by international university rankings that are based largely on research capabilities As universities rely on their international rankings to attract footloose international students and their associated revenue this encourages a gladiatorial obsession with relative research performance in the rankings of the top 100 universities while a focus on teaching quality is not rewarded That universities must foster excellence in research is unquestioned However universities are in the unique position of not just generating ideas that push out the boundaries of knowledge but in also transferring that knowledge to students a diffusion role that is not subject to the same level of status as research Part of the reason why universities may be more focused on research prestige and less on teaching outcomes is because they do not face sufficient incentives to improve the latter not just financial incentives but also institutional and regulatory incentives More closely aligning the interests of universities and their staff with those of the people paying the bills students and taxpayers could be one mechanism to drive improvements in student outcomes The objective would be for universities to respond by improving their teaching quality as well as to consider the effect of their admissions criteria pre commencement information and ongoing student support services on student outcomes Overall this could result in By improving student outcomes it could also lead to lower amounts of Higher Education Loan Program HELP debts that are not expected to be repaid doubtful debts incidentally reducing costs for taxpayers However creating designing and implementing new incentive structures for institutions as complex as universities is not easy A risk is that universities alter their behaviour in unanticipated ways with undesirable consequences Moreover changes to one part of the university system such as funding arrangements for teaching can have incidental and profound effects in other areas such as research which creates new policy questions Accordingly initiatives that aim to fix one problem in the system can reverberate requiring a cascading series of policy interventions As a result the Commission has indicated potential changes rather than recommending them at this stage as further work would be needed on impacts development and testing prior to implementation A formal Reference to undertake such a systemic review is one possible course for policy makers Given the resource and time costs of university education that are borne by students as well as the fundamental effect this has on productivity careers and life choices the sparse provision of reliable meaningful information about the quality of courses degrees and universities is perplexing Generally students cannot determine in advance whether a university s teaching is good quality or if the degree suits their capabilities and preferences inhibiting their ability to make good decisions Three years of effort on a degree that has no real currency is bad for both the student and the economy In turn universities have weak incentives to improve teaching quality if prospective students are unable to determine their quality The Australian Government has already acknowledged that the sources of information on university teaching quality and student outcomes need to be improved The Quality Indicators for Learning and Teaching QILT data and website are being expanded while recent work by the Higher Education Standards Panel aims to improve the range and relevance of pre commencement information available to prospective students However further improvements will be needed once these changes are complete In particular as is already recognised in schools there is merit in measuring the degree to which universities causally contribute to the outcomes of their students value added This is because the absolute outcomes for students are as likely to reflect the quality of the students as they are to reflect the quality of the universities Top universities that attract A students and turn out A graduate s surprise no one But what about universities that accept B students and produce A graduates Which is doing the better job OECD 2013 As in so many other policy areas discussed in this report good data and its availability to trusted parties are also going to play a large role in establishing the genuine impacts of universities This will require the collection of more information from universities as well as greater use of linked administrative data from government agencies such as the Department of Human Services and the Australian Tax Office SP 3 Better data on student outcomes would not only inform students but would also create lessons for universities about what creates good outcomes Teaching methods syllabuses and teacher quality matter a great deal to the educational outcomes in schools but this recognition is lacking in universities In much of the economy a consumer receiving a service that is not fit for purpose or that is not supplied with due care and skill has recourse to compensation or re provision a right to return of the service Until recently universities were by dint of a technicality free of obligations under Australian consumer law ACL That appears to have changed with the introduction of the demand driven system opening up the avenue for a student to seek compensation or re provision of the course if there are sufficient deficiencies in curriculum design course delivery student support supervision quality or the fitness for purpose of a qualification Whether in fact the ACL will adequately give students that recourse is unclear as it has not yet been tested in court Although the ACL can help to protect consumers interests actions can be difficult to mount there will always be some ambiguity about what constitutes a breach and case by case restitution can be costly The United Kingdom has recently clarified their consumer law to ensure that it applies fully to higher education providers The Australian Government should monitor consumer law developments in Australia and the United Kingdom UK to ensure that the Australian Consumer Law applies to the higher education sector If on further examination it appears that action in Australia is difficult to mount and that the UK arrangements have had a positive impact the Australian Government should clarify in legislation that the Australian Consumer Law does relate to higher education This should give the student the right to compensation or the right to a repeat performance on the same basis as other products that prove to be not fit for purpose One way to realign the incentives of universities is to introduce skin in the game financial incentives linked to student or taxpayer outcomes Currently universities provide education services to students with no responsibility for their post graduation outcomes or the quality of the teaching they provide Linking student outcomes to university payments could help to overcome this The Australian Government has already announced one such mechanism as part of the 2017 18 Budget with plans to allocate 7 5 per cent of Commonwealth Grant Scheme CGS funding on a performance contingent basis Potential measures of performance under this measure seem likely to include student retention satisfaction and outcomes although designing and implementing the metrics will involve significant challenges The Commission has considered some desirable features of such measures and some possible pathways forward on the Government s proposal in SP 7 Further complementary policy options could also be considered to try to reduce attrition rates As universities can have some influence over student retention through their admission criteria pre commencement information and ongoing student support services linking financial incentives or penalties to student attrition would place part of the consequences with them While the Government s proposed performance contingent funding seems likely to include measures of attrition as a key variable for determining the reward or penalty provided to universities complementary policy options in this area could also include However such options face some challenges and require further development and consideration before they could be implemented First both may create some incentives for universities to refuse to fail under performing students Whether these incentives are material is unclear because universities employing this strategy would put at risk their long run reputation leave the university open to action under the consumer law and potentially lose any proposed performance contingent funding Secondly universities have only limited influence over student attrition rates the choices and preferences of the students themselves and external factors such as the economic climate or family responsibilities are also highly influential As such the extent to which universities should be penalised for student attrition depends on the degree to which they affect student outcomes If implemented it would be prudent to start small and recalibrate based on observed outcomes Part of the rationale for universities undertaking both research and teaching functions is the teaching research nexus the theory that close proximity to world class researchers makes students more engaged develops their critical thinking aids their research skills and keeps them up to date with the latest research findings However these skills and attributes can be nurtured by high quality teaching only academics as well For instance teaching focused staff with adequate support can keep up to date with the latest research findings Indeed the skills and attributes that make an academic a good researcher will not necessarily also make them a good teacher In line with this there is little empirical evidence that a positive nexus exists particularly at the undergraduate level Despite the lack of evidence the nexus is reinforced by regulatory requirements that restrict the title of university to only those institutions undertaking both research and teaching This matters because the title university has a special status for employers and students regardless of the extent to which universities enhance skills acquisition However in many other countries including the United States and England there is recognition that a university can undertake excellent teaching without conducting research As research is expensive to conduct this can also create barriers to entry and provide a competitive advantage to existing institutions in Australia s university centric market As part of the 2017 18 Budget the Government announced it would examine the requirement for universities to conduct research as part of the review of the Higher Education Provider Category Standards If as a result the higher education market was opened to teaching only universities rigorous quality standards and auditing would still be needed in order to avoid repeating the mistakes of the VET sector discussed in section 3 3 above There is no compelling policy rationale for requiring high quality providers to conduct research in order to be able to label themselves as a university The existing funding arrangements often result in domestic students paying for university research as part of the cost of their education despite that research being of little direct benefit to them Currently most domestic students attend university in a Commonwealth supported place CSP The Australian Government regulates the resources provided to the universities for each CSP by providing a pre determined taxpayer subsidy for each student Commonwealth grants and placing maximum limits on student contributions which normally get paid through the HELP loan system Resource amounts vary by field of study with annual resources per equivalent full time study load EFTSL ranging from 12 158 for humanities subjects to over 30 000 for medicine and agriculture subjects Government regulation of CSP resourcing is necessary because price competition is difficult to establish in the domestic university market This is primarily because the vast majority of domestic students have access to income contingent HELP loans and consequently have a low price sensitivity which was a necessary by product of enabling university access on merit rather than family income Further in the absence of good information lower prices may undermine the prestige of a university and its capacity to attract good students In addition students are often not geographically mobile implying that many universities often only compete within a city sized market rather than across Australia While there is some movement of students from their home state to attend university in the four biggest states well over 80 per cent of commencing students originate from the same state likely reflecting the cost of moving out of their parents home the dominant accommodation choice for higher education students There is strong evidence that the maximum CSP prices set by the Australian Government are often well in excess of the full costs of some courses Universities do not compete down prices for such courses an indicator of the imperfect competition described above This generates teaching surpluses for certain high margin courses which universities can then use to fund research Across all universities the cross subsidy from teaching to research generated by Commonwealth supported domestic students was estimated to be 1 5 billion in 2013 This is nearly half the amount that universities receive from the Australian Government in direct research funding 3 5 billion This has several concerning outcomes For one such cross subsidies are invisible to students and given the standard accounting methods used by universities are not disclosed accurately to the Australian Government either Of most relevance to this inquiry such cross subsidies may also have adverse impacts on skill formation ultimately affecting Australia s productivity Under the demand driven system the number of places available for students in a given course is determined solely by the university Cross subsidisation creates strong incentives for universities to offer more places for prospective students in high margin courses and fewer places in low margin courses in order to maximise teaching surpluses for research This can result in oversupplies or undersupplies of graduates in certain fields based solely on the incentives created by arbitrary Government funding levels and student contribution caps Students in oversupplied programs can then struggle to find employment after graduation wasting the resources used to educate them while under supplied courses can often be in areas that are vital for the community such as dentistry or health New funding arrangements that align total CSP resources to expected teaching costs both fixed and variable would help to minimise these inefficiencies Some initial work on the cost of teaching by discipline has already been undertaken by the Australian Government as part of the 2017 18 Budget alongside the roll out of improved accounting methods for universities specifically allocating expenses by purpose not just type However reducing cross subsidies would decrease funding for research by definition Without offsetting policies this would strain university budgets in the short term and potentially affect Australia s long term research capacity and hence productivity The Australian Government could consider options that addressed the need for adequate research funding while still reducing the adverse impacts of existing high margin courses For example it could set cost reflective prices for courses saving costs and then return it to universities through increased research funding However that would raise questions about the best ways to allocate such funding which the Commission has not investigated in detail Once that avenue of inquiry was opened it would logically extend to all university research funding and indeed potentially to the Australian Government s policies for funding research in the wider economy Consequently further consideration of offsetting measures would be needed before implementation as well as consultation with the affected parties There is a strong in principle case that per student CSP resourcing from combined student contributions and Commonwealth grants should more closely reflect the expected cost of teaching As this would likely remove a significant source of revenue from universities it would also create a range of research funding issues The funding model in present use has not been updated to deal with the shift to a demand driven model and if left unchanged could adversely affect Australia s future skills formation The HELP scheme is a critical program for ensuring that higher education is accessible to all Australians and given the growing significance of the sector for skills formation in an evolving economy is a foundation for future productivity However its design poses several problems for economically efficient decisions about skill acquisition Much of the recent debate about around higher education policy has focused on the sustainability of the growing value of HELP debt that current and former students owe the Government The value of outstanding HELP debt has increased from approximately 12 4 billion in June 2006 to over 47 8 billion in June 2016 Projections indicate that this trend will continue up to nearly 200 billion by 2025 SP 7 The proportion of doubtful HELP debt is also rising strongly While some temporary factors have contributed to this recent increase there are also a range of significant long term challenges to debt repayment including Many of these structural challenges can lead to the unproductive use of HELP particularly on wasted education investments An exemplar is the case of those post retirement age students who do not pay off their debts and who have acquired skills that have a lower likelihood of benefitting the public at large While the scale of some of these problems are small now they look likely to grow However such expenditure is not uniformly wasteful either Therefore the government should avoid arbitrary limitations and rules such as indiscriminate age limits that discourage up skilling and retraining To address these challenges and reduce the costs of the HELP system the Government announced a range of reforms as part of the 2017 18 Budget including changes to the HELP repayment schedule From 2018 19 debtors will begin making repayments at a rate of 1 per cent once they reach 42 000 income rather than the current threshold of 55 874 with an initial repayment rate of 4 per cent By requiring more individuals to make repayments estimated at nearly 200 000 this increases repayments and reduces costs However most of the long term structural challenges remain unaddressed by lower HELP repayment thresholds In particular many university educated part time workers in otherwise wealthy households will still be under the threshold Similarly post retirement age students will be largely unaffected if they have left the workforce as their earnings will likely remain below the threshold Further although lower repayment thresholds would increase HELP repayments it may also distort workforce participation decisions This is because the HELP system results in repayment cliffs at each subsequent income threshold which can induce income bunching at those thresholds Although the lower repayment rate of 1 per cent would help to minimise the disincentive effects of the reforms lower repayment thresholds are also likely to disproportionately affect part time workers who generally have more control over their hours worked and so may respond with reduced workforce participation More broadly subjecting over two million debtors given that nearly all debtors will be paying more under cascading changes to subsequent income thresholds to increased marginal tax rates can also have labour supply effects even if only temporarily while the loan is repaid An alternative to lowering repayment thresholds is to allow outstanding debts to be collected from deceased estates rather than being written off as currently occurs The fiscal gain would of course be much deferred But it would reduce doubtful debts substantially by approximately two thirds according to one estimate and would not have as much of a distortionary effect on participation decisions as the marginal impact of improved collection would generally occur post retirement It would also be consistent with the treatment of other tax debts and private debts and would better address many of the long term structural challenges faced by the HELP debt system including post retirement age students and part time workers in otherwise wealthy households Collection from deceased estates could also be structured to protect against financial hardship for the debtor s family members Decreasing HELP repayment thresholds can affect workforce participation decisions for some marginal debtors A better method of recovering outstanding HELP debts and addressing long term challenges to HELP debt sustainability is collection from deceased estates Equity concerns posed by such an approach can be alleviated by creating a provision for small estates only collecting from the estates of debtors beyond prime working age and providing the Australian Taxation Office with discretionary powers to waive remaining debts The preceding discussion has largely focused on reforms to the supply side of the education and training system Demand for education can also be affected to the extent that quality is improved university teaching accessibility and flexibility is enhanced online courses the value of learning increases better recognition and accreditation of learning or prices change CSP funding or HELP design But there is an underlying presumption that there are students motivated to attend these institutions The demand for education and training particularly among some cohorts such as older workers cannot be assumed In the face of technological change ensuring the skills relevance of the existing workforce will become increasingly important Additional measures may be needed or barriers removed to help workers and or their employers realise the pay off from up skilling and retraining As the potential breadth of training requirements are wide and varied reforms will cut across the whole education system Some workers for example may need to develop foundational literacy and numeracy skills while others may need information and guidance about pathways to up skill their already high levels of education In Australia an individual s education and training is typically front ended that is their formal learning occurs early in their life after which they enter the workforce and continue working until retirement interspersed with on the job training The school VET and university systems play the main role in educating and training young people at the start of their life Historically this model of learning has been effective as it maximises the amount of time a person can earn higher wages from their additional skills maximising returns to education It also lowers the effective cost of education and training because it takes place at a time in people s lives when they can obtain part time casual jobs while studying and when full time jobs are difficult to obtain or would not pay well While participation in formal education is substantially lower for older cohorts and continues to decline with age Australia s post secondary school education and training system has played a role in providing some mature workers the opportunity to While education and training in the first 20 25 years of life remain critical there are grounds for more systematic and greater investments in the skills of people throughout their working life In particular the returns from further training and education may rise over the coming decades Three main mechanisms lie behind this In summary technological change is making it worthwhile to undertake more training new ways of learning make the additional investment easier and cheaper and people working longer gives them longer to obtain the benefits from more training figure 3 5 These factors increase the return on additional relevant investment in education and training The level of adult participation in education and training in Australia is high compared with other countries figure 3 6 However this participation tends to relate to the enhancement of professional skills associated with already acquired post school qualifications The extension of opportunities to other groups will be important for minimising structural adjustment costs and distributional impacts of potentially large shifts in the labour market As The Economist has emphasised focusing on narrow groups for lifelong learning poses large risks for people and society the lifelong learning that exists today mainly benefits high achievers and is therefore more likely to exacerbate inequality than diminish it If 21st century economies are not to create a massive underclass policymakers urgently need to work out how to help all their citizens learn while they earn The Economist 2017 p 2 Barriers to employment and training among the working especially older workers are well known discussed further in SP 8 The ageing of the workforce means that a greater number of workers will be facing barriers that may result in poor job matching underemployment unemployment or early retirement Increased and unexpected vulnerabilities from technological advancement adds a new element to structural change creating a broader group of people who are not necessarily aware of potential risks or the pay off from re skilling Per cent of age groupSource OECD Education at a glance online statistics An essential component for improved living standards is early intervention Policy settings should be such that actions are taken before workers are retrenched or made redundant Redundancy is a poor starting point for re skilling It means there is a potentially lengthy interruption to employment which then reduces subsequent job prospects The problem facing vulnerable employees is one of creeping gradualism The risks of job loss grow slowly varying by place and skill so that there is no obvious trigger for acquiring new skills before the risks are realised For example long distance truck drivers as noted above are at risk of displacement if automated vehicles are adopted for long haul freight distribution But they do not know when It might happen only for some trucks on some routes or may occur for some companies ahead of others Regulatory uncertainty about the safety of autonomous vehicles also make predictions difficult For the workers in this situation switching occupations not only involves a gamble in terms of forgone wages and conditions but it removes people from the familiar milieu of their job and their colleagues workplaces are often valued as much for the relationships they create as their earnings Beyond the multiple new approaches discussed above for access to flexible innovative and affordable skills formation there remain some barriers to well informed choice for skill formation options Governments have taken some steps to overcome the information barriers to skills development and employment There are a burgeoning number of websites to assist people considering particular occupations and looking to undertake training including The Australian Government is also developing a new website to provide a single point of entry for information about higher education admissions policies and processes There is evidence that improved availability of course outcome information helps people including disadvantaged workers between the ages of 25 54 seek out courses with good expected labour market outcomes But just as the Commission found in health care chapter 2 the enthusiasm to use the web for information provision carries with it the risk of a confusing maze of information working against the very purpose for which such sites exist One improvement would be to consolidate the information about training and education into one website While the websites listed above are usually linked they do not provide a single comprehensive information source for either school leavers or those in the workforce to review their employment and study options A single platform may make it easier to navigate for the end user particularly workers who have not had much contact with the education and training system for a number of years A single platform will also make it easier to market to the public providing greater awareness of the information available Increased knowledge and use of a single platform represents a cost effective method to promote careers and training information However any such portal must be properly maintained to be useful with a single agency accountable for its quality and usability There is also scope for improvement in the content of the existing tools The Australian Human Rights Commission 2016 found that information and guidance available to older people considering formal skills training is inadequate and does not support people to overcome barriers p 93 It also found that there were gaps in the provision of information for VET courses on the My Skills website And information is often far too lacking in granularity to be really useful Currently graduate occupation information is limited to ANZSCO major group level for example Technician and trades workers Managers Labourers which provides no indication to prospective students on the likelihood of their finding work after graduating in the occupation for which the course is designed to prepare them Polidano Van de Ven and Voitchovsky 2017 p 10 The improvements announced by the Australian Government in the 2016 17 Budget to the QILT website will provide a more accurate picture of graduate earning outcomes but as noted earlier the measures should be developed to provide an indication of value added Increased collaboration between the Government educational institutions and employers could help with the development expansion and funding of an online tool The process of consultation between them in developing a single tool would be valuable in its own right The Australian Government should ensure that Australians of all working ages can readily access comprehensive and up to date information about career and education options including how to make career changes later in life As a first step the Australian Government should consolidate the existing range of career guidance and education information websites into a single portal to provide school leavers and existing workers with a comprehensive one stop shop It should outline A further step is for the Australian Government to establish a cross portfolio review of the policies needed to develop a workforce with greater capacity to adapt to structural change The review would examine the changes needed in the education and training and tax and transfer systems along with the need for awareness raising approachesThe investment approach in the Australian Government s Try Test and Learn TTL program may have lessons for the development of employment and skill initiatives focused on older cohorts at high risk of losing their jobs due to structural adjustment The TTL is an early intervention program that aims to improve the economic and social participation of young carers young parents and young students at risk of long term unemployment These groups were identified as promising targets for interventions since actuarial assessment suggested that the cost savings from avoiding prolonged welfare dependency were high The TTL model is not prescriptive in nature but harvests ideas for small scale interventions gathered through submissions from the community sector government academics business and individuals The advantage of many of the ideas put forward under the TTL program is that they are low cost and readily able to be abandoned or scaled up Many use online platforms and peer support a free input Through this initiative the Australian Government is seeking to develop a body of evidence of what works and to discover how behaviours pathways or systems can be changed to improve workforce participation While the funding round for TTL is not complete and programs are yet to be implemented a similar model could be used for workers who may also face protracted periods of welfare dependency after occupational dislocation particularly if they shift to a disability payment The evaluation outcomes from the TTL will provide lessons for the future development of a new program targeting that group From an economy wide perspective all of the prior discussion in this chapter of labour market trends coalesces around workers These workers may be otherwise destined to remain on support payments or in poorly matched employment The return of such workers to higher wage and more sustainable jobs may well require a re think of skills provision Improvements in living standards are inevitable if the counter factual is to remain on social support Since the dominant provider of education in this country is and seems likely to remain a role of governments and since the fiscal burden of a failure to acquire new skills will remain with government under our social safety net if no action is taken the case for better designed and more accessible mature age education seems well made Policy solutions may not be easy or uniform for this diverse group but given the uncertainty about how technology will affect the labour market it is important that this issue be at the forefront of public debate Government industry and individuals need to continually assess and re assess the impact on the labour market based on evidence Structural change is not new but some approaches used to tackle it could be in particular early intervention Previous chapterReport homeContentsNext chapterFollow OnSubscribeOur mission is to help leaders in

publication has been defining and informing the senior management agenda since 1964 Our learning programs help organizations accelerate growth by unlocking their people s potential Recent developments in robotics artificial intelligence and machine learning have put us on the cusp of a new automation age Robots and computers can not only perform a range of routine physical work activities better and more cheaply than humans but they are also increasingly capable of accomplishing activities that include cognitive capabilities once considered too difficult to automate successfully such as making tacit judgments sensing emotion or even driving Automation will change the daily work activities of everyone from miners and landscapers to commercial bankers fashion designers welders and CEOs But how quickly will these automation technologies become a reality in the workplace And what will their impact be on employment and productivity in the global economy The McKinsey Global Institute has been conducting an ongoing research program on automation technologies and their potential effects A new MGI report A future that works Automation employment and productivity highlights several key findings The automation of activities can enable businesses to improve performance by reducing errors and improving quality and speed and in some cases achieving outcomes that go beyond human capabilities Automation also contributes to productivity as it has done historically At a time of lackluster productivity growth this would give a needed boost to economic growth and prosperity It would also help offset the impact of a declining share of the working age population in many countries Based on our scenario modeling we estimate automation could raise productivity growth globally by 0 8 to 1 4 percent annually see animation below The right level of detail at which to analyze the potential impact of automation is that of individual activities rather than entire occupations Every occupation includes multiple types of activity each of which has different requirements for automation Given currently demonstrated technologies very few occupations less than 5 percent are candidates for full automation However almost every occupation has partial automation potential as a proportion of its activities could be automated We estimate that about half of all the activities people are paid to do in the world s workforce could potentially be automated by adapting currently demonstrated technologies That amounts to almost 15 trillion in wages The activities most susceptible to automation are physical ones in highly structured and predictable environments as well as data collection and processing In the United States these activities make up 51 percent of activities in the economy accounting for almost 2 7 trillion in wages They are most prevalent in manufacturing accommodation and food service and retail trade And it s not just low skill low wage work that could be automated middle skill and high paying high skill occupations too have a degree of automation potential As processes are transformed by the automation of individual activities people will perform activities that complement the work that machines do and vice versa Still automation will not happen overnight Even when the technical potential exists we estimate it will take years for automation s effect on current work activities to play out fully The pace of automation and thus its impact on workers will vary across different activities occupations and wage and skill levels Factors that will determine the pace and extent of automation include the ongoing development of technological capabilities the cost of technology competition with labor including skills and supply and demand dynamics performance benefits including and beyond labor cost savings and social and regulatory acceptance Our scenarios suggest that half of today s work activities could be automated by 2055 but this could happen up to 20 years earlier or later depending on various factors in addition to other economic conditions The effects of automation might be slow at a macro level within entire sectors or economies for example but they could be quite fast at a micro level for individual workers whose activities are automated or for companies whose industries are disrupted by competitors using automation While much of the current debate about automation has focused on the potential for mass unemployment people will need to continue working alongside machines to produce the growth in per capita GDP to which countries around the world aspire Thus our productivity estimates assume that people displaced by automation will find other employment Many workers will have to change and we expect business processes to be transformed However the scale of shifts in the labor force over many decades that automation technologies can unleash is not without precedent It is of a similar order of magnitude to the long term technology enabled shifts away from agriculture in developed countries workforces in the 20th century Those shifts did not result in long term mass unemployment because they were accompanied by the creation of new types of work We cannot definitively say whether things will be different this time But our analysis shows that humans will still be needed in the workforce the total productivity gains we estimate will only come about if people work alongside machines That in turn will fundamentally alter the workplace requiring a new degree of cooperation between workers

and growing technological innovation is crucial At a time when there is an urgent need to improve the efficiency of public services data analytics has huge potential Eddie Copeland NestaHow to use it Estonia saves more than 2 8 million hours of labour every year through a data exchange network that helped it digitise 99 of government services The system lets citizens pay their taxes in five minutes and incorporate companies in under 20 Police forces in the US are using big data to predict where crime is most likely to occur and allocate officers more efficiently Some cities have cut crime by up to 40 London is using data analytics to predict which children are most at risk for neglect and abuse allowing child services to intervene before something happens The system will save municipalities 910 000 a year Ukraine has clamped down on corruption and saved 37 million on drugs for its health service with a data driven app that compares government purchases to prices listed by other suppliers How to learn The School of Data has courses on the fundamentals of data as well as how to extract map and clean it The Open Data Institute offers classes in open data essentials and finding stories in data It also has offline courses like Open data in a day for government and Managing risk with open data Coursera has a John Hopkins University sanctioned Launch your career in data science class Datacamp teaches data science skills like R SQL and python Dataquest offers beginner intermediate and expert level courses in data analysis and prediction General Assembly has a number of courses in data science and analysis In the US just 27 of citizens are happy with government s digital services Constituents want to interact with government more easily and governments leading the charge in bringing services online are using artificial intelligence AI to do so With AI systems learn from experience and keep improving their performance without humans having to explain how to complete tasks A prime example of this is chatbots virtual assistants that field questions from constituents who would normally have to call a public office or help desk Chatbots which learn from the questions they are asked to continually improve performance help governments serve constituents better and free up public servants time for higher value jobs AI has the potential to rid humans of monotonous work administrative tasks like data sorting filing and searching documents translating materials and drafting briefs among others saving federal governments up to 1 2 billion hu man hours and 41 1 billion annually City officials only work during the day 8am to 5pm Chatbots work 24 7 Ryan Johnson City of North CharlestonHow to use it Governments in the US Singapore and Jersey use chatbots to help citizens cut through bureaucracy and find the answers they need quickly and easily Las Vegas is using AI to predict car crashes with up to 70 accuracy It uses it to warn drivers to avoid the area up to two hours in advance The UK is using a machine learning model that can identify billion dollar pension schemes at risk of collapse New York City is preventing fires by using a prediction tool that has improved the accuracy of inspections by 20 allowing the city to divert crews to the most at risk buildings How to learn Udacity has an introductory course to AI Udemy offers a range of AI courses from fundamental to advanced learning Coursera has a deep learning specialisation taught by Stanford University professors It also offers a range of other AI classes EdX has a variety of introduction to AI courses IBM offers a beginner s guide to artificial intelligence machine learning and cognitive computing Policymakers are often accused of losing sight of the challenges everyday people face Design thinking is a way for governments to leverage the philosophy of user centric companies like Apple which puts customer experience at the centre of product design to solve problems and shape policy Design thinking puts end citizens at the centre of policy formulation in the iterative process public servants form theories about what constituents want by observing them prototype a product or service then test it out on real people This form of empathetic hands on policymaking helps government build services in concert with citizens to meet their needs rather than relying on detached experts The collaborative approach encourages public servants to break out of departmental siloes and tap into more risky innovative service design It s quite messy doing design work But the old ways of thinking just aren t working anymore Sarah Hurcombe the Australian Centre for Social InnovationHow to use it Denmark used design thinking to reorganise waste management in Copenahagen reduce tension between inmates and guards in prisons and transform services for mentally disabled adults in Odense Singapore has redesigned its employment centres to make them calm and easily navigable for stressed job seekers West Hollywood used design thinking to bring the first robotic parking garage to the west coast The US Department of Labour used design thinking to come up with a speed dating approach to teaching job seekers about resume building financial literacy and how to find work How to learn Stanford University offers a world renowned virtual crash course in design thinking Coursera has a University of Virginia backed design thinking for innovation class Ideou teaches a number of courses in design thinking and innovation strategy MIT has a class in mastering innovation and design thinking FutureLearn has a course called designing for the future in which students learn to apply design thinking to modern problems The University of Cincinnati offers and introductory design thinking and innovation course The use of human psychology to drive citizen behaviour was pioneered by the UK government to cut costs and help people make better choices It taps into the minutiae of how people act and uses small nudges such as a text message or personalised letter to prompt behavioural changes The discipline has had an outsize effect on human behaviour the UK Nudge Unit has signed up an additional 100 000 organ donors a year doubled the number of army applicants and helped collect an additional 40 million a year from taxpayers Nudge units use empirical evidence to anticipate how people will react to policy options rather than assuming their response will be rational They have spread to governments across the world including Guatemala the US Australia Germany and Singapore but the use of behavioural insights is still nascent In the future it is expected to have a significant impact on solving problems that stem from ingrained or unconscious bias like gender inequality It s hard for government to admit that something it s doing might not work or that it s failed People are often running blind David Halpern UK Nudge UnitHow to

Industry insights and news straight to your inbox Across the world the workforce is growing In fact the number of women a cohort with low employment and activity rates between 15 and 64 years working or looking for work has increased globally in the past five years Despite this growth employers across the globe report skills shortages across a multitude of industries While skilled migration is at an all time high according to Hays Global Skills Index digitization is raising questions about who will do the work of tomorrow and what it will look like Over the next 10 to 20 years nearly half of jobs are at risk of being automated particularly in areas such as transportation and logistics office and admin support and manufacturing As AI machine learning and IoT becomes commonplace in professional environments it s critical that people have the skills to respond to these changes in a positive and productive way With such significant gaps in the contemporary workforce governments are creating initiatives to tackle this growing skills shortage by linking education and business to cultivate the employees of the future With the tagline Realise Your Aspirations SkillsFuture is 100 committed to giving Singaporeans the best possible professional opportunities imaginable This national movement to works to provide businesses and individuals with choices to maximize their skills on a continuous basis regardless of their existing knowledge base or starting points SkillsFuture understands that the skills passion and contribution of each individual will drive Singapore s next phase of development towards an advanced thriving economy and an inclusive forward thinking society SkillsFuture not only offers a number of tailored programmes for professionals at all stages of their careers as well as employers and training providers but its e services also help encourage individuals to adopt a lifelong learning mindset The SkillsFuture Credit initiative provides Singaporeans aged 25 and over with an opening credit of S 500 This course credit doesn t expire and the government provides periodic top ups to help engaged lifelong learners accumulate more platform funding to continue their education Result In 2016 126 000 Singaporeans used SkillsFuture credit to enhance their digital careers the scheme s inaugural year More than 34 of applicants used the scheme more than once It s clear to see that SkillsFuture learning model is inspiring positive results and as more people use the scheme the stronger a digital nation Singapore will become The primary objective of Tamkeen is to enhance the skill sets of Bahrainis to make them the employees of choice By offering individuals and enterprises a range of professional certifications and flexible training options through an interactive user portal Tamkeen is helping to drive the future prosperity of its nation s workforce There are three core areas of focus Students To guide and support students to help them make informed decisions about their educational or occupational choices through various schemes involving partnerships with key stakeholders including the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Youth Sports Affairs Jobseekers To provide the fundamental skills and give jobseekers the power to acquire professional qualifications that will ultimately enhance their employability These programmes also offer valuable insights about job hunting CV writing and job interview etiquette Employees To support will help upskill professionals to increase their chances of career development or career progression by using grants and advisory services Result With over 200 programmes currently in operation and an international skills collaboration with the U S underway Tamkeen is set to enrich the skillset of digital learners both on home soil and overseas Skills Development Scotland is an initiative that values the power of diversity and inclusion in the modern workplace With over 1 200 colleagues working across the nation in schools careers centers and designated partner locations SDS Fund is dedicated to developing the skills of individuals and businesses in a multitude of sectors working to make a critical contribution to a bright prosperous and healthy Scottish economy SDS works with organizations to offer tailored advice and solutions based on their personal needs giving employees access to a service that will help them gain more knowledge confidence and competency in a challenging digital environment The SDS Fund works with its partner BEMIS to ensure its dedication to inclusion and diversity is maintained throughout its various programmes courses and apprenticeships something that is essential to growth progress and development Result According to an SDS Fund Progress report in 2015 alone the initiative helped 400 people understand more about and access community services and offered training and materials have been made available to around 272 individuals that needed support And as the scheme picks up momentum big outcomes are expected for 2018 Managed by Pembangunan Sumber Manusia Berhad Malaysia s HRDF is at the forefront of upskilling and reskilling the nation In line with the 11th Malaysia Plan the government has initiated a number of programs that focus on accelerating human capital development in 4 core areas Working in conjunction with the government HRDF offers tailored educational solutions to organizations across the nation providing training in e learning industrial training computer based training coaching and mentoring and more Result The HRDF has pledged to contribute 35 skilled Malaysian labor force as well as the generation of 1 5 million jobs by 2020 And with its current initiatives in place success seems likely Ireland s government driven educational initiative provides a choice of around 208 free part time and intensive conversion courses in the realms of higher education from certificate to degree to postgraduate level By giving professionals the opportunity to acquire priceless digital skills in key areas that are linked to their expertise of choice Springboard aims to close Ireland s digital skills gap helping to foster a new breed of professionals those that can continue to thrive in an ever evolving digital landscape Result 96 of graduates would recommend Springboard to other job seekers a testament to the value of its educational offerings and the organization s blog not only offers a content to help its students stay abreast of digital developments but it also offers practical information about using the platform itself With the number of full time undergraduate students in Ireland increasing by 10 in a relatively short period of time there is plenty of scope for Springboard to help accelerate Ireland s digital skills progress even further Dedicated to the growth and development of digital skills the Tech Partnership exists to cultivate the digital professionals of tomorrow and its membership is free to all employers of tech professionals in the UK This innovative partnership is a network of employers working in close collaboration with one common goal to create the skills needed to push the UK digital economy forward Despite the fact that the Tech Partnership is ending this year the scheme s ambition lies in delivering the skills for a million digital jobs by 2025 No one business can achieve this on its own and the partnership s collaborative approach will help upskill workers across a range of sectors in a practical and positive way The Tech Partnership works with a number of innovative companies including BT Speaking on the partnership BT Group Chief Executive Gavin Patterson said We are particularly pleased that industry will have the opportunity to build on its work within the Tech Partnership and our existing degree apprenticeship schemes setting standards and promoting degrees that are aligned to employer needs By offering a range of relevant degrees and apprenticeships as well as access to basic digital skills the Tech Partnership works to set the standards for digital skills in the UK in a bid to nurture the talent of the nation s budding professionals Result With the Prime Minister recently announcing the 20 million Institute of Coding formed by businesses including IBM Cisco and Microsoft it s clear to see that governing bodies in the UK and beyond are starting to stand up and take notice of the world s digital skills gap These six initiatives take slightly different approaches but they all have one thing in common to build tomorrow s digital workforce by offering innovative continuous valuable sustainable and accessible education to today s budding professional And that is the most important thing of all Keep up to date with industry insights and latest news Sitemap Terms Conditions Privacy Policy Digital Marketing Institute 2019In late November 2018 I delivered the opening keynote at the Future of Work 2018 Conference hosted by the University of Melbourne Center for Workplace Leadership 1 where I described how to keep people at the center of the future of work discussion After my talk find a video of the 45 minute keynote here I was interviewed for a short video segment to share the highlights In preparing for the interview I found the questions to explore a thoughtful comprehensive look at the scope of the discussion on the future of work and thus I wanted to share my answers I am interested in your reactions Do you agree with my thoughts Disagree Why What are some examples of human centric approaches to work within areas of high automation I would approach this question differently While there are some jobs that might have a higher likelihood of automation than others especially those contain significant amounts of routine tasks 2 the World Economic Forum has recently predicted that greater than 50 of all jobs will require significant reskilling and upskilling by 2022 3 This means we will need to consider more human centric approaches in most jobs not just those with a higher proportion of tasks that could be automated In the research I ve been conducting in partnership with Bill Eggers and Amrita Datar from Deloitte and Carlos Teixeira from the Harvard Kennedy School through my current part time fellowship with the Harvard Kennedy School digitalHKS initiative we ve envisioned 6 government jobs of the future with a method that puts humans back at the center for both new and changing jobs Putting the worker first we envision future jobs to place human machine coordination at the core in order to improve productivity and decision making while also increasing the well being of the workers themselves The trick is not to think about what can be automated but also what can be augmented If a human s time could be freed up what higher order value could be accomplished with uniquely human skills Might we be able to deliver more value than human machine coordination than through humans alone or machines alone For example Child case workers in Colorado currently spend less than 10 percent of their work time actually interacting with children and families This impacts their ability to most effectively protect vulnerable children and coordinate services for those children Case workers today spend a large percentage of their time on administrative tasks Our research has envisioned a future where administrative burdens are reduced with the application of technologies to increase the time spent on higher valued work for the customer For example some technology applications could include case management systems powered by cognitive computing to ease scheduling and follow up voice based smart assistants that document case notes after an appointment while the future child aid coordinator travels between appointments robotic process automation tools that automatically process a client s eligibility for services on the fly and using predictive analytics and machine learning to prevent abuse neglect and ill treatment Child aid coordinators should be empowered to customize services for vulnerable children based on the child s own unique circumstances Spending more time with children and families is a critical part to increasing the value created by this work and by applying technology to free time from administrative tasks coordinators are able to spend more time problem solving for their customers What frightens you or stirs you the most about the shift from human power to machine power MIT Professor David A Mindell talks about three myths of 21st century robotics and automation in his book Our Robots Ourselves that I think are particularly relevant to shift the focus of this question The myth of linear progress the idea that technology evolves from direct human involvement into remote presence and then to fully autonomous systems The myth of replacement the idea that machines take over human jobs one for one Myth of full autonomy the utopian idea that robots today or in the future can operate entirely on their own 4 So there s a lot of fear mongering about how quickly and how extremely a shift to machine power will happen Also I think what we have to remind ourselves is that human power alone and machine power alone won t be as great as power achieved through human machine coordination To get the most value we need to design machines that have humans in the loop and empower humans to design work processes where machines are in the loop This is where the greatest value lies but is also where the challenge is because most organizations are not good at integrating new technologies into their business processes One reason they struggle with this not far from the only reason is significant workforce resistance when new technologies are forced on them This is where employees seeing WHY the change is important and why there is a benefit to them to re skill is important Another reason is because true user centered design in the technology development and deployment process is not common practice Organizations must embrace a user centered technology adoption mindset if technology initiatives are to succeed in improving the performance of an organization Co creating a visualization for the jobs of the future as occurs in the workshops Bill Amrita and I have developed can be a powerful tool to enable these actions How futuristic or progressive is the research in this area are we finding out the facts and figures too late There is a lot of research being done in this area but often in silos Conversations about future of work are often segmented between communities People building technologies focus on a technology enabled future Human capital and staffing professionals focus on how workforce changes are affecting the future of work Universities and educators focus on future skills and learning mindsets as being key enablers for the future The urgent need is to build bridges across these communities and research areas since I believe solutions will lie at the intersections of the complex topics including but not limited to Technology development robotics computer and data science engineering etc Economics and economic development policy local state and national Education and learning Workforce development policy Technology ethics Labor relations Business and public sector management Human centered design human factors Architecture and build environment design Business strategy Organizational design Performance management Organizational and Individual PsychologyMIT is one university trying to get ahead of this need for interdisciplinary action oriented research through the Task force on Work of the Future announced off earlier this year but significantly more work can be done in convening these communities for active solution development What s critical to do right now in ensuring the human evolves and doesn t disappear from meaningful work In the near term government employers employees and educators all have a role to play to design a future that is better for humans not worse Employees must not wait around for skill development to be presented to them by their employer a mindset of life long learning will be a key attribute for the future employee Learning doesn t necessarily mean traditional university higher education where costs are becoming unsustainable Learning can happen online through local boot camps by doing through micro courses designed to be taken on demand etc Employees must see that change is coming understand the new skills that will be required for them to succeed in a changed work world and feel empowered to take some of that learning on for themselves Now that s not to say that employers won t also have an important role to play in training employees in the skills of the future like AT T s 1B commitment to re train half of its workforce for the jobs of the future But McKinsey estimates that globally some 500M 900M future workers may need to move to new employers and sectors to find meaningful work 5 That transition will require some initiative on the part of the employee Thus we must create means for individuals to feel empowered and encouraged to do this and reduce fear of the future that could be paralyzing Educators act as a bridge between the future workforce and employers Being an effective bridge should involve identifying the salient knowledge skills and abilities required for the future of work and evolving curriculum and learning environments to prepare students for those futures This requires educators to have a keen understanding of the needs of industry Many institutes of higher education are also completely rethinking how they teach and how students learn and are making education to non traditional students more broadly available through online learning certifications and MOOCs Innovating the learning process itself and the funding model for learning is a critical role of educators and a role all educators should be moving to adopt in the near term Employers must step out of their comfort zone and think about a future where their potential workforce could include not only be full time human employees but contract employees the crowd strategic partnerships and machine intelligence How do you think about integrating the machine as part of the team How does this change the role and skills for managers How might humans and machines combined create a more valued product or service that you provide today The challenge is to not think about the application of machines as an efficiency gain to cut overall costs by reducing human labor but to think about how machines augment humans who can provide higher order cognitive value to the organization Employers should also actively engage their workforce in designing the jobs of the future jobs that use technology to augment current work and that add new value Current employees see problems on the front line and opportunities for additional value creation that management and senior leadership often doesn t see That front line intelligence should be incorporated into designing jobs of the future Designing a future organizational model that harnesses an agile way to leverage human machine coordination to add value is a business imperative Further employers have to be obsessed with creating a learning environment in their organizations This environment should teach existing employees how to fail fast and adapt to changing technologies and customer information regularly but also help new employees onboard much more quickly due to the increasing fluidity of the workforce and increasing incidence of telework remote teams Governments must set economic workforce development training education and technology policies that consider the interdisciplinary issues of the future of work But their role is not only limited to policy making through laws and executive orders They could also Leverage convening power to create a cross sector agenda Encourage experimentation at the state and local level as test beds for national policy Fund programs to re skill employees in parts of the economy that might not be able to afford to do it themselves like small to mid size manufacturers Consider government agency roles and responsibilities to see if policy making across different interdisciplinary areas should be better coordinated Encourage policy making that includes a participatory element to ensure the voices and values of the public not just organizational stakeholders are considered when evaluating policy solutions Ensure trade offs between technology ethics and societal values are considered in economic growth policies Initiate diplomatic efforts to address inequality issues in the future of work EtcMcKinsey 6 Bain 7 and others have also made recent recommendations on what these groups can do to prepare for the future of work How do we rein in the growth of inequality as technology shifts the balance of power and opportunity in society New technology throughout history has been accompanied by fear of that technology Malcolm Frank and others in their book What to Do when Machines do Everything note Many seem to forget that throughout history automation has provided a net benefit to society In the process of automating our work and our society through generation after generation three positive things have repeatedly occurred 1 A new abundance has been created sales of products and services produced by automation now vastly more affordable and of higher quality skyrocket2 With the new abundance overall employment rises even when there is less labor input per unit 3 Society gains a net benefit with higher living standards created by newly affordable products and services 8 However this fourth work revolution does have some unique issues to consider with respect to furthering inequality A primary issue involves the coding of biases into future decision making structures and thus significant discussions have emerged on the ethical use of AI This discussion can often be about how to ensure that the algorithm developers aren t coding their own personal biases into technologies But it can also be about the data that we are using to train our AI if training data is biased or not representative of broader society then we could be making incorrect diagnoses faster or forgetting entire populations in the future we re optimizing for For example a 2010 report from the University of British Columbia warned against the danger of assuming that all of humanity s psychology closely matches the behaviors of 20 something college students They cite evidence that between 2003 and 2007 undergrads made up 80 percent of study subjects in six top psychology journals and that 96 percent of all psychology samples come from countries that make up only 12 percent of the world s population 9 The researchers refer to the sample population as mostly coming from Western Educated Industrialized Rich Democratic WEIRD populations So if a future AI therapist were trained off this data set the accuracy of diagnosis and the effectiveness of treatment may likely underperform with underrepresented communities in the dataset We must be vigilant against potential bias both in our training research data as well as the humans coding the rules else we are likely to further encourage inequitable application of technology What can only humans do and how will this change improve be compromised in the future work economy Humans are still vastly better at problem solving communication knowledge sharing collaboration leadership creativity empathy and the ability to cope with ambiguity and uncertainty 10 In some jobs that conduct routine cognitive tasks machines can actually become smarter than humans when powered by vast amounts of data These jobs may include call centers auditing insurance underwriting and basic tax preparation Some creative cognitive jobs may also be replaced For example powered by significant amounts of viewer data Netflix can set the parameters to create new TV series and movies they know will be enjoyed by their population As described by Jessica Brillhart AI is also creating beautiful art This means humans will need to perform more sophisticated cognitive tasks in the future of work Mohanbir Sawhney suggests a few such jobs in Forbes like managing and designing the future human machine teams and jobs that require social intelligence like providing care to humans nurses counselors physical therapists Also he notes as technology improves the quality of life for society humans may have more free time for leisure which could increase employment in the entertainment and leisure industries 11 All previous work revolutions agricultural and industrial have unlocked new industries and thus new opportunities for jobs while improving the overall quality of life of society though there could be much vigorous debate on the nuances of this statement If history is our guide we would expect to see the same net change over time though the times that society undergoes that transition can be very difficult The relatively good news here is that the transition may be quick occurring within one person s lifetime and not over the course of three lifetimes like previous revolutions This will significantly impact a generation but the overall transition time may be shorter Thus we have an urgent need to act now to minimize the negative effects on this generation with overall progress vigorous guard against embedded bias and human quality of life and equity top of mind References 1 Important Note My work on the

rethinking the whole nature of work And we need to deal with the massive transitions that are happening in the world of work if we re gonna have a healthy society over the coming decades So how we used to farm was a lot of manual labour and the equipment was getting old and we re dealing with breakdown So we were able to build this facility it s a big technology advancement compared to how we used to farm and now we re able to do less time choring and do other work instead so we re more efficient and it s just a more humane way to harvest milk Sensequake is making cities safer and smarter by combining sensors AI and data analysis to perform structural health monitoring and determine the integrity and natural hazard vulnerability of a structure More and more workplaces are going to need the technologies that are emerging now and in the future And having knowledge of these new technologies is going to be crucial in every sector Skills development is vital right now What skills are we embedding inside of our youth today in order to service these applications service these robots Where are we giving that experiential learning Hopefully there s growth in the dairy industry if we were to stay in our old facility we wouldn t be able to grow it would be a lot of labour milking fewer cows and I d be a last generation farmer I think that Canada has some unique opportunities to be

economic trends will reshape labour markets we will have a better understanding of what we should be emphasizing in our educational and training systems to be as well prepared as possible for tomorrow s world Rapid advances in artificial intelligence and robotics have in particular created a new momentum to understand exactly how widespread the impacts of technology will be on jobs But what if this focus is misplaced The inherent unpredictability of technological progress means that even within the literature on automation there are projected ranges for developed countries from 5 percent of jobs to 50 percent of jobs being at risk of automation with figures even higher than this for developing countries The timeframes for these impacts are similarly broad ranging from 10 20 years to 50 years in other estimates Layered onto the direct uncertainty around depth of impacts and timescale are unanswerable questions around the social norms and preferences which may influence how quickly if at all technological solutions replace humans Then there is the question of technologies that are still at nascent stages or that will only emerge in the coming years Will emerging technologies such as blockchain make intermediaries like Airbnb and Uber less relevant in 2 years or 10 years How quickly will autonomous vehicles eliminate the jobs of drivers around the world Uncertainty makes policy responses to specific potential outcomes challenging and makes the need for non path dependent responses critical These challenges are exacerbated by the cross cutting nature of the future of work policy issue touching as it does on economic social regulatory and technological issues A forthcoming report from the Mowat Centre at the University of Toronto argues that policymakers should focus their attention on upgrading the systems that support workers and young people and ensuring those systems are prepared to thrive in a world of increased uncertainty volatility and disruption Whether the primary and secondary education systems unemployment and training schemes or housing health and social supports existing policy and service delivery frameworks in many countries were designed for the industrial age and do not take advantage of nor reflect the digital age in which we live today Policymakers should focus their attention on upgrading the systems that support workers and young people and ensuring those systems are prepared to thrive in a world of increased uncertainty volatility and disruption For instance unemployment schemes in both Canada and America are straining to meet the needs of labour markets characterized by more part time temporary and contract workers Both countries are at record low rates of coverage for income supports for the unemployed Fewer than one in three unemployed Americans now receive benefits and for those who qualify benefits replace a smaller percentage of wages than before 2 Similarly only 39 percent of unemployed Canadians receive regular benefits down from over 80 percent in 1978 3 As more workers are engaged in non standard forms of employment fewer workers are completing enough hours to pass eligibility thresholds Those who do qualify often do not receive payments for very long Developing unemployment programs that provide more targeted outcomes based and personalized supports is only going to become more pressing in a future where we can expect more workers in the contingent on demand workforce Reforms that focus on developing systems that are resilient and responsive are more likely to have relevance than re orienting programs around predictions about what types of occupations are likely to be in demand 10 or 20 years from now A clear example of the risks of future casting skills and occupations presents itself in the area of computer programming Governments from New York to England to Singapore have decided that coding will be a growth area in the economy and that they should begin to train young children to acquire these skills While there may well be value in training more young people to be comfortable with computers and how they work and skills such as problem solving and logic can be enhanced through such efforts there is an open question about whether coding will actually be an area where humans will have much of a role in the future As American software entrepreneur Mark Cuban has observed coding could well be automated within five years and a better focus for skills development could be creative thinking 4 Which brings us back to the original conundrum future casting skills is hugely challenging and future casting skills overlaid against occupations likely to be in demand is even more difficult The significant time and effort involved in re orienting educational systems from the primary to tertiary levels means that policymakers who get their projections wrong could have an entire generation with skills that are not particularly useful For policymakers facing an uncertain future the best course is to redesign the systems that will support workers and young people engaged in the work force or preparing to enter it Many of the changes that are required across policy and service delivery frameworks will have the added benefit of not just laying the groundwork for the future but also addressing the real and pressing needs of those who are ill served today by schemes that were designed for a different time What particular characteristics should inform the design of social and employment supports Successful programs and systems in the future will be Two promising examples of new interventions that align with these criteria are Singapore s SkillsFuture program and France s Personal Activity Accounts Both programs are designed to provide citizens with easier access to services that they need when they need them Singapore s program provides a digital platform for citizens to access lifelong learning resources including information about education and training opportunities integrated training supports and an individualized credit of 500 that is periodically topped up by the government for skills development The French model provides customized training supports and credits for people facing different life situations including the employed education system drop outs and those who engage in voluntary and charitable work The ability of governments to pivot programs towards these types of models delivering targeted programs quickly adjusting them on the fly based on rigorous evaluation and partnering with other societal actors should be the primary focus of reform in the short to medium term Anticipating specific competencies and hard skills which will be in demand in the future and re aligning training and educational systems towards them should be undertaken with extreme caution In the longer term exploring the effectiveness of more transformative approaches such as a guaranteed annual income may be required But adjusting existing supports to better reflect today s world of work will go a significant ways towards addressing concerns about the future of work currently bedeviling policymakers around the world The more those supports are customized digital integrated focused on outcomes and rigorously evaluated the more likely it is they will meet the challenges of an uncertain ever evolving future This piece was originally published in The Future of Work in the Global South edited by Hernan Galperin and Andrea Alarcon International Development Research Centre 2017 Sunil JohalJan
