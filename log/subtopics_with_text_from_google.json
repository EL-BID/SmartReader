by unlocking their people s potential Automation and artificial intelligence AI are transforming businesses and will contribute to economic growth via contributions to productivity They will also help address moonshot societal challenges in areas from health to climate change At the same time these technologies will transform the nature of work and the workplace itself Machines will be able to carry out more of the tasks done by humans complement the work that humans do and even perform some tasks that go beyond what humans can do As a result some occupations will decline others will grow and many more will change While we believe there will be enough work to go around barring extreme scenarios society will need to grapple with significant workforce transitions and dislocation Workers will need to acquire new skills and adapt to the increasingly capable machines alongside them in the workplace They may have to move from declining occupations to growing and in some cases new occupations This executive briefing which draws on the latest research from the McKinsey Global Institute examines both the promise and the challenge of automation and AI in the workplace and outlines some of the critical issues that policy makers companies and individuals will need to solve for Automation and AI are not new but recent technological progress is pushing the frontier of what machines can do Our research suggests that society needs these improvements to provide value for businesses contribute to economic growth and make once unimaginable progress on some of our most difficult societal challenges In summary Beyond traditional industrial automation and advanced robots new generations of more capable autonomous systems are appearing in environments ranging from autonomous vehicles on roads to automated check outs in grocery stores Much of this progress has been driven by improvements in systems and components including mechanics sensors and software AI has made especially large strides in recent years as machine learning algorithms have become more sophisticated and made use of huge increases in computing power and of the exponential growth in data available to train them Spectacular breakthroughs are making headlines many involving beyond human capabilities in computer vision natural language processing and complex games such as Go These technologies are already generating value in various products and services and companies across sectors use them in an array of processes to personalize product recommendations find anomalies in production identify fraudulent transactions and more The latest generation of AI advances including techniques that address classification estimation and clustering problems promises significantly more value still An analysis we conducted of several hundred AI use cases found that the most advanced deep learning techniques deploying artificial neural networks could account for as much as 3 5 trillion to 5 8 trillion in annual value or 40 percent of the value created by all analytics techniques Exhibit 1 Deployment of AI and automation technologies can do much to lift the global economy and increase global prosperity at a time when aging and falling birth rates are acting as a drag on growth Labor productivity growth a key driver of economic growth has slowed in many economies dropping to an average of 0 5 percent in 2010 2014 from 2 4 percent a decade earlier in the United States and major European economies in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis after a previous productivity boom had waned AI and automation have the potential to reverse that decline productivity growth could potentially reach 2 percent annually over the next decade with 60 percent of this increase from digital opportunities AI is also being used in areas ranging from material science to medical research and climate science Application of the technologies in these and other disciplines could help tackle societal moonshot challenges For example researchers at Geisinger have developed an algorithm that could reduce diagnostic times for intracranial hemorrhaging by up to 96 percent Researchers at George Washington University meanwhile are using machine learning to more accurately weight the climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AI and automation still face challenges The limitations are partly technical such as the need for massive training data and difficulties generalizing algorithms across use cases Recent innovations are just starting to address these issues Other challenges are in the use of AI techniques For example explaining decisions made by machine learning algorithms is technically challenging which particularly matters for use cases involving financial lending or legal applications Potential bias in the training data and algorithms as well as data privacy malicious use and security are all issues that must be addressed Europe is leading with the new General Data Protection Regulation which codifies more rights for users over data collection and usage A different sort of challenge concerns the ability of organizations to adopt these technologies where people data availability technology and process readiness often make it difficult Adoption is already uneven across sectors and countries The finance automotive and telecommunications sectors lead AI adoption Among countries US investment in AI ranked first at 15 billion to 23 billion in 2016 followed by Asia s investments of 8 billion to 12 billion with Europe lagging behind at 3 billion to 4 billion Even as AI and automation bring benefits to business and society we will need to prepare for major disruptions to work Our analysis of more than 2000 work activities across more than 800 occupations shows that certain categories of activities are more easily automatable than others They include physical activities in highly predictable and structured environments as well as data collection and data processing These account for roughly half of the activities that people do across all sectors The least susceptible categories include managing others providing expertise and interfacing with stakeholders Nearly all occupations will be affected by automation but only about 5 percent of occupations could be fully automated by currently demonstrated technologies Many more occupations have portions of their constituent activities that are automatable we find that about 30 percent of the activities in 60 percent of all occupations could be automated This means that most workers from welders to mortgage brokers to CEOs will work alongside rapidly evolving machines The nature of these occupations will likely change as a result Automation will displace some workers We have found that around 15 percent of the global workforce or about 400 million workers could be displaced by automation in the period 2016 2030 This reflects our midpoint scenario in projecting the pace and scope of adoption Under the fastest scenario we have modeled that figure rises to 30 percent or 800 million workers In our slowest adoption scenario only about 10 million people would be displaced close to zero percent of the global workforce Exhibit 2 The wide range underscores the multiple factors that will impact the pace and scope of AI and automation adoption Technical feasibility of automation is only the first influencing factor Other factors include the cost of deployment labor market dynamics including labor supply quantity quality and the associated wages the benefits beyond labor substitution that contribute to business cases for adoption and finally social norms and acceptance Adoption will continue to vary significantly across countries and sectors because of differences in the above factors especially labor market dynamics in advanced economies with relatively high wage levels such as France Japan and the United States automation could displace 20 to 25 percent of the workforce by 2030 in a midpoint adoption scenario more than double the rate in India Even as workers are displaced there will be growth in demand for work and consequently jobs We developed scenarios for labor demand to 2030 from several catalysts of demand for work including rising incomes increased spending on healthcare and continuing or stepped up investment in infrastructure energy and technology development and deployment These scenarios showed a range of additional labor demand of between 21 percent to 33 percent of the global workforce 555 million and 890 million jobs to 2030 more than offsetting the numbers of jobs lost Some of the largest gains will be in emerging economies such as India where the working age population is already growing rapidly Additional economic growth including from business dynamism and rising productivity growth will also continue to create jobs Many other new occupations that we cannot currently imagine will also emerge and may account for as much as 10 percent of jobs created by 2030 if history is a guide Moreover technology itself has historically been a net job creator For example the introduction of the personal computer in the 1970s and 1980s created millions of jobs not just for semiconductor makers but also for software and app developers of all types customer service representatives and information analysts Partial automation will become more prevalent as machines complement human labor For example AI algorithms that can read diagnostic scans with a high degree of accuracy will help doctors diagnose patient cases and identify suitable treatment In other fields jobs with repetitive tasks could shift toward a model of managing and troubleshooting automated systems At retailer Amazon employees who previously lifted and stacked objects are becoming robot operators monitoring the automated arms and resolving issues such as an interruption in the flow of objects While we expect there will be enough work to ensure full employment in 2030 based on most of our scenarios the transitions that will accompany automation and AI adoption will be significant The mix of occupations will change as will skill and educational requirements Work will need to be redesigned to ensure that humans work alongside machines most effectively Automation will accelerate the shift in required workforce skills we have seen over the past 15 years Demand for advanced technological skills such as programming will grow rapidly Social emotional and higher cognitive skills such as creativity critical thinking and complex information processing will also see growing demand Basic digital skills demand has been increasing and that trend will continue and accelerate Demand for physical and manual skills will decline but will remain the single largest category of workforce skills in 2030 in many countries Exhibit 3 This will put additional pressure on the already existing workforce skills challenge as well as the need for new credentialing systems While some innovative solutions are emerging solutions that can match the scale of the challenge will be needed Our research suggests that in a midpoint scenario around 3 percent of the global workforce will need to change occupational categories by 2030 though scenarios range from about 0 to 14 percent Some of these shifts will happen within companies and sectors but many will occur across sectors and even geographies Occupations made up of physical activities in highly structured environments or in data processing or collection will see declines Growing occupations will include those with difficult to automate activities such as managers and those in unpredictable physical environments such as plumbers Other occupations that will see increasing demand for work include teachers nursing aides and tech and other professionals As intelligent machines and software are integrated more deeply into the workplace workflows and workspaces will continue to evolve to enable humans and machines to work together As self checkout machines are introduced in stores for example cashiers can become checkout assistance helpers who can help answer questions or troubleshoot the machines More system level solutions will prompt rethinking of the entire workflow and workspace Warehouse design may change significantly as some portions are designed to accommodate primarily robots and others to facilitate safe human machine interaction The occupational mix shifts will likely put pressure on wages Many of the current middle wage jobs in advanced economies are dominated by highly automatable activities such as in manufacturing or in accounting which are likely to decline High wage jobs will grow significantly especially for high skill medical and tech or other professionals but a large portion of jobs expected to be created including teachers and nursing aides typically have lower wage structures The risk is that automation could exacerbate wage polarization income inequality and the lack of income advancement that has characterized the past decade across advanced economies stoking social and political tensions Most countries already face the challenge of adequately educating and training their workforces to meet the current requirements of employers Across the OECD spending on worker education and training has been declining over the last two decades Spending on worker transition and dislocation assistance has also continued to shrink as a percentage of GDP One lesson of the past decade is that while globalization may have benefited economic growth and people as consumers the wage and dislocation effects on workers were not adequately addressed Most analyses including our own suggest that the scale of these issues is likely to grow in the coming decades We have also seen in the past that large scale workforce transitions can have a lasting effect on wages during the 19th century Industrial Revolution wages in the United Kingdom remained stagnant for about half a century despite rising productivity a phenomenon known as Engels Pause PDF 690KB after the German philosopher who identified it In the search for appropriate measures and policies to address these challenges we should not seek to roll back or slow diffusion of the technologies Companies and governments should harness automation and AI to benefit from the enhanced performance and productivity contributions as well as the societal benefits These technologies will create the economic surpluses that will help societies manage workforce transitions Rather the focus should be on ways to ensure that the workforce transitions are as smooth as possible This is likely to require actionable and scalable solutions in several key areas There is work for everyone today and there will be work for everyone tomorrow even in a future with automation Yet that work will be different requiring new skills and a far greater adaptability of the workforce than we have seen Training and retraining both midcareer workers and new generations for the coming challenges will be an imperative Government private sector leaders and innovators all need to work together to better coordinate public and private initiatives including creating the right incentives to invest more in human capital The future with automation and AI will be challenging but a much richer one if we harness the technologies with aplomb and mitigate the negative effects James Manyika is chairman and

trapped in a room with its mate looks uncannily like a dog well maybe a mutant dog with a canary yellow body and a proboscis sticking out where its head should be The robot confidently scurries to the door raises itself to the perfect height and then uses its appendage to press down the handle Pulling open the door the robot allows its mate to be first across the threshold before the two of them make their dash for freedom Such is the content of a short video by Boston Dynamics that has gone viral since it was released in February Reactions to it on social media have ranged from amusement soon they ll be opening our fridges and stealing our beer to alarm this is how we die It is the latest evidence of recent remarkable advances in robotics and artificial intelligence robots can now perform backflips and ride bicycles and machines empowered by AI are able to analyze X ray images better than expert radiologists and to teach themselves to play the ancient game of Go better than world champions Yet the dog clip is also powerful because it conjures up a more worrisome vision of robots on the loose beyond the control of us humans Thus it plays into a powerful angst laden contemporary narrative about technology and the future of work and maybe even of mankind itself What really are the risks from this new wave of technology And will the opportunities these advances bring with them outweigh those risks To address such questions about the future it is useful indeed necessary to look to the past Technology has for centuries both excited the human imagination and prompted fears about the effects Back in 1589 Queen Elizabeth I of England refused to grant a patent to a stocking frame invented by one William Lee because Her Majesty was concerned about the effect of the contraption on the livelihoods of those who knitted stockings by hand The Luddite weavers in Britain and silk workers in Lyons France famously staged revolts in the early 19th century against new automated looms that threatened their skilled and well paid jobs And in the realm of fiction imagination has run riot since the Czech writer Karel Capek coined the word robot from a Slavic word for work in his 1920 play Rossum s Universal Robots a k a RUR which ends with the destruction of mankind As one of Capek s characters explains Robots are not people Mechanically they are more perfect than we are they have an enormously developed intelligence but they have no soul For 100 percent of continuous 10 year periods in the United States technologically driven productivity gains have gone hand in hand with rising employment Almost a century later that same concern about soulless hyper intelligence infuses not just movies like The Matrix and mind bending video series like Philip K Dick s Electric Dreams but also warnings about AI and its potential consequences expressed by Elon Musk and the late Stephen Hawking among others Back in the 1950s the German philosopher Martin Heidegger fretted about the risk that humans would become enslaved by the technologies we rely on With the rise of machines able to mimic many human traits from speech albeit still falteringly to facial recognition already significantly more accurately than humans that time appears to be much closer Yet when we switch from philosophy to economics we find a very different story a long historical record of innovation that shows technological change has been overwhelmingly positive for productivity and surprisingly benign when it comes to employment Job displacement has occurred in waves first with the structural shift from agriculture to manufacturing and then with the move from manufacturing to services Throughout productivity gains generated by new technology have been reinvested and the GDP bounce from that productivity eventually raises consumption and on balance increases the demand for labor In McKinsey s research we have sought to quantify this trend and its net impact in several ways For example we looked at the very big picture what happened to employment as productivity grew over the past 50 years We found no tradeoff between the two for 100 percent of continuous 10 year periods in the United States technologically driven productivity gains have gone hand in hand with rising employment Even when measured in one year snapshots productivity and employment have risen together four years in five The personal computer provides an iconic case to support the compatibility of technological progress with job growth We measured how many jobs were lost and how many gained in the United States between 1980 and 2015 as a result of the diffusion of computer technology Several hundred thousand bookkeepers and auditing clerks secretaries and typists did lose their jobs But the overall balance was strongly positive the desktop laptop computer created more than 19 million jobs in industries ranging from computer hardware to enterprise software to online retail sales against the loss of about 3 5 million jobs a net gain of 15 7 million That figure amounts to 18 percent of all the net U S employment created in the period almost one in five jobs Something similar happened with the invention of the automobile which destroyed the horse and buggy business but gave rise to a wealth of new sometimes unimagined products from petroleum based synthetic rubber to motels That said we ignore those left along the way at our peril For the many workers who are displaced painful transitions are a reality In Britain during the industrial revolution starting in about 1800 wages of the masses stagnated for almost a half century despite a strong surge in productivity that enriched the owners of capital a phenomenon often referred to as Engels pause because it was first noted by the German philosopher who co authored with Karl Marx The Communist Manifesto Wages picked up again as the fruits of productivity gains eventually trickled down to workers But eventually can be a long time the Luddites fears were not entirely unfounded And once again today the link between productivity gains and wage growth seems bent if not broken U S median hourly compensation rose only 11 percent from 1973 to 2016 even as hourly labor productivity grew by 75 percent While it is natural to focus on labor displacement through technology one element often overlooked in the discussion of the future of work is the number of jobs that are neither lost nor gained but fundamentally changed for reasons that are hard to predict History again provides some examples When ATMs became as common as vending machines in the 1970s the number of bank tellers actually increased That s because the new technology reduced the costs of processing individual transactions giving the banks incentives to open more branches to meet local demand for other financial services The tellers primary tasks changed from cashing checks and taking deposits to providing advice and selling securities mortgages and the like To be sure this tale is not yet complete with the rise of online banking the demand for tellers has again waned and so their numbers have thinned especially after the 2008 financial crisis But modern economies are nothing if not dynamic and the only certainty is change There s a similar story to be told about jobs and information technology Thanks to the internet and some ingenious software anyone can now dig up information at the blink of a cursor Yet the need for data analysis has exploded even as the need for data gathering clerks and the like has plummeted And so the number of information analysts of the genus homo sapiens has quintupled since 1980 to about two million today This largely comforting history isn t much help in determining whether this time will be different To the point the rise of ever more sophisticated technologies especially artificial intelligence that can be brought to bear on any number of tasks is likely to usher in a new age of rapid workforce transitions The McKinsey Global Institute recently estimated that in our fastest automation adoption scenario as many as 375 million workers worldwide or about 14 percent of the global workforce will need to switch occupational categories by 2030 in order to avoid obsolescence Even if the pace of adoption is slower as in our midpoint scenario some 75 million workers will need to switch occupational categories in the next 10 to 15 years Among the work most vulnerable to automation jobs that require routinized physical activity in a predictable setting and collecting and processing data Some aspects of the current technological transformation seem in line with that of previous eras the rise of computers for example and earlier epochs of technical change such as the diffusion of the steam engine that transformed work across multiple sectors of the economy simultaneously Every new wave of automation seems remarkable at the time and AI is not the first technology to chip away at cognitive tasks Since the birth of computerized spreadsheets in the 1980s machines have tackled ever more sophisticated problems that previously required human brainpower Still other aspects of the new technologies do seem qualitatively different from previous waves of innovation The rate of technological change today is strikingly rapid and while hard to measure appears to be accelerating Consider in this regard the development of deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques based on neural networks the exponential increase in computing capacity made available through the cloud and the sheer volume of data that can be generated These advances are driving AI for example enabling the development of autonomous vehicles but also heralding breakthrough applications such as a heightened ability to diagnose disease with non invasive techniques Accordingly the share of jobs that could be automated could also be larger than historical precedents suggest The future of work looks set to be not a tale of machines replacing humans but of machines complementing humans in the workplace That said we see no evidence to date suggesting that the time it takes for new technologies to be diffused throughout the economy is shrinking Looking at a range of high value technologies over the past 60 years from airbags to MRI machines to smartphones we find that the pace of adoption hasn t changed It still takes between 5 and 16 years to reach 50 percent adoption and 5 to 28 years to reach 80 percent adoption Even highly popular social media applications do not beat this clock Facebook for example was begun in 2004 and had attracted more than 2 2 billion followers 13 years later but the untapped market remains vast Consider too that new technology is rarely applied to a blank canvas a variety of economic and social factors play a big role in determining the pace of adoption They include the cost of developing and deploying the hardware and software labor market dynamics the regulatory environment and social acceptance Computer algorithms in state of the art technology aircraft can do just about anything asked of them without a helping hand but we still insist on humans in the cockpit for peace of mind And who wants to be cared for in a hospital solely by a robot We remain disconcerted by the uncanny valley the term coined by the Japanese robotics guru Masahiro Mori to characterize that unsettling feeling people may experience when facing humanoid robots Indeed for tech luminaries ranging from the MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson to the former Google chairman Eric Schmidt the future of work looks set to be not a tale of machines replacing humans but of machines complementing humans in the workplace The rise of AI and the ascendance of self learned algorithms whose logic can be hard to explain pose some arguably unique problems A recent report from a who s who of experts on the malicious use of AI lists a number of the darkest scenarios from political manipulation through hyper personalized disinformation campaigns to a major increase in sophisticated computer hacking attacks For now AI pioneers including Google DeepMind s chief executive Demis Hassabis are clear that while machines are proving formidable in specific areas such as games we remain a long way away from the time when they will have mastered a general artificial intelligence enabling them to think and act like humans And a number of groups including Stanford University s AI100 with which I am associated are trying to look ahead to study and anticipate how AI will affect the way people live work and play long into the future The challenges here for policymakers and business leaders worldwide are significant We will need to institute retraining of workers on a scale we have not seen for generations We will need to rethink and adapt our social systems to help hundreds of millions of workers affected by the new technologies hopefully handling it better than we have handled globalization in providing both new forms of income and job transition support We will need to find ways to tame the wilder unpredictable side of AI For their part CEOs will need to rethink their organizational structures and processes to take advantage of the technologies and the performance enhancing effects they can have or risk ending up in the recycle bin of business history While all of this may seem intimidating it is still the best way forward We should embrace automation technologies for the productivity benefits they bring even as we deal proactively with the workforce transitions that will accompany adoption Given that demographic trends increased longevity low birth rates are rapidly increasing the dependent population our societies really need that productivity boost Beyond the prosperity and employment these technologies will create there will be other societal benefits new moonshots as we use the power of AI to tackle daunting problems from cancer to climate change We can already see one of the key challenges that of worker retraining or reskilling as some like to call it advancing to the top of the corporate agenda and in some countries also receiving renewed political attention In our recent work on the skills that will be needed by the workforce we found that demand will rise sharply not just for technological skills of all kinds but also for social and emotional skills that is leadership and empathy with customers as well as for higher cognitive skills linked to creativity and complex information processing Business leaders tell us that they believe finding the right talent to help implement automation is critical to their future financial performance and they expect companies to take the lead in the skills upgrade that is required Some firms are already putting in place large scale retraining initiatives AT T is using external education providers including for example Udacity At SAP the German enterprise software company the focus is on in house efforts to create learning journeys for thousands of employees including engineers who need to acquire softer skills as their roles change to service customers directly Walmart has set up more than 100 academies in the United States that provide hands on training for positions that include customer service managers and online grocery pickup While welcome these disparate retraining efforts are barely a start Given the scale of the occupational and skill shifts that we see coming in the next decade much more will need to be done and not just by business Governments and educational establishments working together with philanthropic foundations will of necessity be part of the mix Foundations have the advantage of being able to test innovative programs as pilots and will not face the disadvantage of concern that workers with new skills will subsequently jump ship for a new employer As a starter governments will need to reverse the 20 plus year decline in spending on labor related services no small task in light of tight government budgets and in the United States reflexive opposition to government intervention They will also need to be more flexible in order to adapt to the rapidly changing workplace Mobility is one key yet labor markets have become markedly less dynamic in recent years In the United States for example job reallocation rates have declined by 25 percent since 1990 This is the time to test ideas such as portable benefits that are owned by workers and not tied to particular jobs or companies Technology itself can help facilitate greater mobility especially digital platforms turbocharged by AI that enable matching of people to jobs But we also need to rethink some basic assumptions In order for changing jobs across sectors to become a common practice companies will need to agree on definitions and qualifications for specific skills And a major debate is overdue about credentialing Today higher education encourages the world to judge graduates by their subject knowledge rather than by their skills in problem solving and creative thinking skills that will be especially valuable in an AI enhanced workplace More than anything we need to prepare for this new era in which humans must work alongside smart machines far more intensively President Lyndon Johnson was prescient in this regard writing a half a century ago Automation is not our enemy Our enemies are ignorance indifference and inertia Automation can be the ally of our prosperity if we will just look ahead if we will understand what is to come and if we will set our course wisely after proper planning Back then nobody other than science fiction writers could have imagined robot dogs opening doors and escaping to wherever those androids from Blade Runner found refuge But LBJ s words resonate planning for change has never been

generally rises Erik Brynjolfsson Director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital EconomyThe rapid pace of technical advances and the increasing feasibility of automation has created questions about the future of work and its potential for displacing workers Estimates of the scale of threatened jobs over the next decade or two range from 9 to 47 according to a 2016 White House research report This is defined as those working in jobs where more than 70 of their activities can be automated On average nearly one half 46 of work activities in the country are currently automatable Share of Jobs with Highly Automatable Skills by EducationMost of this risk is concentrated among lower paid lower skilled and less educated workers Workers earning below 20 per hour face a greater than 80 chance of displacement More than two out of five workers without a high school degree have job skills that are considered highly automatable These projections should raise concerns about the ability of communities to tackle existing issues of social equity and affordable housing that could be exacerbated by automation Share of Jobs with High Probability of Automation by Occupation s Median Hourly WageJob tasks that are most susceptible include predictable physical tasks which make up 8 of all work tasks data processing 16 processing and data collection 17 On the other end of the spectrum work that either involves managing others 7 or applying expertise 14 proves the least susceptible However even these jobs aren t immune to some degree of automation This magnitude of shifts in work activities over multiple decades is not unprecedented The share of U S farm employment fell from 40 in 1900 to 2 in 2000 while the share of manufacturing employment fell from approximately 25 in 1950 to less than 10 in 2010 In both cases new activities and jobs were created that offset those that disappeared What may be unprecedented is the pace of the change and scale of people affected That said a decline in immigration to the United States and the aging population decline in the share of the working age population will open economic growth gaps at the same time that we re seeing job disruption due to automation We will see large scale shifts in workplace activities over the next century and these trends are already underway These shifts are inherent in automation technologies and also a consequence of a shifting labor demographic Millennials who already constitute the largest workforce population in the U S are demanding greater flexibility and autonomy than previous generations Building an educated workforce and rethinking our educational and training programs is the most critical task in preparing for the future of an automated world says Erik Brynjolfsson director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy and co author of The Second Machine Age Work Progress and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies Individuals will be required to have not only coding skills he says but also more diverse math reading interpersonal and creative skill sets According to the National League of Cities The Future of Work in Cities report nearly all 95 of the 11 6 million jobs that have been created since the last recession required some postsecondary education While science technology engineering and math STEM skills are emphasized many employers are also looking for primary and secondary educational systems to address gaps in workplace competencies like teamwork problem solving and communication STEM skills may power new technologies but the soft skills of collaboration critical thinking and interpersonal skills are vital components of the jobs likely to endure automation The balance of these skills will remain essential to prepare students with the human digital capabilities they will need As more restaurant orders are automated and shopping moves further online humans who work in these retail sectors will be expected to provide the customer with something extra something social to shift toward selling more personalized or unique experiences what the experts call the commodification of experience New technology and peer to peer platforms as well as a greater emphasis on personal craftsmanship and human ability have fueled the growth of a creative class of individuals capable of marketing their work from home This emphasis will likely continue to spread across the lower skilled labor market where individuality and a personal touch are valued and where services cannot be outsourced or easily automated Cities should encourage entrepreneurship and reduce barriers to innovation For example they can limit the number of occupational licenses necessary or streamline the process to get new licenses The 21st century worker will need a lifelong learning mindset to be successful and use digital resources to enable digital skills development The nation will need to reverse its declining investment in our workforce if we are going to sufficiently prepare people for future jobs in an era of automated work Scholarship Sacramento Valley Vision based in Sacramento created a comprehensive online platform of local scholarships for students who live in the Sacramento region to help address the growing costs of advanced education tuition at four year public colleges is up 33 since the 2007 08 school year They have identified approximately 350 000 in local scholarship funds in Sacramento County Since the program s inception in 2013 it has reached more than 1 000 students and their families with scholarship education and one on one and group mentoring Degrees At Work in Louisville In 2010 Louisville made a citywide commitment to add 55 000 college degrees 40 000 bachelor s and 15 000 associate degrees to its workforce by 2020 They first targeted the lowest hanging fruit the more than 90 000 local adults who had already completed some college coursework Degrees At Work aims to help 15 000 working adults earn degrees by 2020 working with local companies that have stepped up to provide tuition reimbursement college advising and flexible schedules for their employees Long Beach Internship

said at a Nov 29 FCW event on government modernization that 20 to 30 percent of all work activities will soon be automatable thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence He pointed to a Deloitte study of the federal workforce that found 4 3 billion hours are spent each year on a wide range of task and activities A huge share of those hours is devoted to essentially moving paper he said while relatively little time goes to coaching and other sorts of human activities But the study also found that four out of five of the most labor intensive activities have either a medium or high automation potential Eggers said That could allow for reductions in certain parts of the workforce he noted but it also frees up time for critical higher value work and the chance to deliver better service by giving the human workforce AI powered support Studies have repeatedly shown Eggers said that it s the human machine pairing that gives the best results he said The full video of

Bremmer warns the audience about the dangers of automation at an Intelligence Squared U S debate Can we all agree that Google Duplex demo was eerie A robot posing as a human being scheduled a reservation over the phone We all knew artificial intelligence was coming but it was breathtaking to hear software come to life Before we go any further let s get our terms straight Automation and artificial intelligence are not the same thing According to Dave Evans Automation is software that follows pre programmed rules Artificial intelligence is designed to simulate human thinking Automation in this context refers to the impact of artificial intelligence on tasks that only humans can perform today Even if you re skeptical of Google Duplex in light of the current backlash Alexa has made her way into millions of homes Amazon and Google are proving the value of artificial intelligence to consumers Apple still has a ways to go with Siri While Alexa won t take down the government there was a recent debate about the impact of automation on democracy that s worth watching Intelligence Squared U S features debates about current events Each episode puts forward a provocative motion like Automation Will Crash Democracy Two teams of two debate the motion There are polls conducted at the beginning and at the end of the debate A team wins by persuading audience members to change their opinion Ian Bremmer and Yascha Mounk argued for the motion insisting automation will crash democracy Andrew Keen and Alina Polyakova argued against the motion It s unclear whether the middle class can survive an AI revolution It could leave very few jobs for the masses In this scenario the rich would end up with even more power And without a middle class it s hard to sustain a healthy democracy Not scary enough for you Tech pioneers like Elon Musk and Bill Gates have spoken out about the dangers of artificial intelligence Although Gates thinks Musk should take it down a notch Musk is so concerned that he co founded OpenAI The nonprofit which he also chairs researches artificial intelligence to make the technology safer and more accessible Ian Bremmer one of the debate s participants recently published a bestselling book titled Us vs Them The Failure of Globalism Even though the motion didn t reference China Bremmer invoked the country for good reason Bremmer insists the US could be at a disadvantage Right now it s either Silicon Valley or it s China Those are the drivers of automation Since the actual government drives innovation in China they can leverage the technology and advance it The United States government doesn t have that level of control over its technology sector Moreover based on the recent Facebook hearings it s hard to imagine the US government confronting the threat of automation in a meaningful way Mounk fears a consolidation of power So I think that there s two different ways in which democracy might come under pressure The first is that there s going to be enclaves of very rich people who actually own all of the productive material in society which is the machines and robots and so on being asked to give up more and more money in order to finance that nice universal basic income scheme Throughout the debate he derides universal basic income as a program that can easily be abused Mounk thinks democracy is far fetched in this new world We ve only ever had democracy in the time period from the French Revolution until today when political leaders needed citizen armies when we could rely on average citizens to stand up to defend the country against enemies abroad and to keep the peace at home He believes the rich will protect themselves with their own robot armies and no longer need the middle class The counterarguments from Andrew Keen and Alina Polyakova were more optimistic Keen is an entrepreneur and author Polyakova is a fellow at the Brookings Institute They believe regulation will provide the proper guard rails for innovation That s why they reject all the doomsday scenarios that could result from automation Polyakova also has faith in new industries if we look at every technological revolution we see far more jobs created or people transitioning into a different industry versus just mass unemployment It s easy to hold the AI revolution up to the industrial revolution but it s different While I believe automation will create new jobs the current rate of change is so unprecedented it s hard to compare it to the past Both sides of the debate agree regulation can thwart many of the potential threats of automation It s unclear where the United States will find the political will to respond given its current legislative gridlock The artificial intelligence revolution will challenge America s system of government but it s still worth wondering can democracy survive Find out which team won the debate Watch it here Follow Theo on Twitter or go to Hit Start Media to listen

Darrell M West is author of the Brookings book The Future of Work Robots AI and Automation In Edward Bellamy s classic Looking Backward the protagonist Julian West wakes up from a 113 year slumber and finds the United States in 2000 has changed dramatically from 1887 People stop working at age forty five and devote their lives to mentoring other people and engaging in volunteer work that benefits the overall community There are short work weeks for employees and everyone receives full benefits food and housing 1 The reason is that new technologies of the period have enabled people to be very productive while working part time Businesses do not need large numbers of employees so individuals can devote most of their waking hours to hobbies volunteering and community service In conjunction with periodic work stints they have time to pursue new skills and personal identities that are independent of their jobs In the current era developed countries may be on the verge of a similar transition Robotics and machine learning have improved productivity and enhanced the economies of many nations Artificial intelligence AI has advanced into finance transportation defense and energy management The internet of things IoT is facilitated by high speed networks and remote sensors to connect people and businesses In all of this there is a possibility of a new era that could improve the lives of many people 2 Yet amid these possible benefits there is widespread fear that robots and AI will take jobs and throw millions of people into poverty A Pew Research Center study asked 1 896 experts about the impact of emerging technologies and found half of these experts 48 percent envision a future in which robots and digital agents will have displaced significant numbers of both blue and white collar workers with many expressing concern that this will lead to vast increases in income inequality masses of people who are effectively unemployable and breakdowns in the social order 3 These fears have been echoed by detailed analyses showing anywhere from a 14 to 54 percent automation impact on jobs For example a Bruegel analysis found that 54 of EU jobs are at risk of computerization 4 Using European data they argue that job losses are likely to be significant and people should prepare for large scale disruption Related Technology Innovation How artificial

will transform many sectors of life They studied 702 occupational groupings and found that 47 percent of U S workers have a high probability of seeing their jobs automated over the next 20 years 5 A McKinsey Global Institute analysis of 750 jobs concluded that 45 of paid activities could be automated using currently demonstrated technologies and 60 of occupations could have 30 or more of their processes automated 6 A more recent McKinsey report Jobs Lost Jobs Gained found that 30 percent of work activities could be automated by 2030 and up to 375 million workers worldwide could be affected by emerging technologies 7 Researchers at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD focused on tasks as opposed to jobs and found fewer job losses Using task related data from 32 OECD countries they estimated that 14 percent of jobs are highly automatable and another 32 have a significant risk of automation Although their job loss estimates are below those of other experts they concluded that low qualified workers are likely to bear the brunt of the adjustment costs as the automatibility of their jobs is higher compared to highly qualified workers 8 Related Books Going

2015While some dispute the dire predictions on grounds new positions will be created to offset the job losses the fact that all these major studies report significant workforce disruptions should be taken seriously If the employment impact falls at the 38 percent mean of these forecasts Western democracies likely could resort to authoritarianism as happened in some countries during the Great Depression of the 1930s in order to keep their restive populations in check If that happened wealthy elites would require armed guards security details and gated communities to protect themselves as is the case in poor countries today with high income inequality The United States would look like Syria or Iraq with armed bands of young men with few employment prospects other than war violence or theft Yet even if the job ramifications lie more at the low end of disruption the political consequences still will be severe Relatively small increases in unemployment or underemployment have an outsized political impact We saw that a decade ago when 10 percent unemployment during the Great Recession spawned the Tea party and eventually helped to make Donald Trump president With some workforce disruption virtually guaranteed by trends already underway it is safe to predict American politics will be chaotic and turbulent during the coming decades As innovation accelerates and public anxiety intensifies right wing and left wing populists will jockey for voter support Government control could gyrate between very conservative and very liberal leaders as each side blames a different set of scapegoats for economic outcomes voters don t like The calm and predictable politics of the post World War II era likely will become a distant memory as the American system moves

and Development Working Paper 189 2016 Donald Trump entered office on a promise to bring back jobs and lift up the white working class While 53 percent of Americans earning less than 30 000 a year voted for Hillary Clinton the counties she won made up 64 percent of America s GDP in 2015 Trump won over five times as many counties as Clinton but these counties constituted only 36 percent of America s GDP in 2015 Trump also surpassed Clinton in places where voters are most at risk of losing their jobs due to automation and won support among those who had already lost out as a result of technological changes in the workplace A National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that the more robots introduced in a commuting zone between 1993 and 2007 the more likely the area went to Trump However Trump s economic message and governance so far has focused almost entirely on job loss due to trade and he has said little on how automation challenges his constituency On the other hand Barack Obama warned in his final speech as president that the next wave of economic dislocation won t come from overseas It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes many good middle class jobs obsolete In the fall of 2016 the White House released a report on automation that outlined its likely impacts on lower wage earners and the prospects for deepened wage inequality Research from Oxford University predicts 47 percent of jobs are likely to be automated within a decade or two and a study by the McKinsey Global Institute finds that 46 percent of time spent on existing work activities will become automated However when asked about the threat of losing jobs to automation Secretary Treasury Steve Mnuchin said the issue is not even on our radar screen I m not worried at all Not everyone agrees Larry Summers who originally argued that automation would help the economy by creating new jobs has since stepped back from this position warning This isn t some future possibility This is something that s emerging before us right now MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson concurs This is the biggest challenge for our society for the next decade While much has been written on the policy challenges automation poses little has been written on the political dynamics it is likely to produce Unsurprisingly political leaders tend to shy away from discussing the issue It is difficult to antagonize technological advancement automation is often the result of corporate investment it yields growth and achieves efficiency and average Americans save on products and services as a result And some make the case that automation is not happening fast enough citing dismal productivity gains The competing theses on the likely effects of automation differ in their understanding of how today s technological shifts compare to past radical changes in the economy Nonetheless policy recommendations that confront technological unemployment can insure against the worst case scenario And as similar disruptions originate from trade and technological improvement similar policies can ameliorate the consequences of dislocation produced by trade and tech shocks Pursuing such policies could also present a political opportunity to restore some sober analysis and much needed non partisan problem solving This would require a response somewhat antithetical to our politics one that is forward thinking and anticipates voters concerns While 65 percent of Americans believe that within 50 years robots and computers will likely complete work performed by humans today 80 percent of Americans do not expect their jobs will disappear While poorer and less educated Americans demonstrate greater concern for the prospect American workers overall worry more about displacement by other workers industry trends and mismanagement Given that few voters are preoccupied with disruptive changes to work stability through technological advancements there exists little incentive for politicians to tackle it But doing so provides two important opportunities at a time ripe for political renewal First addressing automation upends a politics that relies heavily on antagonism Unlike trade few voters reject the benefits of technological change and automation offers no foreign scapegoats like cheap labor abroad or multilateral trade to accuse of stealing jobs Subsequently it is difficult to claim political victories and publically take on opponents Second while workers are concerned about more immediate threats tackling automation would require modernizing the social safety net to not only improve the working lives of Americans today but also to respond to the changing nature of work itself As Brookings Mark Muro writes programs should be anticipatory and offer support when disruption is forecast but not yet hitting home This might require openness to challenging some of the premises that have long guided partisan economic platforms Because automation is predicted to yield greater economic growth while at the same time displacing many workers traditional conservatives will have to embrace some degree of government intervention An inability to adapt conservative economic governance to confront the features of radical shifts in the labor market could prove electorally costly Americans likely to be the most affected by automation live in Republican districts but in areas that have experienced the greatest shocks from automation the 2016 presidential vote was closer This presents an opportunity for Democrats to contend for the support of these voters If Democrats fail to address these voters needs the party might miss an opportunity to reassert a strong economic message and reconnect with a working class base Joseph Parilla and Mark Muro have suggested the creation of a Universal Basic Adjustment Benefit to tackle the dislocation likely to become an increasingly routine feature of the labor market Inspired by calls for a Universal Basic Income UBI the adjustment would include job search counseling worker training funding relocation grants and wage insurance Given that UBI has attracted support from a group of odd bedfellows that includes American Enterprise Institute s Charles Murray and Andy Stern the former president of the Service Employees International Union a Basic Adjustment Benefit might be able to generate similar cross ideological interest In fact it might even prove more palatable than UBI proposals as the benefit would target moving workers back into the labor market and would combine many welfare programs that could be administered flexibly at the local level The consequences of failing to incorporate automation into our political dialogue are potentially high In the Midwest manufacturing job loss bred feelings of economic frustration that led many to favor a populist candidate who gave them something to blame which exemplifies the frustrations likely to take hold as the threat of technological unemployment mounts Additionally many of the jobs expected to disappear as a result of automation are held by white males without college educations a group Trump won handily Without efforts to ensure workers without a college degree can participate in the economy of the automated era the growing education divide producing the kind of populist backlash here and across the west is likely to deepen By Mark Baillie 2018 05 24T09 00 34 143Z BusinessThe British government is keen to recognise the importance of artificial intelligence AI and automation in ensuring the long term future success of UK industry In line with this it has acknowledged that one of its grand challenges is putting the UK at the forefront of the AI and data revolution In fact comments from Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond have suggested that large swathes of government activity will soon be performed by AI and automation to free up time for human civil servants Automating some aspects of government jobs will result in savings and efficiencies However there are concerns that public sector workers will be at risk of losing their jobs to AI and automation in the next decade Think tank Reform estimated early last year that 250 000 of the UK s five million public sector workers risk losing jobs to AI and automation in the next 15 years Speaking to a House of Lords committee in 2017 Hammond said The government is looking at how it can apply artificial intelligence There are very significant areas of government activity which involve relatively low level decision making which will be highly susceptible to AI probably over a relatively short period of time which does present the tantalising possibility of being able to drive some real productivity enhancement in the delivery of government processes The truth is that automation in the public sector is already developing at a rapid pace New initiatives range from implementing AI and automation into day to day bureaucratic tasks such as form filling and applying for patents to using facial recognition technologies to verify the identity of individuals entering the UK But it s time to stop viewing AI and automation as an existential threat to our livelihoods Far from replacing people AI and automation will transform the workplace as menial tasks and some non routine jobs are digitalised through AI and process automation enabling greater efficiency while taking away some of the strain of day to day tasks In its industrial strategy report the UK government rightly realised we are at one of the most important exciting and challenging times in the history of global enterprise Importantly that report highlights that Britain is well placed to benefit from this new Industrial Revolution This digital revolution will be powered by humans increasing reliance on AI and automation Set to impact almost every sector of British industry AI and automation is here to stay Organisations are turning to digital transformation to boost innovation and enhance user experience and AI and automation will play a major role in this change While some jobs may disappear or evolve along the road to automation there is considerable opportunity for innovation and change AI and automation can give government departments both at the national and local level much faster access to sophisticated insights Combining this technology and big data will allow them to make better decisions more quickly for a greater number of citizens This ability to rapidly adapt to and drive new innovations is part of what allowed Britain to prosper and develop so quickly during the first industrial revolution After all as the government goes on to note in the industrial strategy report We are an open enterprising economy built on invention innovation and competition We have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business with high standards respected institutions and the reliable rule of law We have achieved near historic levels of employment We are a crossing point for the world because of our geographic position the English language our strong ties our openness to ideas and our vibrant culture Driving an automated future offers a wide range of benefits Not least is the prospect of boosting productivity across all of Britain s leading industries from high tech post industrial manufacturing through to the creative industries sector The UK s industrial strategy has already identified the four grand challenges in the years ahead as artificial intelligence and big data clean growth the future of mobility and meeting the needs of an ageing society Astute investments in AI and automation can enable huge productivity boosts UK consumers are already beginning to recognise that more organisations are embracing this technology and the advantages it can offer including within the public sector In fact after surveying 2 000 UK consumers on their attitudes towards AI and automation in government last year OpenText found that two thirds of UK citizens 66 per cent believe this technology will be introduced into government services within 20 years with 16 per cent claiming that this could happen in the next two years The same poll revealed less fear and uncertainty about the introduction of AI and automation in government than many headlines suggest The majority of those surveyed were not concerned about the implementation of this technology in government with over a quarter 26 per cent going as far as claiming AI and automated technologies would be able to make better decisions than most elected representatives though they would prefer for final decisions to be made by a human Many respondents recognised the immediate benefits of the technology A fifth 20 per cent felt that updating processes by bringing in AI and automation would lead to less admin and form filling Additionally 24 per cent pinpointed reduced waiting times as a major advantage while 19 per cent thought that there would be fewer errors in government as a result of the effective implementation of AI and automation This research shows increasing acceptance of AI and automation as a method to improve services but Britain still has some way to go to fully embrace its potential The UK ranked lowest 16 per cent across the countries surveyed when asked if AI and automated technology would be working in government in the next five years showing more hesitance around its uptake than countries such as France 24 per cent the Netherlands 28 per cent and the USA 22 per cent AI and automation will transform the workplace and bring a wide range of benefits to all sectors including the public sector With the potential to increase the speed efficiency and effectiveness of a wide range of government services AI and automated technologies cannot be ignored While the technology already exists the key challenge over the next few years will be gaining trust amongst both public

federal IT data management and workforce infrastructures But few agencies have the potential to feel that impact like the Office of Personnel Management Tasked with bringing more IT and cybersecurity talent into the government at a time when both are in high demand globally the agency must also navigate the fundamental reshaping of the government s civilian workforce which is increasingly being fueled by the emergence of technologies like artificial intelligence and automation In its Federal Workforce Priorities Report released last week OPM estimates that 45 percent of work activities could be automated today based on technology available in 2016 and five percent of all federal jobs could be done completely by machines That leaves the agency at a crossroads in how it shapes the future of the federal workforce and the services it will provide said Don Kettl a professor at the University of Maryland s School of Public Policy and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution This will not be your mother and father s OPM by the time we are done for sure he said The idea of managing an OPM purely on the basis of trying to create rules to make the existing system work will be a pretty bad fit for the system we know we are going to need To capitalize on a seismic change in the nature of work combined with a shrinking federal workforce the Trump administration and OPM have proposed an initiative to reskill some existing federal workers to into higher value work activities jobs while leveraging automation technology to streamline administrative functions As part of the PMA the Office of Management and Budget and its Office of Federal Procurement Policy will identify three areas suited for automation and develop pilots for them by the first quarter of 2019 By the second quarter of 2019 OMB will develop a plan to reskill federal workers impacted by automation efforts while an OPM pilot will assess the skills those employees will need The results of those pilots could be pivotal for agencies looking to stretch their budget said Mallory Barg Bulman vice president of research and evaluation at the Partnership for Public Service Bulman said a January 2018 report conducted by the Partnership and the IBM Center for The Business of Government found federal entities like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Air Force were already leveraging AI to gain efficiencies in how they collect data and navigate acquisition rules and regulations Federal agencies are looking for ways to do more with less she said The places where we ve seen it be successful are places where agencies have taken routine and tedious tasks and really found ways to automate it But even with the capabilities and resources gained by automation the emphasis placed on employee skills and the ability to recruit and retain those employees becomes greater and that s where OPM s role in reskilling and training becomes even more pronounced The truth is providing opportunities for training can really be a profound retention tool Bulman said When we looked at the Best Places to Work in the Federal Government scores for the Senior Executive Service members particularly those who were new to the SES and on the younger end training was the most powerful predictor of their intent to stay But because the PMA tries to tackle government s most difficult challenges in order to modernize it Kettl said OPM s role will be paramount We try to think broadly about the strategic role of government and the strategic transformation of its workforce to make that happen This is a very big deal he said It s something that s very important very fundamental and something that will require a very fundamental rethinking of the role of OPM in particular along the way New studies shed light on the job security of certain government jobs in an increasingly digital age Automation has already altered several industries and it s only a matter of time before it transforms more of them Given that many governments continue to grapple with tight budgets and suppressed staffing levels it s worth considering whether they might one day rely more on automation and technology to carry out tasks performed by humans Recent studies have shed some light on what this might look like particularly in the public sector Automation has already made some forays into government Kirke Everson a KPMG intelligent automation consultant cited chatbots utilized in call centers as an example He suggested that automation could soon replace personnel who perform repetitive back office tasks such as eligibility checks and other procedures following a defined set of rules Government is ripe for automation Everson says But if it requires a large amount of judgments or human interaction maybe you don t start there In the U K an estimated 861 000 public sector jobs could be automated by 2030 according to an analysis by Deloitte and Oxford University Administrative and operative roles which account for 27 percent of the public workforce were identified as having the highest probability of being automated These types of jobs are already declining and the report projects their numbers in the U K to fall further from 87 000 in 2015 to only 4 000 by 2030 A separate Oxford University study examined U S job occupations deeming about 47 percent of total employment in both government and the private sector to be at risk of computerization Some public sector roles considered most vulnerable included library workers postal service clerks and transportation inspectors all positions with highly repetitive tasks Many of the other occupations researchers identified were especially common in transportation These included bus drivers and subway or streetcar operators as well as highway maintenance workers tablecaption font size 11px margin bottom 30px line height 1 2em important The probability of computerization ranges from 0 to 1 with higher values representing more tasks potentially completed by computers Numbers shown for predominately public sector occupations Source The Future of Employment How Susceptible are Jobs to Computerisation by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A Osborne But does this mean large numbers of public employees will one day be out of work Historically industrialization and improvements in technology haven t caused higher long term unemployment It s unknown whether this time will be any different though with economists offering different predictions for automation s effects Neil Reichenberg who heads the International Public Management Association for Human Resources views it more as a shift It s not so much cutting staff as it is moving people to more strategic higher level work he says While technology has already reshaped countless occupations across just about every segment of the economy it hasn t yet prompted the complete elimination of many types of jobs Consider teachers who employ greater use of educational software programs in classrooms These and other types of public employee positions haven t vanished but they do require greater tech skills than in years past Although some might associate automation with armies of robots it s computers that are most responsible for redefining work these days A recent Brookings Institution report assessed digitization or the degree of computer skills and related knowledge typically required of various occupations Several public sector jobs that required few digital skills in 2002 now mandate at least mid level proficiency of computers or other devices Parking enforcement workers and compliance officers for example might have relied entirely on paper records not long ago Today the Brookings data suggests digital skills for these occupations have jumped considerably over the past decade Source Brookings analysis of O Net OES and Moody s data In some ways automating various aspects of jobs could prove to be more difficult in the public sector than in the private sector Unions Reichenberg says will likely oppose efforts expected to result in job losses Last year the union membership rate for government workers was more than five times that of the private sector Still if automation offers governments ways to cut costs without sacrificing quality of services they ll likely consider it Resources remain limited Revenues aren t expected to grow much and total state and local government employment is still below levels reached a decade ago In some jurisdictions automated processes or technologies could enable governments to provide services that otherwise wouldn t be available It s inevitable Reichenberg says If you look at the way we do work today technology is going to play a major role This story was originally

reserved e RepublicCommentFor many people artificial intelligence conjures up images of sci fi movies and the future They see it as a threat to their jobs and sometimes even their safety but AI represents the biggest leap forward in terms of work productivity since the personal computer and few other industries can benefit from AI as much as government With AI we can change the way government works and help employees do their job better AI is already integrated into numerous cloud platforms and can be used to discover new information and deliver outcomes instantly I like to refer to this as practical AI AI has the potential to improve employee experiences by speeding up decision making and automating mundane and repetitive tasks Bringing machine learning to everyday work enables government agencies and departments to make better decisions faster because they do not have to hunt for data and aggregate it into a spreadsheet By building intelligence into platforms AI helps manage complex workflows and allows organizations to One way that AI will be applied in the workplace is automating service requests Most companies have an IT service desk as well as a customer support center These functions ensure that customers and employees receive help in a timely manner whether it is a request for a new computer a password reset or the status of a repair Manually triaging thousands of incidents or cases categorizing tasks and routing work can consume resources introduce human error and slow resolution In fact a new report from Accenture found that customer support functions spend up to 12 percent of their time categorizing prioritizing and assigning tickets Meanwhile AI accurately categorizes requests nearly instantly It eliminates the bottleneck created by agents having to manually assign categorize and route requests A full two days a week is wasted on manual administrative work according to the recent State of Work survey conducted by ServiceNow If an agency with 5 000 people automated those processes they could get 4 million work hours back a year Adding AI frees up employees to do the work they want to do spurring creativity Nearly half of respondents 48 percent said work levels increased by 20 percent or more after they adopted AI solutions Additionally 91 percent of executives say their skilled employees spend too much time on admin tasks and 93 percent believe that reducing mundane tasks unleashes employee creativity To properly implement AI solutions across government agencies we need to define which tasks are best suited for humans and which ones should be performed by AI The government has a term inherently governmental to describe work processes or decisions that must be done by government employees Contractors do much of the work in our government agencies but certain work is inherently governmental in nature As we move into an age defined by AI we need to identify and define the work processes and decisions that are inherently human We are going to increasingly work in a blended workplace with AI systems and humans working together to achieve a mission There are certain activities within any work environment that can only be performed or should only be performed by humans While there may be many more human activities designated as inherently human in the beginning I believe that as humans become more comfortable with the role of AI in the blended workforce less and less work will be designated as inherently human There will always be a need for humans to remain in charge from factual responsibility and liability aspects as well as from emotional and psychological ones We spend a third of our lives at work It shapes who we are how we feel and how we interact with the world so we must create great work experiences and this is what AI does AI creates work experiences that unleash productivity bringing out the best in us Rather than fearing machines stealing jobs we need

found in the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives Here are a few worth considering On the one hand Emerging Europe Developing Asia Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean are witnessing how robotics automation and artificial intelligence are lowering costs and increasing productivity providing an opportunity for accelerated growth Countries like Estonia have taken the lead in digital technology youth in Nigeria and Ethiopia are harnessing technology to boost yields in agriculture in Vietnam and Bangladesh Information and Communication Technologies ICT is boosting the service industry and across Latin America and the Caribbean smartphone adoption is expected to reach beyond 70 by 2020 On the other hand as a result of this new wave of technological advances known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution a series of myths emerge that it is important to clarify Myth 1 All regions will be impacted in the same way The truth is that technology will be adopted at varying speeds depending on the region s economic development and demographic trends An aging population in Emerging Europe will face different challenges than Africa where 12 to 15 million young people enter the job market each year Myth 2 Mass unemployment is unavoidable The truth is that the jobless rate will be lower than originally expected Mass unemployment is unlikely to become a reality But the shifts in job opportunities will certainly require flexibility and access to new training tools which may in turn be provided by technology itself Myth 3 Automation will replace all human jobs and tasks The truth is that automation only takes place where it is both technically and economically feasible A human workforce will still be required in most sectors particularly those such as health and education At the same time it would be foolish to ignore the genuine threats of unemployment and increased income inequality that the rapid expansion of new technology will generate Above all as Multilateral Development Banks the question we need to be asking is how can governments ease the transition What can governments do to ensure that the largest number of people possible benefit from this transition Policymakers can take four actions to ease the adoption of technology while mitigating potentially adverse effects on jobs and incomes Multilateral Development Banks certainly have their own role to play not only by acting as think tanks for initiatives on how to capitalize on new technologies and mitigate their negative effects but also in coordinating global or regional policy responses strengthening partnerships between policymakers and employers to jointly identify and address challenges Our products and services will need to adapt A recent IDB health project in the Dominican Republic which uses drones to link remote rural clinics with hospital laboratories is a prime example of this Change will also take place within our workforce Outsourcing the IDB s human resources department from Washington to Costa Rica to ensure efficiency and reduce costs was certainly a step in the right direction It is important that we take the time to seriously identify the opportunities and risks the 21st century global job market presents so that together we can help shape the future of work In the meantime we must also remain relevant for our customer base and at the forefront of innovation Whether we succeed or not is up to all of us Downlaod the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives hereFiled Under Beyond development effectiveness Tagged With labor

necessarily disappearing but they are transforming as artificial intelligence machine learning and advanced robotics tackle more roles in the workplace Policymakers should act now to help New Yorkers prepare for the changes that are coming to the world of work by Matt A V ChabanTags automation new york state economic opportunity workforce opportunity innovation economy tech middle class jobs projectIt has taken decades for New York State s economy to rebound from the effects of offshoring and globalization From Buffalo and Rochester to Binghamton and Riverhead the state has shed hundreds of thousands of jobs particularly in manufacturing and related industrial sectors and upstate job growth has been comparatively slow Yet in the years ahead New York State will need to contend with an even more powerful and fast moving economic force automation Machine learning robotics and artificial intelligence are poised to bring about massive changes to a much larger swath of the economy in the years ahead sweeping not just through factory floors but office towers hospital wards and main streets Automation has the potential to displace workers in a growing range of occupations as varied as bookkeepers and x ray technicians paralegals and food prep workers The result is that both traditional and emerging industries will be transformed with significant effects on New York s workforce This research provides the first comprehensive look at the automation potential of every occupation statewide and in each of New York s ten regions Our study finds that New York State is less susceptible to automation than the nation as a whole But it also reveals that more than 1 2 million jobs in the state about 12 percent of the state s workforce could be largely automated using technology that exists today These are jobs in which 80 percent or more of their associated tasks could be done by machines To be clear automation is not expected to eliminate all or even most of these jobs Indeed this analysis shows that there are only about 24 740 jobs in the state that are 100 percent automatable As with other major economic transformations such as the Industrial Revolution the dawn of electricity and the Internet age some jobs will disappear many will be created and in the end most will simply change There is immense potential for jobs across New York to be transformed Statewide the equivalent of 41 2 percent of all job tasks could be performed by machines in the coming decade On this score New York is actually better off than the nation where 51 percent of all job tasks could be done by machines according to an analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute on which this report is based This is not to suggest that 41 percent of jobs in the state will be eliminated that is simply the scope of job responsibilities that could change as more of today s work whether taking orders entering data or even driving is done by machines The potential for automation is spread fairly evenly across the state Of all regions the automation potential is highest in Western New York where 44 5 percent of all job tasks could be done using existing technology Other regions with high automation potential include Central New York 44 4 percent the North Country 44 3 percent the Mohawk Valley 43 8 percent and Long Island 43 7 New York City has the lowest potential for automation as detailed by the Center in a January report just 39 percent of jobs in the five boroughs stand a high likelihood of being automated But other regions also have a comparatively lower potential for automation such as the Capital Region 42 percent and the Hudson Valley 42 2 percent 1 This research part of our Middle Class Jobs Project a research initiative funded by Fisher Brothers and Winston C Fisher also finds that the jobs that offer New Yorkers a foothold in the economy and a gateway to the middle class are the ones most threatened by automation Such is the case with the state s roughly 155 000 food preparers and servers including fast food workers the largest group whose tasks are highly susceptible to automation 87 percent of their job tasks could be automated It s also the case for the state s 124 000 accounting and bookkeeping clerks 86 percent automation potential and the 181 000 who drive tractor trailers delivery trucks and buses 78 to 85 percent automation potential Additionally there are 112 000 stock clerks and 34 000 dishwashers whose jobs are all roughly 86 percent automatable Even among the state s 20 000 chief executives computers will be able to perform 25 percent of their work in the coming decades That s a notch more vulnerable than the state s 211 000 janitors since machines are predicted to do only 22 percent of all custodial tasks although smart mops could well become part of the job We also conclude that the strongest effects are on lower and middle income jobs the first rungs of the state s economic ladder where the impact of automation is likely to be significant Among the 100 most automatable occupations in the state with at least 1 000 workers 68 percent make less than 40 000 per year while 31 percent make between 40 000 and 80 000 annually and only one of those positions crane operators makes more In total the equivalent of 186 billion wages could be impacted by automation Precisely because it will be difficult to predict exactly which jobs will be impacted by automation and where policymakers business leaders and educators across New York have all the more reason to start preparing now In many parts of the state the same communities that have struggled with the loss of industrial and manufacturing jobs are likely to confront even greater challenges in the years ahead Meanwhile areas that have benefited from new jobs in industries like restaurants and retail will not be immune to the forces of automation Preparing New York State for the future of work is a job that starts today Automation and the Empire StateThe effects of automation will be felt in every corner of the state although some regions rely more heavily on highly automatable jobs In evaluating the likelihood that a machine could perform each job s component tasks this analysis reveals which occupations are most likely to be augmented and supplanted in the decades to come One key factor in determining automatability is the prevalence of work that is highly routine whether physically or cognitively Where job tasks are more variable relying on interpersonal relationships and quick judgement calls humans continue to have the edge The effects of automation may no longer be confined to the factory floor but production occupations remain the most susceptible to displacement That s a major reason why Western New York where manufacturing still accounts for almost 1 in 10 jobs is the state s most vulnerable region The average job in the nine regions excluding New York City is about 10 percent more likely to be automated than it is in the five boroughs although rates for every region remain below the national average New York City with a large number of workers in high touch healthcare jobs managerial positions customer service and the creative economy is the region of the state least vulnerable to the effects of automation That said more than one third of the state s most highly automatable jobs are in New York City more than 454 000 in total However four regions across the state are home to more than 100 000 highly automatable jobs and all ten regions have at least 20 000 jobs that are highly automatable This includes 182 650 in Long Island 116 330 in the Hudson Valley 105 200 in Western New York 80 470 in the Finger Lakes 72 770 in the Capital Region 57 800 in Central New York 40 990 in the Southern Tier and 22 080 in the North Country The most automatable jobs in each region are relatively consistent statewide as the breakdown below reveals Close to 2 percent of the state s workforce is employed in food preparation and serving jobs including fast food and those jobs are spread across the entire state The same goes for jobs filling orders or driving delivery trucks As a result automation is likely to transform not only those regions with a traditional reliance on manufacturing but other parts of the state that have seen the service sector expand significantly over the past two decades Automation in New York State Region by Region All statewide data is for 2017 regional data 2016 the most recent years available Capital RegionCentral New YorkFinger LakesHudson ValleyLong IslandMohawk ValleyNew York CityNorth CountrySouthern TierWestern New York Additional details about automatable jobs can be found here Statewide Capital Region Central New York Finger Lakes Hudson Valley Long Island Mohawk Valley New York City North Country Southern Tier Western New York While some regions are more dependent on certain fields for employment every region of the state has large numbers of workers in similar occupations In addition to food preparation and serving jobs including fast food which are prevalent statewide and highly automatable there are thousands of New Yorkers in every region employed in personal care which is quite resilient to automation retail which is only somewhat durable and bookkeeping which is rather vulnerable All of these jobs may change significantly as new technology is developed and adopted but most workplaces will still need help with this work and someone will have to perform it The result is that the skills required to access even entry level opportunities may increase even as humans continue to hold most of the jobs that exist today Many of the state s most automatable occupations are also expected to add jobs over the next decade although an increased pace of technology adoption could change this Such trends may appear to counter the headlines of kiosk filled McDonald s restaurants and Shake Shacks and autonomous Tesla built tractor trailers although some of these changes are already underway The tipping point for many jobs may well be more than a decade out however the growth of jobs in highly vulnerable industries only underscores the urgent need to prepare the state s workforce for the changes to come There are some regional variations The persistence of manufacturing jobs which account for 9 percent of all jobs in Western New York and 6 percent in Central New York could help explain why both are relatively more vulnerable than New York City 2 percent the Capital Region 4 percent and the Hudson Valley 3 4 percent Long Island s large share of jobs that are at least 50 percent automatable may have some correlation with a higher number of office administrative positions which are almost one in five jobs in Nassau and Suffolk counties That compares to one in six on average in the state and in New York City The five boroughs also employ a lower number of workers in transportation fields 4 9 percent than is typical in the rest of the state 5 3 percent Indeed all manner of factors not just economic or technical could determine whether a business decides to replace some or all of its workers with machines It is not just a matter of how soon fully autonomous dishwashers can be developed but if it would be worth paying to buy and maintain such a machine when most human dishwashers make minimum wage In other cases the complexity of job tasks is a key determinant while accounting clerks whose job tasks consist largely of routine data entry are highly vulnerable to automation accountants are the second largest highly resilient occupation in the state There are also political factors powerful unions have kept subway and train conductors employed despite automatability rates approaching 95 percent and social ones There are some 151 380 waiters in the state the 11th largest profession and just over three quarters of their work 76 9 percent is automatable Yet many people go out to eat as a special treat and value the human connection that a server provides and restaurants may find that humans are more effective at upselling a second round of drinks than any robot However some venues and businesses like airport terminals and fast food outlets have demonstrated a willingness to make this shift leading to the even higher automatability of fast food workers and the heightened risks for the entry level positions with the lowest barriers to entry Although relatively few of the fastest growing occupations in New York State are highly automatable the vast majority of growing fields will experience major changes The average automation potential of the 50 fastest growing occupations is nearly 39 percent This approaches the statewide average and is a reminder of just how much most jobs will change with two in five job tasks able to be done by machines instead of people in the near future Jobs in Major Occupational Categories That Are at Least Half Automatable All statewide data is for 2017 regional data 2016 the most recent years available As a result New Yorkers will require a new level of tech fluency to be prepared for the jobs of tomorrow many of which will become augmented by computers robots artificial intelligence and machine learning For example retail workers may need to manage Internet connected point of sale and inventory management systems and build advanced customer profiles while personal care workers may need to update client records using their smartphones or set up remote doctor visits via FaceTime Critical thinking adaptability and the ability to learn new tools will be crucial for most workers in the future as it should be now for the policymakers educators and business leaders responsible for preparing for the coming world of work The promise of automation is as great as any perceived peril but only if New Yorkers are ready to tackle these new and evolving occupations Photo Credit Franck V

77 of administration and operations roles by 2030 Even if your result was The Luddite or Old School there s still time to learn about the technologies and disciplines that will be essential to getting things done in the public service of the future We ve isolated the most important trends here this is why they matter how governments can use them and the best online resources to learn them yourself Big data once a tool reserved for statisticians and intelligence personnel is now indispensable to the functioning of government With it public servants can use evidence to drive decision making rather than guesswork In the private sector a strong linkbetween effective data use and better financial performance has been established but much of government data still lives on paper or in old fashioned systems This coupled with a tendency to treat data analysis as an afterthought when crafting policy prevents governments from reaping its benefits Of course every civil servant need not be a data scientist but they should appreciate its potential to improve the lives of citizens help services function more efficiently and cut costs In the future of work all public servants will deal with data in service delivery which means overcoming a misconception of big data as amorphous and overwhelming Public servants should come to see it as a tool to help government do more for their citizens with less which in this era of shrinking budgets and growing technological innovation is crucial At a time when there is an urgent need to improve the efficiency of public services data analytics has huge potential Eddie Copeland NestaHow to use it Estonia saves more than 2 8 million hours of labour every year through a data exchange network that helped it digitise 99 of government services The system lets citizens pay their taxes in five minutes and incorporate companies in under 20 Police forces in the US are using big data to predict where crime is most likely to occur and allocate officers more efficiently Some cities have cut crime by up to 40 London is using data analytics to predict which children are most at risk for neglect and abuse allowing child services to intervene

Institute offers classes in open data essentials and finding stories in data It also has offline courses like Open data in a day for government and Managing risk with open data Coursera has a John Hopkins University sanctioned Launch your career in data science class Datacamp teaches data science skills like R SQL and python Dataquest offers beginner intermediate and expert level courses in data analysis and prediction General Assembly has a number of courses in data science and analysis In the US just 27 of citizens are happy with government s digital services Constituents want to interact with government more easily and governments leading the charge in bringing services online are using artificial intelligence AI to do so With AI systems learn from experience and keep improving their performance without humans having to explain how to complete tasks A prime example of this is chatbots virtual assistants that field questions from constituents who would normally have to call a public office or help desk Chatbots which learn from the questions they are asked to continually improve performance help governments serve constituents better and free up public servants time for higher value jobs AI has the potential to rid humans of monotonous work administrative tasks like data sorting filing and searching documents translating materials and drafting briefs among others saving federal governments up to 1 2 billion hu man hours and 41 1 billion annually City officials only work during the day 8am to 5pm Chatbots work 24 7 Ryan Johnson City of North

University professors It also offers a range of other AI classes EdX has a variety of introduction to AI courses IBM offers a beginner s guide to artificial intelligence machine learning and cognitive computing Policymakers are often accused of losing sight of the challenges everyday people face Design thinking is a way for governments to leverage the philosophy of user centric companies like Apple which puts customer experience at the centre of product design to solve problems and shape policy Design thinking puts end citizens at the centre of policy formulation in the iterative process public servants form theories about what constituents want by observing them prototype a product or service then test it out on real people This form of empathetic hands on policymaking helps government build services in concert with citizens to meet their needs rather than relying on detached experts The collaborative approach encourages public servants to break out of departmental siloes and tap into more risky innovative service design It s quite messy doing design work But the old ways of thinking just aren t working anymore Sarah Hurcombe the Australian Centre for Social InnovationHow to use it Denmark used design thinking to reorganise waste management in Copenahagen reduce tension between inmates and guards in prisons and transform services for mentally disabled adults in Odense Singapore has redesigned its employment centres to make them calm and easily navigable for stressed job seekers West Hollywood used design thinking to bring the first robotic parking garage to the

changes The discipline has had an outsize effect on human behaviour the UK Nudge Unit has signed up an additional 100 000 organ donors a year doubled the number of army applicants and helped collect an additional 40 million a year from taxpayers Nudge units use empirical evidence to anticipate how people will react to policy options rather than assuming their response will be rational They have spread to governments across the world including Guatemala the US Australia Germany and Singapore but the use of behavioural insights is still nascent In the future it is expected to have a significant impact on solving problems that stem from ingrained or unconscious bias like gender inequality It s hard for government to admit that something it s doing might not work or that it s failed People are often running blind David Halpern UK Nudge UnitHow to use it The UK Australia and Singapore use a behavioural science and machine learning tool to blind managers to gender and

What are the skills and attitudes for successful public problem solving Industry insights and news straight to your inbox Across the world the workforce is growing In fact the number of women a cohort with low employment and activity rates between 15 and 64 years working or looking for work has increased globally in the past five years Despite this growth employers across the globe report skills shortages across a multitude of industries While skilled migration is at an all time high according to Hays Global Skills Index digitization is raising questions about who will do the work of tomorrow and what it will look like Over the next 10 to 20 years nearly half of jobs are at risk of being automated particularly in areas such as transportation and logistics office and admin support and manufacturing As AI machine learning and IoT becomes commonplace in professional environments it s critical that people have the skills to respond to these changes in a positive and productive way With such significant gaps in the contemporary workforce governments are creating initiatives to tackle this growing skills shortage by linking education and business to cultivate the employees of the future With the tagline Realise Your Aspirations SkillsFuture is 100 committed to giving Singaporeans the best possible professional opportunities imaginable This national movement to works to provide

partnership is a network of employers working in close collaboration with one common goal to create the skills needed to push the UK digital economy forward Despite the fact that the Tech Partnership is ending this year the scheme s ambition lies in delivering the skills for a million digital jobs by 2025 No one business can achieve this on its own and the partnership s collaborative approach will help upskill workers across a range of sectors in a practical and positive way The Tech Partnership works with a number of innovative companies including BT Speaking on the partnership BT Group Chief Executive Gavin Patterson said We are particularly pleased that industry will have the opportunity to build on its work within the Tech Partnership and our existing degree apprenticeship schemes setting standards and promoting degrees that are aligned to employer needs By offering a range of relevant degrees and apprenticeships as well as access to basic digital skills the Tech Partnership works to set the standards for digital skills in the UK in a bid to nurture the talent of the nation s budding professionals Result With the Prime Minister recently announcing the 20 million Institute of Coding formed by businesses including IBM Cisco and Microsoft it s clear to see that governing bodies in the UK and beyond are starting to stand up and take notice of the world s digital skills gap These six initiatives take slightly different approaches but they all have one thing in common to build tomorrow s digital workforce by offering innovative continuous valuable sustainable and accessible education to today s budding professional And that is the most important thing of all Keep up to date with industry insights and latest news Sitemap Terms Conditions Privacy Policy Digital

Video Transcript EnglishWith the rise of technology automating many jobs globalization it seems like we re in a period of very rapid and dynamic change and we re kind of rethinking the whole nature of work And we need to deal with the massive transitions that are happening in the world of work if we re gonna have a healthy society over the coming decades So how we used to farm was a lot of manual labour and the equipment was getting old and we re dealing with breakdown So we were able to build this facility it s a big technology advancement compared to how we used to farm and now we re able to do less time choring and do other work instead so we re more efficient and it s just a more humane way to harvest milk Sensequake is making cities safer and smarter by combining sensors AI and data analysis to perform structural health monitoring and determine the integrity and natural hazard vulnerability of a structure More and more workplaces are going to need the technologies that are emerging now and in the future And having knowledge of these new technologies is going to be crucial in every sector Skills development is vital right now What skills are we embedding inside of our youth today in order to service these applications service these robots Where are we giving that experiential learning Hopefully there s growth in the dairy industry if we were to stay in our old facility we wouldn t be able to grow it would be a lot of labour milking fewer cows and I d be a last generation farmer I think that Canada has some unique opportunities to be successful because of its place in the world because of its skilled workforce the quality of its education system This opportunity with Future Skills Council and the Centre gives us the time and space to collectively think about how we make the best use of our resources so that we don t find ourselves behind NC INNOVATION GD hrsdc rhdcc gc caWe want to hear from you How do you think the new Canada Service Corps program should be shaped The Student Work Placement Program helps employers train students Create the life you want Explore your job prospects and learn what you need to get to work You will not receive a reply For enquiries contact us In late November 2018 I delivered the opening keynote at the Future of Work 2018 Conference hosted by the University of Melbourne Center for Workplace Leadership 1 where I described how to keep people at the center of the future of work discussion After my talk find a video of the 45 minute keynote here I was interviewed for a short video segment to share the highlights In preparing for the interview I found the questions to explore a thoughtful comprehensive look at the scope of the discussion on the future of work and thus I wanted to share my answers I am interested in your reactions Do you agree with my thoughts Disagree Why What are some examples of human centric approaches to work within areas of high automation I would approach this question differently While there are some jobs that might have a higher likelihood of automation than others especially those contain significant amounts of routine tasks 2 the World Economic Forum has recently predicted that greater than 50 of all jobs will require significant reskilling and upskilling by 2022 3 This means we will need to consider more human centric approaches in most jobs not just those with a higher proportion of tasks that could be automated In the research I ve been conducting in partnership with Bill Eggers and Amrita Datar from Deloitte and Carlos Teixeira from the Harvard Kennedy School through my current part time fellowship with the Harvard Kennedy School digitalHKS initiative we ve envisioned 6 government jobs of the future with a method that puts humans back at the center for both new and changing jobs Putting the worker first we envision future jobs to place human machine coordination at the core in order to improve productivity and decision making while also increasing the well being of the workers themselves The trick is not to think about what can be automated but also what can be augmented If a human s time could be freed up what higher order value could be accomplished with uniquely human skills Might we be able to deliver more value than human machine coordination than through humans alone or machines alone For example Child case workers in Colorado currently spend less than 10 percent of their work time actually interacting with children and families This impacts their ability to most effectively protect vulnerable children and coordinate services for those children Case workers today spend a large percentage of their time on administrative tasks Our research has envisioned a future where administrative burdens are reduced with the application of technologies to increase the time spent on higher valued work for the customer For example some technology applications could include case management systems powered by cognitive computing to ease scheduling and follow up voice based smart assistants that document case notes after an appointment while the future child aid coordinator travels between appointments robotic process automation tools that automatically process a client s eligibility for services on the fly and using predictive analytics and machine learning to prevent abuse neglect and ill treatment Child aid coordinators should be empowered to customize services for vulnerable children based on the child s own unique circumstances Spending more time with children and families is a critical part to increasing the value created by this work and by applying technology to free time from administrative tasks coordinators are able to spend more time problem solving for their customers What frightens you or stirs you the most about the shift from human power to machine power MIT Professor David A Mindell talks about three myths of 21st century robotics and automation in his book Our Robots Ourselves that I think are particularly relevant to shift the focus of this question The myth of linear progress the idea that technology evolves from direct human involvement into remote presence and then to fully autonomous systems The myth of replacement the idea that machines take over human jobs one for one Myth of full autonomy the utopian idea that robots today or in the future can operate entirely on their own 4 So there s a lot of fear mongering about how quickly and how extremely a shift to machine power will happen Also I think what we have to remind ourselves is that human power alone and machine power alone won t be as great as power achieved through human machine coordination To get the most value we need to design machines that have humans in the loop and empower humans to design work processes where machines are in the loop This is where the greatest value lies but is also where the challenge is because most organizations are not good at integrating new technologies into their business processes One reason they struggle with this not far from the only reason is significant workforce resistance when new technologies are forced on them This is where employees seeing WHY the change is important and why there is a benefit to them to re skill is important Another reason is because true user centered design in the technology development and deployment process is not common practice Organizations must embrace a user centered technology adoption mindset if technology initiatives are to succeed in improving the performance of an organization Co creating a visualization for the jobs of the future as occurs in the workshops Bill Amrita and I have developed can be a powerful tool to enable these actions How futuristic or progressive is the research in this area are we finding out the facts and figures too late There is a lot of research being done in this area but often in silos Conversations about future of work are often segmented between communities People building technologies focus on a technology enabled future Human capital and staffing professionals focus on how workforce changes are affecting the future of work Universities and educators focus on future skills and learning mindsets as being key enablers for the future The urgent need is to build bridges across these communities and research areas since I believe solutions will lie at the intersections of the complex topics including but not limited to Technology development robotics computer and data science engineering etc Economics and economic development policy local state and national Education and learning Workforce development policy Technology ethics Labor relations Business and public sector management Human centered design human factors Architecture and build environment design Business strategy Organizational design Performance management Organizational and Individual PsychologyMIT is one university trying to get ahead of this need for interdisciplinary action oriented research through the Task force on Work of the Future announced off earlier this year but significantly more work can be done in convening these communities for active solution development What s critical to do right now in ensuring the human evolves and doesn t disappear from meaningful work In the near term government employers employees and educators all have a role to play to design a future that is better for humans not worse Employees must not wait around for skill development to be presented to them by their employer a mindset of life long learning will be a key attribute for the future employee Learning doesn t necessarily mean traditional university higher education where costs are becoming unsustainable Learning can happen online through local boot camps by doing through micro courses designed to be taken on demand etc Employees must see that change is coming understand the new skills that will be required for them to succeed in a changed work world and feel empowered to take some of that learning on for themselves Now that s not to say that employers won t also have an important role to play in training employees in the skills of the future like AT T s 1B commitment to re train half of its workforce for the jobs of the future But McKinsey estimates that globally some 500M 900M future workers may need to move to new employers and sectors to find meaningful work 5 That transition will require some initiative on the part of the employee Thus we must create means for individuals to feel empowered and encouraged to do this and reduce fear of the future that could be paralyzing Educators act as a bridge between the future workforce and employers Being an effective bridge should involve identifying the salient knowledge skills and abilities required for the future of work and evolving curriculum and learning environments to prepare students for those futures This requires educators to have a keen understanding of the needs of industry Many institutes of higher education are also completely rethinking how they teach and how students learn and are making education to non traditional students more broadly available through online learning certifications and MOOCs Innovating the learning process itself and the funding model for learning is a critical role of educators and a role all educators should be moving to adopt in the near term Employers must step out of their comfort zone and think about a future where their potential workforce could include not only be full time human employees but contract employees the crowd strategic partnerships and machine intelligence How do you think about integrating the machine as part of the team How does this change the role and skills for managers How might humans and machines combined create a more valued product or service that you provide today The challenge is to not think about the application of machines as an efficiency gain to cut overall costs by reducing human labor but to think about how machines augment humans who can provide higher order cognitive value to the organization Employers should also actively engage their workforce in designing the jobs of the future jobs that use technology to augment current work and that add new value Current employees see problems on the front line and opportunities for additional value creation that management and senior leadership often doesn t see That front line intelligence should be incorporated into designing jobs of the future Designing a future organizational model that harnesses an agile way to leverage human machine coordination to add value is a business imperative Further employers have to be obsessed with creating a learning environment in their organizations This environment should teach existing employees how to fail fast and adapt to changing technologies and customer information regularly but also help new employees onboard much more quickly due to the increasing fluidity of the workforce and increasing incidence of telework remote teams Governments must set economic workforce development training education and technology policies that consider the interdisciplinary issues of the future of work But their role is not only limited to policy making through laws and executive orders They could also Leverage convening power to create a cross sector agenda Encourage experimentation at the state and local level as test beds for national policy Fund programs to re skill employees in parts of the economy that might not be able to afford to do it themselves like small to mid size manufacturers Consider government agency roles and responsibilities to see if policy making across different interdisciplinary areas should be better coordinated Encourage policy making that includes a participatory element to ensure the voices and values of the public not just organizational stakeholders are considered when evaluating policy solutions Ensure trade offs between technology ethics and societal values are considered in economic growth policies Initiate diplomatic efforts to address inequality issues in the future of work EtcMcKinsey 6 Bain 7 and others have also made recent recommendations on what these groups can do to prepare for the future of work How do we rein in the growth of inequality as technology shifts the balance of power and opportunity in society New technology throughout history has been accompanied by fear of that technology Malcolm Frank and others in their book What to Do when Machines do Everything note Many seem to forget that throughout history automation has provided a net benefit to society In the process of automating our work and our society through generation after generation three positive things have repeatedly occurred 1 A new abundance has been created sales of products and services produced by automation now vastly more affordable and of higher quality skyrocket2 With the new abundance overall employment rises even when there is less labor input per unit 3 Society gains a net benefit with higher living standards created by newly affordable products and services 8 However this fourth work revolution does have some unique issues to consider with respect to furthering inequality A primary issue involves the coding of biases into future decision making structures and thus significant discussions have emerged on the ethical use of AI This discussion can often be about how to ensure that the algorithm developers aren t coding their own personal biases into technologies But it can also be about the data that we are using to train our AI if training data is biased or not representative of broader society then we could be making incorrect diagnoses faster or forgetting entire populations in the future we re optimizing for For example a 2010 report from the University of British Columbia warned against the danger of assuming that all of humanity s psychology closely matches the behaviors of 20 something college students They cite evidence that between 2003 and 2007 undergrads made up 80 percent of study subjects in six top psychology journals and that 96 percent of all psychology samples come from countries that make up only 12 percent of the world s population 9 The researchers refer to the sample population as mostly coming from Western Educated Industrialized Rich Democratic WEIRD populations So if a future AI therapist were trained off this data set the accuracy of diagnosis and the effectiveness of treatment may likely underperform with underrepresented communities in the dataset We must be vigilant against potential bias both in our training research data as well as the humans coding the rules else we are likely to further encourage inequitable application of technology What can only humans do and how will this change improve be compromised in the future work economy Humans are still vastly better at problem solving communication knowledge sharing collaboration leadership creativity empathy and the ability to cope with ambiguity and uncertainty 10 In some jobs that conduct routine cognitive tasks machines can actually become smarter than humans when powered by vast amounts of data These jobs may include call centers auditing insurance underwriting and basic tax preparation Some creative cognitive jobs may also be replaced For example powered by significant amounts of viewer data Netflix can set the parameters to create new TV series and movies they know will be enjoyed by their population As described by Jessica Brillhart AI is also creating beautiful art This means humans will need to perform more sophisticated cognitive tasks in the future of work Mohanbir Sawhney suggests a few such jobs in Forbes like managing and designing the future human machine teams and jobs that require social intelligence like providing care to humans nurses counselors physical therapists Also he notes as technology improves the quality of life for society humans may have more free time for leisure which could increase employment in the entertainment and leisure industries 11 All previous work revolutions agricultural and industrial have unlocked new industries and thus new opportunities for jobs while improving the overall quality of life of society though there could be much vigorous debate on the nuances of this statement If history is our guide we would expect to see the same net change over time though the times that society undergoes that transition can be very difficult The relatively good news here is that the transition may be quick occurring within one person s lifetime and not over the course of three lifetimes like previous revolutions This will significantly impact a generation but the overall transition time may be shorter Thus we have an urgent need to act now to minimize the negative effects on this generation with overall progress vigorous guard against embedded bias and human quality of life and equity top of mind References 1 Important Note My work on the Future of Work is conducted as an outside activity from my NASA duties

labour markets we will have a better understanding of what we should be emphasizing in our educational and training systems to be as well prepared as possible for tomorrow s world Rapid advances in artificial intelligence and robotics have in particular created a new momentum to understand exactly how widespread the impacts of technology will be on jobs But what if this focus is misplaced The inherent unpredictability of technological progress means that even within the literature on automation there are projected ranges for developed countries from 5 percent of jobs to 50 percent of jobs being at risk of automation with figures even higher than this for developing countries The timeframes for these impacts are similarly broad ranging from 10 20 years to 50 years in other estimates Layered onto the direct uncertainty around depth of impacts and timescale are unanswerable questions around the social norms and preferences which may influence how quickly if at all technological solutions replace humans Then there is the question of technologies that are still at nascent stages or that will only emerge in the coming years Will emerging technologies such as blockchain make intermediaries like Airbnb and Uber less relevant in 2 years or 10 years How quickly will autonomous vehicles eliminate the jobs of drivers around the world Uncertainty makes policy responses to specific potential outcomes challenging and makes the need for non path dependent responses critical These challenges are exacerbated by the cross cutting nature of the future of work policy issue touching as it does on economic social regulatory and technological issues A forthcoming report from the Mowat Centre at the University of Toronto argues that policymakers should focus their attention on upgrading the systems that support workers and young people and ensuring those systems are prepared to thrive in a world of increased uncertainty volatility and disruption Whether the primary and secondary education systems unemployment and training schemes or housing health and social supports existing policy and service delivery frameworks in many countries were designed for the industrial age and do not take advantage of nor reflect the digital age in which we live today Policymakers should focus their attention on upgrading the systems that support workers and young people and ensuring those systems are prepared to thrive in a world of increased uncertainty volatility and disruption For instance unemployment schemes in both Canada and America are straining to meet the needs of labour markets characterized by more part time temporary and contract workers Both countries are at record low rates of coverage for income supports for the unemployed Fewer than one in three unemployed Americans now receive benefits and for those who qualify benefits replace a smaller percentage of wages than before 2 Similarly only 39 percent of unemployed Canadians receive regular benefits down from over 80 percent in 1978 3 As more workers are engaged in non standard forms of employment fewer workers are completing enough hours to pass eligibility thresholds Those who do qualify often do not receive payments for very long Developing unemployment programs that provide more targeted outcomes based and personalized supports is only going to become more pressing in a future where we can expect more workers in the contingent on demand workforce Reforms that focus on developing systems that are resilient and responsive are more likely to have relevance than re orienting programs around predictions about what types of occupations are likely to be in demand 10 or 20 years from now A clear example of the risks of future casting skills and occupations presents itself in the area of computer programming Governments from New York to England to Singapore have decided that coding will be a growth area in the economy and that they should begin to train young children to acquire these skills While there may well be value in training more young people to be comfortable with computers and how they work and skills such as problem solving and logic can be enhanced through such efforts there is an open question about whether coding will actually be an area where humans will have much of a role in the future As American software entrepreneur Mark Cuban has observed coding could well be automated within five years and a better focus for skills development could be creative thinking 4 Which brings us back to the original conundrum future casting skills is hugely challenging and future casting skills overlaid against occupations likely to be in demand is even more difficult The significant time and effort involved in re orienting educational systems from the primary to tertiary levels means that policymakers who get their projections wrong could have an entire generation with skills that are not particularly useful For policymakers facing an uncertain future the best course is to redesign the systems that will support workers and young people engaged in the work force or preparing to enter it Many of the changes that are required across policy and service delivery frameworks will have the added benefit of not just laying the groundwork for the future but also addressing the real and pressing needs of those who are ill served today by schemes that were designed for a different time What particular characteristics should inform the design of social and employment supports Successful programs and systems in the future will be Two promising examples of new interventions that align with these criteria are Singapore s SkillsFuture program and France s Personal Activity Accounts Both programs are designed to provide citizens with easier access to services that they need when they need them Singapore s program provides a digital platform for citizens to access lifelong learning resources including information about education and training opportunities integrated training supports and an individualized credit of 500 that is periodically topped up by the government for skills development The French model provides customized training supports and credits for people facing different life situations including the employed education system drop outs and those who engage in voluntary and charitable work The ability of governments to pivot programs towards these types of models delivering targeted programs quickly adjusting them on the fly based on rigorous evaluation and partnering with other societal actors should be the primary focus of reform in the short to medium term Anticipating specific competencies and hard skills which will be in demand in the future and re aligning training and educational systems towards them should be undertaken with extreme caution In the longer term exploring the effectiveness of more transformative approaches such as a guaranteed annual income may be required But adjusting existing supports to better reflect today s world of work will go a significant ways towards addressing concerns about the future of work currently bedeviling policymakers around the world The more those supports are customized digital integrated focused on outcomes and rigorously evaluated the more likely it is they will meet the challenges of an uncertain ever evolving future This piece was originally published in The Future of Work in the Global South edited by Hernan Galperin and Andrea Alarcon International Development Research Centre 2017 Sunil JohalJan

many jobs in the next few decades What work will be left for humans to do Toby WalshToby Walsh is Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of New South Wales in Sydney AustraliaSun 1 Oct 2017 02 00 EDT Last modified on Sun 1 Oct 2017 02 01 EDTHal Varian chief economist at Google has a simple way to predict the future The future is simply what rich people have today The rich have chauffeurs In the future we will have driverless cars that chauffeur us all around The rich have private bankers In the future we will all have robo bankers One thing that we imagine that the rich have today are lives of leisure So will our future be one in which we too have lives of leisure and the machines are taking the sweat We will be able to spend our time on more important things than simply feeding and housing ourselves Let s turn to another chief economist Andy Haldane is chief economist at the Bank of England In November 2015 he predicted that 15 million jobs in the UK roughly half of all jobs were under threat from automation You d hope he knew what he was talking about And he s not the only one making dire predictions Politicians Bankers Industrialists They re all saying a similar thing We need urgently to face the challenge of automation robotics that could make so much of contemporary work redundant Jeremy Corbyn at the Labour Party Conference in September 2017 World Bank data has predicted that the proportion of jobs threatened by automation in India is 69 percent 77 percent in China and as high as 85 percent in Ethiopia according to World Bank president Jim Yong Kim in 2016 It really does sound like we might be facing the end of work as we know it Many of these fears can be traced back to a 2013 study from the University of Oxford This made a much quoted prediction that 47 of jobs in the US were under threat of automation in the next two decades Other more recent and detailed studies have made similar dramatic predictions Now there s a lot to criticize in the Oxford study From a technical perspective some of report s predictions are clearly wrong The report gives a 94 probability that bicycle repair person will be automated in the next two decades And as someone trying to build that future I can reassure any bicycle repair person that there is zero chance that we will automate even small parts of your job anytime soon The truth of the matter is no one has any real idea of the number of jobs at risk Even if we have as many as 47 of jobs automated this won t translate into 47 unemployment One reason is that we might just work a shorter week That was the case in the Industrial Revolution Before the Industrial Revolution many worked 60 hours per week After the Industrial Revolution work reduced to around 40 hours per week The same could happen with the unfolding AI Revolution Another reason that 47 automation won t translate into 47 unemployment is that all technologies create new jobs as well as destroy them That s been the case in the past and we have no reason to suppose that it won t be the case in the future There is however no fundamental law of economics that requires the same number of jobs to be created as destroyed In the past more jobs were created than destroyed but it doesn t have to be so in the future In the Industrial Revolution machines took over many of the physical tasks we used to do But we humans were still left with all the cognitive tasks This time as machines start to take on many of the cognitive tasks too there s the worrying question what is left for us humans Some of my colleagues suggest there will be plenty of new jobs like robot repair person I am entirely unconvinced by such claims The thousands of people who used to paint and weld in most of our car factories got replaced by only a couple of robot repair people No the new jobs will have to be doing jobs where either humans excel or where we choose not to have machines But here s the contradiction In fifty to hundred years time machines will be super human So it s hard to imagine of any job where humans will remain better than the machines This means the only jobs left will be those where we prefer humans to do them The AI Revolution then will be about rediscovering the things that make us human Technically machines will have become amazing artists They will be able to write music to rival Bach and paintings to match Picasso But we ll still prefer works produced by human artists These works will speak to the human experience We will appreciate a human artist who speaks about love because we have this in common No machine will truly experience love like we do As well as the artistic there will be a re appreciation of the artisan Indeed we see the beginnings of this already in hipster culture We will appreciate more and more those things made by the human hand Mass produced goods made by machine will become cheap But items made by hand will be rare and increasingly valuable Finally as social animals we will also increasingly appreciate and value social interactions with other humans So the most important human traits will be our social and emotional intelligence as well as our artistic and artisan skills The irony is that our technological future will not be about technology but all about our humanity Toby Walsh is Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of

Government has been on the retreat for the past decade or more But there are signs it is staging a comeback This may be a good thing Does government have a future For a public organisation such as the OECD the question seems purely rhetorical and the answer obvious Does anyone seriously believe that the world could function without government Yet the proposition is far from being fanciful Only a decade ago just as we were being told about the end of history many voices including some well known economic and political thinkers argued that the end of government would be part of the package The defeat of communism and the fall of the Berlin Wall in October 1989 symbolised the victory of individual freedom personal initiative and markets over government interference oppression and authoritarian planning In the aftermath of these historical events which had been dismissed as unlikely dreams just a few months before they happened the role and function of public authority even if democratically elected to rule on behalf of citizens were scrutinised Fundamental issues were raised Why should people go on trusting the wisdom and judgement of those who claim to be acting in the public interest Shouldn t everyone have the right to decide for themselves on social economic or environmental matters and be free to make full use of their own innate potential Why tolerate restrictions that only cramp creativity and innovation and hold back progress and development Surely the pursuit of individual happiness would boost the welfare of us all The size of government and public sector waste were criticised as were the systemic lack of transparency and the potential for corruption The management of government came under the spotlight too Its taxation expenditure and debt its laws and regulations such areas as these were considered as an obstacle to economic growth dynamism and development while private sector solutions for previously publicly owned services like telecoms and railways were considered more efficient and responsive to people s needs Small is beautiful was the mantra of the day leading to downsizing and other prescriptions in a well meaning bid to purge society of big government The revolution in communications technology in particular the Internet added another dimension to the dream of a world free of governments since it opened up an uncontrolled and virtually uncontrollable private space in which governments would not be able to apply their policies rules or broader frameworks even if they wanted to In the same vein as the last century drew to a close the frantic growth of the stock markets around the world was seen as a sign of an unprecedented growth path to a new economy and proof of the supremacy of the market There simply seemed to be no space left for government These were challenging times for those of us who clung to the view that governments would still be needed to help manage the process of globalisation who believed that markets could not meet all social environmental or even economic needs and that the unlimited exposure of the individual to market forces would not necessarily mean prosperity for all both within countries and between the industrialised world and the developing economies But the voices that doubted the perfect rationality of markets were lost in the din of the money machine which spat out more growth and more wealth for some and the prospect however illusory of riches for many But many and all are not the same thing Confrontational language re emerged like digital divide and anti globalisation In fact the price of this rather heady period was greater awareness of the risk of exclusion for large parts of the planet A limited backlash occurred in Asia then Russia and elsewhere though these were not described as such at the time In the OECD world the end of the speculative bubble led to requests for government action from stakeholders who had not been heard of for a while Government institutions like the WTO and the IMF were solicited to extend financial support or arbitration in cases of economic distress and conflict Producers and consumers in OECD and non OECD countries suffered from downturns and cried out for new frameworks to help them improve efficiency and survive Privatised and deregulated industries showed weaknesses even becoming liabilities to the functioning of whole economies Whom better to ask for assistance than the government Whether this all adds up to a renewed understanding that to function properly markets might need strong frameworks broad and flexible though they may be it is too early to say But there does appear to be recognition that efficiency cannot be the sole objective of economic activities and that values like welfare and sustainability also count With large corporate scandals and sagging public faith we have also been reminded that the market alone is imperfect and cannot guarantee its own survival Good governance private and public though with democracy leading by example is clearly a key ingredient of economic growth and sustainable development By the same token governments will never go back to being the way they were Public sector efficiency remains a concern and working methods and management practices in the private sector should be useful points of reference for the daily operations of the public sector But there is also a growing emphasis on the importance of functioning markets in other words enhancing opportunities for individuals through the creation and enforcement of level playing fields within a transparent framework which serves economic social and environmental objectives While the government as owner of productive assets continues its retreat new forms of public private partnerships for example for investment in infrastructure or service delivery are being explored And finally there is much more attention being paid to the participation of stakeholders and community advocacy in public policymaking and implementation Security is another reason why government is back When it comes to the essential need for individual and collective safety there seems to be no alternative to a strong and efficient government Private partnerships will be involved like insurance security equipment even some policing But whether it concerns the security in airports transborder flows of merchandise biotechnology or food safety the public sector is obviously considered to be the guarantor of last resort That implies of course not only a reinforced responsibility of political players and public administrations it also calls for even greater respect for the principles of accountability transparency and the participation of stakeholders Without proper open government these values cannot be guaranteed Governments will remain in business if they are smart responsive and efficient and maintain public trust Good public governance will secure that confidence

stagnated for decades and millions have fled the labor force entirely the 19 percent of prime age males lacking full time work in 2018 would have marked the worst year on record prior to the Great Recession Life expectancy is falling nationwide driven by rising substance abuse and suicide among those without a college degree This crisis was neither unforeseeable nor uncontrollable it is the result of America s choice to define prosperity solely in terms of consumption and shape economic policy accordingly The abandonment of the American worker can be linked with two major developments in midcentury economic thinking which combined to produce the central metaphor of modern American politics the economic pie The first was the overwhelming importance assigned to measurement of the economy s total size This had been critical to the federal government s Keynesian response to the Great Depression which relied on public spending to boost demand and thus production Such management of the economy required accurate knowledge of production levels and trends so the U S Department of Commerce developed the system of national accounting that became the Gross Domestic Product a Herculean effort whose leader Simon Kuznets would win the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences When the Depression gave way to a global military conflict the outcome of which would turn on the industrial capacity of the Allied and Axis economies GDP became an existential concern As the economy regained its peacetime footing national accounts recorded fewer M4 Sherman tanks headed to the front and more Chevrolet Bel Air convertibles destined for the suburbs Notwithstanding Kuznets s warning to Congress that the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income GDP quickly became the primary measure of prosperity and GDP growth the primary goal of economic policy Long after saturation bombing ended cross country comparisons of GDP remained the means for assessing national power Read The mental health consequences of unemploymentThe second key midcentury development in economic thinking was the ascent of consumers and the priority given to their interests at the expense of producers Of course production and consumption are two sides of the same coin and each person potentially plays both roles If unions drive wages higher and prices rise households might benefit in their paychecks and suffer in the checkout line simultaneously If cheap imports drive domestic manufacturers out of business the reverse might be true But the goals of rising productivity for workers of all skill levels and in all places versus maximizing what each household can consume lead to very different policy agendas This tendency to prioritize consumption goes back at least to the days of Adam Smith who wrote in The Wealth of Nations Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer With the Depression the principle became entrenched as Keynesians struggled to ensure sufficient demand The broader 1960s cultural shift toward individualism and the priority placed on fulfilling desires also moved the consumer toward the economy s center In modern America efforts to promote the virtue of production over the vice of consumption are often regarded as archaic curiosities There is almost nothing more important we can do for our young than convince them that production is more satisfying than consumption wrote Republican Senator Ben Sasse in his best selling 2017 book The Vanishing American Adult In its review The Atlantic characterized this view as stoicism and self denial These trends helped bring about a dramatic expansion of the welfare state Trillions of dollars poured into low income households as the welfare system sought to guarantee an individual s right to consumption while doing nothing about if not actively retarding his ability to become more productive Today a welfare benefit such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program SNAP or food stamps gets credit for lifting people out of poverty merely because the benefit s cash value raises the recipients income above the poverty threshold even though it does nothing to help them gain a foothold in the economy and provide for themselves Read The link between opioids and unemploymentThe conviction that GDP offers a reliable proxy for prosperity and that each individual s satisfaction depends on the share of GDP she can consume underlies the economic pie metaphor which was born in the postwar years as well Per the metaphor a person s helping of pie is dictated by two factors the pie s total size and the share allocated to the slice Pie being an obviously desirable and delicious dessert one s instinct is to fight for a larger share at the expense of others But if the pie grows or seeing as pies do not grow if we just bake a bigger one everyone can have more Economic piety has gained remarkably widespread acceptance Presidents Truman Kennedy Johnson Ford Reagan H W Bush Clinton and Obama all deployed it Republicans tend to promote free markets that will grow the pie rapidly while grudgingly accepting a role for government in apportionment Democrats focus more on the role of government in guaranteeing big enough portions for all but generally recognize that more growth will mean more to go around Results have been extraordinary National GDP has tripled over the past 40 years spending on programs for redistribution has quadrupled The problem is not so much that public policy has failed as that it has succeeded at the wrong things America is like the classic romcom heroine who as the trailer intones had it all or so she thought She has the prestigious job and the elegant apartment yet she is not happy A constructive definition of prosperity would look different in two ways First within the economic context it would emphasize the ability to produce rather than the ability to consume Second it would attend to not only economic outcomes but also social foundations Much modern policy analysis works from the assumption that only quantifiable economic impacts matter either because economic growth and the accompanying rise in consumption is an end unto itself or because growth and consumption can be trusted to benefit society more broadly This is wrong Economic policies have dramatic effects on family and community health and the health of those social institutions in turn influences the economy profoundly Productive activities lie at the heart of most people s conception of a good life Higher material living standards are desirable but fulfilling obligations and serving others supporting a family contributing to a community and attaining competence or even excellence in a vocation are tied much more closely to life satisfaction a flourishing society and the creation of opportunity for the next generation More tangibly engaging in productive work is critical to self esteem mental health and life satisfaction Unemployed Americans are twice as likely as full time workers to receive treatment for depression the long term unemployed are three times as likely In empirical happiness studies life satisfaction drops 10 times more from unemployment than from a substantial loss of income And while people return to their previously self reported levels of happiness several years after marrying divorcing becoming widowed or welcoming a first child into the world they never get used to joblessness Read The black and Hispanic unemployment rates don t deserve applauseThe choice to emphasize consumption over production also has political consequences To paraphrase President John F Kennedy will people ask what they can do for their country or what their country can do for them Will they feel that they owe society the best they can produce or that society owes them what they want to consume Valuing consumption above all offers what looks like a get out of jail free card government spending Like a medieval indulgence a promise of redistribution cures all And if replacing lost income with a government benefit solves little or makes a bad problem worse this merely drives the indulgence s price higher next time around A healthier economic policy alongside a focus on people s interests as workers would recognize the importance of pluralism Economic piety envisions the entire nation gaining or losing ground at once Money being fungible everyone is presumed to have access to whatever he might choose to buy Production is not so simple People have different priorities excel in different ways and find meaning in different places so a production oriented prosperity that extends across society must offer numerous paths to its achievement Cities may be more economically productive for example but not everyone wants to live in a city Pluralism facilitates prosperity by allowing people to order their lives in ways closer to their ideals Pluralism aspires to a form of genuine opportunity not equal opportunity which has come to stand in American politics for the unachievable objective that every child should have equal life chances of arriving at any destination That is plainly impossible in a world in which individuals possess different innate characteristics and grow up in different environments Pluralism s genuine opportunity in contrast means that every person no matter where she begins has some agency to set the direction of her life to pursue accomplishments that give her life meaning to support a family and to raise children who will themselves have a wider range of choices than was available to her In practical terms this concept of prosperity call it productive pluralism points toward a very different model for economic policy Rather than maximizing GDP at every moment in time the overriding focus must be on the labor market s health ensuring that it reaches an equilibrium in which workers of widely varying aptitudes in all parts of the country can support strong families and communities A labor market like any market responds to the conditions in which it operates If its outcomes are ones unacceptable to society then policy makers must alter those conditions An education system that promises college or bust for instance produces some college graduates and a lot of busts a fine way to grow GDP but a disaster for the many who are left behind Efforts at environmental protection must be far more sensitive to the burdens imposed on industries such as manufacturing construction and resource extraction ones in which many less skilled workers especially men can work most productively and at the highest wages A share of the more than 1 trillion spent annually on safety net programs such as food stamps disability and Medicaid should go instead toward a subsidy for low wage workers that puts money directly into their paychecks encouraging employers to create such jobs and workers to take them An emphasis on labor market health also changes the analysis of trade and immigration policy In consumer welfare terms unconstrained trade and immigration appear to be unmitigated goods Not so from the worker s perspective How society draws borders around its labor market matters a great deal and imbalances take a serious toll A high level of trade can be beneficial but a large trade deficit is a problem It represents a dramatic expansion of labor supply with no accompanying expansion of demand A high level of unskilled immigration likewise is unwise amidst concern about the limited opportunities available to the existing unskilled workforce Productive pluralism not only aligns better than economic piety with people s needs at each moment in time but also offers a superior formula for long term prosperity by providing the foundations for replicating themselves over time In other words productive pluralism is sustainable Sustainability has a technical meaning The term is flung around casually in politics and increasingly in corporate marketing materials But the canonical definition provided in 1987 by the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development is striking Sustainable development meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs This provides a practical and moral principle divorced from any particular policy context a litmus test that can be applied anywhere Read Are low skill workers America s next great economic resource While sustainability is generally associated with environmentalism the issues it raises are not only or even primarily ones of natural and ecological resources What matters is the vitality of the endowments that allow society to replicate and expand its prosperity year after year generation after generation If economic growth fails to nourish the endowments on which it relies it is not sustainable Farmers want to maximize crop yields but most know better than to do this at the expense of their soil Society s economic endowments of physical and intellectual capital the infrastructure and machinery and innovation that power the economy are quite robust the capitalist system naturally invests in their upkeep and ensures that economic activity expands rather than depletes their stock Social endowments are another matter America s families and communities are responsible for transmitting opportunity shaping minds and instilling values from one generation to the next Families are overwhelmingly responsible for socializing children and preparing them for productive lives Communities play an important role in that process too and their economic profiles and support structures largely dictate the choices available to their members Unlike economic endowments social endowments have proved themselves highly vulnerable to depletion from among other things consumption oriented policies which erode opportunity and set in motion a downward spiral in which the next generation beginning from a worse point can likely offer even less to the one that follows When ways of life vanish or towns crumble or industries flee overseas they are not easily replaced When self sufficiency gives way to dependence cultural norms shatter Families that fail to form or fall apart leave both adults and children adrift Productive pluralism fosters the opposite dynamic It prioritizes outcomes that nourish and replenish social endowments supporting the formation of strong families and the vibrancy of strong communities If people understand prosperity and measure their own lives in terms of the contributions they make to continued social health they spur a virtuous cycle Productive citizens create even greater opportunity for the next generation of productive citizens That s what long term prosperity looks like Of course economic growth remains vital But not all growth is equally beneficial and the policy choices that yield the most immediate short term growth don t necessarily prepare the ground for sustained economic and social progress Material gains are better understood as the emergent property of long term prosperity Alongside stable institutions that protect basic freedoms productive pluralism of strong families and communities leads to entrepreneurship innovation and rising productivity It should come as no surprise that measures of social trust are highly correlated with GDP across countries and entrepreneurship across individuals Traditional economic theory also leads society astray in identifying specialization as the key to prosperity the MIT professor C sar Hidalgo and the Harvard professor Ricardo Hausmann have shown the opposite to be true The more diverse the array of knowledge within an economy the stronger its long term health If productive capacity atrophies even as consumption rises that poses a serious problem because that capacity is not something that an economy can scale back up at will Experience must accumulate supply chains must develop productivity must grow percentage point by percentage point year by year Where capacity and know how are lost or not built it becomes necessary to start over from behind those who moved more steadily forward Residential mobility is the issue that best captures policy makers misunderstanding of prosperity and the social endowments that foster it The willingness to pack up and move in pursuit of opportunity is part and parcel of the American Dream and a key element of the nation s economic vitality Yet as hardship has increased in recent decades the share of the population that relocates has declined If things are so terrible some economists grumble why won t anyone move They have built elaborate models to show how much higher GDP would be if only people lived where their productivity would be highest This gets things backward Strong families and communities launch people into the world to seek their fortune Relocation requires deep stores of social capital Without the skills and habits to access opportunity failure is likely Lacking a strong support base it can be hard to get started If someone is already dependent on government benefits and a move places those benefits at risk staying put can seem the better bet Geographic mobility can t rescue America from the consequences of its socially unsustainable growth because lower geographic mobility is one of those consequences Certainly genuine pluralism requires the opportunity to relocate But in most circumstances it should also include the opportunity to stay a choice that has always been and remains the norm and one Americans should applaud not lament Even when mobility was much higher it rarely amounted to the abandonment of existing communities The migration of Okies from the Dust Bowl of the 1930s may be the iconic American image of relocation in search of opportunity but Oklahoma s population declined only 2 percent during that decade In Kansas and Nebraska the declines were less than 5 percent As technology obliterated agricultural employment the population of Iowa held steady or increased in every decade from 1880 to 1980 Relocation tears people away from their communities If a critical mass relocates it can decimate the community left behind The idea that struggling communities should disband themselves is not a return to how things used to be it is an admission of catastrophic failure and a prescription for further disaster If Americans want to enjoy the fruits of long term prosperity including widespread relocation in pursuit of opportunity they will need to restore its prerequisites

it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 According to the May June 2017 issue of the Harvard Business Review the exodus might be gaining speed Chinese entrepreneurs are being both pushed and pulled into Africa On the push side China s ascendancy in global manufacturing is now coming under structural pressure A generation under the one child policy has shrunk the country s labor pool causing shortages in its coastal manufacturing hubs And labor costs have risen sharply in recent years Hourly manufacturing wages have increased by 12 percent annually since 2001 and productivity adjusted manufacturing wages nearly tripled from 2004 to 2014 According to Justin Yifu Lin a former chief economist at the World Bank China is on the verge of graduating from low skilled manufacturing jobs That will free up nearly 100 million labor intensive manufacturing jobs enough to more than quadruple manufacturing employment in low income countries To put that into perspective when manufacturing employment reached its peak in the United States in 1978 only 20 million people had jobs in American factories Now five times that number of jobs are about to migrate out of a single country China For the sake of the developing world I wish this were true Author Indermit Gill Nonresident Senior Fellow Global Economy and DevelopmentThe World Bank recently published a detailed report on the future of manufacturing ominously titled Trouble in the making Figure 1 shows two charts from the book The top chart shows that in 2015 money from manufacturing was split 50 50 by high income economies and the developing world China s share was half of the latter and still growing The rest of Asia was 10 percent and rising Africa barely registered Source Hallward Driemeier and Nayyar 2018 If you care more about jobs than money the bottom chart is more encouraging In 2010 manufacturing jobs were split 15 85 between high income and developing countries with Africa s share rising until 2010 But so was China s share Related Africa in focus Figures of the week Chinese investment in Africa Mariama Sow Thursday September 6 2018 Future Development Joyless growth in China India and the United States Indermit Gill Tuesday January 22 2019 Future Development How will we cope when there are too few young people in the world Edan Prabhu Tuesday October 10 2017We know what happened since at least until 2014 China s manufacturing employment was still rising In 2014 in just the formal sector the total was about 120 million manufacturing workers more than 10 times the employment in U S manufacturing To figure out how long this could go on it is useful to look at international comparisons of labor costs published by the Conference Board Manufacturing and Technology News warns Both narratives that China is losing manufacturing jobs and that the wage gap is almost closed between American and Chinese workers are far off the mark The reason for the ostensive rise in China s labor costs is the belief that its workforce is shrinking rapidly But a closer look at China s demographics would make you think again The alarm is about dependency ratios which are indeed projected to rise But what really matters for the subject at hand is the size of the workforce not the number of elderly Chinese The U N s population estimates indicate that the population aged 15 64 will be a billion in 2025 in 2050 the number of Chinese aged 15 69 will still be almost a billion Don t bet on China giving back manufacturing jobs any time soon Note The most recent estimates are available at https www un org development desa publications world population prospects the 2017 revision htmlThere is one scenario in which this could happen If manufacturing wages in China rose to levels close to those in high income countries Of course this would also likely mean that Chinese productivity would also have risen a lot and under plausible assumptions that in turn would mean that much fewer manufacturing workers would be needed to fulfill global demand for manufactured goods Either way for the slow and late industrializers in Latin America South Asia and Africa trouble is indeed in the making Future DevelopmentThis blog was first launched in September 2013 by the World Bank in an effort to hold governments more accountable to poor people and offer solutions to the most prominent development challenges Continuing this goal Future Development was re launched in January 2015 at brookings edu For archived content visit worldbank org On the ongoing trade negotiations If we re serious about resolving the core issues that the U S has with China then this is going to be a way station that s going to require a lot more continued focus by the administration for a number of months if not years Our mission is to help leaders in multiple sectors develop a deeper understanding of the global economy Our flagship business publication has been defining and informing the senior management agenda since 1964 Our learning programs help organizations accelerate growth by unlocking their people s potential Governments around the world want to deliver better education better health care better pensions and better transportation services They know that impatient electorates expect to see change and fast But the funds required to meet such expectations are enormous particularly in the many developed economies where populations are aging and the public sector s productivity hasn t kept pace with that of the private sector The need to get value for money from governments at all levels is therefore under the spotlight as never before But cost cutting programs that seek savings of 1 to 3 percent a year will not be enough and in some cases may even weaken the quality of service To address the problem public sector leaders are looking with growing interest at lean techniques long used in private industry From the repair of military vehicles to the processing of income tax returns from surgery to urban planning lean is showing that it can not only improve public services but also transform them for the better Crucially for the public sector a lean approach breaks with the prevailing view that there has to be a trade off between the quality of public services and the cost of providing them By improving an operating system the configuration of assets material resources and staff a lean approach can cut costs dramatically typically by 15 to 30 percent But cost savings are only part of lean s appeal as demonstrated by the experience of Toyota Motor the pioneer of these techniques in the 1950s and the only consistently profitable volume car manufacturer Lean aims to optimize costs quality and customer service constantly It does so by engaging and equipping employees to focus on creating and delivering value in the eyes of the customer and eliminating whatever doesn t contribute to this goal Contrary to popular belief lean is about making a process or operation fighting fit not about cutting it to the bone Many businesses have followed Toyota s lead and undergone a lean transformation A major European telecommunications company for example successfully applied lean techniques to a problem that was leading many of its customers to switch to competitors the repair of faulty telephone lines The company found that its call center operators diagnostics experts and repair technicians operated as though they actually worked for rival employers As a result it took an average of 19 hours to repair a line Using lean principles the company realigned its organization and invested in the development of team leaders In the first few months of its pilot project productivity increased by 40 percent and recurring failures fell by 50 percent The program was then rolled out across the company s national network where it achieved similar success 1 1 John Drew Blair McCallum and Stefan Roggenhofer Journey to Lean Making Operational Changes Stick Hampshire England Palgrave Macmillan 2004 Likewise a major European bank used lean techniques to reduce the processing time for mortgage applications to 5 days from 35 Because fewer applicants dropped out of the process the bank s revenues grew by 5 percent even as processing costs fell by 35 percent Is any of this relevant to the public sector Not surprisingly the concept and language of lean rooted as they are in manufacturing spark cynicism among many civil servants Some feel that their priority should be matters of policy not operations others resent the notion that they are somehow part of a production line Moreover without the incentive of the profit motive these government managers may believe they have neither a reason nor the levers to pursue a lean approach Yet practical experience suggests that they can In a UK government office processing large volumes of standard documents lean techniques achieved double digit productivity gains in the number of documents processed per hour and improved customer service by slashing lead times to fewer than 12 days from about 40 thus eliminating backlogs The proportion of documents processed correctly the first time increased by roughly 30 percent lead times to process incoming mail decreased to 2 days from 15 and the staff occasionally attains the nirvana of an unprecedented zero backlog In a UK military armored vehicle repair shop a lean transformation generated a 44 percent increase in the availability of equipment a 16 percent reduction in turnaround times and a more than 40 percent increase in right the first time production This achievement put about 40 more vehicles into operation at any one time Moreover the repair shop progressed from constantly missing its vehicle delivery deadlines to never missing them Persuading people to embark on the lean journey where the last stop may be their own removal or reassignment isn t easy To succeed public sector organizations must find a way to align their growth strategy providing new and better services at limited cost with a regard for the interests of their workers Although lean programs may cut the number of public sector jobs the goal is to make the remaining ones more rewarding Incentives come from the prospect of more meaningful work potentially with room for greater autonomy or a chance to develop new skills To be sure some countries bar layoffs of public sector workers In other cases union contracts make layoffs difficult Even so increasing operational effectiveness can free employees from one part of an organization to deliver new or better services in other areas within existing budgets and without layoffs For instance in Germany Berlin s state government which is barred by law from firing its workers took an innovative approach people no longer needed in one area were placed in labor pools where they could be selected for new assignments in others Even in the United Kingdom where workforce rules are more flexible the government reinvests much of the money saved through efficiencies in new services and workers often take on new roles Organizations can apply lean principles in almost any environment where a process can be defined at the working level Many public services military logistics employment agencies hospital tests social security benefits airport security checks use processes that lend themselves to efficiency and quality improvements Lean principles even apply in specialized fields such as legal casework and the development of policy Work in these areas tends to be solitary and the availability of e mail and voice mail discourages face to face collaboration Looking at such activities through a lean lens suggests that productivity can rise through more highly structured problem solving in teams a more flexible allocation of resources and a more sophisticated approach to managing knowledge From an operational viewpoint the aim is to smooth out the work flow A lean system is designed to eliminate waste variability and inflexibility see sidebar Three sources of loss though given the variety and complexity of many processes there can be no one size fits all lean template The needs of customers and the organization s goals and values drive the design But some important themes and principles of the lean approach do pose specific challenges for public sector organizations Sidebar Three sources of loss The overriding purpose of a lean system is to configure assets material resources and workers in a way that improves the process flow to the customer s benefit while minimizing losses caused by waste variability and inflexibility These forms of loss are apparent in the public sector where the consumer must often wait in lines whether to receive health care obtain a visa or pass through security checks to board an airplane Waste Toyota identified seven types of waste that inhibit a system s flows overproduction waiting transportation overprocessing inventory motion and rework Nearly all are relevant in the public sector Take transportation Is any movement of materials or people unnecessary Does the movement of files needlessly lengthen an application process In a prison system is poor case management causing unnecessary and duplicative trips between prisons and courts Similarly consider waiting times Do any idle periods result from poor coordination between activities Are expensive CT computerized tomography scanners say idle because of the booking system and do hospital operating rooms start work late because of staff shortages Likewise is work or inventory being stockpiled In a back office process for example employees may be either overworked or idle because work often accumulates before moving to the next stage Variability In the context of a lean system variability is any deviation in a service or product that creates unnecessary costs In manufacturing production variability might lead to the extensive reworking or scrapping of parts In the public sector variations in the way investigators gather evidence for a trial can lead to unnecessary acquittals Often managers use the inherent complexity of a process to justify a refusal to standardize any aspect of it However defining and sharing best practices can bring considerable benefits in quality and productivity Inflexibility Finally inflexibility refers to any systemic rigidity that prevents a supplier from meeting the customer s requirements at reasonable cost In manufacturing inflexibility could mean forcing customers to purchase a package of extras when they actually want only one In the public sector staffing levels are often inflexible the same number of police might work a shift on Monday night as one on a busy Saturday night Too often governments design public services on the one size fits all model in the mistaken belief that a standard service necessarily offers economies of scale In reality different customer segments require different levels and types of service These sources of loss are strongly linked to the overall objectives of a lean organization reduced costs higher quality and better customer service In the lean approach managers and staff tackle all three simultaneously to create a consistent flow The overriding purpose of a lean system is to configure assets material resources and workers in a way that improves the process flow to the customer s benefit while minimizing losses caused by waste variability and inflexibility These forms of loss are apparent in the public

necessarily offers economies of scale In reality different customer segments require different levels and types of service These sources of loss are strongly linked to the overall objectives of a lean organization reduced costs higher quality and better customer service In the lean approach managers and staff tackle all three simultaneously to create a consistent flow All activities must be tested to ensure that they add value for the customer Double checking to be sure that they do reminds the organization of its purpose and ensures that processes are efficient A car manufacturer or a retailer that fails to add value finds that its customers go elsewhere But in government departments and other public organizations putting customers first even if you could identify them may be more difficult One reason is a lack of competition Customers of the government job seekers or patients for example usually have no choice of provider The demands of the customer who may never even appear in the office rarely come into focus Much of the public sector remains supplier led not customer led But this norm could be changing In the United Kingdom for example the government is introducing reforms that would allow people to choose where they go for medical treatment Funding would follow the patient Still most public organizations do not have the agility or frontline empowerment to respond to the changing demands of their customers Systems committed to universal access such as the United Kingdom s National Health Service NHS do not have the luxury of refusing to serve a particular segment Defining value for customers in the public sector can also be elusive Costs quality and lead times are all important considerations in a lean system but social value and the equitable provision of services are more difficult to measure In health care for example how can a government balance the desire to give current patients the best possible treatment with the need to deliver care to people still on the waiting list One way to identify and then focus on the customer is to discuss these issues with the staff ensuring that any improvement effort is framed with the customer very much in mind Even in processes such as the criminal justice system counting the accused person as the customer is necessary to reframe and challenge traditional ideas and approaches The developers of a lean system identify end to end processes from a customer s perspective and then design and manage the system to keep information and materials flowing smoothly through those processes However public sector managers sometimes lack the skills experience and mind set to take this approach As in the private sector the only way to understand and manage a process is to see how it works Yet public sector managers don t always see themselves as supervising or managing an operation and it is unusual for a single person to be responsibile for an entire process In addition top down targets tend to focus on a single part of the operation to the detriment of the process as a whole One mail sorting facility for example set a target for dealing with incoming mail The target diverted attention from outgoing mail which sat in out trays for over two days A similar charge has been leveled at the requirement that 98 percent of accident and emergency patients in the United Kingdom must receive treatment within four hours The risk is that local hospitals may merely shift the problem elsewhere for example by admitting patients to a holding ward to circumvent the four hour deadline Compounding these difficulties is the growing propensity of governments to use outsourcing as a cost cutting measure without always considering the impact of the outsourced service on the overall process flow Outsourcing the work of hospital orderlies or transportation and logistics in a supply chain may reduce the fixed and variable costs of that particular activity Yet these moves may drive up total costs and reduce the quality of service Simply going for savings in one part of an organization may fail to improve its overall performance For all these reasons senior executives must learn the details of any process for which they are accountable In many cases senior managers and executives are flying blind or at best relying on data and reports that fail to capture the complexity of the system and the experience of those working within it To lead an organization that constantly strives to improve the chief executive of a hospital a social service agency or a prison must therefore spend at least one day a week on the shop floor As work flows cut across organizational boundaries it may be necessary to involve other departments or government agencies possibly with different or even conflicting incentives Consider the process of a trial An effective process must deliver the defendant and all the relevant case information to court at the right time At a minimum the activities of the arresting officer prison officials prosecutors victims witnesses and defense lawyers must be coordinated Failures of coordination are common leading to postponements delayed judgments and high opportunity costs To overcome such difficulties decision makers should develop a shared understanding of the process For the military repair shop mentioned earlier this meant involving more than ten departments and other stakeholders in a steering group and ensuring that the goals of the transformation process reflected their varied desires But competing interests sometimes impeded the overall process underscoring the need for changes extending well beyond the gates of the repair depot A key characteristic of a lean organization is its ability to improve itself constantly by bringing problems to the surface and resolving them Here as well the public sector often finds itself in a weaker starting position with gaps in skills and entrenched mind sets In a lean system the surface and solve dynamic works in much the same way as lowered water levels expose sandbars in a river For ships to navigate it without running aground the sandbars must be dredged and the cycle repeated continually The US Army Corps of Engineers has crews on the Mississippi Ohio and Illinois rivers from spring through November dredging sandbars to keep the shipping channels open Many organizations keep their water levels high and deal with problems only if they break the surface Such a system masks underlying problems Rather than removing them managers in the public sector are often tempted to add something to the system Government departments around the world have for example tried to improve their processes by installing expensive IT systems Many have delivered benefits some such as the case management system of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation have been expensive failures Huge benefits probably would have been more likely even without the new IT systems if government managers had tackled the underlying process problems McKinsey analysis has repeatedly shown that most benefits from IT investments go to organizations that use IT to improve already well managed processes 2 2 Stephen J Dorgan and John J Dowdy When IT lifts productivity The McKinsey Quarterly 2004 Number 4 pp 13 5 Moving from putting bandages over problems to solving them is particularly difficult in civil service organizations because of a skill gap Except in the military operations management has not traditionally been a career path leading to the top tier of public service Moreover high ranking civil servants tend to be organizationally and culturally removed from the delivery of frontline services so policies are often made without a clear understanding of their effect on customers What s more government reform programs are now under increasing scrutiny which makes it difficult to uncover problems without embarrassment A long tenured manager needs courage to expose the waste that lies within his or her department or the deep seated nature of its problems especially if they can be resolved at little or no cost The likely response will be If it was that cheap to fix why wasn t it fixed before Confronting such issues will demand brave leadership Uncovering systemic problems within the public sector must become more politically acceptable perhaps electorates will need to approve a waste amnesty When improving long term performance is the goal changing the process or the operating system will not suffice The organization s culture must also change Some of these changes will be wrenching A lean process for example requires a performance tracking system that breaks down top level objectives into clear measurable targets that workers at every level must understand accept and meet When performance isn t up to the standard action is required Tackling problems quickly and holding colleagues accountable for poor performance raises efficiency as well as morale A lean process also tends to address the problem of sticky resources prompting organizations to allocate them to shifting priorities more flexibly To mitigate the top down nature of target setting managers must often make changes themselves In so doing they should address the long standing complaints of the frontline staff complaints that typically include management s lack of engagement a greater desire for teamwork and the need to tackle underperformance Profound cultural changes generally follow and reinforce the lean transformation The organization s morale rises as participants build capabilities and see others developing as well Consider the processing of documents in the UK government office discussed earlier Before the change employees worked largely alone processing batches at their own convenience After the lean transformation they began working as a team which made everyone s activities transparent Every team member helped to solve problems when performance dipped and everyone worked together to identify opportunities for further improvement The new mind set brought on by the lean reconfiguration contributed to a 60 percent increase in productivity This new transparency however also raised a whole new set of tough questions including What should our performance targets be and What happens when those targets are not met Applying lean is difficult in the private sector and more so in the public sector Successful lean transformations must close the capability gap early in the process so managers and staff can make the transition to a new way of working Closing the gap typically involves hiring a few people with lean expertise and experience from outside the public sector to seed the transformation and build new internal capabilities Lean requires more than the courage to uncover deep seated organizational problems it may call for the ability to deal with job losses as well Without ducking this simple truth politicians and public sector leaders must outline the need for change explaining its benefits and the logic of the planned approach They need to tell all stakeholders including civil servants and the public a compelling story about the impact and long term benefits of change The challenge to do more with less will not go away A lean approach with its emphasis on lower costs but higher quality and customer service is surely worth investigating

reportManufacturing in 2050 will look very different from today and will be virtually unrecognisable from that of 30 years ago Successful firms will be capable of rapidly adapting their physical and intellectual infrastructures to exploit changes in technology as manufacturing becomes faster more responsive to changing global markets and closer to customers Successful firms will also harness a wider skills base with highly qualified leaders and managers whose expertise combines both commercial and technical acumen typically in science technology engineering or mathematics Constant adaptability will pervade all aspects of manufacturing from research and development to innovation production processes supplier and customer interdependencies and lifetime product maintenance and repair Products and processes will be sustainable with built in reuse remanufacturing and recycling for products reaching the end of their useful lives Closed loop systems will be used to eliminate energy and water waste and to recycle physical waste These developments will further emphasise the key role of physical production in unlocking innovative new revenue streams particularly as firms embrace servitisation and manufacturers make use of the increasing pervasiveness of Big Data to enhance their competitiveness In the public sector policy frameworks that affect the manufacturing sector directly and indirectly will need to recognise the extended nature of value creation and the new ways it is being developed Public planning cycles should match the timescales of firms own long term planning requirements And it will be important that flows of highly skilled workers patient capital and support to promote critical mass in small and medium sized enterprises are all internationally competitive The implications for UK manufacturing firms and the UK government are substantial Some businesses are already adapting and are world class but many are not positioned to succeed in a future world where greater opportunities will be balanced by greater competition The UK needs to radically change its approach to providing a constant and consistent framework within which all firms aspire to prosper A business as usual approach will not deliver that outcome Other economies are already ahead and catching up will require an adaptive capacity that the UK has not yet demonstrated Achieving this is essential as the future competitiveness and health of UK manufacturing will affect many other parts of the economy through its numerous linkages The key message is that there is no easy or immediate route to success but action needs to start now to build on existing support and to refocus and rebalance it for the future Above all policy design will need to address entire system effects This Report sets out many areas where action is needed at both strategic and more detailed levels However the following should be particular priorities The quality and skills of the workforce will be a critical factor in capturing competitive advantage It is essential that UK policy makers focus on the supply of skilled workers including apprenticeship schemes support for researchers and the supply of skilled managers Firms will need to pay much more attention to building multidisciplinary teams to develop increasingly complex products and also innovative business models It will also be crucial to address the current image associated with manufacturing Here government and industry should work together to further promote and market the opportunities for careers in manufacturing industries at all levels of education Financial challenges for the sector include a shortage of risk capital This is particularly evident as a funding gap between research and early development and the funding for proof of concept that is usually required before the market steps in There is also a shortage of funding for applied research and development in some areas such as the development of advanced green energy sources So although there are excellent schemes for public support such as Knowledge Transfer Partnerships funding of the Technology Strategy Board and public private partnerships such as the Energy Technologies Institute these are much smaller than in competitor nations Addressing this mismatch should be a priority Recent years have seen a resurgence in the development of industrial policies by governments in the UK and overseas In the UK industrial policies have been developed in 11 sectors led in most cases by groups from the public and private sectors with many of these encompassing manufacturing industries One specific development has been the creation of the Catapult Centres In particular the High Value Manufacturing Catapult provides a strong base on which to build substantial further effort It is recommended that its funding is substantially increased and used in part to encourage the greater involvement of smaller firms in particular Whilst specific initiatives are essential in areas mentioned above more is needed Recognition that the UK s national infrastructure suffered from fragmented policy making led to the creation of Infrastructure UK IUK Manufacturing suffers from similar challenges and is no less strategic for the future strength and resilience of the UK economy The Lead Expert Group of this Foresight project considers that a similar office to the IUK is needed for manufacturing This would be responsible for helping government to formulate long term policies that would take into account the extended value chain associated with manufacturing industries It should be staffed by experts preferably with substantial successful industry experience They would consider all of the issues highlighted in this report and develop and assist government with piloting new policies A UK Office for Manufacturing would need to work closely with IUK in view of the importance of infrastructure to manufacturing It would also need to work closely with industry particularly to improve skills and increase the ability of companies to innovate by working with relevant partners Other countries including the United States and Australia have developed relevant offices from which the UK can learn In summary manufacturing is too important to leave to its own devices The Lead Expert Group for this project comprising academic and industry leaders commend this report to government together with its associated analysis and evidence underpinning its conclusions It is surely unique in Europe if not globally for a government to commission a strategic look at the future of manufacturing as far ahead as 2050 This report involving some 300 leading business people experts and policy makers from 25 countries sets out a vision of manufacturing that is very different to what we recognise today Clearly both industry and government need to prepare for what will be considerable opportunities and challenges ahead The importance of manufacturing to the UK economy as set out here is incontrovertible Manufacturing is no longer just about production it is a much wider set of activities that create value for the UK and benefits for wider society Manufacturing includes significant innovation It creates jobs that are both highly skilled and well paid It also contributes to the rebalancing of the economy with its strong role on exports and import substitutions Through the government s industrial strategy we are already working with business on long range plans to strengthen advanced manufacturing sectors such as automobiles aerospace life sciences and energy supply chains We are developing the UK s ability to commercialise new technology and expand our skills base There are many UK manufacturing firms that are world class Indeed manufacturing leads other sectors in many areas including productivity exports and research and development There is no room for complacency however The analysis and advice contained in this report will help government to take its support for manufacturing to another level My officials will be working with the project experts to work out next steps I look forward to seeing how their conclusions help government and industry to harness the full potential of UK manufacturing This has been to take a long term and strategic look at manufacturing out to 2050 to In so doing a specific aim is to inform further development of the government s industrial and sector strategies The 2 year project has been run by the Foresight programme in the UK Government Office for Science under the personal direction of the Government Chief Scientific Adviser formerly Professor Sir John Beddington and since April 2013 Sir Mark Walport The Rt Hon Vince Cable MP the Secretary of State for Business Innovation and Skills has sponsored the project and chaired an industry High Level Stakeholder Group Annex C which provided strategic advice The project has based its analysis on the very best evidence Throughout it has been overseen by a multi disciplinary Lead Expert Group Annex D drawn from business and academia chaired by Sir Richard Lapthorne Chairman of Cable Wireless Communications plc In addition it has involved some 300 industry and academic experts business leaders and stakeholders from 25 countries They have contributed to 37 peer reviewed technical evidence papers and provided a wide range of insights and advice Valuable international perspectives were provided at workshops held in Asia Europe and the US The project report on which this summary report is based and all supporting material is available at www bis gov uk foresight This study is unique within Europe both in terms of its scope and its time frame which looks out to the year 2050 It will help Nissan to tune its product offerings and production processes to better meet likely demographic and market trends I am very encouraged by the efforts of the UK government to support manufacturing and this report builds on the excellent automotive and aerospace industrial strategies recently published by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills John Martin Senior Vice President Manufacturing Purchasing and Supply Chain Management Nissan Motor Co LtdManufacturing is essential for long term economic growth and economic resilience However many of its characteristics are changing profoundly Physical production processes are increasingly at the centre of much wider value chains Manufacturing is and must continue to be an essential part of the UK economy Its benefits include i Total Factor Productivity TFP is defined as the increase in output that is not due to an increase in the direct inputs used to produce goods and services ie labour physical capital and intermediate inputs Rather it is the more efficient use of these inputs The UK manufacturing sector is diverse with activities ranging from aerospace pharmaceuticals chemicals and automotives to food and drink It is characterised by a wide range of sizes of firm with a disproportionate share of activity accounted for by a small number of large often foreign owned multinational companies Although most firms are small with 87 of firms employing less than 20 employees in 2009 large firms generate most of the value added and dominate R D expenditure For example firms with 250 or more employees created 88 of the total gross value in 2009 and the largest 10 R D performers alone accounted for over a third of all manufacturing R D However in recent years the relative share of manufacturing in the UK economy has declined more rapidly than in other developed economies Figure 1 while the service sector has grown at a faster rate This growth of the service sector in the UK is consistent with growth in other developed economies including France and the US This deindustrialisation has also applied to UK manufacturing employment with numbers reducing at a faster rate than in other developed economies from close to 9 million people in 1966 to below 3 million in 2011 UK manufacturing performance has been weak relative to international competitors in some key areas But there are also many outstanding individual firms and some important areas of relatively strong performance for manufacturing as a whole Manufacturing has traditionally been understood as the production process in which raw materials are transformed into physical products through processes involving people and other resources It is now clear that physical production is at the centre of a wider manufacturing value chain Figure 2 and Box 1 Manufacturers are increasingly using this wider value chain to generate new and additional revenue with production playing a central role in allowing other value creating activities to occur For example 39 of UK manufacturers with more than 100 employees derived value from services related to their products in 2011 compared with 24 in 2007 Figure 3 This typically involves supporting or complementing products and offering outcome or availability based contracts for products Not all manufacturing firms report service revenue separately and there is no requirement for them to do so However in 2009 Rolls Royce reported 49 of its revenue from services and Arcelor Mittal reported 29 New sources of revenue and of value creation will transform manufacturing business models over time They will draw on new sources of knowledge and closer long term relationships with customers Future sources of revenue for manufacturers will include Manufacturing is entering a dynamic new phase which will provide substantial opportunities for the UK Looking ahead to 2050 this Foresight project has identified 4 key future characteristics of manufacturing They have significant implications for both government and industry Technology will play a central role in driving change Some of the value being created in 2050 will derive from wholly unanticipated breakthroughs but many of the technologies that will transform manufacturing such as additive manufacturing are already established or clearly emerging Table 1 summarises some of the most important pervasive and secondary technologies including ICT sensors advanced materials and robotics When integrated into future products and networks these will collectively facilitate fundamental shifts in how products are designed made offered and ultimately used by consumers Mass personalisation of low cost products on demand The historic split between cheap mass produced products creating value from economies of scale and more expensive customised products will be reduced across a wide range of product types Technologies such as additive manufacturing new materials computer controlled tools biotechnology and green chemistry will enable wholly new forms of personalisation Direct customer input to design will increasingly enable companies to produce customised products with the shorter cycle times and lower costs associated with standardisation and mass production The producer and the customer will share in the new value created For example research at the University of Loughborough shows that customers might be prepared to pay an additional 10 for some degree of personalisation Customisation is a significant opportunity for UK manufacturers targeting both the domestic market and other developed economies Distributed production We will see a transformation in the nature of production itself driven by trends such as new forms of modelling and additive manufacturing through to nanotechnologies and advanced robotics The factories of the future will be more varied and more distributed than those of today Figure 4 The production landscape will include capital intensive super factories producing complex products reconfigurable units integrated with the fluid requirements of their supply chain partners and local mobile and domestic production sites for some products Urban sites will become common as factories reduce their environmental impacts The factory of the future may be at the bedside in the home in the field in the office and on the battlefield Digitised manufacturing value chains Pervasive computing advanced software and sensor technologies have much further to go in transforming value chains They will improve customer relationship management process control product verification logistics product traceability and safety systems They will enable greater design freedom through the uses of simulation and they will create new ways to bring customers into design and suppliers into complex production processes Looking to the future we recognise that transformational change is required and emerging technologies present an opportunity to create a paradigm shift allowing us to manufacture medicines faster greener and at a lower cost Manufacturing has become increasingly critical in the pharmaceutical sector and will require more agility to respond to patient needs more flexibility to bring production closer to customers as well as increases in efficiency and sustainability This will underpin high quality standards and ensure new medicines are affordable for patients around the world The prize is significant and it is imperative that industry and government work together to seize this opportunity and secure a leading position for the UK Roger Connor President of Global Manufacturing and Supply GlaxoSmithKline plcImproving the speed and co ordination of the technology pipeline for UK manufacturing given the pace of change in technological developments and international competition the UK needs to strengthen the extended system that identifies and supports new technologies and their applications The UK s High Value Manufacturing HVM Catapult Centre established in 2011 has a key role in the near term and is an example of a step that the government has taken to develop a more systemic approach across research innovation and industrial policy Immediate priorities should be to scale up funding for the HVM Catapult Centre to promote much stronger involvement of small and medium enterprises in the member centres and to enhance the role it plays in connecting academic expertise to industry Longer term there is potential for the centre to support international collaboration between manufacturers for example by establishing a presence in key emerging economies Greater leveraging of the UK s intellectual assets The UK s education system has considerable strengths relative to international competitors However it files fewer patents than countries such as US Japan and Germany This suggests the UK is not leveraging its intellectual assets as much as it will need to in the future For example there needs to be a shift in the in balance of funding towards applied research and in its commercialisation There also needs to be increased effort to identify key areas such as sensors and additive manufacturing to develop technology roadmaps and to guide policy Protecting intellectual property reducing counterfeiting and avoiding cyber attacks Digitisation increases the risks of objects being copied illegally Technologies such as additive manufacturing may make it even harder to identify breaches However the same trends support innovation and new forms of value creation Today s regulatory and policy frameworks need to be reappraised to ensure they achieve the best balance between openness and the rights and obligations of intellectual property ownership in this changing environment They also need to consider what further action needs to be taken to address the threat of cyber attack which increasingly threatens information rich products and services Patterns of global trade and investment will determine the relative importance of the countries to which the UK exports and from which it imports the types of firms and sectors which will be involved in its trade the future structure and performance of manufacturing within the overall balance of payments the place of the UK in the global pattern of foreign direct investment FDI flows and the conduct of R D and investment in innovation Emergence of BRIC economies and the Next 11 BRIC economies Brazil Russia India and China are likely to become larger than the US by 2015 and the G7 by 2032 In addition the N 11 economies ii are likely to become larger than the US and almost twice the size of the Euro area by 2050 By value UK is low down the global list of exporters to China 24th and India 21st The UK is the world s 10th largest goods exporter with a 2 9 share of global manufacturing exports in 2012 However its share of imports to countries forecast to be in the top 30 economies by 2050 is generally disappointing and below this level The UK s relatively poor current placement in these markets will make it harder for it to benefit from their future growth ii Bangladesh Egypt Indonesia Iran Korea Mexico Nigeria Pakistan Philippines Turkey and Vietnam Continued importance of US and Europe for UK manufacturing exports The UK exported to 226 different countries or territories in 2010 The US was the most important destination accounting for 13 by value In 2012 EU markets accounted for about 54 of total export value with BRIC exports at 8 High tech likely to remain an area of UK advantage At 4 7 the UK s share of global high technology manufacturing exports is relatively strong Current high tech sectoral strengths include pharmaceuticals aerospace chemicals and the automotive sector Changing levels of personal wealth including larger and older populations in major markets The global population with annual per capita expenditure between US 3 650 and US 36 500 2005 prices is estimated to more than double in size from 2 billion in 2012 to 5 billion in 203033 Asia s share of the group will rise from 30 to 64 There will be 3 billion more people in the world by 2050 with 97 of population growth taking place in developing regions Populations in some major markets are growing significantly older with the Asia Pacific region having the oldest Japan and largest China Risks to foreign direct investment into Europe may affect the UK The UK has been a major recipient of inward FDI for manufacturing and remains in a good position to attract an above average share of FDI coming into Europe However FDI flows into Europe as a proportion of total available FDI are likely to reduce due to competition from BRIC and other emerging economies Continued global fragmentation of the value chain Fragmentation includes the outsourcing of functions and offshoring It is driven by factors such as the costs and quality of labour and transport security of provision the opportunities created by trade liberalisation the availability of data and information and the integration of suppliers into product development processes Many manufacturing value chains are likely to continue to fragment with the operation of supply chains playing a major role in determining future changes The international industrial systems view of manufacturing set out in this report points the way to creating and capturing value in a dynamic global economy Meeting the implied challenges will require radical new approaches which cross traditional disciplinary and institutional boundaries Professor Sir Mike Gregory Head of the Institute for Manufacturing University of CambridgeSome onshoring of production back to the UK Onshoring or reshoring is a recent trend typically involving the repatriation of production from low cost locations investment in onshore production to enhance capability and sourcing of components from onshore rather than from overseas This is typically in response to changing labour costs higher transport costs a need to be closer to the market product quality concerns and advantages of collocating R D and production There is little robust evidence about the scale of this trend so far see Box 2 for illustrations However some underlying trends suggest it will become increasingly possible for the UK to compete with lower cost locations on quality delivery speed and customisation Increasing foreign ownership If current trends continue the foreign owned manufacturing sector within the UK will account for a larger share of output by 2020 GVA and employment by 2015 than the UK owned sector The presence of multinational corporations MNCs will continue to help improve the performance of the UK s largest firms but the detail of the effects depends on the investment and production strategies of MNCs The quickest acting and highest octane fuel for growth in any economy is a blisteringly strong export performance The challenge for UK manufacturing is to recognise what things we re especially good at embrace them and drive them forward by investing time money and skills in them We should acknowledge our strengths and play to them Sir Richard Olver Chairman BAE Systems plcEnabling UK manufacturers to control global value chains As manufacturing value chains continue to fragment globally and new business models such as manufacturing services continue to develop it will become increasingly important for manufacturers to create and operate value chains to maximise revenues Government action in support of this needs to be agile and outward looking and informed by a common view of developments which draws upon intelligence from BIS Research Councils and the Technology Strategy Board A recent example of such action is a funding competition launched by the Technology Strategy Board this year this supports feasibility studies into new business models which in turn promote innovations in high value manufacturing Promoting co location of R D with production to maintain and build an industrial commons Products dependent on process driven innovation such as some drugs nano materials and some electronics applications benefit from the co location of different parts of their production systems Figure 5 Government has a major role to play nationally and locally in encouraging greater agglomeration and clustering of particular activities including encouraging co location of production alongside research and development Raising the UK s export performance particularly to emerging economies iii Products win export markets when they deliver value rarity and possess hardto imitate attributes Most exporting is done by firms with relatively high levels of productivity so measures to raise this for example by improving the quality of leadership and management will be key The role of UK Trade and Investment UKTI will also continue to be important and should be strengthened in markets offering the best potential for export growth This includes the provision of advice and market based intelligence to companies seeking to increase their exports or enter new markets and support to businesses once they are operating in a market for example in areas of language and culture Beyond these measures there is a need to understand much better what prevents the UK from having more exporting superstars firms which export 10 or more products to 10 or more destinations iii Industrial commons The embedded knowledge and technology framework that enhances the efficiency effectiveness and productivity of the proprietary capital and labour that use it Identifying phoenix industries emerging from previous manufacturing activities Established industrial regions typically possess important legacy assets such as specialised engineering skills pre existing personal networks technical skills and market knowledge National and local policymakers will need to develop new mechanisms to identify and exploit these legacies to support phoenix industries such as small and medium sized firms specialising in the production of high value sophisticated components for equipment manufacturers Success will depend on strong local alliances such as those behind specialised training and research programmes run by Sheffield University and other universities Keeping the UK attractive to manufacturing FDI 3 attributes that make the UK attractive to overseas investors include quality of life culture and language the stable political environment and technology and infrastructure Priorities for attracting future FDI for manufacturing include the provision of high quality e infrastructure and physical infrastructure roads in particular Ensuring a supply of patient capital UK capital markets are characterised by an arms length relationship between the providers and users of finance An emphasis on short term returns by investors leads to management focus on short term movements in stock market prices and the threat of takeover with long term investment in new capital equipment skills and training and R D spend inhibited These effects are damaging for manufacturing which requires relatively high long term investment in terms of new capital equipment R D and skills The institutional architecture which encourages impatience in corporate governance and the capital market must be addressed to support future UK manufacturing competitiveness Participants at the project s international workshops repeatedly emphasised the profound changes that environmental sustainability iv will have on production processes over the next four decades Figure 6 outlines these in 3 broad phases iv The terms sustainable manufacturing and the drive towards sustainability are frequently used in the Foresight work The definition of sustainability adopted here is that described in the widely cited Brundtland Report development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs Volatility of supply A growing global population and increased urbanisation 70 of the global population will live in urban areas in 2050 will increase demand for materials water energy and land As a result resources will be subject to greater competition with potential disruptions in their supply In most cases prices will rise and they may also become more volatile Those companies and nations that learn how to manufacture their products with less of these inputs will be more resilient to these effects Climate change and the increased vulnerability of global supply chains Climate change will have a range of impacts including rising sea levels and extreme weather events UK manufacturers will be affected by challenges such as the disruption of their international supply chains Greater use of regulation potential pricing of the environment Regulation is likely to focus increasingly on promoting resource productivity For example recent EU legislation aims to divert electrical equipment waste away from landfill Over the period to 2050 national and international responses are likely to include tougher environmental standards for products and new ways to price natural resources and ecosystem services Consumer pull for eco products Consumer demand for sustainable products which use less energy and fewer materials is growing although it is not clear how far and fast demand will change Unilever s pledge to double turnover without increasing greenhouse gas emissions and Marks Spencer s Plan A to go beyond compliance on the environment are examples of corporate responses Making robust products for collaborative consumption ICT based systems are facilitating new business models based on shared use of assets This shifts the business model from ownership to access incentivises manufacturers to provide robust products and allows the creation of new service based revenue streams Emergence of a circular economy in which end of life products are reused remanufactured and recycled Resource scarcity and higher costs for energy and waste disposal will shift manufacturing value creation to new models Figure 7 and Box 3 Incentivising product and process efficiency greater use should be made of well designed regulation in particular drawing upon ideas from abroad For example effective energy reduction has been demonstrated by innovative schemes such as Top Runner in Japan where future product standards are set so that all products manufactured at a specific point in the future must be at least as good as the best performance of today The government should consider developing top runner schemes in the UK for example relating to the energy usage of factories and also procurement and waste policies Targeting R D at improving resource efficiency and material substitution the UK has world class capabilities in key areas of research in novel material design and development Continued support for fundamental research should be complemented by programmes to develop rapid recycling and recovery technologies with non destructive removal of high value parts and materials from complex end of life products Supporting business models based on reuse remanufacturing and services government should work with industry and others for example in the UK such as the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts Manufactures and Commerce RSA and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to accelerate the development and roll out of the circular economy Lessons should also be drawn from overseas organisations such as the 2009 China Circular Economy Promotion Law Quantifying domestic reserves of critical materials It is essential that the UK makes the most of any domestic supplies of key materials where economically viable such as sources of indium widely used in the production of LCD displays and low melting temperature alloys See full size image Sustained future demand for manufacturing workers UK manufacturing employment has declined significantly in the past from around 9 million people in 1966 compared with less than 3 million in 2011 Any future declines will be much smaller with around 170 000 fewer people in the sector projected by 2020 compared with 2010 However there will be around 800 000 jobs to fill in the years up to 2020 as people retire or leave manufacturing An ageing population and the need to accommodate more older workers Over the period to 2050 the UK will have an ageing population with the number of people aged 65 years and over ie of traditional retirement age set to increase while the numbers of traditional working age people are set to decrease By 2030 17 of the UK population will be aged between 60 74 There will be a number of challenges in making manufacturing attractive to older workers particularly in sub sectors with the oldest age profiles including manufacturing of machinery and fabricated metal products Science technology engineering and maths STEM qualifications By 2020 there are expected to be an additional 80 000 managerial professional and associate professional and technical positions in manufacturing Overall many jobs will require apprentice degree and technician level STEM qualifications especially in product design and development Future demand is currently likely to exceed supply especially as at present only around a quarter of engineering and technology graduates work in manufacturing 6 months after graduation Demand for technical specialism combined with commercial and problem solving abilities The precise mix of skills in demand for the factories of the future will vary by sub sector see Table 2 but new blends of skills will increase manufacturers ability to exploit new opportunities These blends of high quality skills will allow developed economies such as the UK to increasingly compete in terms of the quality of their workforce A need to improve the perception of manufacturing amongst young people and women 68 69 and to raise the quality of UK managers Young people and women tend to have a negative perception of manufacturing with 67 of girls aged 7 11 years indicated that they would not like a job in manufacturing compared with 44 of boys In addition the UK currently fares poorly on the quality of its managers average scores for management practices in surveys of manufacturing in different countries show that Great Britain scores below the US Japan Germany Sweden and Canada but is on a par with Australia Italy and France Strong leadership teams and distributed leaders in key positions throughout manufacturing businesses will be essential in the future The potential for human enhancement By 2050 patterns of employment will be influenced by new forms of human enhancement and augmented capabilities These may support mental performance and physical mobility and help counter the effects of ageing Increasing and diversifying the supply of manufacturing workers to avoid future shortfalls There is a need to consistently reach out to young people in the education system to encourage them to study STEM subjects to keep their future options open focussing on accessing and attracting international talent for example through science visas and building and maintaining existing workforce capability for example by encouraging continual vocational education and training Equipping future workers with high quality skills that manufacturers will need potential workers will need to be as high quality and business ready as possible to meet the need for new skills sets driven by changing business models technology and other factors Higher level skills vocational training apprenticeships and STEM qualifications will be critical as the manufacturing workforce shifts to include a greater proportion of managerial professional and technical roles Government will need to increase the scale and ambition of its programme of current initiatives to meet these future requirements Ensuring that manufacturers utilise future workers effectively this will involve raising employer demand for skills to stimulate a supply which meets future needs as closely as possible and employers designing jobs that exploit new skills and capabilities for competitive advantage A common theme of all the future trends is the need for a highly talented skilled and flexible workforce We must do more to achieve a higher percentage of young people going into science and engineering and counter the current poor perception of manufacturing industries Manufacturing local to your consumers to deliver exceptional value is a trend we already see in the food and drink sector Understanding the complete value chain eg from farm to fork will enable businesses to deliver increased value to customers and consumers Richard Martin Chief Engineer Nestle UK IrelandAs manufacturing evolves policy makers will need new approaches which reflect the changing nature of manufacturing to ensure that the UK is a place where it thrives Manufacturing is no longer just about production making a product and then selling it Manufacturers are increasingly using a wider value chain to generate new and additional revenue from pre and post production activities with production playing a critical role in allowing these other activities to occur New metrics are needed to capture the new ways in which manufacturers are creating value and to assess the scale and location of important changes within the sector One way forward would be to pilot the development of new metrics focussed on the value chain Box 4 These will be critical in revealing key interconnections in the economy understanding the important role of production in the manufacturing value chain and helping to identify where in the value chain future policy intervention should focus to support manufacturers as they create and capture new and additional revenue streams New metrics will also help in developing an understanding of how policies in other areas affect manufacturing This report is very timely to prepare us for key opportunities and challenges and to ensure we use this changing manufacturing landscape to capture a larger share of global manufacturing than we currently enjoy in the UK Juergen Maier Managing Director Siemens UK and Ireland Industry SectorFuture industrial policies informed by updated metrics see Section 3 1 will need to complement strategic approaches to individual sectors by allowing for a wider variety of types of targeted interventions This provides an opportunity for developing the current government approach to industrial strategy New measures tailored to specific requirements of manufacturing sub sectors and the technologies upon which successful future business models will be built should include for example Future approaches to policy depend strongly on recognising that manufacturing is part of an extended system which requires a response from government that cuts across policy departments This requires a systems based approach that takes full account of the linkage between science technology innovation and industrial policies The result is the need for more integrated coordination by government across policy domains and government departments that makes it easier to anticipate the potential unintended consequences of policies and to identify where intervention would achieve the greatest impact Such an approach should help to avoid the adoption of selective policies based on narrow objectives that might inadvertently hold back sustainable growth and which are more a feature of the current approach which devolves policy making to different government departments with different roles and agendas The evidence collected by this project suggests that the greatest future need will be to remedy systems failures that affect the rapid emergence and uptake of new cross cutting technologies The future policy system must ensure that the most valuable new technologies are not missed and needs to work with researchers industry experts and policy makers so that government initiatives collectively support them In practice this will mean developing new ways to support emerging technologies including sophisticated use of roadmapping to identify what is needed to support technological change It is essential that institutional structures within government respond to changes in the manufacturing sector so that they can deliver the integrated systems approach which is advocated to enable more effective policy delivery and evaluation This can be helped by promoting a better sharing of understanding and intelligence between the Department for Business Innovation and Skills and the Technology Strategy Board in effect a shift in balance from sponsorship towards knowledge transfer A new institutional architecture can also help A particular issue here is developing policy with a longer term perspective independent of the instabilities produced by the electoral cycle Examples of where this has been achieved in other areas of policy include an independent Bank of England to implement monetary policy the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence NICE to advise the NHS on the take up of new treatments and the removal of ministerial discretion with regard to cases investigated by the Competition Commission However this has not generally been the case with regard to industrial policy In considering future industrial policy towards manufacturing and any related institutional reforms it is recommended that close attention be paid to developments in other countries These are consistent with the general arguments advanced in this section These examples are of the US Advance Manufacturing National Programme Office AMNPO see Box 5 the Australian Productivity Commission APC and the UK Independent Commission for Aid Impact ICAI Building on insights from these examples there is a clear need for future government capability in evaluating and coordinating policy over the long term to be strengthened The UK government should create an Office for Manufacturing which would These are incredibly exciting times for manufacturing in the UK I am delighted to be playing my part in this Foresight project and ensuring that manufacturing continues to be a key growth engine in the nation s economy for many years to come Nigel Stein Chief Executive GKN plcThis Foresight report looks out to 2050 and describes the transformation which will occur in the manufacturing sector and the environment in which it operates These changes will present major opportunities for the UK to develop competitive strengths in new and existing areas but they will also present considerable challenges and threats not least through increases in global competition It will be essential for government and industry to work together to forge new policy frameworks and develop measures so that manufacturing is able to fulfil its full potential for contributing to UK economic growth and prosperity and in rebalancing the economy Together the proposed measures put forward in this report build on the current industrial and sector specific strategies emphasising that government will need to significantly strengthen its future approach to ensuring a strong and resilient manufacturing sector Government needs to act in 3 systemic areas to Policies and measures also need to be developed to support manufacturing as it becomes The work in preparing this report has revealed issues affecting not only manufacturing but industry in general in the UK As immediate follow up it is recommended the government commissions detailed comparative studies into The report and its supporting evidence propose a wide range of specific insights and potential actions for the public and private sectors to explore These will need to be considered in the round and the UK will need to adapt if it is to avoid being left behind Many examples of new support initiatives and policy development have been identified in competitor countries All references are listed in the PDF summary

Annual Conference in Las VegasA centrally planned economy is an economic system in which the state or government makes economic decisions rather than the these being made by the interaction between consumers and businesses Unlike a market economy in which private citizens and business owners make production decisions a centrally planned economy controls what is produced and the distribution and use of resources State owned enterprises undertake the production of goods and services Centrally planned economies are also called command economies In these kinds of economies prices are all controlled the government sets plans for the future and the economy is handled by bureaucrats There is generally no reward for taking an economic risk and corporations are not allowed to fail Most developed nations have mixed economies that combine aspects of central planning with the free market systems promoted by classical and neoclassical economists Most of these systems skew heavily toward free markets with government interventions only for certain trade protections and coordination of certain public services Centrally planned economies assume that the market does not work in the best interest of the people and that a central authority needs to make decisions to meet social and national objectives These justifications are often made on the grounds of egalitarianism environmentalism anti corruption or anti consumerism which proponents of central planning do not consider that the free market adequately addresses The state can set prices for goods and determine how much is produced and it can focus labor and resources on industries and projects without having to wait for investment capital from the private sector Opponents of economic planning do not believe that a central entity has the capacity to collect or analyze the financial data required to make major economic determinations They argue that socialist and communist systems lead to inefficiencies and lost aggregate utility Free market economies are founded on the assumption that people seek to maximize personal financial utility and firms are profit seeking Each economic actor acts in its own best interest given the consumption investment or production options before it In this way these economic actors assure that price and quantity equilibrium are met and that utility is maximized Central planning has a different motivation at its core relying instead on moral obligation and membership within a community There are several general criticisms regarding centrally planned economies Those opposed say that governments just don t have the ability to properly predict the future and therefore cannot come up with proper plans for the economy These kinds of economies are also considered inflexible in that there is a degree of difficulty when it comes to responding to any surpluses or shortages Because the government is responsible for making economic decisions it s believed that there is a greater likelihood of corruption that does not necessarily come with a free market or mixed economy Finally there is the sense that with a centrally planned economy comes more political repression because consumers are not able to freely make choices the government rules with an iron fist Communist and socialist systems are the most noteworthy examples in which governments control the factors of economic production Central planning is often associated with Marxist Leninist theory and the former Soviet Union China Vietnam and Cuba The economic performance of these states have been mixed though they generally trailed more capitalist countries in terms of growth Historically most centrally planned economies have been administered in authoritarian states though participation in such an economy could theoretically also be elective Markets EconomyMarkets EconomyMarkets EconomyMarkets EconomyMarkets EconomyMarkets EconomyDownload this issue brief pdf Read the issue brief in

budgeting practices Unfortunately this left Americans convinced that government investments in the future are off the table because of large federal budget deficits that need to be reduced Americans were misled As the Center for American Progress points out the United States can balance our budget reduce our long term debt and make key investments in our future all at the same time CAP s plan works toward a more vibrant economy where all Americans are better off and clean energy is an integral part of this future Best of all the investments that government needs to make are relatively modest and can be paid for by ending wasteful spending in the same energy sector There is no doubt that Americans need clean energy because it s vital to our nation s economic competitiveness security and health There is also no doubt that government will play an important role in making the transition to clean energy Why Because the federal government always has been and always will be a player in energy markets The federal government has made investments in energy for more than a century by granting access to resources on public lands helping build railroads and waterways to transport fuels building dams to provide electricity subsidizing exploration and extraction of fossil fuels providing financing to electrify rural America taking on risk in nuclear power and conducting research and development in virtually all energy sources There s no reason that Washington should stop making new investments Considering the history government investment has led to amazing developments including universal access to reliable and affordable electricity lasting economic development and industrial growth This success story alone could justify continued government engagement of vibrant energy markets When we consider that investments in clean energy are investments in America s future it s clear that the smart choice is to make these investments to meet the next generation of energy challenges and to produce a foundation of affordable reliable and clean energy alternatives for future waves of investment and opportunity At the same time we can no longer afford indiscriminate or wasteful subsidies It is essential that government s investments in energy be fair effective and efficient This issue brief examines how the government currently invests in renewable energy when those investments are effective and how those investments should work in the future The federal government has a suite of tools at its disposal to make investments including cash grants regulatory incentives tax expenditures and financing supports When properly designed and targeted each of these tools plays an important role In the energy sector most government investment happens through the tax code Indeed for energy companies that receive federal support the most important day of the year is Tax Day when they receive a large amount of their government benefits In fact 44 percent of energy spending in 2010 was through the tax system with the remainder through other tools There are both good and bad reasons for this Both companies and the government have an established system for paying and processing taxes so providing investments through the tax code provides for efficient delivery of incentives by tapping existing infrastructure and rules More cynically however tax expenditures are an expedient that may be at cross purposes with good government practice because they are held to different budget standards than direct spending This means that working through the tax code is less transparent and therefore far easier to pass through Congress with reduced budget scrutiny These issues are discussed in detail in the CAP report Government Spending Undercover Spending Programs Administered by the IRS by Lily Batchelder and Eric Toder Tax expenditures are government spending programs that deliver subsidies through the tax code via special tax credits deductions exclusions exemptions and preferential rates While the actual implementation can be complicated tax expenditures are economically the same as direct spending both for the government and for beneficiaries With direct spending the government brings in tax money and then spends it while with tax expenditures the government simply reduces the taxes that a company owes Either way the company has more money and the federal government has less The underlying reasons for so much energy spending being done through the tax code are unlikely to change at least in the short term Therefore it s important that energy tax expenditures work well In previous CAP work we ve called for regular reviews of all tax expenditures to ensure this spending is effective efficient and necessary There are some energy tax expenditures that clearly do not meet this standard Sima Gandhi and I wrote in depth about this issue in America s Hidden Power Bill where we described obscure tax credits for the oil and gas industry that have existed for more than 80 years and have no demonstrable benefits for Americans Such tax breaks simply provide windfall benefits to these mature industries at taxpayer expense We also discussed several tax credits for clean energy that are much better designed This issue brief calls for Congress to take action on some of the most important clean energy tax issues in today s policy and political debates the production tax credit the investment tax credit and the Treasury Cash Grant Program Each of these can be extended in a way that both leads to powerful incentives for investment in our energy future and represents good tax policy Finally it s important to note that each of the three primary issues is significant for a different reason Because renewable energy sources have different characteristics they require different treatments within the tax code Simply extending the production tax credit is not sufficient Neither is extending the Treasury Cash Grant Program nor improving the investment tax credit Congress needs to do all of these things If Congress only takes action on one of these they will in effect be picking winners across technologies Congress should instead focus on a comprehensive investment package that creates paths for all technologies so that American businesses will invest in the technologies that make the most sense for our country Fortunately we already know some of the best ways for the federal government to make meaningful investments Through effective and efficient use of the tax code the government can continue to help drive deployment of the energy technologies that will be critical to our future This section describes the three most important tax issues for the government to consider in encouraging the next wave of strategic energy investment in the United States They are Let s look at each in turn The renewable electricity production tax credit or PTC is the most critical tax incentive for renewable energy projects using wind geothermal biomass and hydroelectric power technologies among others I ll focus on wind here because it s the most prominent but investment in all of these resources is important The PTC is linked to electricity generation from a project That is for each kilowatt hour of electricity produced the owner of a project gets a tax credit Tax credit means that the owner of the project gets to reduce their tax bill by a certain amount currently 2 2 cents per kilowatt hour or kWh at the end of the year Let s look at an example A typical large wind farm has several dozen turbines that can generate 100 megawatts of electricity Because the wind conditions are only favorable for part of the year it won t produce that much power all of the time Instead the wind turbines will only spin about 30 percent of the time This wind farm will generate 262 800 000 kWh each year which will earn 5 781 600 in tax credits from the PTC Let s be clear This is a 5 million government investment but it just happens to have gone through the tax code This tax credit is economically the same as government spending The government has less money than they would have without the investment and the project is more profitable It is also true that the incentive helped stimulate the investment that made both the income and the tax expenditure possible In short this investment helped directly create economic activity and growth Since its creation in 1993 the government has invested several billion dollars in wind power through the PTC These have been smart investments The PTC is intended to incentivize the deployment of energy sources that are more expensive than fossil fuel sources and whose cost will come down as more of the technology is deployed This is also known as driving a technology down its cost curve Since 1980 the cost of wind power has declined by 90 percent Declining costs are critical because they allow for more clean energy to be built which will improve our environment and diversify our power mix Indeed the PTC has led to massive amounts of new growth in the wind industry Since 1993 more than 40 gigawatts of new capacity have come online We know this growth is attributable to the PTC see Figure 1 Since its creation the PTC has only been extended for two years at a time When it s not in effect there s virtually zero investment When it is in effect investment is tremendous There are also more formal economic studies suggesting the positive outcome of the PTC Economist Gilbert Metcalf for example finds that T he data suggest that much of the current investment in wind can be explained by the production tax credit for wind For more information on how we know the PTC works see the CAP report America s Hidden Power Bill The PTC also has real benefits for American workers At least 85 000 people work in the wind industry These workers are spread all across our country and throughout the industry We have people making turbines installing them and operating them all in good paying jobs Unfortunately we don t have as many people working in the wind industry as we could While the wind manufacturing sector has grown in recent years it has historically been crippled by the PTC expiring every two years Manufacturers know that this on again off again cycle for the industry would leave them with virtually no business every other year so American wind farms use some imported parts Indeed we have more demand for certain turbine parts than we have domestic manufacturing capacity In particular U S manufacturing capacity is insufficient for gearboxes generators bearings and castings The lack of consistent policy is clearly contributing to U S underinvestment in domestic production of these strategic technologies Our economic competitors have simultaneously developed robust manufacturing capacity to serve both their growing domestic demand and meet global demand through technology exports see Figure 2 Over the past three years however the United States experienced tremendous growth in wind manufacturing partly because of the relatively stable PTC which was most recently extended for four years as part of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act known as the stimulus In that time new manufacturers set up shop across the country and the composition of domestic parts that each turbine made has steadily increased while our wind energy imports declined This should be a lesson to Congress A long term PTC is more valuable than a short term extension when we look at the overall impact on jobs and growth Instead of allowing the PTC to expire this year it should be extended for at least four more years to give confidence and stability to investors throughout the supply chain This doesn t mean however that the PTC should be extended indefinitely without review This is exactly one of the biggest problems with many of the deeply flawed fossil fuel subsidies If Congress wants to extend it beyond that timeframe they should build in a review process to evaluate whether or not the credit should be adjusted in any way Congress should review the size of the credit and review whether or not it should be linked to inflation Ultimately as the industry matures and markets expand the PTC like other subsidies that have done their work and grown strong domestic industries should be allowed to sunset taking taxpayers off the hook for payments While the production tax credit primarily benefits wind the solar industry is the primary beneficiary of the investment tax credit or ITC The ITC works a little differently in a way that makes more economic sense for the type of capital investment required for developing solar energy projects Instead of the tax credit being spread over 10 years and only awarded as energy is produced renewable energy developers get an upfront tax credit based on the initial investment in the project For solar power the credit is worth 30 percent of the initial investment So if a building owner spends 6 million to put a 1 megawatt solar energy system on a building s rooftop the building owner is then awarded a 1 8 million tax credit but the owner is not allowed to claim any other tax credits over the life of the project The upfront one time nature of the ITC has some real benefits for solar power First solar is a more expensive technology to initially install so investors have a special need for the investment based incentive Second solar is a younger industry than wind and the technology isn t quite as proven over the long term This means that future energy production is slightly less certain with solar power than with wind power so a production based incentive would be less valuable Just like the PTC the ITC has been a tremendous success The solar industry has experienced extremely impressive cost improvements see Figure 3 Not surprisingly as costs fall and demand rises the solar industry now employs more than 100 000 people up from 20 000 just five years ago The ITC was extended until 2016 as part of the stimulus bill The extension provided very valuable certainty to the solar market but when it expires Congress should also review the size and effectiveness of this credit Despite their incredible successes the PTC and ITC aren t perfect and they don t provide a complete offering to meet the full range of project financing needs faced in the emerging renewable energy market The biggest problem is that most renewable energy projects are structured in such a way that they don t earn profits for the first several years of the project s life The developer only owes taxes on profits not revenues so they may not owe any taxes for years after building the project At the same time tax credits are used to reduce the amount of taxes owed Thus if the developer doesn t owe any taxes the associated credits are worthless This is a structural limitation of using the tax code to support strategically valuable public investments Traditionally project developers have worked around this problem by bringing in so called tax equity investors These investors typically large financial institutions essentially buy the tax credits from a project This cash from the tax equity investor is extremely valuable and allows developers to monetize the tax benefits without actually owing taxes This system worked fairly well before the financial crisis There was more than 6 billion in tax equity available in 2007 The pool of tax equity capital shrank dramatically though when large financial institutions no longer owed taxes as they lost money in 2008 and 2009 This shortfall was fixed with something called the Treasury Cash Grant Program This program also known as the Section 1603 program because of where it s included in the stimulus bill does two things This means that all renewable developers are able to get a cash grant from the Treasury Department for 30 percent of the initial investment in their project This solved the tax equity market shortfall problem and allowed renewable investments to continue Instead of shrinking the wind and solar industries grew during the recent recession largely because the Section 1603 program helped with financing Unfortunately this program drew to a close at the end of 2011 After creating the program in 2009 Congress extended it for one year at the end of 2010 Now they should extend the program for at least one more year and ideally change it to run concurrently with the underlying PTC and ITC always matching their expiration dates This is especially important because there s not expected to be enough tax equity available to meet the demand In 2011 the U S Partnership for Renewable Energy Finance estimated that there was a total of 7 5 billion available through tax equity and the Treasury Cash Grant They project that there will only be 3 6 billion in tax equity available in 2012 which is far less than recent history suggests will be needed see Figure 4 The cash grant program makes the PTC and ITC more effective more efficient and more transparent It makes absolutely no sense to have this beneficial program on a different schedule than the tax credits it improves In addition to overcoming a simple shortfall in investment capital from the tax equity market the cash grant program has several benefits that make it superior to a tax credit First the cash grant is more economically efficient In a best case scenario the tax equity investor is going to buy tax credits at a slight discount it makes no sense to pay full price because then there s no possible profit for the investor In real life however there s evidence that tax equity investors buy tax credits at a much deeper discount The Bipartisan Policy Center finds that even though a tax credit and cash grant may have the same face value to the government the tax credit is only half as valuable as the cash grant to the project developer and thus is dramatically less effective at producing clean energy outcomes Second the cash grant is much more transparent When a developer claims the ITC all they do is check a box and write in a number on a tax form When they claim the cash grant however they submit much more information such as details on the project and the number of jobs that will be created with the investment And while tax information is strictly confidential the Treasury publishes a list of every project that has received a Section 1603 cash grant If Congress does choose to extend the cash grant program to always match the PTC and ITC extensions thus making this public spending more efficient for taxpayers they should also evaluate the size of the tax credits The overwhelming popularity and the evidence of the cash grant s economic efficiency seem to indicate that the ITC could be made smaller if it is always offered as a cash grant In addition to the three key policies described above there is a fourth way that the tax code could be improved to boost renewable energy For many years the technologies eligible for the PTC and ITC have remained unchanged But there s no reason that new developments in renewable energy technology shouldn t be accounted for with modifications to the tax code Most importantly Congress should place technologies within the PTC or ITC or both depending on the unique characteristics of each technology and their specific capital investment needs The offshore wind industry is poised to take off in the waters off of America s East Coast Unfortunately as Michael Conathan and I wrote in Clean Energy from America s Oceans More than 40 000 megawatts of offshore wind energy capacity have been permitted around the globe yet the United States accounts for barely 1 percent of that and we have yet to generate our first watt of electricity from this abundant carbon free source of power There s no shortage of interest in building offshore wind farms and several projects are moving forward with permitting and siting The right government investment can provide critical support for leveraging private capital investment in these projects to accelerate the growth of this new American industry In many ways offshore wind looks more like solar than it looks like onshore wind For instance the technology has extremely high upfront costs These are expected to rapidly decline over time but they are currently a significant barrier to investors entering this market Further the offshore wind technology is largely unknown and unproven in the eyes of American investors and returns are therefore discounted in the capital market Because the future production from an offshore wind farm is less certain than with onshore wind the value of the production tax credit is also unpredictable Congress should address this issue by making offshore wind temporarily eligible for the ITC which better suits this emerging industry As the industry grows and more closely resembles onshore wind the technology should shift back to the PTC Clean renewable energy is a bright spot in the U S economy This industry is a success story that has resulted in job creation scientific innovation cleaner air and a stronger manufacturing sector Yet this is still a young industry and it still needs significant public investment Importantly this investment should be structured in a way that supports the entire industry in an efficient cost effective manner When the government invests in clean energy they need to match the tools available to the specific technologies and businesses that they re supporting In this issue brief we have explained why the production tax credit should be extended This is the fundamental tool that the government uses to invest in renewable energy and it has been a tremendous success But extending the PTC is not sufficient to support the whole industry Other technologies require an investment tax credit which can be made more effective when issued as a cash grant as in the Section 1603 Treasury Cash Grant Program Finally there are new types of renewable energy that are not properly treated in existing law Offshore wind power is much better suited to the ITC than the PTC and Congress acknowledged this by making offshore wind specifically eligible for the ITC This strategy of strong investment in renewable energy with the investment channeled through a mix of tools will make America a better place Congress should start 2012 by making this happen Richard W Caperton is Director of Clean Energy
