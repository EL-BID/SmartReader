Existing cash support can be patchy and is not always tightly targeted to the poor Transfers received by working-age individuals in low and high-income groups, 2013 or latest year available Note: Age group 18-65, 18-62 in France. Public social cash transfers at the household level, adjusted for household size.
 Income groups refer to disposable incomes. Additional data provided by France show that, without counting old-age and disability pensions, the bottom 20% in France receive about three times as much as the top 20%.

At current spending levels, a basic income would be well below the poverty line Non-elderly benefit spending per capita and guaranteed minimum income (GMI) level as a percentage of the poverty line, 2013 Note: Poverty thresholds are 50% of median disposable household income.
 Per-capita spending is in gross terms and refers to total cash transfer except old-age and survivor pensions, but including early-retirement benefits where these can be identified, divided by the number of residents aged below 65 (62 in France). Where receipt of old-age pensions among working-age individuals is relatively common (e.g. in France), true per-capita amounts of all “non-elderly” benefits is significantly higher. Some countries (e.g.
 Luxembourg) pay significant amounts of benefits to non-residents; dividing total expenditure by the resident populations only overestimates true per-capita amounts in these cases. Social assistance amounts refer to the main means-tested safety-net benefit available for working-age people and do not include cash housing benefits that may be available separately. No nationally applicable general GMI entitlements existed in Greece and Turkey. Social Assistance in Italy refers to the Sostegno per l'inclusione attiva GMI programme that started being rolled out nationally in 2016; no nationally applicable GMI programme existed prior to that.

See Box 2 for details. BI amounts are shown after tax and are 9% higher than existing single-person GMI in Finland and as much as 97% higher in Italy. In France, the budget-neutral BI amount would be 2% below current GMI levels and in the United Kingdom, the budgetary neutral BI amount would be 28% below current GMI levels. Poverty line is 50% of median household income adjusted for household size using square root of household size. Source: Secretariat calculations using EUROMOD.
