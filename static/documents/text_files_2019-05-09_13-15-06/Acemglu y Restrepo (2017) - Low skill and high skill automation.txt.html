				</style><p>We present a task-based model in which high- and low-skill workers compete against machines in the production of tasks. Low-skill (high-skill) automation corresponds to tasks performed by low-skill (high-skill) labor being taken over by capital. Automation displaces the type of labor it directly affects, depressing its wage.</p><p><a href="#1"><mark>Through ripple effects, automation also affects the real wage of other workers.</mark></a> Counteracting these forces, automation creates a positive productivity effect, pushing up the price of all factors. Because capital adjusts to keep the interest rate constant, the productivity effect dominates in the long run.</p><p>Finally, low-skill (high-skill) automation increases (reduces) wage inequality.</p>
