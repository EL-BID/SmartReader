by unlocking their people s potential Automation and artificial intelligence AI are transforming businesses and will contribute to economic growth via contributions to productivity They will also help address moonshot societal challenges in areas from health to climate change At the same time these technologies will transform the nature of work and the workplace itself Machines will be able to carry out more of the tasks done by humans complement the work that humans do and even perform some tasks that go beyond what humans can do As a result some occupations will decline others will grow and many more will change While we believe there will be enough work to go around barring extreme scenarios society will need to grapple with significant workforce transitions and dislocation Workers will need to acquire new skills and adapt to the increasingly capable machines alongside them in the workplace They may have to move from declining occupations to growing and in some cases new occupations This executive briefing which draws on the latest research from the McKinsey Global Institute examines both the promise and the challenge of automation and AI in the workplace and outlines some of the critical issues that policy makers companies and individuals will need to solve for Automation and AI are not new but recent technological progress is pushing the frontier of what machines can do Our research suggests that society needs these improvements to provide value for businesses contribute to economic growth and make once unimaginable progress on some of our most difficult societal challenges In summary Beyond traditional industrial automation and advanced robots new generations of more capable autonomous systems are appearing in environments ranging from autonomous vehicles on roads to automated check outs in grocery stores Much of this progress has been driven by improvements in systems and components including mechanics sensors and software AI has made especially large strides in recent years as machine learning algorithms have become more sophisticated and made use of huge increases in computing power and of the exponential growth in data available to train them Spectacular breakthroughs are making headlines many involving beyond human capabilities in computer vision natural language processing and complex games such as Go These technologies are already generating value in various products and services and companies across sectors use them in an array of processes to personalize product recommendations find anomalies in production identify fraudulent transactions and more The latest generation of AI advances including techniques that address classification estimation and clustering problems promises significantly more value still An analysis we conducted of several hundred AI use cases found that the most advanced deep learning techniques deploying artificial neural networks could account for as much as 3 5 trillion to 5 8 trillion in annual value or 40 percent of the value created by all analytics techniques Exhibit 1 Deployment of AI and automation technologies can do much to lift the global economy and increase global prosperity at a time when aging and falling birth rates are acting as a drag on growth Labor productivity growth a key driver of economic growth has slowed in many economies dropping to an average of 0 5 percent in 2010 2014 from 2 4 percent a decade earlier in the United States and major European economies in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis after a previous productivity boom had waned AI and automation have the potential to reverse that decline productivity growth could potentially reach 2 percent annually over the next decade with 60 percent of this increase from digital opportunities AI is also being used in areas ranging from material science to medical research and climate science Application of the technologies in these and other disciplines could help tackle societal moonshot challenges For example researchers at Geisinger have developed an algorithm that could reduce diagnostic times for intracranial hemorrhaging by up to 96 percent Researchers at George Washington University meanwhile are using machine learning to more accurately weight the climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AI and automation still face challenges The limitations are partly technical such as the need for massive training data and difficulties generalizing algorithms across use cases Recent innovations are just starting to address these issues Other challenges are in the use of AI techniques For example explaining decisions made by machine learning algorithms is technically challenging which particularly matters for use cases involving financial lending or legal applications Potential bias in the training data and algorithms as well as data privacy malicious use and security are all issues that must be addressed Europe is leading with the new General Data Protection Regulation which codifies more rights for users over data collection and usage A different sort of challenge concerns the ability of organizations to adopt these technologies where people data availability technology and process readiness often make it difficult Adoption is already uneven across sectors and countries The finance automotive and telecommunications sectors lead AI adoption Among countries US investment in AI ranked first at 15 billion to 23 billion in 2016 followed by Asia s investments of 8 billion to 12 billion with Europe lagging behind at 3 billion to 4 billion Even as AI and automation bring benefits to business and society we will need to prepare for major disruptions to work Our analysis of more than 2000 work activities across more than 800 occupations shows that certain categories of activities are more easily automatable than others They include physical activities in highly predictable and structured environments as well as data collection and data processing These account for roughly half of the activities that people do across all sectors The least susceptible categories include managing others providing expertise and interfacing with stakeholders Nearly all occupations will be affected by automation but only about 5 percent of occupations could be fully automated by currently demonstrated technologies Many more occupations have portions of their constituent activities that are automatable we find that about 30 percent of the activities in 60 percent of all occupations could be automated This means that most workers from welders to mortgage brokers to CEOs will work alongside rapidly evolving machines The nature of these occupations will likely change as a result Automation will displace some workers We have found that around 15 percent of the global workforce or about 400 million workers could be displaced by automation in the period 2016 2030 This reflects our midpoint scenario in projecting the pace and scope of adoption Under the fastest scenario we have modeled that figure rises to 30 percent or 800 million workers In our slowest adoption scenario only about 10 million people would be displaced close to zero percent of the global workforce Exhibit 2 The wide range underscores the multiple factors that will impact the pace and scope of AI and automation adoption Technical feasibility of automation is only the first influencing factor Other factors include the cost of deployment labor market dynamics including labor supply quantity quality and the associated wages the benefits beyond labor substitution that contribute to business cases for adoption and finally social norms and acceptance Adoption will continue to vary significantly across countries and sectors because of differences in the above factors especially labor market dynamics in advanced economies with relatively high wage levels such as France Japan and the United States automation could displace 20 to 25 percent of the workforce by 2030 in a midpoint adoption scenario more than double the rate in India Even as workers are displaced there will be growth in demand for work and consequently jobs We developed scenarios for labor demand to 2030 from several catalysts of demand for work including rising incomes increased spending on healthcare and continuing or stepped up investment in infrastructure energy and technology development and deployment These scenarios showed a range of additional labor demand of between 21 percent to 33 percent of the global workforce 555 million and 890 million jobs to 2030 more than offsetting the numbers of jobs lost Some of the largest gains will be in emerging economies such as India where the working age population is already growing rapidly Additional economic growth including from business dynamism and rising productivity growth will also continue to create jobs Many other new occupations that we cannot currently imagine will also emerge and may account for as much as 10 percent of jobs created by 2030 if history is a guide Moreover technology itself has historically been a net job creator For example the introduction of the personal computer in the 1970s and 1980s created millions of jobs not just for semiconductor makers but also for software and app developers of all types customer service representatives and information analysts Partial automation will become more prevalent as machines complement human labor For example AI algorithms that can read diagnostic scans with a high degree of accuracy will help doctors diagnose patient cases and identify suitable treatment In other fields jobs with repetitive tasks could shift toward a model of managing and troubleshooting automated systems At retailer Amazon employees who previously lifted and stacked objects are becoming robot operators monitoring the automated arms and resolving issues such as an interruption in the flow of objects While we expect there will be enough work to ensure full employment in 2030 based on most of our scenarios the transitions that will accompany automation and AI adoption will be significant The mix of occupations will change as will skill and educational requirements Work will need to be redesigned to ensure that humans work alongside machines most effectively Automation will accelerate the shift in required workforce skills we have seen over the past 15 years Demand for advanced technological skills such as programming will grow rapidly Social emotional and higher cognitive skills such as creativity critical thinking and complex information processing will also see growing demand Basic digital skills demand has been increasing and that trend will continue and accelerate Demand for physical and manual skills will decline but will remain the single largest category of workforce skills in 2030 in many countries Exhibit 3 This will put additional pressure on the already existing workforce skills challenge as well as the need for new credentialing systems While some innovative solutions are emerging solutions that can match the scale of the challenge will be needed Our research suggests that in a midpoint scenario around 3 percent of the global workforce will need to change occupational categories by 2030 though scenarios range from about 0 to 14 percent Some of these shifts will happen within companies and sectors but many will occur across sectors and even geographies Occupations made up of physical activities in highly structured environments or in data processing or collection will see declines Growing occupations will include those with difficult to automate activities such as managers and those in unpredictable physical environments such as plumbers Other occupations that will see increasing demand for work include teachers nursing aides and tech and other professionals As intelligent machines and software are integrated more deeply into the workplace workflows and workspaces will continue to evolve to enable humans and machines to work together As self checkout machines are introduced in stores for example cashiers can become checkout assistance helpers who can help answer questions or troubleshoot the machines More system level solutions will prompt rethinking of the entire workflow and workspace Warehouse design may change significantly as some portions are designed to accommodate primarily robots and others to facilitate safe human machine interaction The occupational mix shifts will likely put pressure on wages Many of the current middle wage jobs in advanced economies are dominated by highly automatable activities such as in manufacturing or in accounting which are likely to decline High wage jobs will grow significantly especially for high skill medical and tech or other professionals but a large portion of jobs expected to be created including teachers and nursing aides typically have lower wage structures The risk is that automation could exacerbate wage polarization income inequality and the lack of income advancement that has characterized the past decade across advanced economies stoking social and political tensions Most countries already face the challenge of adequately educating and training their workforces to meet the current requirements of employers Across the OECD spending on worker education and training has been declining over the last two decades Spending on worker transition and dislocation assistance has also continued to shrink as a percentage of GDP One lesson of the past decade is that while globalization may have benefited economic growth and people as consumers the wage and dislocation effects on workers were not adequately addressed Most analyses including our own suggest that the scale of these issues is likely to grow in the coming decades We have also seen in the past that large scale workforce transitions can have a lasting effect on wages during the 19th century Industrial Revolution wages in the United Kingdom remained stagnant for about half a century despite rising productivity a phenomenon known as Engels Pause PDF 690KB after the German philosopher who identified it In the search for appropriate measures and policies to address these challenges we should not seek to roll back or slow diffusion of the technologies Companies and governments should harness automation and AI to benefit from the enhanced performance and productivity contributions as well as the societal benefits These technologies will create the economic surpluses that will help societies manage workforce transitions Rather the focus should be on ways to ensure that the workforce transitions are as smooth as possible This is likely to require actionable and scalable solutions in several key areas There is work for everyone today and there will be work for everyone tomorrow even in a future with automation Yet that work will be different requiring new skills and a far greater adaptability of the workforce than we have seen Training and retraining both midcareer workers and new generations for the coming challenges will be an imperative Government private sector leaders and innovators all need to work together to better coordinate public and private initiatives including creating the right incentives to invest more in human capital The future with automation and AI will be challenging but a much richer one if we harness the technologies with aplomb and mitigate the negative effects James Manyika is chairman and

trapped in a room with its mate looks uncannily like a dog well maybe a mutant dog with a canary yellow body and a proboscis sticking out where its head should be The robot confidently scurries to the door raises itself to the perfect height and then uses its appendage to press down the handle Pulling open the door the robot allows its mate to be first across the threshold before the two of them make their dash for freedom Such is the content of a short video by Boston Dynamics that has gone viral since it was released in February Reactions to it on social media have ranged from amusement soon they ll be opening our fridges and stealing our beer to alarm this is how we die It is the latest evidence of recent remarkable advances in robotics and artificial intelligence robots can now perform backflips and ride bicycles and machines empowered by AI are able to analyze X ray images better than expert radiologists and to teach themselves to play the ancient game of Go better than world champions Yet the dog clip is also powerful because it conjures up a more worrisome vision of robots on the loose beyond the control of us humans Thus it plays into a powerful angst laden contemporary narrative about technology and the future of work and maybe even of mankind itself What really are the risks from this new wave of technology And will the opportunities these advances bring with them outweigh those risks To address such questions about the future it is useful indeed necessary to look to the past Technology has for centuries both excited the human imagination and prompted fears about the effects Back in 1589 Queen Elizabeth I of England refused to grant a patent to a stocking frame invented by one William Lee because Her Majesty was concerned about the effect of the contraption on the livelihoods of those who knitted stockings by hand The Luddite weavers in Britain and silk workers in Lyons France famously staged revolts in the early 19th century against new automated looms that threatened their skilled and well paid jobs And in the realm of fiction imagination has run riot since the Czech writer Karel Capek coined the word robot from a Slavic word for work in his 1920 play Rossum s Universal Robots a k a RUR which ends with the destruction of mankind As one of Capek s characters explains Robots are not people Mechanically they are more perfect than we are they have an enormously developed intelligence but they have no soul For 100 percent of continuous 10 year periods in the United States technologically driven productivity gains have gone hand in hand with rising employment Almost a century later that same concern about soulless hyper intelligence infuses not just movies like The Matrix and mind bending video series like Philip K Dick s Electric Dreams but also warnings about AI and its potential consequences expressed by Elon Musk and the late Stephen Hawking among others Back in the 1950s the German philosopher Martin Heidegger fretted about the risk that humans would become enslaved by the technologies we rely on With the rise of machines able to mimic many human traits from speech albeit still falteringly to facial recognition already significantly more accurately than humans that time appears to be much closer Yet when we switch from philosophy to economics we find a very different story a long historical record of innovation that shows technological change has been overwhelmingly positive for productivity and surprisingly benign when it comes to employment Job displacement has occurred in waves first with the structural shift from agriculture to manufacturing and then with the move from manufacturing to services Throughout productivity gains generated by new technology have been reinvested and the GDP bounce from that productivity eventually raises consumption and on balance increases the demand for labor In McKinsey s research we have sought to quantify this trend and its net impact in several ways For example we looked at the very big picture what happened to employment as productivity grew over the past 50 years We found no tradeoff between the two for 100 percent of continuous 10 year periods in the United States technologically driven productivity gains have gone hand in hand with rising employment Even when measured in one year snapshots productivity and employment have risen together four years in five The personal computer provides an iconic case to support the compatibility of technological progress with job growth We measured how many jobs were lost and how many gained in the United States between 1980 and 2015 as a result of the diffusion of computer technology Several hundred thousand bookkeepers and auditing clerks secretaries and typists did lose their jobs But the overall balance was strongly positive the desktop laptop computer created more than 19 million jobs in industries ranging from computer hardware to enterprise software to online retail sales against the loss of about 3 5 million jobs a net gain of 15 7 million That figure amounts to 18 percent of all the net U S employment created in the period almost one in five jobs Something similar happened with the invention of the automobile which destroyed the horse and buggy business but gave rise to a wealth of new sometimes unimagined products from petroleum based synthetic rubber to motels That said we ignore those left along the way at our peril For the many workers who are displaced painful transitions are a reality In Britain during the industrial revolution starting in about 1800 wages of the masses stagnated for almost a half century despite a strong surge in productivity that enriched the owners of capital a phenomenon often referred to as Engels pause because it was first noted by the German philosopher who co authored with Karl Marx The Communist Manifesto Wages picked up again as the fruits of productivity gains eventually trickled down to workers But eventually can be a long time the Luddites fears were not entirely unfounded And once again today the link between productivity gains and wage growth seems bent if not broken U S median hourly compensation rose only 11 percent from 1973 to 2016 even as hourly labor productivity grew by 75 percent While it is natural to focus on labor displacement through technology one element often overlooked in the discussion of the future of work is the number of jobs that are neither lost nor gained but fundamentally changed for reasons that are hard to predict History again provides some examples When ATMs became as common as vending machines in the 1970s the number of bank tellers actually increased That s because the new technology reduced the costs of processing individual transactions giving the banks incentives to open more branches to meet local demand for other financial services The tellers primary tasks changed from cashing checks and taking deposits to providing advice and selling securities mortgages and the like To be sure this tale is not yet complete with the rise of online banking the demand for tellers has again waned and so their numbers have thinned especially after the 2008 financial crisis But modern economies are nothing if not dynamic and the only certainty is change There s a similar story to be told about jobs and information technology Thanks to the internet and some ingenious software anyone can now dig up information at the blink of a cursor Yet the need for data analysis has exploded even as the need for data gathering clerks and the like has plummeted And so the number of information analysts of the genus homo sapiens has quintupled since 1980 to about two million today This largely comforting history isn t much help in determining whether this time will be different To the point the rise of ever more sophisticated technologies especially artificial intelligence that can be brought to bear on any number of tasks is likely to usher in a new age of rapid workforce transitions The McKinsey Global Institute recently estimated that in our fastest automation adoption scenario as many as 375 million workers worldwide or about 14 percent of the global workforce will need to switch occupational categories by 2030 in order to avoid obsolescence Even if the pace of adoption is slower as in our midpoint scenario some 75 million workers will need to switch occupational categories in the next 10 to 15 years Among the work most vulnerable to automation jobs that require routinized physical activity in a predictable setting and collecting and processing data Some aspects of the current technological transformation seem in line with that of previous eras the rise of computers for example and earlier epochs of technical change such as the diffusion of the steam engine that transformed work across multiple sectors of the economy simultaneously Every new wave of automation seems remarkable at the time and AI is not the first technology to chip away at cognitive tasks Since the birth of computerized spreadsheets in the 1980s machines have tackled ever more sophisticated problems that previously required human brainpower Still other aspects of the new technologies do seem qualitatively different from previous waves of innovation The rate of technological change today is strikingly rapid and while hard to measure appears to be accelerating Consider in this regard the development of deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques based on neural networks the exponential increase in computing capacity made available through the cloud and the sheer volume of data that can be generated These advances are driving AI for example enabling the development of autonomous vehicles but also heralding breakthrough applications such as a heightened ability to diagnose disease with non invasive techniques Accordingly the share of jobs that could be automated could also be larger than historical precedents suggest The future of work looks set to be not a tale of machines replacing humans but of machines complementing humans in the workplace That said we see no evidence to date suggesting that the time it takes for new technologies to be diffused throughout the economy is shrinking Looking at a range of high value technologies over the past 60 years from airbags to MRI machines to smartphones we find that the pace of adoption hasn t changed It still takes between 5 and 16 years to reach 50 percent adoption and 5 to 28 years to reach 80 percent adoption Even highly popular social media applications do not beat this clock Facebook for example was begun in 2004 and had attracted more than 2 2 billion followers 13 years later but the untapped market remains vast Consider too that new technology is rarely applied to a blank canvas a variety of economic and social factors play a big role in determining the pace of adoption They include the cost of developing and deploying the hardware and software labor market dynamics the regulatory environment and social acceptance Computer algorithms in state of the art technology aircraft can do just about anything asked of them without a helping hand but we still insist on humans in the cockpit for peace of mind And who wants to be cared for in a hospital solely by a robot We remain disconcerted by the uncanny valley the term coined by the Japanese robotics guru Masahiro Mori to characterize that unsettling feeling people may experience when facing humanoid robots Indeed for tech luminaries ranging from the MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson to the former Google chairman Eric Schmidt the future of work looks set to be not a tale of machines replacing humans but of machines complementing humans in the workplace The rise of AI and the ascendance of self learned algorithms whose logic can be hard to explain pose some arguably unique problems A recent report from a who s who of experts on the malicious use of AI lists a number of the darkest scenarios from political manipulation through hyper personalized disinformation campaigns to a major increase in sophisticated computer hacking attacks For now AI pioneers including Google DeepMind s chief executive Demis Hassabis are clear that while machines are proving formidable in specific areas such as games we remain a long way away from the time when they will have mastered a general artificial intelligence enabling them to think and act like humans And a number of groups including Stanford University s AI100 with which I am associated are trying to look ahead to study and anticipate how AI will affect the way people live work and play long into the future The challenges here for policymakers and business leaders worldwide are significant We will need to institute retraining of workers on a scale we have not seen for generations We will need to rethink and adapt our social systems to help hundreds of millions of workers affected by the new technologies hopefully handling it better than we have handled globalization in providing both new forms of income and job transition support We will need to find ways to tame the wilder unpredictable side of AI For their part CEOs will need to rethink their organizational structures and processes to take advantage of the technologies and the performance enhancing effects they can have or risk ending up in the recycle bin of business history While all of this may seem intimidating it is still the best way forward We should embrace automation technologies for the productivity benefits they bring even as we deal proactively with the workforce transitions that will accompany adoption Given that demographic trends increased longevity low birth rates are rapidly increasing the dependent population our societies really need that productivity boost Beyond the prosperity and employment these technologies will create there will be other societal benefits new moonshots as we use the power of AI to tackle daunting problems from cancer to climate change We can already see one of the key challenges that of worker retraining or reskilling as some like to call it advancing to the top of the corporate agenda and in some countries also receiving renewed political attention In our recent work on the skills that will be needed by the workforce we found that demand will rise sharply not just for technological skills of all kinds but also for social and emotional skills that is leadership and empathy with customers as well as for higher cognitive skills linked to creativity and complex information processing Business leaders tell us that they believe finding the right talent to help implement automation is critical to their future financial performance and they expect companies to take the lead in the skills upgrade that is required Some firms are already putting in place large scale retraining initiatives AT T is using external education providers including for example Udacity At SAP the German enterprise software company the focus is on in house efforts to create learning journeys for thousands of employees including engineers who need to acquire softer skills as their roles change to service customers directly Walmart has set up more than 100 academies in the United States that provide hands on training for positions that include customer service managers and online grocery pickup While welcome these disparate retraining efforts are barely a start Given the scale of the occupational and skill shifts that we see coming in the next decade much more will need to be done and not just by business Governments and educational establishments working together with philanthropic foundations will of necessity be part of the mix Foundations have the advantage of being able to test innovative programs as pilots and will not face the disadvantage of concern that workers with new skills will subsequently jump ship for a new employer As a starter governments will need to reverse the 20 plus year decline in spending on labor related services no small task in light of tight government budgets and in the United States reflexive opposition to government intervention They will also need to be more flexible in order to adapt to the rapidly changing workplace Mobility is one key yet labor markets have become markedly less dynamic in recent years In the United States for example job reallocation rates have declined by 25 percent since 1990 This is the time to test ideas such as portable benefits that are owned by workers and not tied to particular jobs or companies Technology itself can help facilitate greater mobility especially digital platforms turbocharged by AI that enable matching of people to jobs But we also need to rethink some basic assumptions In order for changing jobs across sectors to become a common practice companies will need to agree on definitions and qualifications for specific skills And a major debate is overdue about credentialing Today higher education encourages the world to judge graduates by their subject knowledge rather than by their skills in problem solving and creative thinking skills that will be especially valuable in an AI enhanced workplace More than anything we need to prepare for this new era in which humans must work alongside smart machines far more intensively President Lyndon Johnson was prescient in this regard writing a half a century ago Automation is not our enemy Our enemies are ignorance indifference and inertia Automation can be the ally of our prosperity if we will just look ahead if we will understand what is to come and if we will set our course wisely after proper planning Back then nobody other than science fiction writers could have imagined robot dogs opening doors and escaping to wherever those androids from Blade Runner found refuge But LBJ s words resonate planning for change has never been

generally rises Erik Brynjolfsson Director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital EconomyThe rapid pace of technical advances and the increasing feasibility of automation has created questions about the future of work and its potential for displacing workers Estimates of the scale of threatened jobs over the next decade or two range from 9 to 47 according to a 2016 White House research report This is defined as those working in jobs where more than 70 of their activities can be automated On average nearly one half 46 of work activities in the country are currently automatable Share of Jobs with Highly Automatable Skills by EducationMost of this risk is concentrated among lower paid lower skilled and less educated workers Workers earning below 20 per hour face a greater than 80 chance of displacement More than two out of five workers without a high school degree have job skills that are considered highly automatable These projections should raise concerns about the ability of communities to tackle existing issues of social equity and affordable housing that could be exacerbated by automation Share of Jobs with High Probability of Automation by Occupation s Median Hourly WageJob tasks that are most susceptible include predictable physical tasks which make up 8 of all work tasks data processing 16 processing and data collection 17 On the other end of the spectrum work that either involves managing others 7 or applying expertise 14 proves the least susceptible However even these jobs aren t immune to some degree of automation This magnitude of shifts in work activities over multiple decades is not unprecedented The share of U S farm employment fell from 40 in 1900 to 2 in 2000 while the share of manufacturing employment fell from approximately 25 in 1950 to less than 10 in 2010 In both cases new activities and jobs were created that offset those that disappeared What may be unprecedented is the pace of the change and scale of people affected That said a decline in immigration to the United States and the aging population decline in the share of the working age population will open economic growth gaps at the same time that we re seeing job disruption due to automation We will see large scale shifts in workplace activities over the next century and these trends are already underway These shifts are inherent in automation technologies and also a consequence of a shifting labor demographic Millennials who already constitute the largest workforce population in the U S are demanding greater flexibility and autonomy than previous generations Building an educated workforce and rethinking our educational and training programs is the most critical task in preparing for the future of an automated world says Erik Brynjolfsson director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy and co author of The Second Machine Age Work Progress and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies Individuals will be required to have not only coding skills he says but also more diverse math reading interpersonal and creative skill sets According to the National League of Cities The Future of Work in Cities report nearly all 95 of the 11 6 million jobs that have been created since the last recession required some postsecondary education While science technology engineering and math STEM skills are emphasized many employers are also looking for primary and secondary educational systems to address gaps in workplace competencies like teamwork problem solving and communication STEM skills may power new technologies but the soft skills of collaboration critical thinking and interpersonal skills are vital components of the jobs likely to endure automation The balance of these skills will remain essential to prepare students with the human digital capabilities they will need As more restaurant orders are automated and shopping moves further online humans who work in these retail sectors will be expected to provide the customer with something extra something social to shift toward selling more personalized or unique experiences what the experts call the commodification of experience New technology and peer to peer platforms as well as a greater emphasis on personal craftsmanship and human ability have fueled the growth of a creative class of individuals capable of marketing their work from home This emphasis will likely continue to spread across the lower skilled labor market where individuality and a personal touch are valued and where services cannot be outsourced or easily automated Cities should encourage entrepreneurship and reduce barriers to innovation For example they can limit the number of occupational licenses necessary or streamline the process to get new licenses The 21st century worker will need a lifelong learning mindset to be successful and use digital resources to enable digital skills development The nation will need to reverse its declining investment in our workforce if we are going to sufficiently prepare people for future jobs in an era of automated work Scholarship Sacramento Valley Vision based in Sacramento created a comprehensive online platform of local scholarships for students who live in the Sacramento region to help address the growing costs of advanced education tuition at four year public colleges is up 33 since the 2007 08 school year They have identified approximately 350 000 in local scholarship funds in Sacramento County Since the program s inception in 2013 it has reached more than 1 000 students and their families with scholarship education and one on one and group mentoring Degrees At Work in Louisville In 2010 Louisville made a citywide commitment to add 55 000 college degrees 40 000 bachelor s and 15 000 associate degrees to its workforce by 2020 They first targeted the lowest hanging fruit the more than 90 000 local adults who had already completed some college coursework Degrees At Work aims to help 15 000 working adults earn degrees by 2020 working with local companies that have stepped up to provide tuition reimbursement college advising and flexible schedules for their employees Long Beach Internship

robot posing as a human being scheduled a reservation over the phone We all knew artificial intelligence was coming but it was breathtaking to hear software come to life Before we go any further let s get our terms straight Automation and artificial intelligence are not the same thing According to Dave Evans Automation is software that follows pre programmed rules Artificial intelligence is designed to simulate human thinking Automation in this context refers to the impact of artificial intelligence on tasks that only humans can perform today Even if you re skeptical of Google Duplex in light of the current backlash Alexa has made her way into millions of homes Amazon and Google are proving the value of artificial intelligence to consumers Apple still has a ways to go with Siri While Alexa won t take down the government there was a recent debate about the impact of automation on democracy that s worth watching Intelligence Squared U S features debates about current events Each episode puts forward a provocative motion like Automation Will Crash Democracy Two teams of two debate the motion There are polls conducted at the beginning and at the end of the debate A team wins by persuading audience members to change their opinion Ian Bremmer and Yascha Mounk argued for the motion insisting automation will crash democracy Andrew Keen and Alina Polyakova argued against the motion It s unclear whether the middle class can survive an AI revolution It could leave very few jobs for the masses In this scenario the rich would end up with even more power And without a middle class it s hard to sustain a healthy democracy Not scary enough for you Tech pioneers like Elon Musk and Bill Gates have spoken out about the dangers of artificial intelligence Although Gates thinks Musk should take it down a notch Musk is so concerned that he co founded OpenAI The nonprofit which he also chairs researches artificial intelligence to make the technology safer and more accessible Ian Bremmer one of the debate s participants recently published a bestselling book titled Us vs Them The Failure of Globalism Even though the motion didn t reference China Bremmer invoked the country for good reason Bremmer insists the US could be at a disadvantage Right now it s either Silicon Valley or it s China Those are the drivers of automation Since the actual government drives innovation in China they can leverage the technology and advance it The United States government doesn t have that level of control over its technology sector Moreover based on the recent Facebook hearings it s hard to imagine the US government confronting the threat of automation in a meaningful way Mounk fears a consolidation of power So I think that there s two different ways in which democracy might come under pressure The first is that there s going to be enclaves of very rich people who actually own all of the productive material in society which is the machines and robots and so on being asked to give up more and more money in order to finance that nice universal basic income scheme Throughout the debate he derides universal basic income as a program that can easily be abused Mounk thinks democracy is far fetched in this new world We ve only ever had democracy in the time period from the French Revolution until today when political leaders needed citizen armies when we could rely on average citizens to stand up to defend the country against enemies abroad and to keep the peace at home He believes the rich will protect themselves with their own robot armies and no longer need the middle class The counterarguments from Andrew Keen and Alina Polyakova were more optimistic Keen is an entrepreneur and author Polyakova is a fellow at the Brookings Institute They believe regulation will provide the proper guard rails for innovation That s why they reject all the doomsday scenarios that could result from automation Polyakova also has faith in new industries if we look at every technological revolution we see far more jobs created or people transitioning into a different industry versus just mass unemployment It s easy to hold the AI revolution up to the industrial revolution but it s different While I believe automation will create new jobs the current rate of change is so unprecedented it s hard to compare it to the past Both sides of the debate agree regulation can thwart many of the potential threats of automation It s unclear where the United States will find the political will to respond given its current legislative gridlock The artificial intelligence revolution will challenge America s system of government but it s still worth wondering can democracy survive Find out which team won the debate Watch it here Follow Theo on Twitter or go

event on government modernization that 20 to 30 percent of all work activities will soon be automatable thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence He pointed to a Deloitte study of the federal workforce that found 4 3 billion hours are spent each year on a wide range of task and activities A huge share of those hours is devoted to essentially moving paper he said while relatively little time goes to coaching and other sorts of human activities But the study also found that four out of five of the most labor intensive activities have either a medium or high automation potential Eggers said That could allow for reductions in certain parts of the workforce he noted but it also frees up time for critical higher value work and the chance to deliver better service by giving the human workforce AI powered support Studies have repeatedly shown Eggers said that it s the human machine pairing that gives the best results he said The full video of Eggers half hour talk which

Brookings book The Future of Work Robots AI and Automation In Edward Bellamy s classic Looking Backward the protagonist Julian West wakes up from a 113 year slumber and finds the United States in 2000 has changed dramatically from 1887 People stop working at age forty five and devote their lives to mentoring other people and engaging in volunteer work that benefits the overall community There are short work weeks for employees and everyone receives full benefits food and housing 1 The reason is that new technologies of the period have enabled people to be very productive while working part time Businesses do not need large numbers of employees so individuals can devote most of their waking hours to hobbies volunteering and community service In conjunction with periodic work stints they have time to pursue new skills and personal identities that are independent of their jobs In the current era developed countries may be on the verge of a similar transition Robotics and machine learning have improved productivity and enhanced the economies of many nations Artificial intelligence AI has advanced into finance transportation defense and energy management The internet of things IoT is facilitated by high speed networks and remote sensors to connect people and businesses In all of this there is a possibility of a new era that could improve the lives of many people 2 Yet amid these possible benefits there is widespread fear that robots and AI will take jobs and throw millions of people into poverty A Pew Research Center study asked 1 896 experts about the impact of emerging technologies and found half of these experts 48 percent envision a future in which robots and digital agents will have displaced significant numbers of both blue and white collar workers with many expressing concern that this will lead to vast increases in income inequality masses of people who are effectively unemployable and breakdowns in the social order 3 These fears have been echoed by detailed analyses showing anywhere from a 14 to 54 percent automation impact on jobs For example a Bruegel analysis found that 54 of EU jobs are at risk of computerization 4 Using European data they argue that job losses are likely to be significant and people should prepare for large scale disruption Related Technology Innovation How artificial intelligence is transforming the world Darrell

studied 702 occupational groupings and found that 47 percent of U S workers have a high probability of seeing their jobs automated over the next 20 years 5 A McKinsey Global Institute analysis of 750 jobs concluded that 45 of paid activities could be automated using currently demonstrated technologies and 60 of occupations could have 30 or more of their processes automated 6 A more recent McKinsey report Jobs Lost Jobs Gained found that 30 percent of work activities could be automated by 2030 and up to 375 million workers worldwide could be affected by emerging technologies 7 Researchers at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD focused on tasks as opposed to jobs and found fewer job losses Using task related data from 32 OECD countries they estimated that 14 percent of jobs are highly automatable and another 32 have a significant risk of automation Although their job loss estimates are below those of other experts they concluded that low qualified workers are likely to bear the brunt of the adjustment costs as the automatibility of their jobs is higher compared to highly qualified workers 8 Related Books Going Mobile By Darrell M West 2014 Behavioral

on grounds new positions will be created to offset the job losses the fact that all these major studies report significant workforce disruptions should be taken seriously If the employment impact falls at the 38 percent mean of these forecasts Western democracies likely could resort to authoritarianism as happened in some countries during the Great Depression of the 1930s in order to keep their restive populations in check If that happened wealthy elites would require armed guards security details and gated communities to protect themselves as is the case in poor countries today with high income inequality The United States would look like Syria or Iraq with armed bands of young men with few employment prospects other than war violence or theft Yet even if the job ramifications lie more at the low end of disruption the political consequences still will be severe Relatively small increases in unemployment or underemployment have an outsized political impact We saw that a decade ago when 10 percent unemployment during the Great Recession spawned the Tea party and eventually helped to make Donald Trump president With some workforce disruption virtually guaranteed by trends already underway it is safe to predict American politics will be chaotic and turbulent during the coming decades As innovation accelerates and public anxiety intensifies right wing and left wing populists will jockey for voter support Government control could gyrate between very conservative and very liberal leaders as each side blames a different set of scapegoats for economic outcomes voters don t like The calm and predictable politics of the post World War II era likely will become a distant memory as the American system moves toward Trumpism on steroids 1 Edward Bellamy Looking

December 2017 8 Melanie Arntz Terry Gregory and Ulrich Zierahn The Risk of Automation for Jobs in OECD Countries Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Working Paper 189 2016 Donald Trump entered office on a promise to bring back jobs and lift up the white working class While 53 percent of Americans earning less than 30 000 a year voted for Hillary Clinton the counties she won made up 64 percent of America s GDP in 2015 Trump won over five times as many counties as Clinton but these counties constituted only 36 percent of America s GDP in 2015 Trump also surpassed Clinton in places where voters are most at risk of losing their jobs due to automation and won support among those who had already lost out as a result of technological changes in the workplace A National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that the more robots introduced in a commuting zone between 1993 and 2007 the more likely the area went to Trump However Trump s economic message and governance so far has focused almost entirely on job loss due to trade and he has said little on how automation challenges his constituency On the other hand Barack Obama warned in his final speech as president that the next wave of economic dislocation won t come from overseas It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes many good middle class jobs obsolete In the fall of 2016 the White House released a report on automation that outlined its likely impacts on lower wage earners and the prospects for deepened wage inequality Research from Oxford University predicts 47 percent of jobs are likely to be automated within a decade or two and a study by the McKinsey Global Institute finds that 46 percent of time spent on existing work activities will become automated However when asked about the threat of losing jobs to automation Secretary Treasury Steve Mnuchin said the issue is not even on our radar screen I m not worried at all Not everyone agrees Larry Summers who originally argued that automation would help the economy by creating new jobs has since stepped back from this position warning This isn t some future possibility This is something that s emerging before us right now MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson concurs This is the biggest challenge for our society for the next decade While much has been written on the policy challenges automation poses little has been written on the political dynamics it is likely to produce Unsurprisingly political leaders tend to shy away from discussing the issue It is difficult to antagonize technological advancement automation is often the result of corporate investment it yields growth and achieves efficiency and average Americans save on products and services as a result And some make the case that automation is not happening fast enough citing dismal productivity gains The competing theses on the likely effects of automation differ in their understanding of how today s technological shifts compare to past radical changes in the economy Nonetheless policy recommendations that confront technological unemployment can insure against the worst case scenario And as similar disruptions originate from trade and technological improvement similar policies can ameliorate the consequences of dislocation produced by trade and tech shocks Pursuing such policies could also present a political opportunity to restore some sober analysis and much needed non partisan problem solving This would require a response somewhat antithetical to our politics one that is forward thinking and anticipates voters concerns While 65 percent of Americans believe that within 50 years robots and computers will likely complete work performed by humans today 80 percent of Americans do not expect their jobs will disappear While poorer and less educated Americans demonstrate greater concern for the prospect American workers overall worry more about displacement by other workers industry trends and mismanagement Given that few voters are preoccupied with disruptive changes to work stability through technological advancements there exists little incentive for politicians to tackle it But doing so provides two important opportunities at a time ripe for political renewal First addressing automation upends a politics that relies heavily on antagonism Unlike trade few voters reject the benefits of technological change and automation offers no foreign scapegoats like cheap labor abroad or multilateral trade to accuse of stealing jobs Subsequently it is difficult to claim political victories and publically take on opponents Second while workers are concerned about more immediate threats tackling automation would require modernizing the social safety net to not only improve the working lives of Americans today but also to respond to the changing nature of work itself As Brookings Mark Muro writes programs should be anticipatory and offer support when disruption is forecast but not yet hitting home This might require openness to challenging some of the premises that have long guided partisan economic platforms Because automation is predicted to yield greater economic growth while at the same time displacing many workers traditional conservatives will have to embrace some degree of government intervention An inability to adapt conservative economic governance to confront the features of radical shifts in the labor market could prove electorally costly Americans likely to be the most affected by automation live in Republican districts but in areas that have experienced the greatest shocks from automation the 2016 presidential vote was closer This presents an opportunity for Democrats to contend for the support of these voters If Democrats fail to address these voters needs the party might miss an opportunity to reassert a strong economic message and reconnect with a working class base Joseph Parilla and Mark Muro have suggested the creation of a Universal Basic Adjustment Benefit to tackle the dislocation likely to become an increasingly routine feature of the labor market Inspired by calls for a Universal Basic Income UBI the adjustment would include job search counseling worker training funding relocation grants and wage insurance Given that UBI has attracted support from a group of odd bedfellows that includes American Enterprise Institute s Charles Murray and Andy Stern the former president of the Service Employees International Union a Basic Adjustment Benefit might be able to generate similar cross ideological interest In fact it might even prove more palatable than UBI proposals as the benefit would target moving workers back into the labor market and would combine many welfare programs that could be administered flexibly at the local level The consequences of failing to incorporate automation into our political dialogue are potentially high In the Midwest manufacturing job loss bred feelings of economic frustration that led many to favor a populist candidate who gave them something to blame which exemplifies the frustrations likely to take hold as the threat of technological unemployment mounts Additionally many of the jobs expected to disappear as a result of automation are held by white males without college educations a group Trump won handily Without efforts to ensure workers without a college degree can participate in the economy of the automated era the growing education divide producing the kind of populist backlash here and across the west is likely to deepen Innovative Ideas Independent Policy Millions of jobs in New York State will feel the effects of automation in the coming decades These jobs are not necessarily disappearing but they are transforming as artificial intelligence machine learning and advanced robotics tackle more roles in the workplace Policymakers should act now to help New Yorkers prepare for the changes that are coming to the world of work by Matt A V ChabanTags automation new york state economic opportunity workforce opportunity innovation economy tech middle class jobs projectIt has taken decades for New York State s economy to rebound from the effects of offshoring and globalization From Buffalo and Rochester to Binghamton and Riverhead the state has shed hundreds of thousands of jobs particularly in manufacturing and related industrial sectors and upstate job growth has been comparatively slow Yet in the years ahead New York State will need to contend with an even more powerful and fast moving economic force automation Machine learning robotics and artificial intelligence are poised to bring about massive changes to a much larger swath of the economy in the years ahead sweeping not just through factory floors but office towers hospital wards and main streets Automation has the potential to displace workers in a growing range of occupations as varied as bookkeepers and x ray technicians paralegals and food prep workers The result is that both traditional and emerging industries will be transformed with significant effects on New York s workforce This research provides the first comprehensive look at the automation potential of every occupation statewide and in each of New York s ten regions Our study finds that New York State is less susceptible to automation than the nation as a whole But it also reveals that more than 1 2 million jobs in the state about 12 percent of the state s workforce could be largely automated using technology that exists today These are jobs in which 80 percent or more of their associated tasks could be done by machines To be clear automation is not expected to eliminate all or even most of these jobs Indeed this analysis shows that there are only about 24 740 jobs in the state that are 100 percent automatable As with other major economic transformations such as the Industrial Revolution the dawn of electricity and the Internet age some jobs will disappear many will be created and in the end most will simply change There is immense potential for jobs across New York to be transformed Statewide the equivalent of 41 2 percent of all job tasks could be performed by machines in the coming decade On this score New York is actually better off than the nation where 51 percent of all job tasks could be done by machines according to an analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute on which this report is based This is not to suggest that 41 percent of jobs in the state will be eliminated that is simply the scope of job responsibilities that could change as more of today s work whether taking orders entering data or even driving is done by machines The potential for automation is spread fairly evenly across the state Of all regions the automation potential is highest in Western New York where 44 5 percent of all job tasks could be done using existing technology Other regions with high automation potential include Central New York 44 4 percent the North Country 44 3 percent the Mohawk Valley 43 8 percent and Long Island 43 7 New York City has the lowest potential for automation as detailed by the Center in a January report just 39 percent of jobs in the five boroughs stand a high likelihood of being automated But other regions also have a comparatively lower potential for automation such as the Capital Region 42 percent and the Hudson Valley 42 2 percent 1 This research part of our Middle Class Jobs Project a research initiative funded by Fisher Brothers and Winston C Fisher also finds that the jobs that offer New Yorkers a foothold in the economy and a gateway to the middle class are the ones most threatened by automation Such is the case with the state s roughly 155 000 food preparers and servers including fast food workers the largest group whose tasks are highly susceptible to automation 87 percent of their job tasks could be automated It s also the case for the state s 124 000 accounting and bookkeeping clerks 86 percent automation potential and the 181 000 who drive tractor trailers delivery trucks and buses 78 to 85 percent automation potential Additionally there are 112 000 stock clerks and 34 000 dishwashers whose jobs are all roughly 86 percent automatable Even among the state s 20 000 chief executives computers will be able to perform 25 percent of their work in the coming decades That s a notch more vulnerable than the state s 211 000 janitors since machines are predicted to do only 22 percent of all custodial tasks although smart mops could well become part of the job We also conclude that the strongest effects are on lower and middle income jobs the first rungs of the state s economic ladder where the impact of automation is likely to be significant Among the 100 most automatable occupations in the state with at least 1 000 workers 68 percent make less than 40 000 per year while 31 percent make between 40 000 and 80 000 annually and only one of those positions crane operators makes more In total the equivalent of 186 billion wages could be impacted by automation Precisely because it will be difficult to predict exactly which jobs will be impacted by automation and where policymakers business leaders and educators across New York have all the more reason to start preparing now In many parts of the state the same communities that have struggled with the loss of industrial and manufacturing jobs are likely to confront even greater challenges in the years ahead Meanwhile areas that have benefited from new jobs in industries like restaurants and retail will not be immune to the forces of automation Preparing New York State for the future of work is a job that starts today Automation and the Empire StateThe effects of automation will be felt in every corner of the state although some regions rely more heavily on highly automatable jobs In evaluating the likelihood that a machine could perform each job s component tasks this analysis reveals which occupations are most likely to be augmented and supplanted in the decades to come One key factor in determining automatability is the prevalence of work that is highly routine whether physically or cognitively Where job tasks are more variable relying on interpersonal relationships and quick judgement calls humans continue to have the edge The effects of automation may no longer be confined to the factory floor but production occupations remain the most susceptible to displacement That s a major reason why Western New York where manufacturing still accounts for almost 1 in 10 jobs is the state s most vulnerable region The average job in the nine regions excluding New York City is about 10 percent more likely to be automated than it is in the five boroughs although rates for every region remain below the national average New York City with a large number of workers in high touch healthcare jobs managerial positions customer service and the creative economy is the region of the state least vulnerable to the effects of automation That said more than one third of the state s most highly automatable jobs are in New York City more than 454 000 in total However four regions across the state are home to more than 100 000 highly automatable jobs and all ten regions have at least 20 000 jobs that are highly automatable This includes 182 650 in Long Island 116 330 in the Hudson Valley 105 200 in Western New York 80 470 in the Finger Lakes 72 770 in the Capital Region 57 800 in Central New York 40 990 in the Southern Tier and 22 080 in the North Country The most automatable jobs in each region are relatively consistent statewide as the breakdown below reveals Close to 2 percent of the state s workforce is employed in food preparation and serving jobs including fast food and those jobs are spread across the entire state The same goes for jobs filling orders or driving delivery trucks As a result automation is likely to transform not only those regions with a traditional reliance on manufacturing but other parts of the state that have seen the service sector expand significantly over the past two decades Automation in New York State Region by Region All statewide data is for 2017 regional data 2016 the most recent years available Capital RegionCentral New YorkFinger LakesHudson ValleyLong IslandMohawk ValleyNew York CityNorth CountrySouthern TierWestern New York Additional details about automatable jobs can be found here Statewide Capital Region Central New York Finger Lakes Hudson Valley Long Island Mohawk Valley New York City North Country Southern Tier Western New York While some regions are more dependent on certain fields for employment every region of the state has large numbers of workers in similar occupations In addition to food preparation and serving jobs including fast food which are prevalent statewide and highly automatable there are thousands of New Yorkers in every region employed in personal care which is quite resilient to automation retail which is only somewhat durable and bookkeeping which is rather vulnerable All of these jobs may change significantly as new technology is developed and adopted but most workplaces will still need help with this work and someone will have to perform it The result is that the skills required to access even entry level opportunities may increase even as humans continue to hold most of the jobs that exist today Many of the state s most automatable occupations are also expected to add jobs over the next decade although an increased pace of technology adoption could change this Such trends may appear to counter the headlines of kiosk filled McDonald s restaurants and Shake Shacks and autonomous Tesla built tractor trailers although some of these changes are already underway The tipping point for many jobs may well be more than a decade out however the growth of jobs in highly vulnerable industries only underscores the urgent need to prepare the state s workforce for the changes to come There are some regional variations The persistence of manufacturing jobs which account for 9 percent of all jobs in Western New York and 6 percent in Central New York could help explain why both are relatively more vulnerable than New York City 2 percent the Capital Region 4 percent and the Hudson Valley 3 4 percent Long Island s large share of jobs that are at least 50 percent automatable may have some correlation with a higher number of office administrative positions which are almost one in five jobs in Nassau and Suffolk counties That compares to one in six on average in the state and in New York City The five boroughs also employ a lower number of workers in transportation fields 4 9 percent than is typical in the rest of the state 5 3 percent Indeed all manner of factors not just economic or technical could determine whether a business decides to replace some or all of its workers with machines It is not just a matter of how soon fully autonomous dishwashers can be developed but if it would be worth paying to buy and maintain such a machine when most human dishwashers make minimum wage In other cases the complexity of job tasks is a key determinant while accounting clerks whose job tasks consist largely of routine data entry are highly vulnerable to automation accountants are the second largest highly resilient occupation in the state There are also political factors powerful unions have kept subway and train conductors employed despite automatability rates approaching 95 percent and social ones There are some 151 380 waiters in the state the 11th largest profession and just over three quarters of their work 76 9 percent is automatable Yet many people go out to eat as a special treat and value the human connection that a server provides and restaurants may find that humans are more effective at upselling a second round of drinks than any robot However some venues and businesses like airport terminals and fast food outlets have demonstrated a willingness to make this shift leading to the even higher automatability of fast food workers and the heightened risks for the entry level positions with the lowest barriers to entry Although relatively few of the fastest growing occupations in New York State are highly automatable the vast majority of growing fields will experience major changes The average automation potential of the 50 fastest growing occupations is nearly 39 percent This approaches the statewide average and is a reminder of just how much most jobs will change with two in five job tasks able to be done by machines instead of people in the near future Jobs in Major Occupational Categories That Are at Least Half Automatable All statewide data is for 2017 regional data 2016 the most recent years available As a result New Yorkers will require a new level of tech fluency to be prepared for the jobs of tomorrow many of which will become augmented by computers robots artificial intelligence and machine learning For example retail workers may need to manage Internet connected point of sale and inventory management systems and build advanced customer profiles while personal care workers may need to update client records using their smartphones or set up remote doctor visits via FaceTime Critical thinking adaptability and the ability to learn new tools will be crucial for most workers in the future as it should be now for the policymakers educators and business leaders responsible for preparing for the coming world of work The promise of automation is as great as any perceived peril but only if New Yorkers are ready to tackle these new and evolving occupations Photo Credit Franck V Unsplash 1 All statewide calculations are based on the Center for an Urban Future s analysis of 2017 data from the New York State

All Rights Reserved Search1 2 3 Last The President s Management Agenda intertwines agencies and initiatives governmentwide in a strategy to overhaul federal IT data management and workforce infrastructures But few agencies have the potential to feel that impact like the Office of Personnel Management Tasked with bringing more IT and cybersecurity talent into the government at a time when both are in high demand globally the agency must also navigate the fundamental reshaping of the government s civilian workforce which is increasingly being fueled by the emergence of technologies like artificial intelligence and automation In its Federal Workforce Priorities Report released last week OPM estimates that 45 percent of work activities could be automated today based on technology available in 2016 and five percent of all federal jobs could be done completely by machines That leaves the agency at a crossroads in how it shapes the future of the federal workforce and the services it will provide said Don Kettl a professor at the University of Maryland s School of Public Policy and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution This will not be your mother and father s OPM by the time we are done for sure he said The idea of managing an OPM purely on the basis of trying to create rules to make the existing system work will be a pretty bad fit for the system we know we are going to need To capitalize on a seismic change in the nature of work combined with a shrinking federal workforce the Trump administration and OPM have proposed an initiative to reskill some existing federal workers to into higher value work activities jobs while leveraging automation technology to streamline administrative functions As part of the PMA the Office of Management and Budget and its Office of Federal Procurement Policy will identify three areas suited for automation and develop pilots for them by the first quarter of 2019 By the second quarter of 2019 OMB will develop a plan to reskill federal workers impacted by automation efforts while an OPM pilot will assess the skills those employees will need The results of those pilots could be pivotal for agencies looking to stretch their budget said Mallory Barg Bulman vice president of research and evaluation at the Partnership for Public Service Bulman said a January 2018 report conducted by the Partnership and the IBM Center for The Business of Government found federal entities like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Air Force were already leveraging AI to gain efficiencies in how they collect data and navigate acquisition rules and regulations Federal agencies are looking for ways to do more with less she said The places where we ve seen it be successful are places where agencies have taken routine and tedious tasks and really found ways to automate it But even with the capabilities and resources gained by automation the emphasis placed on employee skills and the ability to recruit and retain those employees becomes greater and that s where OPM s role in reskilling and training becomes even more pronounced The truth is providing opportunities for training can really be a profound retention tool Bulman said When we looked at the Best Places to Work in the Federal Government scores for the Senior Executive Service members particularly those who were new to the SES and on the younger end training was the most powerful predictor of their intent to stay But because the PMA tries to tackle government s most difficult challenges in order to modernize it Kettl said OPM s role will be paramount We try to think broadly about the strategic role of government and the strategic transformation of its workforce to make that happen This is a very big deal he said It s something that s very important very fundamental and something that will require a very fundamental rethinking of the role of OPM in particular along the way New studies shed light on the job security of certain government jobs in an increasingly digital age Automation has already altered several industries and it s only a matter of time before it transforms more of them Given that many governments continue to grapple with tight budgets and suppressed staffing levels it s worth considering whether they might one day rely more on automation and technology to carry out tasks performed by humans Recent studies have shed some light on what this might look like particularly in the public sector Automation has already made some forays into government Kirke Everson a KPMG intelligent automation consultant cited chatbots utilized in call centers as an example He suggested that automation could soon replace personnel who perform repetitive back office tasks such as eligibility checks and other procedures following a defined set of rules Government is ripe for automation Everson says But if it requires a large amount of judgments or human interaction maybe you don t start there In the U K an estimated 861 000 public sector jobs could be automated by 2030 according to an analysis by Deloitte and Oxford University Administrative and operative roles which account for 27 percent of the public workforce were identified as having the highest probability of being automated These types of jobs are already declining and the report projects their numbers in the U K to fall further from 87 000 in 2015 to only 4 000 by 2030 A separate Oxford University study examined U S job occupations deeming about 47 percent of total employment in both government and the private sector to be at risk of computerization Some public sector roles considered most vulnerable included library workers postal service clerks and transportation inspectors all positions with highly repetitive tasks Many of the other occupations researchers identified were especially common in transportation These included bus drivers and subway or streetcar operators as well as highway maintenance workers tablecaption font

numbers of public employees will one day be out of work Historically industrialization and improvements in technology haven t caused higher long term unemployment It s unknown whether this time will be any different though with economists offering different predictions for automation s effects Neil Reichenberg who heads the International Public Management Association for Human Resources views it more as a shift It s not so much cutting staff as it is moving people to more strategic higher level work he says While technology has already reshaped countless occupations across just about every segment of the economy it hasn t yet prompted the complete elimination of many types of jobs Consider teachers who employ greater use of educational software programs in classrooms These and other types of public employee positions haven t vanished but they do require greater tech skills than in years past Although some might associate automation with armies of robots it s computers that are most responsible for redefining work these days A recent Brookings Institution report assessed digitization or the degree of computer skills and related knowledge typically required of various occupations Several public sector jobs that required few digital skills in 2002 now mandate at least mid level proficiency of computers or other devices Parking enforcement workers and compliance officers for example might have relied entirely on paper records not long ago Today the Brookings data suggests digital skills for these occupations have jumped considerably over the past decade Source Brookings analysis of O Net OES and Moody s data In some ways automating various aspects of jobs could prove to be more difficult in the public sector than in the private sector Unions Reichenberg says will likely oppose efforts expected to result in job losses Last year the union membership rate for government workers was more than five times that of the private sector Still if automation offers governments ways to cut costs without sacrificing quality of services they ll likely consider it Resources remain limited Revenues aren t expected to grow much and total state and local government employment is still below levels reached a decade ago In some jurisdictions automated processes or technologies could enable governments to provide services that otherwise wouldn t be available It s inevitable Reichenberg says If you look at the way we do work today technology is going to play a major role This story was originally published on Governing We invite you to discuss

34 143Z BusinessThe British government is keen to recognise the importance of artificial intelligence AI and automation in ensuring the long term future success of UK industry In line with this it has acknowledged that one of its grand challenges is putting the UK at the forefront of the AI and data revolution In fact comments from Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond have suggested that large swathes of government activity will soon be performed by AI and automation to free up time for human civil servants Automating some aspects of government jobs will result in savings and efficiencies However there are concerns that public sector workers will be at risk of losing their jobs to AI and automation in the next decade Think tank Reform estimated early last year that 250 000 of the UK s five million public sector workers risk losing jobs to AI and automation in the next 15 years Speaking to a House of Lords committee in 2017 Hammond said The government is looking at how it can apply artificial intelligence There are very significant areas of government activity which involve relatively low level decision making which will be highly susceptible to AI probably over a relatively short period of time which does present the tantalising possibility of being able to drive some real productivity enhancement in the delivery of government processes The truth is that automation in the public sector is already developing at a rapid pace New initiatives range from implementing AI and automation into day to day bureaucratic tasks such as form filling and applying for patents to using facial recognition technologies to verify the identity of individuals entering the UK But it s time to stop viewing AI and automation as an existential threat to our livelihoods Far from replacing people AI and automation will transform the workplace as menial tasks and some non routine jobs are digitalised through AI and process automation enabling greater efficiency while taking away some of the strain of day to day tasks In its industrial strategy report the UK government rightly realised we are at one of the most important exciting and challenging times in the history of global enterprise Importantly that report highlights that Britain is well placed to benefit from this new Industrial Revolution This digital revolution will be powered by humans increasing reliance on AI and automation Set to impact almost every sector of British industry AI and automation is here to stay Organisations are turning to digital transformation to boost innovation and enhance user experience and AI and automation will play a major role in this change While some jobs may disappear or evolve along the road to automation there is considerable opportunity for innovation and change AI and automation can give government departments both at the national and local level much faster access to sophisticated insights Combining this technology and big data will allow them to make better decisions more quickly for a greater number of citizens This ability to rapidly adapt to and drive new innovations is part of what allowed Britain to prosper and develop so quickly during the first industrial revolution After all as the government goes on to note in the industrial strategy report We are an open enterprising economy built on invention innovation and competition We have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business with high standards respected institutions and the reliable rule of law We have achieved near historic levels of employment We are a crossing point for the world because of our geographic position the English language our strong ties our openness to ideas and our vibrant culture Driving an automated future offers a wide range of benefits Not least is the prospect of boosting productivity across all of Britain s leading industries from high tech post industrial manufacturing through to the creative industries sector The UK s industrial strategy has already identified the four grand challenges in the years ahead as artificial intelligence and big data clean growth the future of mobility and meeting the needs of an ageing society Astute investments in AI and automation can enable huge productivity boosts UK consumers are already beginning to recognise that more organisations are embracing this technology and the advantages it can offer including within the public sector In fact after surveying 2 000 UK consumers on their attitudes towards AI and automation in government last year OpenText found that two thirds of UK citizens 66 per cent believe this technology will be introduced into government services within 20 years with 16 per cent claiming that this could happen in the next two years The same poll revealed less fear and uncertainty about the introduction of AI and automation in government than many headlines suggest The majority of those surveyed were not concerned about the implementation of this technology in government with over a quarter 26 per cent going as far as claiming AI and automated technologies would be able to make better decisions than most elected representatives though they would prefer for final decisions to be made by a human Many respondents recognised the immediate benefits of the technology A fifth 20 per cent felt that updating processes by bringing in AI and automation would lead to less admin and form filling Additionally 24 per cent pinpointed reduced waiting times as a major advantage while 19 per cent thought that there would be fewer errors in government as a result of the effective implementation of AI and automation This research shows increasing acceptance of AI and automation as a method to improve services but Britain still has some way to go to fully embrace its potential The UK ranked lowest 16 per cent across the countries surveyed when asked if AI and automated technology would be working in government in the next five years showing more hesitance around its uptake than countries such as France 24 per cent the Netherlands 28 per cent and the USA 22 per cent AI and automation will transform the workplace and bring a wide range of benefits to all sectors including the public sector With the potential to increase the speed efficiency and effectiveness of a wide range of government services AI and automated technologies cannot be ignored While the technology already exists the key challenge over the next few years will be gaining trust amongst both public sector

questions It is no wonder Argentina put it on the agenda as one of three priorities to be discussed at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires Will its impact be the same across the globe What jobs will be most affected What new skillsets will be required But above all how can governments prepare and what role can Multilateral Development Banks play All four leading regional development banks recently came together in Washington to present some key perspectives regarding the jobs of the future which can be found in the study The Future of Work Regional Perspectives Here are a few worth considering On the one hand Emerging Europe Developing Asia Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean are witnessing how robotics automation and artificial intelligence are lowering costs and increasing productivity providing an opportunity for accelerated growth Countries like Estonia have taken the lead in digital technology youth in Nigeria and Ethiopia are harnessing technology to boost yields in agriculture in Vietnam and Bangladesh Information and Communication Technologies ICT is boosting the service industry and across Latin America and the Caribbean smartphone adoption is expected to reach beyond 70 by 2020 On the other hand as a result of this new wave of technological advances known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution a series of myths emerge that it is important to clarify Myth 1 All regions will be impacted in the same way The truth is that technology will be adopted at varying speeds depending on the region s economic development and demographic trends An aging population in Emerging Europe will face different challenges than Africa where 12 to 15 million young people enter the job market each year Myth 2 Mass unemployment is unavoidable The truth is that the jobless rate will be lower than originally expected Mass unemployment is unlikely to become a reality But the shifts in job opportunities will certainly require flexibility and access to new training tools which may in turn be provided by technology itself Myth 3 Automation will replace all human jobs and tasks The truth is that automation only takes place where it is both technically and economically feasible A human workforce will still be required in most sectors particularly those such as health and education At the same time it would be foolish to ignore the genuine threats of unemployment and increased income inequality that the rapid expansion of new technology will generate Above all as Multilateral Development Banks the question we need to be asking is how can governments ease the transition What can governments do to ensure that the largest number of people possible benefit from this transition Policymakers can take four actions to ease the adoption of technology while mitigating potentially adverse effects on jobs and incomes Multilateral Development Banks certainly have their own role to play not only by acting as think tanks for initiatives on how to capitalize on new technologies and mitigate their negative effects but also in coordinating global or regional policy responses strengthening partnerships between policymakers and employers to jointly identify and address challenges Our products and services will need to adapt A recent IDB health project in the Dominican Republic which uses drones to link remote rural clinics with hospital laboratories is a prime example of this Change will also take place within our workforce Outsourcing the IDB s human resources department from Washington to Costa Rica to ensure efficiency and reduce costs was certainly a step in the right direction It is important that we take the time to seriously identify the opportunities and risks the 21st century global job market presents so that together we can help shape the future of work In the meantime we must also remain relevant for our customer base and at the forefront of innovation Whether we succeed or not is up to all of us Downlaod the study The

employment data from the last few decades to help understand what has changed and what future trends might be likely Watch our 3 minute video about employment trends to find out more Our Deputy Chair Karen Chester gave a speech to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia CEDA WA on 17 July 2018 in Perth Jobs matter For almost all of us they are a source of income But they are also a source of self esteem of social interaction a feeling of purpose and even of community And the skills embedded in jobs remain principal drivers of increasing productivity and ultimately wages So when one opines on the future of work people tend to listen But perhaps when one is opining on the future of work today expectations of the listener are more akin to the BBC announcer of Monty Python s Flying Circus and now for something completely different When perhaps it s simply not so different And I guess that may well prove the damp squib hashtag for my talk today We know from history that soothsayers abound when it comes to opining on the future of work Indeed history is littered with the foretelling of a dystopia of jobless woe or a utopia of little need to work at all And the only universal truth seems to be that they were all wrong both happily and unhappily so The 20th century father of the fiscal stimulus John Maynard Keynes foretold in 1930 that In the 21st century a 15 hour work week will suffice as we turn instead to how to use freedom from pressing economic cares And yet despite significant productivity gains since the Keynes 1930 treatise we still all work on average around 40 hours a week In the late 1970s the historian Ian Turner presided over a major symposium on what new technologies would mean for the worker He predicted an imminent period of change as significant as the Neolithic or Industrial Revolutions To quote By 1988 at least a quarter of the Australian workforce would be made redundant by technological change And a similar adage we heard in 1982 from Barry Jones in his book Sleepers Awake technology and the future of work We all know that the late 1980s did see an exponential uptick in the common use of computers in workplaces and even more so in the 90s as the price of the humble computer plummeted But the foretelling of widespread redundancies of the Australian workforce were not seen For throughout the past 100 years it s been more a case of technology remaining the loyal friend not foe of the worker continuing to remove jobs that are often unpleasant physically tiring downright dangerous or just tedious think toll booth operator More recently we ve seen a plethora of papers and reports produced by think tanks academics consultants and platform giants touting analyses of jobs that could be lost as a result of the latest wave of technological change And that latest wave being the digital age and both the resultant automation and artificial intelligence Some of these reports seem to have settled on a nice big round figure of about 40 per cent of today s jobs now being at risk of automation over the next 10 to 20 years Now most of these reports stem from a seminal 2013 paper by Frey and Osborne where US data was used to predict job losses in the future But their approach left out a few things It did not take into account that new technologies can create new jobs Nor did it contemplate that not all tasks within an occupation can be automated or should be automated And we know that the rate of technological adoption will also depend a lot on consumer preferences do you want a robot cutting your hair and the actual cost or put crudely the business case of adoption Others in taking these factors into account suggest 9 of Australian workers are exposed to the risk of automation So a much smaller but not insignificant number And here I ll mention the must read paper by Melbourne University economists Jeff Borland and Michael Coelli Are the Robots Taking Our Jobs Their work lines up with the more considered studies in the US and Europe So let s look at the evidence a common sense thing to do when in the midst of a chorus of now for something completely different To test whether we have strayed into a world of lies lies and damned statistics And in looking at the evidence I ve drawn on some of the Commission s recent endeavour such as our Digital Disruption report 2016 and Shifting the Dial 2017 as well as the work of Jeff Borland and Michael Coelli and that of Bart van Ark of The Conference Board Overall the evidence suggests that labour markets have been pretty well resilient to shocks posed by new technologies of the past century and even the most recent modern bit Occupations skills and jobs come and they go No matter how transformative the technology be it the telephone electricity indoor plumbing refrigeration air transport the personal computer and today s digital No technology has removed people s capacity to work And in productivity terms all have been more transformative than the digital revolution so far with emphasis being on the so far And a bunch of measures suggest that technology is not having as large of an effect as expected at least not in our current modern times The rise of the New Digital Economy which encompasses mobile technology ubiquitous access to the internet and the world of the cloud is unquestionably changing lots of things But to date productivity is not one So much so that this has become known as the Productivity Paradox So whilst our low rate of multi factor productivity growth observed recently is not unique to Australia it has been observed across other countries too it represents something of a puzzle This is because it suggests that at least in aggregate our economies have not become any more efficient in producing things And we know the policy reasons why productivity may have slowed in Australia but this is notwithstanding our purported better ability to exploit information technologies One explanation for this is that there has been a change in the nature of technological progress That recent technologies characterised by some as dramatic have been minor compared to those in the previous century The other explanation one offered by Bart van Ark and perhaps one of intuitive appeal is that whilst we still see rapidly declining ICT prices along with a shift from ICT investment to ICT services perhaps the new digital economy is still in its installation phase And we shouldn t expect to see the productivity dividend until it truly enters the deployment phase This makes sense when you see that in the US the contribution of the most ICT intensive industries to productivity growth has dropped markedly from 46 to 26 in the past decade 2007 16 And for the US and the UK it has even at times registered negative productivity growth in these sectors Which could suggest that the dividend only makes its way into the deployment and hopefully productivity dividend phase once users fully grapple with how to absorb technology effectively So returning to the evidence on the impact on jobs And we do know that there has been automation of many tasks in the workplace But arguably if technology was both disruptive and displacing replacing existing jobs without creating new ones we would expect to see a persistent upward trend in the unemployment rate And we don t Whilst routine manual and routine cognitive jobs have fallen as a proportion of jobs from 50 to 37 non routine manual and non routine cognitive jobs have increased from 42 to 53 Think child care aged care nursing office managers designers and engineers using software Most importantly the aggregate amount of work available to the Australian population on a per capita basis has not seen a decline since the 1980s when computers became common in the workplace The amount of work available has actually increased by about 14 since the early 1980s But that s not to say there hasn t been a lot of change in our workforce and the nature of work since the 1980s Since the 1980s the workforce participation rate for females has increased a lot by some 15 percentage points to now be just over 60 Marriage and even children are placing much less of a brake on economic participation of women Which is both a good thing for the economy and for women There has also been an increase in the incidence of part time jobs by some 25 percentage points since the late 1960s to now account for nearly one third of total employment around 35 in Australia And despite what some have suggested the pace at which workers are changing between jobs in the Australian labour market is not getting quicker Not only is there no evidence that more workers are being forced to work in short duration jobs but what is apparent is that the opposite has happened The proportion of workers in very long duration jobs more than 10 years has increased from just under 20 per cent in 1982 to around 27 per cent in 2016 Which is perhaps unsurprising when you also take into account the participation rate of older Australians 65 in age has risen steeply having nearly doubled in the past 30 years to now represent 12 of our workforce Also a good thing with our ageing population We do know that more workers today have multiple jobs now around 7 of workers And perhaps of much greater significance when workers do change jobs today more are changing occupations some 40 and industries over 50 And it was this modern day workforce reality that informed much of our thinking around the Commission s proposed changes to superannuation default arrangements in our current superannuation Inquiry And our thinking on what is needed from our tertiary education system which I ll return to later And whilst the gig economy is still in its infancy this has not translated yet to any increase in the proportion of the workforce being independent contractors Indeed this has not changed significantly since 2001 it s actually fallen a few percentage points from 20 per cent of employed persons in 2001 to around 18 per cent in 2014 So what does any of this mean or matter for public policy And perhaps here our focus should be two fold First on making sure there are no road blocks to our economy reaching the deployment phase of the digital or any technological age And second making sure we avoid a workforce of have and have nots in the benefits from the changes in the economy and ultimately jobs A sense of equality in the ultimate job productivity and wage dividend So let me pose a few policy questions Are we getting better at assisting transitioning workers We know that structural change whatever its source can result in considerable work and thus life disruption for the workers impacted unless we get the consequential skill adjustment right So have we gotten better in assisting displaced workers get the right skills to transition into new occupations and industries Recent work by the Commission on transitioning regional economies found that effectiveness of government in doing this is at best unclear Some programs found to be not well targeted automotive industry or create conflicting incentives Tasmanian forestry industry And why unclear use of data to simply track the impacted workers and decent evaluation of transitional assistance are largely missing in action Put simply we can and should be doing better Further it s a tad perverse that if the digital economy ultimately disrupts more jobs we do not use the data fuelling that economic activity to assist those disrupted We know of such endeavour in Germany using data to track the worker and the resultant human capital modelling which in turn better informs what requalification programs will deliver a better job transition to a displaced worker Are the right incentives in place to get the workers to the new jobs We know that jobs at least risk of automation jobs that require soft skills such as good old fashioned empathy account for the largest and growing part of our workforce And the latest metrics from the ABS brand new quarterly labour account experimental estimates reveal health care and social assistance as the largest employment sectors accounting for over 1 6 million jobs or 12 2 of all filled jobs This is largely a function of our demographic changes an ageing population women working more along with the NDIS arguably our single biggest social reform since Medicare The Commission s recent review of NDIS costs found that the NDIS workforce was not growing fast enough most regions require between a 50 per cent and 150 per cent increase in the disability services workforce Put simply for the foreseeable future 1 in 5 new jobs in Australia are projected to be for services for the NDIS Thus care is needed to ensure that the demand for these skills and workers is not frustrated by poor incentives The most notable as highlighted in our NDIS review being the need to ensure the pricing of these services allows this massive labour force response to occur Lest we have a program delivering disappointment and not services to the 475 000 Australians with eligible disabilities Is our education and training system fit for purpose for the workers of today and tomorrow Perhaps this is our biggest public policy must have when thinking of ensuring innovation and technology delivers not just more jobs but jobs for most That sense of equality in who shares in the ultimate job productivity and wage dividend And this was a question the Commission sought to ask and answer last year in our inaugural 5 yearly productivity review Shifting the Dial A policy roadmap for Australian Governments on what is needed to deliver on economic participation and productivity two of the three Ps population participation and productivity that matter most for economic growth and ultimately jobs and their real wages And we identified some fundamental fractures in our current education and training system First deteriorating results in subjects that matter for future work think science maths and reading the cognitive trifecta at school Second the VET system is a mess struggling to deliver relevant competency based qualifications Employers today are more satisfied with non accredited training courses 90 than VET 76 Third universities need to improve student employment outcomes delivering qualifications relevant to labour market needs and at a time relevant to the worker s needs Our key educational institutions seem more focused on research than student employment outcomes which is unsurprising given the notable absence of their skin in the game As manifest in 26 of students today not completing their undergraduate studies in less than 9 years Whilst undergraduate underemployment has more than doubled in the last decade to now reach just over 20 Currently the tertiary education system is set up against becoming a chef at age 40 or a dementia care worker at age 50 Retraining is currently inconvenient and expensive and the approach of educational institutions remains outdated and outmoded still emphasising a one career for life approach Which is not the modern day reality for many workers from the metrics cited earlier Taken collectively this unfortunate troika can only put at risk our capacity to deal with future labour market changes in an efficient and equitable way So we ve proposed a few things change for schools evidence and evaluation of what works with teaching for universities incentives be redressed around student employment outcomes and for work skills government to develop two things First tools for proficiency based assessment for skills rather than simply competency based assessment whether they can perform it at all And second a framework to facilitate independent accreditation of skills obtained agnostic of learning method Do current policy settings constrain us getting to and through the installation phase and on to realising benefits in the deployment phase of the digital economy Today s market power arguably resides in data and content The growth of the digital economy automation and artificial intelligence coupled with greater availability of data and algorithm advances will be key drivers of new business activity research endeavour products skills and jobs In short access and use of data and content will be the determining force in realising the economic benefits of the digital economy and artificial intelligence On data the Commission s report last year on Data Use and Availability proposed fundamental and novel changes to data availability and access policy to ensure it generates new economic opportunities and business opportunities driven by consumer needs and preferences A pro consumer and thus pro competition stimulus with the consumer in the drivers seat for their data held with business and government today And the good news is the Government s response to this inquiry has been one of can and will do The Government has committed to support the two most structurally significant recommendations First the passage of national legislation to remove barriers to data sharing and integration across major public interest data sets and create trusted user access And second the complementary legislated concept of a new general Right for Consumers to exercise joint control in the sharing and use of their data So it s now all down to getting the implementation right On content the Commission s Inquiry in 2016 on Intellectual Property Arrangements examined whether those arrangements meet the needs of the Australian economy And the short answer was no for copyright Currently Australia s copyright exceptions are too narrow and prescriptive do not reflect the way people today consume and use content and do not readily accommodate new legitimate uses of copyright material We found ourselves mired in the wrong debate of publishers clamouring for well protected profit for the purported benefit of local authors For access to content be it snippets of images maps pixels words song sounds is needed alongside data to actually do artificial intelligence But our arrangements unlike those in countries like the US South Korea and Israel pose a seemingly impenetrable barrier to AI being alive and well in our economy For in the absence of meaningful reform to copyright Australia will inevitably and demonstrably be a net importer of AI services and products And fair access to content also matters for education Now more than ever workers need flexible access to ongoing learning MOOCs are a key component of providing low cost and flexible access to ongoing learning And in consulting with the states on Shifting the Dial we were implored to think of the transitioning worker in NW Tasmania in our approach to ongoing skills acquisition especially for mature age workers Yet Australia s current system of copyright usage heavily constrain Universities TAFEs and schools from offering MOOCs So on a final note I ve failed dismally to foretell a future of dystopia or utopia and happily so but that doesn t mean that the deployment phase of the digital economy may yet still surprise us And in reflecting on the Inquiries that formed much of the Commission s endeavour over the last five years or so nearly all have dealt in some way shape or form with the now of work and thus the future of work And in doing so tried to view it through the lens of the needs of workers and students And through that lens it affords a sense of what policies new or tweaked will see our economy able to access the installation phase and realise the benefits of the deployment phase of any technological change And perhaps most importantly ensuring those phases see the benefits of jobs productivity and higher wages shared across the workforce Avoiding a world of technology driven haves and have nots Because that s what matters most for the

accelerate growth by unlocking their people s potential The technology driven world in which we live is a world filled with promise but also challenges Cars that drive themselves machines that read X rays and algorithms that respond to customer service inquiries are all manifestations of powerful new forms of automation Yet even as these technologies increase productivity and improve our lives their use will substitute for some work activities humans currently perform a development that has sparked much public concern Building on our January 2017 report on automation McKinsey Global Institute s latest report Jobs lost jobs gained Workforce transitions in a time of automation PDF 5MB assesses the number and types of jobs that might be created under different scenarios through 2030 and compares that to the jobs that could be lost to automation The results reveal a rich mosaic of potential shifts in occupations in the years ahead with important implications for workforce skills and wages Our key finding is that while there may be enough work to maintain full employment to 2030 under most scenarios the transitions will be very challenging matching or even exceeding the scale of shifts out of agriculture and manufacturing we have seen in the past We previously found that about half the activities people are paid to do globally could theoretically be automated using currently demonstrated technologies Very few occupations less than 5 percent consist of activities that can be fully automated However in about 60 percent of occupations at least one third of the constituent activities could be automated implying substantial workplace transformations and changes for all workers While technical feasibility of automation is important it is not the only factor that will influence the pace and extent of automation adoption Other factors include the cost of developing and deploying automation solutions for specific uses in the workplace the labor market dynamics including quality and quantity of labor and associated wages the benefits of automation beyond labor substitution and regulatory and social acceptance Taking these factors into account our new research estimates that between almost zero and 30 percent of the hours worked globally could be automated by 2030 depending on the speed of adoption We mainly use the midpoint of our scenario range which is automation of 15 percent of current activities Results differ significantly by country reflecting the mix of activities currently performed by workers and prevailing wage rates The potential impact of automation on employment varies by occupation and sector see interactive above Activities most susceptible to automation include physical ones in predictable environments such as operating machinery and preparing fast food Collecting and processing data are two other categories of activities that increasingly can be done better and faster with machines This could displace large amounts of labor for instance in mortgage origination paralegal work accounting and back office transaction processing It is important to note however that even when some tasks are automated employment in those occupations may not decline but rather workers may perform new tasks Automation will have a lesser effect on jobs that involve managing people applying expertise and social interactions where machines are unable to match human performance for now Jobs in unpredictable environments occupations such as gardeners plumbers or providers of child and eldercare will also generally see less automation by 2030 because they are technically difficult to automate and often command relatively lower wages which makes automation a less attractive business proposition Workers displaced by automation are easily identified while new jobs that are created indirectly from technology are less visible and spread across different sectors and geographies We model some potential sources of new labor demand that may spur job creation to 2030 even net of automation For the first three trends we model only a trendline scenario based on current spending and investment trends observed across countries We have previously estimated that global consumption could grow by 23 trillion between 2015 and 2030 and most of this will come from the consuming classes in emerging economies The effects of these new consumers will be felt not just in the countries where the income is generated but also in economies that export to these countries Globally we estimate that 250 million to 280 million new jobs could be created from the impact of rising incomes on consumer goods alone with up to an additional 50 million to 85 million jobs generated from higher health and education spending By 2030 there will be at least 300 million more people aged 65 years and older than there were in 2014 As people age their spending patterns shift with a pronounced increase in spending on healthcare and other personal services This will create significant new demand for a range of occupations including doctors nurses and health technicians but also home health aides personal care aides and nursing assistants in many countries Globally we estimate that healthcare and related jobs from aging could grow by 50 million to 85 million by 2030 Jobs related to developing and deploying new technologies may also grow Overall spending on technology could increase by more than 50 percent between 2015 and 2030 About half would be on information technology services The number of people employed in these occupations is small compared to those in healthcare or construction but they are high wage occupations By 2030 we estimate that this trend could create 20 million to 50 million jobs globally For the next three trends we model both a trendline scenario and a step up scenario that assumes additional investments in some areas based on explicit choices by governments business leaders and individuals to create additional jobs Infrastructure and buildings are two areas of historic underspending that may create significant additional labor demand if action is taken to bridge infrastructure gaps and overcome housing shortages New demand could be created for up to 80 million jobs in the trendline scenario and in the event of accelerated investment up to 200 million more in the step up scenario These jobs include architects engineers electricians carpenters and other skilled tradespeople as well as construction workers Investments in renewable energy such as wind and solar energy efficiency technologies and adaptation and mitigation of climate change may create new demand for workers in a range of occupations including manufacturing construction and installation These investments could create up to ten million new jobs in the trendline scenario and up to ten million additional jobs globally in the step up scenario The last trend we consider is the potential to pay for services that substitute for currently unpaid and primarily domestic work This so called marketization of previously unpaid work is already prevalent in advanced economies and rising female workforce participation worldwide could accelerate the trend We estimate that this could create 50 million to 90 million jobs globally mainly in occupations such as childcare early childhood education cleaning cooking and gardening When we look at the net changes in job growth across all countries the categories with the highest percentage job growth net of automation include the following The changes in net occupational growth or decline imply that a very large number of people may need to shift occupational categories and learn new skills in the years ahead The shift could be on a scale not seen since the transition of the labor force out of agriculture in the early 1900s in the United States and Europe and more recently in in China Seventy five million to 375 million may need to switch occupational categories and learn new skills We estimate that between 400 million and 800 million individuals could be displaced by automation and need to find new jobs by 2030 around the world based on our midpoint and earliest that is the most rapid automation adoption scenarios New jobs will be available based on our scenarios of future labor demand and the net impact of automation as described in the next section However people will need to find their way into these jobs Of the total displaced 75 million to 375 million may need to switch occupational categories and learn new skills under our midpoint and earliest automation adoption scenarios under our trendline adoption scenario however this number would be very small less than 10 million Exhibit 1 In absolute terms China faces the largest number of workers needing to switch occupations up to 100 million if automation is adopted rapidly or 12 percent of the 2030 workforce While that may seem like a large number it is relatively small compared with the tens of millions of Chinese who have moved out of agriculture in the past 25 years For advanced economies the share of the workforce that may need to learn new skills and find work in new occupations is much higher up to one third of the 2030 workforce in the United States and Germany and nearly half in Japan Today there is a growing concern about whether there will be enough jobs for workers given potential automation History would suggest that such fears may be unfounded over time labor markets adjust to changes in demand for workers from technological disruptions although at times with depressed real wages Exhibit 2 We address this question about the future of work through two different sets of analyses one based on modeling of a limited number of catalysts of new labor demand and automation described earlier and one using a macroeconomic model of the economy that incorporates the dynamic interactions among variables If history is any guide we could also expect that 8 to 9 percent of 2030 labor demand will be in new types of occupations that have not existed before Both analyses lead us to conclude that with sufficient economic growth innovation and investment there can be enough new job creation to offset the impact of automation although in some advanced economies additional investments will be needed as per our step up scenario to reduce the risk of job shortages A larger challenge will be ensuring that workers have the skills and support needed to transition to new jobs Countries that fail to manage this transition could see rising unemployment and depressed wages The magnitude of future job creation from the trends described previously and the impact of automation on the workforce vary significantly by country depending on four factors Higher wages make the business case for automation adoption stronger However low wage countries may be affected as well if companies adopt automation to boost quality achieve tighter production control move production closer to end consumers in high wage countries or other benefits beyond reducing labor costs Economic growth is essential for job creation economies that are stagnant or growing slowly create few if any net new jobs Countries with stronger economic and productivity growth and innovation will therefore be expected to experience more new labor demand Countries with a rapidly growing workforce such as India may enjoy a demographic dividend that boosts GDP growth if young people are employed Countries with a shrinking workforce such as Japan can expect lower future GDP growth derived only from productivity growth The automation potential for countries reflects the mix of economic sectors and the mix of jobs within each sector Japan for example has a higher automation potential than the United States because the weight of sectors that are highly automatable such as manufacturing is higher The four factors just described combine to create different outlooks for the future of work in each country see interactive heat map Japan is rich but its economy is projected to grow slowly to 2030 It faces the combination of slower job creation coming from economic expansion and a large share of work that can be automated as a result of high wages and the structure of its economy However Japan will also see its workforce shrink by 2030 by four million people In the step up scenario and considering the jobs in new occupations we cannot envision today Japan s net change in jobs could be roughly in balance The United States and Germany could also face significant workforce displacement from automation by 2030 but their projected future growth and hence new job creation is higher The United States has a growing workforce and in the step up scenario with innovations leading to new types of occupations and work it is roughly in balance Germany s workforce will decline by three million people by 2030 and it will have more than enough labor demand to employ all its workers even in the trendline scenario At the other extreme is India a fast growing developing country with relatively modest potential for automation over the next 15 years reflecting low wage rates Our analysis finds that most occupational categories are projected to grow in India reflecting its potential for strong economic expansion However India s labor force is expected to grow by 138 million people by 2030 or about 30 percent India could create enough new jobs to offset automation and employ these new entrants by undertaking the investments in our step up scenario China and Mexico have higher wages than India and so are likely to see more automation China is still projected to have robust economic growth and will have a shrinking workforce like Germany China s problem could be a shortage of workers Mexico s projected rate of future economic expansion is more modest and it could benefit from the job creation in the step up scenario plus innovation in new occupations and activities to make full use of its workforce To model the impact of automation on overall employment and wages we use a general equilibrium model that takes into account the economic impacts of automation and dynamic interactions Automation has at least three distinct economic impacts Most attention has been devoted to the potential displacement of labor But automation also may raise labor productivity firms adopt automation only when doing so enables them to produce more or higher quality output with the same or fewer inputs including material energy and labor inputs The third impact is that automation adoption raises investment in the economy lifting short term GDP growth We model all three effects We also create different scenarios for how quickly displaced workers find new employment based on historical data The results reveal that in nearly all scenarios the six countries that are the focus of our report China Germany India Japan Mexico and the United States could expect to be at or very near full employment by 2030 However the model also illustrates the importance of reemploying displaced workers quickly If displaced workers are able to be reemployed within one year our model shows automation lifting the overall economy full employment is maintained in both the short and long term wages grow faster than in the baseline model and productivity is higher However in scenarios in which some displaced workers take years to find new work unemployment rises in the short to medium term The labor market adjusts over time and unemployment falls but with slower average wage growth In these scenarios average wages end up lower in 2030 than in the baseline model which could dampen aggregate demand and long term growth In general the current educational requirements of the occupations that may grow are higher than those for the jobs displaced by automation In advanced economies occupations that currently require only a secondary education or less see a net decline from automation while those occupations requiring college degrees and higher grow In India and other emerging economies we find higher labor demand for all education levels with the largest number of new jobs in occupations requiring a secondary education but the fastest rate of job growth will be for occupations currently requiring a college or advanced degree Workers of the future will spend more time on activities that machines are less capable of such as managing people applying expertise and communicating with others They will spend less time on predictable physical activities and on collecting and processing data where machines already exceed human performance The skills and capabilities required will also shift requiring more social and emotional skills and more advanced cognitive capabilities such as logical reasoning and creativity Wages may stagnate or fall in declining occupations Although we do not model shifts in relative wages across occupations the basic economics of labor supply and demand suggests that this should be the case for occupations in which labor demand declines Our analysis shows that most job growth in the United States and other advanced economies will be in occupations currently at the high end of the wage distribution Some occupations that are currently low wage such as nursing assistants and teaching assistants will also increase while a wide range of middle income occupations will have the largest employment declines Income polarization could continue Policy choices such as increasing investments in infrastructure buildings and energy transitions could help create additional demand for middle wage jobs such as construction workers in advanced economies The wage trend picture is quite different in emerging economies such as China and India where our scenarios show that middle wage jobs such as retail salespeople and teachers will grow the most as these economies develop This implies that their consuming class will continue to grow in the decades ahead The benefits of artificial intelligence and automation to users and businesses and the economic growth that could come via their productivity contributions are compelling They will not only contribute to dynamic economies that create jobs but also help create the economic surpluses that will enable societies to address the workforce transitions that will likely happen regardless Faced with the scale of worker transitions we have described one reaction could be to try to slow the pace and scope of adoption in an attempt to preserve the status quo But this would be a mistake Although slower adoption might limit the scale of workforce transitions it would curtail the contributions that these technologies make to business dynamism and economic growth We should embrace these technologies but also address the workforce transitions and challenges they bring In many countries this may require an initiative on the scale of the Marshall Plan involving sustained investment new training models programs to ease worker transitions income support and collaboration between the public and private sectors All societies will need to address four key areas Sustaining robust aggregate demand growth is critical to support new job creation as is support for new business formation and innovation Fiscal and monetary policies that ensure sufficient aggregate demand as well as support for business investment and innovation will be essential Targeted initiatives in certain sectors could also help including for example increasing investments in infrastructure and energy transitions Providing job retraining and enabling individuals to learn marketable new skills throughout their lifetime will be a critical challenge and for some countries the central challenge Midcareer retraining will become ever more important as the skill mix needed for a successful career changes Business can take a lead in some areas including with on the job training and providing opportunities to workers to upgrade their skills Greater fluidity will be needed in the labor market to manage the difficult transitions we anticipate This includes restoring now waning labor mobility in advanced economies Digital talent platforms can foster fluidity by matching workers and companies seeking their skills and by providing a plethora of new work opportunities for those open to taking them Policy makers in countries with inflexible labor markets can learn from others that have deregulated such as Germany which transformed its federal unemployment agency into a powerful job matching entity Income support and other forms of transition assistance to help displaced workers find gainful employment will be essential Beyond retraining a range of policies can help including unemployment insurance public assistance in finding work and portable benefits that follow workers between jobs We know from history that wages for many occupations can be depressed for some time during workforce transitions More permanent policies to supplement work incomes might be needed to support aggregate demand and ensure societal fairness More comprehensive minimum wage policies universal basic income or wage gains tied to productivity growth are all possible solutions being explored Policy makers business leaders and individual workers all have constructive and important roles to play in smoothing workforce transitions ahead History shows us that societies across the globe when faced with monumental challenges often rise to the occasion for the well being of their citizens Yet over the past few decades investments and policies to support the workforce have eroded Public spending on labor force training and support has fallen in most member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD Educational models have not fundamentally changed in 100 years It is now critical to reverse these trends with governments making workforce transitions and job creation a more urgent priority We will all need creative visions for how our lives are organized and valued in the future in a world where the role and meaning of work start to shift Businesses will be on the front lines of the workplace as it changes This will require them to both retool their business processes and reevaluate their talent strategies and workforce needs carefully considering which individuals are needed which can be redeployed to other jobs and where new talent may be required Many companies are finding it is in their self interest as well as part of their societal responsibility to train and prepare workers for a new world of work Individuals too will need to be prepared for a rapidly evolving future of work Acquiring new skills that are in demand and resetting intuition about the world of work will be critical for their own well being There will be demand for human labor but workers everywhere will need to rethink traditional notions of where they work how they work and what talents and capabilities they bring to that

by unlocking their people s potential Automation and artificial intelligence AI are transforming businesses and will contribute to economic growth via contributions to productivity They will also help address moonshot societal challenges in areas from health to climate change At the same time these technologies will transform the nature of work and the workplace itself Machines will be able to carry out more of the tasks done by humans complement the work that humans do and even perform some tasks that go beyond what humans can do As a result some occupations will decline others will grow and many more will change While we believe there will be enough work to go around barring extreme scenarios society will need to grapple with significant workforce transitions and dislocation Workers will need to acquire new skills and adapt to the increasingly capable machines alongside them in the workplace They may have to move from declining occupations to growing and in some cases new occupations This executive briefing which draws on the latest research from the McKinsey Global Institute examines both the promise and the challenge of automation and AI in the workplace and outlines some of the critical issues that policy makers companies and individuals will need to solve for Automation and AI are not new but recent technological progress is pushing the frontier of what machines can do Our research suggests that society needs these improvements to provide value for businesses contribute to economic growth and make once unimaginable progress on some of our most difficult societal challenges In summary Beyond traditional industrial automation and advanced robots new generations of more capable autonomous systems are appearing in environments ranging from autonomous vehicles on roads to automated check outs in grocery stores Much of this progress has been driven by improvements in systems and components including mechanics sensors and software AI has made especially large strides in recent years as machine learning algorithms have become more sophisticated and made use of huge increases in computing power and of the exponential growth in data available to train them Spectacular breakthroughs are making headlines many involving beyond human capabilities in computer vision natural language processing and complex games such as Go These technologies are already generating value in various products and services and companies across sectors use them in an array of processes to personalize product recommendations find anomalies in production identify fraudulent transactions and more The latest generation of AI advances including techniques that address classification estimation and clustering problems promises significantly more value still An analysis we conducted of several hundred AI use cases found that the most advanced deep learning techniques deploying artificial neural networks could account for as much as 3 5 trillion to 5 8 trillion in annual value or 40 percent of the value created by all analytics techniques Exhibit 1 Deployment of AI and automation technologies can do much to lift the global economy and increase global prosperity at a time when aging and falling birth rates are acting as a drag on growth Labor productivity growth a key driver of economic growth has slowed in many economies dropping to an average of 0 5 percent in 2010 2014 from 2 4 percent a decade earlier in the United States and major European economies in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis after a previous productivity boom had waned AI and automation have the potential to reverse that decline productivity growth could potentially reach 2 percent annually over the next decade with 60 percent of this increase from digital opportunities AI is also being used in areas ranging from material science to medical research and climate science Application of the technologies in these and other disciplines could help tackle societal moonshot challenges For example researchers at Geisinger have developed an algorithm that could reduce diagnostic times for intracranial hemorrhaging by up to 96 percent Researchers at George Washington University meanwhile are using machine learning to more accurately weight the climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AI and automation still face challenges The limitations are partly technical such as the need for massive training data and difficulties generalizing algorithms across use cases Recent innovations are just starting to address these issues Other challenges are in the use of AI techniques For example explaining decisions made by machine learning algorithms is technically challenging which particularly matters for use cases involving financial lending or legal applications Potential bias in the training data and algorithms as well as data privacy malicious use and security are all issues that must be addressed Europe is leading with the new General Data Protection Regulation which codifies more rights for users over data collection and usage A different sort of challenge concerns the ability of organizations to adopt these technologies where people data availability technology and process readiness often make it difficult Adoption is already uneven across sectors and countries The finance automotive and telecommunications sectors lead AI adoption Among countries US investment in AI ranked first at 15 billion to 23 billion in 2016 followed by Asia s investments of 8 billion to 12 billion with Europe lagging behind at 3 billion to 4 billion Even as AI and automation bring benefits to business and society we will need to prepare for major disruptions to work Our analysis of more than 2000 work activities across more than 800 occupations shows that certain categories of activities are more easily automatable than others They include physical activities in highly predictable and structured environments as well as data collection and data processing These account for roughly half of the activities that people do across all sectors The least susceptible categories include managing others providing expertise and interfacing with stakeholders Nearly all occupations will be affected by automation but only about 5 percent of occupations could be fully automated by currently demonstrated technologies Many more occupations have portions of their constituent activities that are automatable we find that about 30 percent of the activities in 60 percent of all occupations could be automated This means that most workers from welders to mortgage brokers to CEOs will work alongside rapidly evolving machines The nature of these occupations will likely change as a result Automation will displace some workers We have found that around 15 percent of the global workforce or about 400 million workers could be displaced by automation in the period 2016 2030 This reflects our midpoint scenario in projecting the pace and scope of adoption Under the fastest scenario we have modeled that figure rises to 30 percent or 800 million workers In our slowest adoption scenario only about 10 million people would be displaced close to zero percent of the global workforce Exhibit 2 The wide range underscores the multiple factors that will impact the pace and scope of AI and automation adoption Technical feasibility of automation is only the first influencing factor Other factors include the cost of deployment labor market dynamics including labor supply quantity quality and the associated wages the benefits beyond labor substitution that contribute to business cases for adoption and finally social norms and acceptance Adoption will continue to vary significantly across countries and sectors because of differences in the above factors especially labor market dynamics in advanced economies with relatively high wage levels such as France Japan and the United States automation could displace 20 to 25 percent of the workforce by 2030 in a midpoint adoption scenario more than double the rate in India Even as workers are displaced there will be growth in demand for work and consequently jobs We developed scenarios for labor demand to 2030 from several catalysts of demand for work including rising incomes increased spending on healthcare and continuing or stepped up investment in infrastructure energy and technology development and deployment These scenarios showed a range of additional labor demand of between 21 percent to 33 percent of the global workforce 555 million and 890 million jobs to 2030 more than offsetting the numbers of jobs lost Some of the largest gains will be in emerging economies such as India where the working age population is already growing rapidly Additional economic growth including from business dynamism and rising productivity growth will also continue to create jobs Many other new occupations that we cannot currently imagine will also emerge and may account for as much as 10 percent of jobs created by 2030 if history is a guide Moreover technology itself has historically been a net job creator For example the introduction of the personal computer in the 1970s and 1980s created millions of jobs not just for semiconductor makers but also for software and app developers of all types customer service representatives and information analysts Partial automation will become more prevalent as machines complement human labor For example AI algorithms that can read diagnostic scans with a high degree of accuracy will help doctors diagnose patient cases and identify suitable treatment In other fields jobs with repetitive tasks could shift toward a model of managing and troubleshooting automated systems At retailer Amazon employees who previously lifted and stacked objects are becoming robot operators monitoring the automated arms and resolving issues such as an interruption in the flow of objects While we expect there will be enough work to ensure full employment in 2030 based on most of our scenarios the transitions that will accompany automation and AI adoption will be significant The mix of occupations will change as will skill and educational requirements Work will need to be redesigned to ensure that humans work alongside machines most effectively Automation will accelerate the shift in required workforce skills we have seen over the past 15 years Demand for advanced technological skills such as programming will grow rapidly Social emotional and higher cognitive skills such as creativity critical thinking and complex information processing will also see growing demand Basic digital skills demand has been increasing and that trend will continue and accelerate Demand for physical and manual skills will decline but will remain the single largest category of workforce skills in 2030 in many countries Exhibit 3 This will put additional pressure on the already existing workforce skills challenge as well as the need for new credentialing systems While some innovative solutions are emerging solutions that can match the scale of the challenge will be needed Our research suggests that in a midpoint scenario around 3 percent of the global workforce will need to change occupational categories by 2030 though scenarios range from about 0 to 14 percent Some of these shifts will happen within companies and sectors but many will occur across sectors and even geographies Occupations made up of physical activities in highly structured environments or in data processing or collection will see declines Growing occupations will include those with difficult to automate activities such as managers and those in unpredictable physical environments such as plumbers Other occupations that will see increasing demand for work include teachers nursing aides and tech and other professionals As intelligent machines and software are integrated more deeply into the workplace workflows and workspaces will continue to evolve to enable humans and machines to work together As self checkout machines are introduced in stores for example cashiers can become checkout assistance helpers who can help answer questions or troubleshoot the machines More system level solutions will prompt rethinking of the entire workflow and workspace Warehouse design may change significantly as some portions are designed to accommodate primarily robots and others to facilitate safe human machine interaction The occupational mix shifts will likely put pressure on wages Many of the current middle wage jobs in advanced economies are dominated by highly automatable activities such as in manufacturing or in accounting which are likely to decline High wage jobs will grow significantly especially for high skill medical and tech or other professionals but a large portion of jobs expected to be created including teachers and nursing aides typically have lower wage structures The risk is that automation could exacerbate wage polarization income inequality and the lack of income advancement that has characterized the past decade across advanced economies stoking social and political tensions Most countries already face the challenge of adequately educating and training their workforces to meet the current requirements of employers Across the OECD spending on worker education and training has been declining over the last two decades Spending on worker transition and dislocation assistance has also continued to shrink as a percentage of GDP One lesson of the past decade is that while globalization may have benefited economic growth and people as consumers the wage and dislocation effects on workers were not adequately addressed Most analyses including our own suggest that the scale of these issues is likely to grow in the coming decades We have also seen in the past that large scale workforce transitions can have a lasting effect on wages during the 19th century Industrial Revolution wages in the United Kingdom remained stagnant for about half a century despite rising productivity a phenomenon known as Engels Pause PDF 690KB after the German philosopher who identified it In the search for appropriate measures and policies to address these challenges we should not seek to roll back or slow diffusion of the technologies Companies and governments should harness automation and AI to benefit from the enhanced performance and productivity contributions as well as the societal benefits These technologies will create the economic surpluses that will help societies manage workforce transitions Rather the focus should be on ways to ensure that the workforce transitions are as smooth as possible This is likely to require actionable and scalable solutions in several key areas There is work for everyone today and there will be work for everyone tomorrow even in a future with automation Yet that work will be different requiring new skills and a far greater adaptability of the workforce than we have seen Training and retraining both midcareer workers and new generations for the coming challenges will be an imperative Government private sector leaders and innovators all need to work together to better coordinate public and private initiatives including creating the right incentives to invest more in human capital The future with automation and AI will be challenging but a much richer one if we harness the technologies with aplomb and mitigate the negative effects James Manyika is chairman and

asked to consider the potential impacts of rapid technological changeMinister of finance Grant Robertson has asked the Productivity Commission to examine and report on technological change disruption and the future of work in a project to be undertaken jointly with the Australian Productivity Commission The move follows the launch last August of a joint Australia NZ project focused on growing the digital economy and maximising opportunities for small and medium sized enterprises The minister said the commission had been asked to consider the potential impacts of rapid technological change and its impact on the future of work and the workforce in New Zealand to help inform future government policy so the opportunities presented by disruptive technologies for economic productivity and social prosperity could be realised and the risks managed The commission said its earlier joint project had been designed to explore how institutional and regulatory settings in the two countries could support the use of digital technology and in particular how small and medium enterprises could maximise the opportunities from digital transformation NZ Productivity Commission director Judy Kavanagh said the joint report had highlighted the challenges and opportunities presented by the digital economy In this new mandate the commission will provide recommendations that will help manage the likely impacts of wider technological disruption and change on the future of work the workforce labour markets productivity and wellbeing She said the commission s work would be informed by the knowledge and insights of all sectors of the economy and society The Commission will be speaking with public bodies unions businesses academics and other interested parties to better understand the impacts of technological change on the future of work In his instructions to the commission Robertson said well designed and coordinated government responses could allow New Zealand to fully realise the potential of disruptive technologies for economic productivity and social prosperity improve the services provided by government and increase the efficiency and effectiveness with which government functions He said it would also enable the Government to provide an enabling environment without unnecessary barriers to desirable change while effectively managing risks and help to prepare New Zealand for any rapid labour displacement and distributional impacts Given the uncertainty around future technology and its impact the inquiry is not expected to make detailed quantified predictions of impacts Robertson said Rather it should give a sense of the nature and relative scale of impacts in different scenarios The inquiry should have a long term focus with recommendations that can be implemented in the short to medium term It should provide a resource for government to develop policies and programmes that make the most of the technological opportunities on offer and allow New Zealanders to face an uncertain future with confidence The Commission s final report to the Government is due on 31 March 2020 Sign up to gain exclusive access to email subscriptions event invitations

Communications is prohibited CommentFor many people artificial intelligence conjures up images of sci fi movies and the future They see it as a threat to their jobs and sometimes even their safety but AI represents the biggest leap forward in terms of work productivity since the personal computer and few other industries can benefit from AI as much as government With AI we can change the way government works and help employees do their job better AI is already integrated into numerous cloud platforms and can be used to discover new information and deliver outcomes instantly I like to refer to this as practical AI AI has the potential to improve employee experiences by speeding up decision making and automating mundane and repetitive tasks Bringing machine learning to everyday work enables government agencies and departments to make better decisions faster because they do not have to hunt for data and aggregate it into a spreadsheet By building intelligence into platforms AI helps manage complex workflows and allows organizations to One way that AI will be applied in the workplace is automating service requests Most companies have an IT service desk as well as a customer support center These functions ensure that customers and employees receive help in a timely manner whether it is a request for a new computer a password reset or the status of a repair Manually triaging thousands of incidents or cases categorizing tasks and routing work can consume resources introduce human error and slow resolution In fact a new report from Accenture found that customer support functions spend up to 12 percent of their time categorizing prioritizing and assigning tickets Meanwhile AI accurately categorizes requests nearly instantly It eliminates the bottleneck created by agents having to manually assign categorize and route requests A full two days a week is wasted on manual administrative work according to the recent State of Work survey conducted by ServiceNow If an agency with 5 000 people automated those processes they could get 4 million work hours back a year Adding AI frees up employees to do the work they want to do spurring creativity Nearly half of respondents 48 percent said work levels increased by 20 percent or more after they adopted AI solutions Additionally 91 percent of executives say their skilled employees spend too much time on admin tasks and 93 percent believe that reducing mundane tasks unleashes employee creativity To properly implement AI solutions across government agencies we need to define which tasks are best suited for humans and which ones should be performed by AI The government has a term inherently governmental to describe work processes or decisions that must be done by government employees Contractors do much of the work in our government agencies but certain work is inherently governmental in nature As we move into an age defined by AI we need to identify and define the work processes and decisions that are inherently human We are going to increasingly work in a blended workplace with AI systems and humans working together to achieve a mission There are certain activities within any work environment that can only be performed or should only be performed by humans While there may be many more human activities designated as inherently human in the beginning I believe that as humans become more comfortable with the role of AI in the blended workforce less and less work will be designated as inherently human There will always be a need for humans to remain in charge from factual responsibility and liability aspects as well as from emotional and psychological ones We spend a third of our lives at work It shapes who we are how we feel and how we interact with the world so we must create great work experiences and this is what AI does AI creates work experiences that unleash productivity bringing out the best in us Rather than fearing machines stealing jobs we need to understand how AI will change the way government works though small but practical ways and prepare the workforce of the future for this change About the AuthorBob Osborn is CTO Federal of

for our newsletter I agree to this site s Privacy Policy Thank you for inviting me to speak with you here today In particular I want to thank the Productivity Commission and all involved in the Productivity Hub The previous presenters today have touched on a range of ideas for how we can face the challenge of improving our productivity in a changing world From technology and data to public services and the energy transition I m excited to see forward thinking people working on such a broad range of important topics I d like to commend you all and encourage you to keep up the good work My presentation today will focus on an issue that is at the heart of a productive economy how we approach the rapidly changing world of work I want to talk about how this fits with the overall economic strategy of the Government the core policy areas that we have identified to support New Zealanders in this process and the institutional settings required to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of the Future of Work Economic StrategyBy harnessing the potential of new technology and innovation educating and upskilling our workforce and incentivising research and development we can lift productivity and transition to an economy that is sustainable inclusive and productive That is this Government s overarching economic aim The lessons learned from the Future of Work Commission heavily influenced this Government s economic strategy We aim to shape an economy where we work smarter make better use of our resources ensure everyone who wants to work can work and ensure that the benefits of growth are spread across society In an article published this past weekend Rod Oram argued that we can rise to the immense challenge of making this a high value high wage economy over the next decade The global and local conditions for doing so are the most favourable ever I know there is an appetite among businesses and workers to take up this challenge and I couldn t agree more that the time is right to face up to this Boosting productivity across the economy will be one of the key drivers to improving New Zealanders living standards and wellbeing The Government will put this at the heart of what we do Our focus on lifting wellbeing will require a different approach and different measures of success We want to take a broader view of success and move beyond simple measures such as GDP which while an important measure of economic output does not tell the full story of peoples wellbeing We are working with our Confidence and Supply partner the Green Party on new sustainable development indicators to paint a fuller picture of how well off people are and how the Government can focus its resources best I have also instructed the Treasury to accelerate their work on the Living Standards Framework which measures the impact of policies on four capitals Human Social Natural and Financial Physical I intend to use this framework to inform the Budget process for Budget 2019 making it our first ever Wellbeing Budget By placing wellbeing at the heart of what we do we will be able to measure the extent to which our policies and investments are making real improvements to peoples lives Improving productivity is key to improving wellbeing By producing more from every hour worked businesses become more profitable incomes rise and workers wellbeing rises as time is freed up and purchasing power rises The challenge is how we achieve this The Changing World of WorkThis Government has come into office at an interesting time in New Zealand s economic story Technological advances are transforming our world for example through increased processing power and big data sensors remote work or smart devices The full effect of forces such as automation algorithms and globalisation are not yet known but we do know that they already are and will continue to be disruptive to what only 5 or 10 years ago we considered the status quo My thinking on this topic was shaped by the Future of Work Commission which I chaired for the Labour Party when we were in Opposition It was an ambitious undertaking that saw us engage with thousands of New Zealanders and experts from around the world It is hard to distil that work down to a few points but overall my takeaway is that there is an enormous possibility for us to have productive and fulfilling work over the coming decades But it will only happen if we prepare now We are facing a world where the change has been estimated by McKinsey Global Institute to be occurring at ten times the pace of the Industrial Revolution and 300 times the scale or roughly 3 000 times the impact Every aspect of our working lives is changing Whole jobs are disappearing and almost every job is being re shaped The very notion of what a job is has been challenged by the so called gig economy Advances in technology present both challenges and opportunities for this sometimes all at once For example a company which automates production of its products will experience productivity gains but there might be consequences for the company s workers What happens to those who are laid off How well positioned are they to quickly retrain Could their past training help them swiftly move into other work How can we benefit from changes to the nature of work while negating or limiting the disadvantages We cannot say with any certainty exactly what the world of work will look like but there are some core changes we can identify and the responses to them that are needed This represents both challenges and opportunities How we respond will drive the future of New Zealand s economy and shape how productive sustainable and inclusive our growth will be over the next few decades We all know the story of the New Zealand economy Over the past 20 years New Zealand has generally done well in the creating more part of the productivity equation GDP growth has averaged about 2 8 over that time compared to the OECD average of 2 1 But it s the other part of the equation the resources required to create more where we have been weak Of that headline growth about 1 7 can be attributed to growth in the volume of labour input or simply total hours worked In other words we required strong population growth and more people entering the workforce to ensure more hours were worked in order to increase production More people working is not a recipe for long term sustainable and inclusive growth The portion of that growth which can be attributed to getting more from each unit of labour in producing goods and services has been 1 1 of that 2 8 over the past 20 years that is we are one of the weaker performers in the OECD In fact our relatively low labour productivity growth over a long period of time means the level of labour productivity in New Zealand GDP per hour worked is about 20 below the OECD average The Productivity Commission has told us that New Zealand s shallow capital markets have meant low levels of investment of productive capital the stuff we need to invest in to help us create more from our available resources Our investment in non residential capital per person in the labour force in 2016 was 25 lower than the OECD average In order to get ahead in terms of headline growth we relied on more people coming here to work and those who were already here to enter work We are at a point where the level of labour productivity in New Zealand GDP per hour worked is around 30 below Australia We have to do something different In recent years the main growth drivers have been population growth and a run away housing market That is not a sustainable path and as those forces recede we need to move deliberately and with urgency to establish an economy that is based on a thriving productive sector We also have to ensure that the benefits of this growth translate into meaningful improvements to the living standards of many New Zealanders who missed out in recent years I spoke earlier about our Government s emphasis on wellbeing and delivering higher living standards for all New Zealanders We want to ensure the economy is delivering real benefits to peoples lives rather than simply pursuing growth for the sake of growth Our success in achieving this will largely be determined by how we respond to the challenges we face including New Zealand s productivity challenge With this in mind today I want to talk you through this Government s plan to ensure we are prepared to face the changes that are coming due to technological advances and the changing nature of work In responding to this our Future of Work report identified three core values to drive our response We need to be Inclusive offering opportunity and harnessing the talents of all Resilient to deal with the changes and shocks that are coming our way and Adaptable to be leaders of the change and shape it in line with our values There are a huge range of policy approaches and changes to the way we run our economy that are needed to meet these challenges and take the opportunities that will arise Our Tax Working Group and the reforms we are making to the Reserve Bank Act are an important part of setting the path to a more productive economy That focus on improving productivity is at the heart of the terms of reference for both these reviews Beyond these we had more than 63 recommendations in our report and you will be pleased I am not going to go through them all now I want to touch on just a few of the main themes Just TransitionIn the face of this rapid change it is essential that we have a just transition for those most affected We saw in New Zealand in the 1980s and 1990s the damage that can be done when major changes are made without enough thought or support given to those who face the immediate consequences In this instance I am using that phrase to primarily talk about two things one at a system level the other at a practical on the ground level The government has committed itself to the goal of a net zero carbon economy by 2050 This is an essential shift for New Zealand away from an economy that hastens climate change to one that is more sustainable and develops New Zealand s strategic advantages We will need to ensure this is a just transition where affected industries and communities are given the support to find new sustainable growth opportunities We are in the process of establishing an Independent Climate Commission which will have the job of establishing goals and targets Meanwhile under the leadership of Hon James Shaw a Green Investment Fund is being created to leverage private sector investment to support business developments that will support a low carbon economy Innovation science and research will have significant roles to play in this However New Zealand s total investment in Research and Development is only 1 3 of GDP about half the OECD average When the OECD issued its most recent assessment of the New Zealand economy last year this is what it had to say on R D Expenditure on R D is low as a share of GDP most notably in the business sector Collaboration between firms education and research institutions is low And its advice Increase fiscal support for business research and development Maintain or increase long term support for successful collaboration between research institutions and industry In the Coalition Agreement with New Zealand First we have set a target of hitting an R D spend of 2 of GDP in ten years That s more than a 50 increase in R D investment relative to GDP over that time and will make a significant contribution to improving our productivity Officials say that this is an ambitious goal We believe this can be done with the Government incentivising such vital work by the private sector Minister for Research Science and Innovation Megan Woods has already begun work on overhauling New Zealand s R D regime with Ministers set to discuss officials initial findings later this month We are committed in the first instance to restoring R D tax credits to give firms some certainty about their investments One other key investment identified in our Future of Work programme is in direct support of the technology sector and for businesses to make better use of new technology Research by Swedish academic and technologist Goran Roos found that 55 of New Zealand jobs are at risk due to technological advances and that countries likely to be least affected will be those with the highest levels of economic complexity This is just one of the reasons why it is important for us to diversify our skills base and look for more sustainable drivers of growth By putting the right policies and incentives in place the technology sector can be one of those economic drivers While technological advances present challenges to existing jobs we also have the opportunity to create new forms of work According to NZTech chief executive Graeme Muller only 14 percent of large NZ businesses have deployed any enabling technology for the Internet of Things despite 70 percent believing it will be strategically important for their business to do so Their concerns are largely around costs and changes in technology This Government wants to nurture an environment that gives businesses the confidence to take up new technology Minister Clare Curran is in the process of creating the position of Chief Technology Officer CTO who will report directly to the Prime Minister and Cabinet The CTO will be responsible for introducing and managing a National Digital Architecture and Digital Technology Roadmap They will also work with the wider industry to develop ingenuity and creativity in the ICT sector Our aim is for the ICT industry to be our second largest contributor to GDP by 2025 Learning For LifeThe other critical element of a just transition to this new world of work is how we support people to gain the relevant skills and knowledge We need to both support those workers whose jobs are under threat and prepare those who are yet to start working for the kind of labour market they are likely to enter New Zealand currently spends a fraction of what other countries do on active labour market policies Other countries around the world such as Singapore France and Germany have recognised that they need to both plan ahead for the changes but also provide greater support for people who are displaced by technological change The Future of Work was the catalyst for our three years free training and education policy One of this Government s key policies is to provide one year of free post secondary education or training gradually progressing to 3 years by 2025 In 2018 we will see 30 000 students enrolled in tertiary education courses and 50 000 in industry training without paying fees for their first year of education thanks to this policy This is extremely important for those whose jobs or future jobs are affected by automation and other technologies One aspect of this policy has not had a lot of attention which is for adults who have never trained or studied before They will be able to take up the three years free policy as it is rolled out This can be taken in short bursts or as complete re training This policy also covers the costs of those undertaking apprenticeships and aspects of industry training Because of the relative costs from 2018 this means two years free for apprentices right away For the next generation of people entering the workforce it is essential they are given the skills to be resilient and adaptable In the Future of Work Commission s time we heard from employer after employer that they were looking for people with what we once called soft skills the ability to collaborate be creative and solve problems These ideas lie at the heart of New Zealand s education curriculum but there is work to do to ensure they are developed for all our young people We will be embarking on a host of initiatives to see this happen including reform of our careers advice and guidance in schools to give all young people the opportunity to understand and experience the world of work This will be developed in close cooperation with business and training providers to create a more seamless transition from school to whatever comes next In January Employment Minister Willie Jackson announced the first of a series of initiatives to help give a group of young people who have fallen outside of the system sustainable work opportunities Sadly Maori and Pacifika young people are over represented among this group They are the most at risk of being excluded from the future of work and we need practical programmes that provide work experience to get them back into a training journey In the long term I believe we will need to radically alter the way we think about training and learning and work if we are to continue to lift productivity As the pace of technological change picks up we need to see ourselves as genuinely learning for life In many ways jobs will be events on that learning and training journey rather than the other way around This presents a series of challenges and opportunities for our education and training system that we will look at over the coming years There are of course many other areas of policy response that will contribute to our response to the Future of Work but I wanted to finish today on what systemic changes we will need to ensure we are leading the change rather than being passive recipients of it Active and Capable StateA critical element identified in our Future of Work report is that the state needs to be an active participant in how we shape the future of work It is important to note that by active I do not mean that it controls or dictates what happens but rather that we move beyond the tired and dangerous idea that we can simply leave the response to market forces to decide how New Zealand fares in the future world of work This means working alongside businesses to identify opportunities as noted above in the R and D and Tech sectors for example It means developing a new partnership between the Crown and Maori as the settlement of historic Treaty breaches comes to an end and opportunities for economic development emerge It also means being innovative and entrepreneurial when that is appropriate We are wanting public servants to co design with both politicians and the wider community what we can do to stay ahead of the curve A major example of this is the Provincial Growth Fund developed as part of our coalition agreement with New Zealand First This will see significant investments in the regions of New Zealand to grow sustainable and productive job opportunities The details of the Fund are to be released shortly and will provide some of the most significant development of our regions in decades These will be driven from the ground up with the Government as an active partner A New Social PartnershipIt is my strong belief that the most critical element to New Zealand succeeding in the Future of Work is a renewed social partnership between businesses workers and the government In the course of our Commission we saw examples in both large and small businesses of innovative approaches to this idea Air New Zealand s High Performance Engagement model is one useful example By involving workers in the full range of strategic decisions and change processes Air New Zealand has not only seen significant productivity benefits they have created far more harmonious workplace relations In a number of the new smaller technology businesses we have seen flat management structures and workplace democracy in action that is core to the way they run their businesses These companies give a significant voice to their employees and have seen productivity growth and improved workplace relations as a result We are working with MBIE and others to facilitate these approaches across a range of industries We can also see innovations happening in the way we work An example which has grabbed attention recently is Perpetual Guardian s decision to switch to trial a four day working week for five days pay The move was designed to improve workers wellbeing by giving them more time to spend with family and on other aspects of life with the expectation that this will enhance their productivity during the days they do work the same levels of output for fewer hours worked These are the kinds of practices that we need to see more of If we look at Germany as an example union members often sit on company boards as part of the decision making process ensuring that employee wellbeing is considered alongside high level corporate profit and financial targets It is unsurprising then that German workers on average worked the fewest hours annually in 2016 of all OECD countries with New Zealand workers on average doing 400 more hours every year This is possible because Germany s workers are also some of the most productive in the world I want to see New Zealand reach a point where we are able to work 400 fewer hours a year while producing more than we do today For us to get there we need to make the advances in productivity we have been discussing today Technological improvements will play a huge role in this One of my goals as Minister of Finance is to develop this new partnership at a system wide level to promote a combined work stream on how we can apply these lessons to other industries and sectors My parting challenge to the many public servants here today is to think about how we can do this across Government and break down some of the silos we have created to enable businesses and workers and their representatives to easily engage in such a partnership ConclusionI am most certainly not the first New Zealand politician to both highlight the challenge of low productivity nor to say that we will address it So the proof will be in what we actually do But we are in an environment that has change occurring at a pace and scale we have never seen before We have to take the opportunity now to capitalise on that to finally make the leaps that have so far eluded our country We have already made a start with the initiatives I have mentioned today I want us to re write our productivity story so that New Zealand becomes a leading example of a sustainable and productive economy in which everyone gets a share of economic success We have a long way to go but this Government is committed to tackling the long term challenges that this country has faced for many years I look forward to working with you on this journey Thank you Productivity growth in the United States and other advanced economies has slowed sharply over the past decade If this slowdown persists it will mean more slowly rising living standards and more difficult fiscal challenges What public policies might quicken the pace of productivity growth in the U S We put that question recently to a panel of experts convened by the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy and the Initiative on Business and Public Policy Here are some of their suggestions One solution to the productivity slowdown on which there was broad consensus was the need to enhance competition Competition promotes productivity growth through increased incentives for innovation and through selection If firms have strong incentives to innovate many productivity boosting innovations will come to market Also when only the firms with the highest productivity survive while the least productive firms are forced to exit the market the average productivity will go up Jonathan Baker a lawyer and economist who teaches at American University s Washington College of Law believes that there is room to improve competition in the U S economy Market power is a problem in the U S economy it s plausible that growing market power has contributed to the productivity slowdown he explains Competition can be increased in a number of ways including by strengthening antitrust enforcement and by reforming the patent system so that patents are not used to shut out potential competitors while providing enough incentives for firms to invest in developing innovations Bronwyn Hall emerita professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley suggested that in some industries it s currently too easy to get a patent Most of us who look closely at the patent system think that the requirement for novelty is a little too low And so we do think there s room for reform in the patent area Occupational licensing is another area that might have room for improving competition There s been tremendous growth in this country in occupational licensing requirements And that s got to harm entry barriers and make it hard for people to move in and out of occupations And it s not just doctors it s things like cosmetologists a whole range of jobs says Baker It also is important to avoid policies that might stifle productivity Some of such policies have been popular in this year s political campaign If you think about the ongoing political campaign the policies that have been given a lot of attention include things like restrictions on trade and immigration These are not the kinds of policies you want to think about if you re going to think about enhancing productivity says Robert Barro a Harvard University economist Policies to increase the skills of the workforce are essential to raising productivity as well Isabel Sawhill a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution argued that policies that increase years of schooling might not be enough She stressed the importance of ensuring that those years of schooling actually translate into skills and knowledge She noted that more than two thirds of young adults today would fail to quality for military service because of lack of education drug addiction jail records and other shortcomings which also suggests that they may not have the capabilities to be very productive in the workplace Improving the allocation of funding to research and development is another area that might improve prospects for productivity growth over the long run Hall pointed out that the allocation of federal funding for basic science R D is skewed towards life sciences and argued that this isn t a great strategy We can t tell now what field of science will be useful in the future It s just like the stock market And so all we can do is have a portfolio that is more balanced in the basic science spending Related Books Kuznets beyond Kuznets

University of California at Berkeley suggested that policy focus on low hanging fruit those industries that subtract value from our economy rather than add to it One example of such a value subtracting industry is healthcare administration he believes Our doctors nurses and pharmacists do wonderful things but as Princeton s Uwe Reinhart likes to say you do the national income accounting

Washington Transformation Politics Policies Prospects a forum sponsored by the Summer Institute of Martha s Vineyard Hebrew Center Vineyard Haven MassachusettsI want to talk tonight about labor productivity growth Labor productivity is the amount of goods and services produced per hour spent on the job Increases in labor productivity again that s the amount of goods and services produced per hour on the job are a fundamental factor in determining how fast the economy grows and how fast the average standard of living grows And productivity growth can be influenced by government policy about which I also want to say a few words 1Labor productivity growth varies a lot from year to year but it is possible to discern longer historical periods with high or low productivity growth as shown in figure 1 For example labor productivity rose at an average annual rate of 3 1 4 percent from 1948 to 1973 whereas in the period 1974 to 2016 the average growth rate of productivity was about 1 7 percent That is to say that with the important exception of the information technology IT boom beginning in the mid 1990s the U S economy has been in a low productivity growth period since 1974 The record for the past five years has been particularly dismal How much does productivity growth matter A great deal The person who made that clear in an article published in 1957 60 years ago Professor Robert Solow is here tonight That is a pleasure an honor a joy and something of a difficulty for anyone wanting to talk about productivity and its growth in the presence of the master The reason the rate of productivity growth matters so much is that it is a basic determinant of the rate of growth of average income per capita over long periods 2 To understand that one needs to know only the trick of calculating how long it takes for a growing economy to double A good rule of thumb for calculating the time it takes labor productivity or anything else that is growing to double can be calculated by dividing 70 by the growth rate When labor productivity was growing at 3 1 4 percent per year during the 25 years from 1948 to 1973 it took 22 years for labor productivity to double Looking again at Figure 1 in the 42 years from 1974 to 2016 when labor productivity was growing on average at a rate of 1 3 4 percent it would have taken approximately 41 years for labor productivity to double There is a vast difference between the prospects facing the young in an economy where incomes per capita are doubling every 22 years and an economy in which incomes are on average doubling only every 41 years Now productivity statistics are imperfect in many respects for example capturing the value of the seemingly free apps we use on our smartphones is challenging And many of us who live in the modern age cannot believe that the iPhone has not fundamentally changed our lives It has certainly changed our lives to some extent and there is likely some underestimation of productivity growth in the official data But to figure out whether the current degree of data bias has reduced estimated growth we have to ask not whether there is bias but whether the bias has increased To a first approximation one could assume that the rate of bias is constant and does not account for the estimated decline in productivity growth and that we should not dismiss the slowdown as an artifact of measurement difficulties3 That is the conclusion most researchers reach but the data issue is not settled As Bob Solow famously said just before the increase in productivity growth of 1996 2003 the computer is everywhere except in the growth data And there are serious researchers who have made serious arguments that we will soon be seeing more rapid growth in the productivity data Factors determining productivity growth Clearly a key question for economic forecasters and even more so for U S citizens and indeed for the entire global economy is whether we should anticipate a return of the more rapid productivity gains experienced in the IT boom and for the quarter century after the end of World War II or should instead resign ourselves to tepid economic growth in future years And a central policy issue is whether government policies can help push the economy toward a higher productivity regime In this context it is useful to think of labor productivity growth as coming from three sources as shown in figure 2 First greater investment by firms in tangible equipment and structures as well as intangible investments such as software and product designs raise labor productivity Second improvements in labor quality or the capabilities of the workforce contribute as well through education training and experience Finally innovations yield more or better output from the same inputs the same capital and labor such as the introduction of the assembly line and computer aided product design I will consider the role that policy may play through each of these channels It is noteworthy that most of the recent drop in productivity is due to a lower contribution from innovation although weaker investment has played a role as well The contribution to labor productivity from labor quality has changed very little Innovation Our prospects for further significant technological innovations are hotly debated Some observers believe that we have exhausted the low hanging fruit on the productivity tree and in particular that efficiency gains from the use of IT have run their course 4 Other observers argue that we can reach fruit higher on the tree with each passing year These observers believe that innovation yields better tools such as 3 D printers and genetic sequencing equipment which themselves enable further technological advances 5 For what it is worth I believe the early signs of self driving cars the emergence of disease treatments based on genetics and the falling costs for conventional and alternative energy production suggest that we are continuing to innovate both in IT as well as in other parts of the economy One possibility is that we are in a productivity lull while firms reorganize to exploit the latest innovations it took decades before the full benefits of the steam engine electrification and computers were seen 6One way to ensure the vigor of innovation is to support research and development R D and here the recent record is mixed As shown in figure 3 R D spending in the United States softened during the Great Recession R D funded by U S businesses has since recovered However government funded R D as a share of gross domestic product is at the lowest level in recent history A great deal of the R in overall R D is government funded and not tied to a specific commercial goal The applied research built on this basic research ultimately yields productivity gains far into the future 7 Consequently the decline in government funded R D is disturbing To raise productivity and economic well being firms must adopt innovations that emerge from R D as quickly as possible This adjustment may occur as start ups introduce innovation to the market as existing innovative firms expand or as competing firms imitate the innovators Recent research suggests that all three of these channels which reflect the economic dynamism of businesses have been operating sluggishly of late New firms are not created as often as in the past innovative firms are not hiring or investing as aggressively as they once did and the diffusion of innovations is weak from frontier firms to trailing firms 8It is difficult to pinpoint specific policy actions that would address this decline in dynamism Broadly speaking however government policymakers should carefully consider the effects of regulations and tax policy on the free flow of workers capital and ideas Investment In recent years the contribution to labor productivity growth from investment has declined Business fixed investment rose roughly 2 1 2 percent per year on average from 2004 to 2016 compared with about 5 percent from 1996 to 2003 9 Some bright spots do exist Capital expenditure by leading IT companies Google Amazon and the like has soared since 2010 and investment in the energy sector has returned to life Nevertheless firms as a whole seem reluctant to invest This cautious approach to investment may in part reflect uncertainty about the policy environment By one measure U S policy uncertainty was elevated for much of the recovery subsided in 2013 and then rose again late last year underpinned by uncertainty about policies associated with health care regulation taxes and trade 10 Reasonable people can disagree about the right way forward on each of those issues but mitigating the damping effect of uncertainty by providing more clarity on the future direction of government policy is highly desirable particularly if the direction of policy itself is desirable Government investment can be an important source of productivity growth as well For example the interstate highway system is credited with boosting productivity in the 1950s and 1960s 11 That highway system and many other federally supported roadways waterways and structures have been neglected in recent years Indeed real infrastructure spending that is adjusting for inflation has fallen nearly 1 percent per year since 2005 12 This area of government investment deserves more attention Labor Quality Also important to raising labor productivity is investment in human capital workers knowledge and skills Such investment is a particular issue because most forecasts anticipate that the long rise in educational attainment both for college and high school may soon come to an end One area where policy may play a role is promoting educational access and readiness for groups for whom educational attainment is relatively low Recent research has shown a substantial return to public investment in early childhood education for economically disadvantaged groups Such programs increase high school graduation promote income over the life cycle for both participants and their parents and produce other socially beneficial outcomes such as greater health 13At the other end of the education process a college degree has long been considered a worthwhile investment and thus our society should promote access to and readiness for college among a broad range of individuals in particular through federal support for need based financial aid 14Lastly I will note that ultimately the return on the human capital embodied in our workforce is closely tied to public health A rise in morbidity or fall in longevity in the U S population is not a concern only for humanitarian reasons Workers too ill to perform at their potential represent lost productivity and welfare for society as a whole Research has shown just such a trend among prime age non Hispanic Americans without a college degree 15 More study is needed to determine what policies would help reverse this trend and government funding could likely assist the effort More broadly programs to promote clean air and drinking water are examples of public health policies that bolster the health and longevity of the present and future workforce as a whole Concluding remarks To conclude we return to the basic question How much does productivity growth matter The basic answer simple arithmetic says it matters a lot If labor productivity grows an average of 2 percent per year average living standards for our children s generation will be twice what we experienced If labor productivity grows an average of 1 percent per year the difference is dramatic Living standards will take two generations to double 16But fortunately when it comes to productivity we are not simply consigned to luck or to fate Governments can take sensible actions to promote more rapid productivity growth Broadly speaking government policy works best when it can address a need that the private sector neglects including investment in basic research infrastructure early childhood education schooling and public health Reasonable people can disagree about the right way forward but if we as a society are to succeed we need to follow policies that will support and advance productivity growth That is easier said than done But it can be done References Andrews Dan Chiara Criscuolo and Peter Gal 2015

Indifference CurvesAppendix C Present Discounted ValueAppendix D The Expenditure Output ModelChapter 20 Economic GrowthSustained long term economic growth comes from increases in worker productivity which essentially means how well we do things In other words how efficient is your nation with its time and workers Labor productivity is the value that each employed person creates per unit of his or her input The easiest way to comprehend labor productivity is to imagine a Canadian worker who can make 10 loaves of bread in an hour versus a U S worker who in the same hour can make only two loaves of bread In this fictional example the Canadians are more productive Being more productive essentially means you can do more in the same amount of time This in turn frees up resources to be used elsewhere What determines how productive workers are The answer is pretty intuitive The first determinant of labor productivity is human capital Human capital is the accumulated knowledge from education and experience skills and expertise that the average worker in an economy possesses Typically the higher the average level of education in an economy the higher the accumulated human capital and the higher the labor productivity The second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change Technological change is a combination of invention advances in knowledge and innovation which is putting that advance to use in a new product or service For example the transistor was invented in 1947 It allowed us to miniaturize the footprint of electronic devices and use less power than the tube technology that came before it Innovations since then have produced smaller and better transistors that that are ubiquitous in products as varied as smart phones computers and escalators The development of the transistor has allowed workers to be anywhere with smaller devices These devices can be used to communicate with other workers measure product quality or do any other task in less time improving worker productivity The third factor that determines labor productivity is economies of scale Recall that economies of scale are the cost advantages that industries obtain due to size Read more about economies of scale in Cost and Industry Structure Consider again the case of the fictional Canadian worker who could produce 10 loaves of bread in an hour If this difference in productivity was due only to economies of scale it could be that Canadian workers had access to a large industrial size oven while the U S worker was using a standard residential size oven Now that we have explored the determinants of worker productivity let s turn to how economists measure economic growth and productivity To analyze the sources of economic growth it is useful to think about a production function which is the process of turning economic inputs like labor machinery and raw materials into outputs like goods and services used by consumers A microeconomic production function describes the inputs and outputs of a firm or perhaps an industry In macroeconomics the connection from inputs to outputs for the entire economy is called an aggregate production function Economists construct different production functions depending on the focus of their studies Figure 1 presents two examples of aggregate production functions In the first production function shown in Figure 1 a the output is GDP The inputs in this example are workforce human capital physical capital and technology We discuss these inputs further in the module Components of Economic Growth An economy s rate of productivity growth is closely linked to the growth rate of its GDP per capita although the two are not identical For example if the percentage of the population who holds jobs in an economy increases GDP per capita will increase but the productivity of individual workers may not be affected Over the long term the only way that GDP per capita can grow continually is if the productivity of the average worker rises or if there are complementary increases in capital A common measure of U S productivity per worker is dollar value per hour the worker contributes to the employer s output This measure excludes government workers because their output is not sold in the market and so their productivity is hard to measure It also excludes farming which accounts for only a relatively small share of the U S economy Figure 2 shows an index of output per hour with 2009 as the base year when the index equals 100 The index equaled about 106 in 2014 In 1972 the index equaled 50 which shows that workers have more than doubled their productivity since then According to the Department of Labor U S productivity growth was fairly strong in the 1950s but then declined in the 1970s and 1980s before rising again in the second half of the 1990s and the first half of the 2000s In fact the rate of productivity measured by the change in output per hour worked averaged 3 2 per year from 1950 to 1970 dropped to 1 9 per year from 1970 to 1990 and then climbed back to over 2 3 from 1991 to the present with another modest slowdown after 2001 Figure 3 shows average annual rates of productivity growth averaged over time since 1950 In recent years a controversy has been brewing among economists about the resurgence of U S productivity in the second half of the 1990s One school of thought argues that the United States had developed a new economy based on the extraordinary advances in communications and information technology of the 1990s The most optimistic proponents argue that it would generate higher average productivity growth for decades to come The pessimists on the other hand argue that even five or ten years of stronger productivity growth does not prove that higher productivity will last for the long term It is hard to infer anything about long term productivity trends during the later part of the 2000s because the steep recession of 2008 2009 with its sharp but not completely synchronized declines in output and employment complicates any interpretation While productivity growth was high in 2009 and 2010 around 3 it has slowed down since then Productivity growth is also closely linked to the average level of wages Over time the amount that firms are willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce If a few employers tried to pay their workers less than what those workers produced then those workers would receive offers of higher wages from other profit seeking employers If a few employers mistakenly paid their workers more than what those workers produced those employers would soon end up with losses In the long run productivity per hour is the most important determinant of the average wage level in any economy To learn how to compare economies in this regard follow the steps in the following Work It Out feature The Organization for Economic Co operation and Development OECD tracks data on the annual growth rate of real GDP per hour worked You can find these data on the OECD data webpage Labour productivity growth in the total economy at this website Step 1 Visit the OECD website given above and select two countries to compare Step 2 On the drop down menu Variable select Real GDP Annual Growth in percent and record the data for the countries you have chosen for the five most recent years Step 3 Go back to the drop down menu and select Real GDP per Hour Worked Annual Growth Rate in percent and select data for the same years for which you selected GDP data Step 4 Compare real GDP growth for both countries Table 2 provides an example of a comparison between Australia and Belgium Step 5 Consider the many factors can affect growth For example one factor that may have affected Australia is its isolation from Europe which may have insulated the country from the effects of the global recession In Belgium s case the global recession seems to have had an impact on both GDP and real GDP per hours worked between 2009 and 2013 though productivity does seem to be recovering Nothing is more important for people s standard of living than sustained economic growth Even small changes in the rate of growth when sustained and compounded over long periods of time make an enormous difference in the standard of living Consider Table 3 in which the rows of the table show several different rates of growth in GDP per capita and the columns show different periods of time Assume for simplicity that an economy starts with a GDP per capita of 100 The table then applies the following formula to calculate what GDP will be at the given growth rate in the future For example an economy that starts with a GDP of 100 and grows at 3 per year will reach a GDP of 209 after 25 years that is 100 1 03 25 209 The slowest rate of GDP per capita growth in the table just 1 per year is similar to what the United States experienced during its weakest years of productivity growth The second highest rate 3 per year is close to what the U S economy experienced during the strong economy of the late 1990s and into the 2000s Higher rates of per capita growth such as 5 or 8 per year represent the experience of rapid growth in economies like Japan Korea and China Table 3 shows that even a few percentage points of difference in economic growth rates will have a profound effect if sustained and compounded over time For example an economy growing at a 1 annual rate over 50 years will see its GDP per capita rise by a total of 64 from 100 to 164 in this example However a country growing at a 5 annual rate will see almost the same amount of growth from 100 to 163 over just 10 years Rapid rates of economic growth can bring profound transformation See the following Clear It Up feature on the relationship between compound growth rates and compound interest rates If the rate of growth is 8 young adults starting at age 20 will see the average standard of living in their country more than double by the time they reach age 30 and grow nearly sevenfold by the time they reach age 45 The formula for growth rates of GDP over different periods of time as shown in Figure 2 is exactly the same as the formula for how a given amount of financial savings grows at a certain interest rate over time as presented in Choice in a World of Scarcity Both formulas have the same ingredients Recall that compound interest is interest that is earned on past interest It causes the total amount of financial savings to grow dramatically over time Similarly compound rates of economic growth or the compound growth rate means that the rate of growth is being multiplied by a base that includes past GDP growth with dramatic effects over time For example in 2013 the World Fact Book produced by the Central Intelligence Agency reported that South Korea had a GDP of 1 67 trillion with a growth rate of 2 8 We can estimate that at that growth rate South Korea s GDP will be 1 92 trillion in five years If we apply the growth rate to each year s ending GDP for the next five years we will calculate that at the end of year one GDP is 1 72 trillion In year two we start with the end of year one value of 1 67 and increase it by 2 Year three starts with the end of year two GDP and we increase it by 2 and so on as depicted in the Table 4 Another way to calculate the growth rate is to apply the following formula Where future value is the value of GDP five years hence present value is the starting GDP amount of 1 64 trillion g is the growth rate of 2 and n is the number of periods for which we are calculating growth Productivity the value of what is produced per worker or per hour worked can be measured as the level of GDP per worker or GDP per hour The United States experienced a productivity slowdown between 1973 and 1989 Since then U S productivity has rebounded the current global recession notwithstanding It is not clear whether the current growth in productivity will be sustained The rate of productivity growth is the primary determinant of an economy s rate of long term economic growth and higher wages Over decades and generations seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita An aggregate production function specifies how certain inputs in the economy like human capital physical capital and technology lead to the output measured as GDP per capita Compound interest and compound growth rates behave in the same way as productivity rates

s priorities when it comes to the future of work Photo Lynn GrievesonSam Sachdeva is Newsroom s political editor covering foreign affairs trade defence and security issues PoliticsThe Government has released the terms of reference for the Productivity Commission s inquiry into the future of work with Finance Minister Grant Robertson saying the rapid change of pace is one of the biggest issues facing the workplace The terms of reference for the inquiry sent to Productivity Commission chairman Murray Sherwin by Robertson ask it to look into how New Zealand can maximise the opportunities and manage the risks of disruptive technological change and its impact on the future of work and the workforce It is difficult to predict exactly what technological change will mean for New Zealand and how widespread disruption will be but impacts are already being felt in the form of changing business models and some jobs being replaced or transformed by automation The inquiry is not expected to make detailed quantified predictions of impacts given the uncertainty around future technology but instead a sense of the nature and relative scale of impacts in different scenarios The commission has been asked to take a long term focus with recommendations that can be implemented in the short or medium term providing a resource to develop government policies and programmes that make the most of the technological opportunities on offer and allow New Zealanders to face an uncertain future with confidence Rapid pace of changeSpeaking at the Work in Progress conference in Wellington Robertson said the rapid pace of change in the workplace made undertaking such work more difficult with one estimate suggesting change was occurring at 10 times the scale and 100 times the pace of the Industrial Revolution The report produced by Labour s Future of Work Commission while the party was in opposition was out of date even before it was released he said While work had always changed and evolved the current situation was different due to the risk that new developments would reduce rather than add to the number of jobs available for workers The Future of Work Tripartite Forum set up to bring the Government business sector and unions together to work on the issue was already working on four separate areas of potential future change As a child of the 1980s I will never accept that if you re going to make big economic shifts you should click your fingers and do it One priority was the concept of just transitions ensuring that planning was done to account for the impact of workplace changes and government policies such as the decision to ban oil and gas exploration As a child of the 1980s I will never accept that if you re going to make big economic shifts you should click your fingers and do it because that s what happened in New Zealand in the 1980s I saw the damage done when you switch economic direction without a plan and a process to bring communities with you Robertson said the Government s work in Taranaki to help the community adjust to the impact of the oil and gas ban would serve as a pilot for how to move a workforce along with broader employment changes Conveyor belt of trainingAnother critical area of work was the concept of lifelong learning an issue which Robertson was a key part of the Government s vocational education and training reforms We need workplace training and training that takes place in other settings to be at the core of what we do to make this work we have to embed it as a normal part of people s lives Rather than focusing on discrete training for a particular job it was better to think of a conveyor belt of training throughout your working life From time to time you may step off the training conveyor belt to do some specific jobs but you will always be training and retraining Robertson said MBIE was working on an interesting pilot in the manufacturing sector based on similar work in Singapore to map out the infrastructure and skills needs of the industry over the next 20 to 30 years with input from employers While the Productivity Commission has until the end of March next year to present its final report Robertson said the Government had asked it to produce a series of smaller reports throughout the process given the pace of change in the workplace The forum was also working on how to close the digital divide and improve business planning for new technologies as well as improving productivity While the Productivity Commission has until the end of March next year to present its final report Robertson said the Government had asked it to produce a series of smaller reports throughout the process given the pace of change in the workplace Productivity Commission director Judy Kavanagh said the new mandate would allow the organisation to provide recommendations on the likely impact of rapid technological disruption and broader changes to the future of work the workforce labour markets productivity and wellbeing The body s recent report on the low emissions economy highlighted the need to make the most of technology and innovation Kavanagh said The commission would speak to unions

automation and artificial intelligence perform more tasks and there is massive disruption of jobs experts say a wider array of education and skills building programs will be created to meet new demands There are two uncertainties Will well prepared workers be able to keep up in the race with AI tools And will market capitalism survive By Lee Rainie and Janna AndersonMachines are eating humans jobs talents And it s not just about jobs that are repetitive and low skill Automation robotics algorithms and artificial intelligence AI in recent times have shown they can do equal or sometimes even better work than humans who are dermatologists insurance claims adjusters lawyers seismic testers in oil fields sports journalists and financial reporters crew members on guided missile destroyers hiring managers psychological testers retail salespeople and border patrol agents Moreover there is growing anxiety that technology developments on the near horizon will crush the jobs of the millions who drive cars and trucks analyze medical tests and data perform middle management chores dispense medicine trade stocks and evaluate markets fight on battlefields perform government functions and even replace those who program software that is the creators of algorithms People will create the jobs of the future not simply train for them and technology is already central It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead Jonathan GrudinMultiple studies have documented that massive numbers of jobs are at risk as programmed devices many of them smart autonomous systems continue their march into workplaces A recent study by labor economists found that one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment to population ratio by about 0 18 0 34 percentage points and wages by 0 25 0 5 percent When Pew Research Center and Elon University s Imagining the Internet Center asked experts in 2014 whether AI and robotics would create more jobs than they would destroy the verdict was evenly split 48 of the respondents envisioned a future where more jobs are lost than created while 52 said more jobs would be created than lost Since that expert canvassing the future of jobs has been at the top of the agenda at many major conferences globally Several policy and market based solutions have been promoted to address the loss of employment and wages forecast by technologists and economists A key idea emerging from many conversations including one of the lynchpin discussions at the World Economic Forum in 2016 is that changes in educational and learning environments are necessary to help people stay employable in the labor force of the future Among the six overall findings in a new 184 page report from the National Academies of Sciences the experts recommended The education system will need to adapt to prepare individuals for the changing labor market At the same time recent IT advances offer new and potentially more widely accessible ways to access education Jobholders themselves have internalized this insight A 2016 Pew Research Center survey The State of American Jobs found that 87 of workers believe it will be essential for them to get training and develop new job skills throughout their work life in order to keep up with changes in the workplace This survey noted that employment is much higher among jobs that require an average or above average level of preparation including education experience and job training average or above average interpersonal management and communication skills and higher levels of analytical skills such as critical thinking and computer skills A central question about the future then is whether formal and informal learning structures will evolve to meet the changing needs of people who wish to fulfill the workplace expectations of the future Pew Research Center and Elon s Imagining the Internet Center conducted a large scale canvassing of technologists scholars practitioners strategic thinkers and education leaders in the summer of 2016 asking them to weigh in on the likely future of workplace training Some 1 408 responded to the following question sharing their expectations about what is likely to evolve by 2026 In the next 10 years do you think we will see the emergence of new educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers in the skills they will need to perform the jobs of the future The nonscientific canvassing found that 70 of these particular respondents said yes such programs would emerge and be successful A majority among the 30 who said no generally do not believe adaptation in teaching environments will be sufficient to teach new skills at the scale that is necessary to help workers keep abreast of the tech changes that will upend millions of jobs See About this canvassing of experts for further details about the limits of this sample Participants were asked to explain their answers and offered the following prompts to consider Several common expectations were evident in these respondents answers no matter how hopeful or fretful they were about the future of skills and capabilities training efforts It is important to note that many respondents listed human behaviors attributes and competencies in describing desirable work skills Although these aspects of psychology cannot be classified as skills and perhaps cannot be directly taught in any sort of training environment we include these answers under the general heading of skills capabilities and attributes A diversifying education and credentialing ecosystem Most of these experts expect the education marketplace especially online learning platforms to continue to change in an effort to accommodate the widespread needs Some predict employers will step up their own efforts to train and retrain workers Many foresee a significant number of self teaching efforts by jobholders themselves as they take advantage of proliferating online opportunities Respondents see a new education and training ecosystem emerging in which some job preparation functions are performed by formal educational institutions in fairly traditional classroom settings some elements are offered online some are created by for profit firms some are free some exploit augmented and virtual reality elements and gaming sensibilities and a lot of real time learning takes place in formats that job seekers pursue on their own A considerable number of respondents to this canvassing focused on the likelihood that the best education programs will teach people how to be lifelong learners Accordingly some say alternative credentialing mechanisms will arise to assess and vouch for the skills people acquire along the way A focus on nurturing unique human skills that artificial intelligence AI and machines seem unable to replicate Many of these experts discussed in their responses the human talents they believe machines and automation may not be able to duplicate noting that these should be the skills developed and nurtured by education and training programs to prepare people to work successfully alongside AI These respondents suggest that workers of the future will learn to deeply cultivate and exploit creativity collaborative activity abstract and systems thinking complex communication and the ability to thrive in diverse environments One such comment came from Simon Gottschalk a professor in the department of sociology at the University of Nevada Las Vegas The skills necessary at the higher echelons will include especially the ability to efficiently network manage public relations display intercultural sensitivity marketing and generally what author Dan Goleman would call social and emotional intelligence This also includes creativity and just enough critical thinking to move outside the box Another example is the response of Fredric Litto a professor emeritus of communications and longtime distance learning expert from the University of S o Paulo We are now in the transitional stage of employers gradually reducing their prejudice in the hiring of those who studied at a distance and moving in favor of such graduates who in the workplace demonstrate greater proactiveness initiative discipline collaborativeness because they studied online Other respondents mentioned traits including leadership design thinking human meta communication deliberation conflict resolution and the capacity to motivate mobilize and innovate Still others spoke of more practical needs that could help workers in the medium term to work with data and algorithms to implement 3 D modeling and work with 3 D printers or to implement the newly emerging capabilities in artificial intelligence and augmented and virtual reality Jonathan Grudin principal researcher at Microsoft commented People will create the jobs of the future not simply train for them and technology is already central It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead Seriously You re asking about the workforce of the future As if there s going to be one Anonymous scientific editorAbout a third of respondents expressed no confidence in training and education evolving quickly enough to match demands by 2026 Some of the bleakest answers came from some of the most respected technology analysts For instance Jason Hong an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University wrote There are two major components needed for a new kind of training program at this scale political will and a proven technology platform Even assuming that the political will and budget existed there s no platform today that can successfully train large numbers of people MOOCs Massive Open Online Courses have a high dropout rate and have serious questions about quality of instruction They are also struggling with basic issues like identification of individuals taking the courses So in short we can train small numbers of individuals tens of thousands per year using today s community colleges and university systems but probably not more Several respondents argued that job training is not a primary concern at a time when accelerating change in market economies is creating massive economic divides that seem likely to leave many people behind An anonymous scientific editor commented Seriously You re asking about the workforce of the future As if there s going to be one Employers either run sweatshops abroad or hire people in the first world to do jobs that they hate while more and more unskilled and skilled people end up permanently on welfare or zero hour contracts And the relatively job secure qualified people who work in the professions are probably a lot closer than they think they are to going over that same cliff The details of how they earn their credentials aren t going to be an issue Most participants in this canvassing wrote detailed elaborations explaining their positions though they were allowed to respond anonymously Their well considered comments provide insights about hopeful and concerning trends These findings do not represent all possible points of view but they do reveal a wide range of striking observations Respondents collectively articulated five major themes that are introduced and briefly explained in the 29 page section below and then expanded upon in more detailed sections Some responses are lightly edited for style or due to length The following section presents a brief overview of the most evident themes extracted from the written responses including a small selection of representative quotes supporting each point Some responses are lightly edited for style or due to length These experts envision that the next decade will bring a more widely diversified world of education and training options in which various entities design and deliver different services to those who seek to learn They expect that some innovation will be aimed at emphasizing the development of human talents that machines cannot match and at helping humans partner with technology They say some parts of the ecosystem will concentrate on delivering real time learning to workers often in formats that are self taught Commonly occurring ideas among the responses in this category are collected below under headings reflecting subthemes Most experts seem to have faith that rapid technological development and a rising wariness of coming impacts of the AI robotics revolution are going to spur the public private and governmental actions needed for education and training systems to be adapted to deliver more flexible open adaptable resilient certifiable and useful lifelong learning Educators have always found new ways of training the next generation of students for the jobs of the future and this generation will be no different Justin ReichJim Hendler a professor of computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute predicted The nature of education will change to a mix of models College education which will still favor multi year residential education will need to be more focused on teaching students to be lifelong learners followed by more online content in situ training and other such elements to increase skills in a rapidly changing information world As automation puts increasing numbers of low and middle skill workers out of work these models will also provide for certifications and training needs to function in an increasingly automated service sector Michael Wollowski an associate professor of computer science at the Rose Hulman Institute of Technology commented We will definitely see a vast increase in educational and training programs We will also see what might be called on demand or on the job kind of training programs We kind of have to as with continued automation we will need to retrain a large portion of the workforce I strongly believe employers will subscribe to this idea wholeheartedly it increases the overall education of their workforce which benefits their bottom line Nevertheless I am a big believer in the college experience which I see as a way to learn what you are all about as a person and in your field of study The confidence in your own self and your abilities cannot be learned in a short course It takes life experience or four years at a tough college At a good college you are challenged to be your best this is very resource intensive and cannot be scaled at this time Justin Reich executive director at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT Teaching Systems Lab observed Educators have always found new ways of training the next generation of students for the jobs of the future and this generation will be no different Our established systems of job training primarily community colleges and state universities will continue to play a crucial role though catastrophically declining public support for these institutions will raise serious challenges David Karger a professor of computer science at MIT wrote Most of what we now call online learning is little more than glorified textbooks but the future is very promising No matter how good our online teaching systems become the current four year college model will remain dominant for quite some time Online teaching will increase the reach of the top universities which will put pressure on lesser universities to demonstrate value One potential future would be for those universities to abandon the idea that they have faculty teaching their own courses and instead consist entirely of a cadre of less well paid teaching assistants who provide support for the students who are taking courses online A few respondents said already established institutions cannot be as fully successful as new initiatives Jerry Michalski founder at REX commented Today s educational and training institutions are a shambles They take too long to teach impractical skills and knowledge not connected to the real world and when they try to tackle critical thinking for a longer time scale they mostly fail The sprouts of the next generation of learning tools are already visible Within the decade the new shoots will overtake the wilting vines and we will see all sorts of new initiatives mostly outside these schooling academic and training institutions which are mostly beyond repair People will shift to them because they work because they are far less expensive and because they are always available Barry Chudakov founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp says education has been liberated because thanks to digital innovation everyone can embed learning continuously in their everyday lives He wrote The key to education in the next 10 years will be the understanding that we now live in a world without walls and so the walls of the school physical and conceptual need to shatter and never go up again In the hopefully near future we will not segregate schooling from work and real world thinking and development They will seamlessly weave into a braid of learning realization exposure hands on experience and integration into students own lives And again the experience of being a student now confined to grade school secondary school and university will expand to include workers those looking for work and those who want or need to retrain as well as what we now think of as conventional education One way we will break down these walls we are already doing so will be to create digital learning spaces to rival classrooms as places where learning happen s Via simulation gaming digital presentations combined with hands on real world experience learning and re education will move out of books and into the world The more likely enhancement will be to take digital enhancements out into the world again breaking down the walls of the classroom and school to inform and enhance experience An anonymous respondent echoed the sentiment of quite a few others who do not think it is possible to advance and enhance online education and training much in the next decade writing These programs have a cost and too few are willing to sacrifice for these programs More such arguments are included in later sections of this report Some respondents expressed confidence in the best of current online education and training options saying online course options are cost effective evolving for the better and game changing because they are globally accessible Those with the most optimism expect great progress will be made in augmented reality AR virtual reality VR and AI While some say 2026 will still be early days for this tech many are excited about its prospects for enhancing learning in the next decade Already today there are quite effective online training and education systems but they are not being implemented to their full potential Edward FriedmanEdward Friedman professor emeritus of technology management at the Stevens Institute of Technology wrote Already today there are quite effective online training and education systems but they are not being implemented to their full potential These applications will become more widely used with familiarity that is gained during the next decade Also populations will be more tech savvy and be able to make use of these systems with greater personal ease In addition the development of virtual reality AI assistants and other technological advances will add to the effectiveness of these systems There will be a greater need for such systems as the needs for new expertise in the workforce increase and the capacity of traditional education systems proves that it is not capable of meeting the need in a cost effective manner The president of a technology LLC wrote Training teaching are all going online partly because of high costs of campus education Richard Adler distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future predicted AI voice response telepresence VR and gamification techniques will come together to create powerful new learning environments capable of personalizing and accelerating learning across a broad range of fields Ray Schroeder associate vice chancellor for online learning at the University of Illinois Springfield commented It is projected that those entering the workforce today will pursue four or five different careers not just jobs over their lifetime These career changes will require retooling training and education The adult learners will not be able to visit physical campuses to access this learning they will learn online I expect that we will see the further development of artificially intelligent teaching specialists such as Jill Watson at Georgia Tech the virtual graduate assistant who was thought to be human by an entire class of computer science students I anticipate the further development and distribution of holoportation technologies such as those developed by Microsoft using HoloLens for real time three dimensional augmented reality These teaching tools will enable highly sophisticated interactions and engagement with students at a distance They will further fuel the scaling of learning to reach even more massive online classes Fredric Litto an professor emeritus of communications and longtime distance learning expert from the University of S o Paulo replied There is no field of work that cannot be learned totally or in great part in well organized and administered online programs either in traditional course formats or in self directed independent learning opportunities supplemented when appropriate by face to face hands on practice situations Tawny Schlieski research director at Intel and president of the Oregon Story Board explained New technologies of human computer interaction like augmented and virtual reality offer the possibility of entirely new mechanisms of education Augmented and virtual reality tools make learning more experiential they engage students with physical movement and they enable interactive and responsive instructional assets As these tools evolve over the next decade the academics we work with expect to see radical change in training and workforce development which will roll into although probably against a longer timeline more traditional institutions of higher learning Many respondents said real world campus based higher education will continue to thrive during the next decade They generally expect that no other educational experience can match residential universities capabilities for fully immersive person to person learning as well as mentoring and socializing functions before 2026 They said a residential university education helps build intangible skills that are not replicable online and thus deepens the skills base of those who can afford to pay for such an education but they expect that job specific training will be managed by employers on the job and via novel approaches Some say major universities core online course content developed with all of the new tech bells and whistles will be marketed globally and adopted as baseline learning in smaller higher education locales where online elements from major MOOCs can be optimally paired in hybrid learning with in person mentoring activities The most important skills to have in life are gained through interpersonal experiences and the liberal arts Human bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion empathy vulnerability and social emotional intelligence Frank ElavskyUta Russmann communications marketing sales professor at the FHWien University of Applied Sciences in Vienna Austria said In the future more and more jobs will require highly sophisticated people whose skills cannot be trained in mass online programs Traditional four year and graduate programs will better prepare people for jobs in the future as such an education gives people a general understanding and knowledge about their field and here people learn how to approach new things ask questions and find answers deal with new situations etc all this is needed to adjust to ongoing changes in work life Special skills for a particular job will be learned on the job Frank Elavsky data and policy analyst at Acumen LLC responded The most important skills to have in life are gained through interpersonal experiences and the liberal arts Human bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion empathy vulnerability and social emotional intelligence These skills are imperative to focus on as the future is in danger of losing these skillsets from the workforce Many people have gained these skills throughout history without any kind of formal schooling but with the growing emphasis on virtual and digital mediums of production education and commerce people will have less and less exposure to other humans in person and other human perspectives Isto Huvila professor at Uppsala University replied The difference between educating to perform and educating to make the future is the difference between vocational education and higher university education Spending four years at a university is not only about learning skills but about bildung self cultivation and socialising in a group that is capable of fostering collaboration much better than an ad hoc group of people But this does not mean that alternative means and paths of learning and accreditation would not be useful as complementary to the traditional system that has limitations as well Dana Klisanin psychologist futurist at Evolutionary Guidance Media R D wrote Educational institutions that succeed will use the tools of social media and game design to grant students access to teachers from all over the world and increase their motivation to succeed Online educational programs will influence the credentialing systems of traditional institutions and online institutions will increasingly offer meet ups and mingles such that a true hybrid educational approach emerges Will training for skills most important in the jobs of the future work well in large scale settings by 2026 Respondents in this canvassing overwhelmingly said yes anticipating that improvements in such education would continue However many believe the most vital skills are not easy to teach learn or evaluate in any education or training setting available today Dozens of descriptive terms were applied by respondents as they noted the skills capabilities and attributes they see as important in workers lives in the next decade The skills needed to succeed in today s world and the future are curiosity creativity taking initiative multi disciplinary thinking and empathy These skills interestingly are the skills specific to human beings that machines and robots cannot do Tiffany ShlainWhile coding and other hard skills were listed as being easiest to teach to a large group in an online setting soft human skills were seen by most respondents as crucial for survival in the age of AI and robotics Devin Fidler research director at the Institute for the Future predicted As basic automation and machine learning move toward becoming commodities uniquely human skills will become more valuable There will be an increasing economic incentive to develop mass training that better unlocks this value Susan Price a digital architect at Continuum Analytics commented Increasingly machines will perform tasks they are better suited to perform than humans such as computation data analysis and logic Functions requiring emotional intelligence empathy compassion and creative judgment and discernment will expand and be increasingly valued in our culture Tiffany Shlain filmmaker and founder of the Webby Awards wrote The skills needed to succeed in today s world and the future are curiosity creativity taking initiative multi disciplinary thinking and empathy These skills interestingly are the skills specific to human beings that machines and robots cannot do and you can be taught to strengthen these skills through education I look forward to seeing innovative live and online programs that can teach these at scale Ben Shneiderman professor of computer science at the University of Maryland observed Students can be trained to be more innovative creative and active initiators of novel ideas Skills of writing speaking and making videos are important but fundamental skills of critical thinking community building teamwork deliberation dialogue and conflict resolution will be powerful A mindset of persistence and the necessary passion to succeed are also critical Louisa Heinrich founder at Superhuman Limited commented Lateral and system thinking skills are increasingly critical for success in an ever changing global landscape and these will need to be re prioritised at all levels of education An anonymous technologist commented Programming and problem solving learning how to work with artificial intelligence and robotics will become more important and more and more workers will be replaced by software hardware based workers Automation will reduce the need for the current workforce and the divide between the upper class and the lower class will continue to eat the middle class Some who are pessimistic about the future of human work due to advances in capable AI and robotics mocked the current push in the U S to train more people in technical skills An anonymous respondent commented Teach a billion people to program and you ll end up with 900 000 000 unemployed programmers An anonymous program director for a major U S technology funding organization predicted We will see training for the jobs of the past and for service jobs The jobs of the future will not need large numbers of workers with a fixed set of skills most things that we can train large numbers of workers for we will also be able to train computers to do better Among the many other skills mentioned were process oriented and system oriented thinking journalistic skills including research evaluation of multiple sources writing and speaking understanding algorithms computational thinking networking and programming grasping law and policy an evidence based way of looking at the world time management conflict resolution decision making locating information in the flood of data storytelling using data and influencing and consensus building A few people mentioned that young adults need to be taught how to have face to face interaction including one who said they seem to be sorely lacking in these skills and can only interact with a cellphone or laptop Because so many intricacies of the workplace the human soft and hard are learned on the job respondents said they expect apprenticeships and forms of mentoring will regain value and evolve along with the 21st century workplace D Yvette Wohn assistant professor of information systems at the New Jersey Institute of Technology wrote Formalized apprenticeships that require both technical skills and interpersonal interaction will become more important Ian O Byrne an assistant professor of literacy education at the College of Charleston replied In the future we ll see more opportunities for online personalized learning This will include open online learning experiences e g MOOCs where individuals can lurk and build up capacity or quench interests I also believe that we ll see a rise in the offering of premium or pay content that creates a space where one to one learning and interaction will allow mentors to guide learners while providing critical feedback We will identify opportunities to build a digital version of the apprenticeship learning models that have existed in the past Alternative credentials and digital badges will provide more granular opportunities to document and archive learning over time from traditional and nontraditional learning sources Through evolving technologies e g blockchain this may provide opportunities for learners to document and frame their own learning pathways An instructional designer with 19 years of experience commented The pattern I m seeing is toward individualized learning almost on the level of tutoring or apprenticeship We ve seen again and again that the broader the audience focus the less the course seems to deliver As for what the skills of the future are they ll be specialized to their fields with a university degree assumed to be a certificate in the ability to learn more about a particular subject specialty You may get a degree in computer software development but the truth is that you still need to be taught how to write software for say the mortgage company or insurance company that hires you The key to the future will be flexibility and personal motivation to learn and tinker with new things As they anticipate the appearance of effective new learning environments and advances in digital accountability systems many of these experts believe fresh certification programs will be created to attest to workers participation in training programs and the mastery of skills Some predict that many more workers will begin using online and app based learning systems Charlie Firestone communications and society program executive director and vice president at The Aspen Institute replied There will be a move toward more precise and better credentialing for skills and competencies e g badging and similar techniques Employers will accept these more as they prove probative And online learning will be more prevalent even as an adjunct to formal classroom learning New industries such as green energy and telemedicine will increase new employment opportunities Despite all of these measures the loss of jobs from artificial intelligence and robotics will exceed any retraining program at least in the short run Sam Punnett research officer at TableRock Media wrote I suspect employers will recognize the new credentialing systems Particularly those certificates awarded for studies in emerging disciplines currently data science appears all the rage and those that reflect an upgrade of previously acquired skills Traditional credentials will continue to hold value but I believe they will be considered in light of a candidates perceived ability in learning how to learn The four year degree and subsequent graduate studies will continue to be less of a guaranty towards employment without work experience Certificates are being viewed more favourably and many universities are lagging in their connection between their pedagogies and working world requirements William J Ward a university communications professor DR4WARD commented Higher Education is doing a poor job of preparing students with the skills they need to succeed in the workforce Online and credentialing systems are more transparent and do a better job on delivering skills People with new types of credentialing systems are seen as more qualified than traditional four year and graduate programs Many workplaces place a higher value on real world work portfolios than they do on a degree or certification yet their hiring systems including AI bots programmed to scan resum s still use the commonly accepted credentials as a basis for interviewing candidates Some respondents hope to see change Schools today turn out widget makers who can make widgets all the same They are built on producing single right answers rather than creative solutions Jeff JarvisA software engineering and system administration professional commented The reliability of the traditional educational system is already being questioned in some fields it s considered common sense that certifications and degrees mean little and that a portfolio references and hands on interviews are much more important for assessing a candidate s ability The unfortunate reality is that many HR departments still post job listings saying degrees and certifications are required as a way of screening candidates Both of those cost a lot of money and neither mean a lot for a candidate s competence I hope this will change both job listings and quality of degrees certifications but don t see it happening soon Meryl Krieger career specialist at Indiana University Bloomington s Jacobs School replied Credentialing systems will involve portfolios as much as resum s resum s simply are too two dimensional to properly communicate someone s skillset Three dimensional materials in essence job reels that demonstrate expertise will be the ultimate demonstration of an individual worker s skills I see credentialing as a piece of a very complex set of criteria these will also incorporate an individual s ability to communicate and work with teams huge in employer requests for new employees which can more readily be documented and tracked through online portfolio tools than through traditional resume formats Thus the educational and training programs of the future will become in their best incarnations sophisticated combinations of classroom and hands on training programs The specific models will necessarily be responding to individual industry requirements Jeff Jarvis a professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism wrote Schools today turn out widget makers who can make widgets all the same They are built on producing single right answers rather than creative solutions They are built on an outmoded attention economy Pay us for 45 hours of your attention and we will certify your knowledge I believe that many not all areas of instruction should shift to competency based education in which the outcomes needed are made clear and students are given multiple paths to achieve those outcomes and they are certified not based on tests and grades but instead on portfolios of their work demonstrating their knowledge While the first three themes found among the responses to this canvassing were mostly hopeful about advances in education and training for 21st century jobs a large share of responses from top experts reflect a significant degree of pessimism for various reasons Some even say the future of jobs for humans is so baleful that capitalism may fail as an economic system The next themes and subthemes examine these responses A large share of respondents predicted that online formats for knowledge transfer will not advance significantly in the next decade The 30 who expressed pessimism were often deeply doubtful about the capabilities of current education systems to adapt to pivot to respond to new challenges as quickly as necessary Interestingly being able to adapt and respond to looming challenges was seen by nearly everyone in this canvassing as one of the most highly prized future capabilities these respondents especially agree that it is important and they say that our human institutions government business education are not adapting efficiently and are letting us down Many of them say that current K 12 or K 16 education programs are incapable of making adjustments within the next decade to serve the shifting needs of future jobs markets Among the other reasons listed by people who do not expect these kinds of transformative advances in job creation and job skill upgrading Some among the 70 of respondents who are mostly optimistic about the future of training for jobs also echoed one or more of the points above mentioning these tension points while hoping for the best Following are representative statements tied to these points and more from all respondents Thomas Claburn editor at large at Information Week wrote I m skeptical that educational and training programs can keep pace with technology Traditional models train people to equate what they do with who they are i e what do you want to be when you grow up rather than to acquire critical thinking and flexible skills and attitudes that fit a rapidly changing world Pamela RutledgeAndrew Walls managing vice president at Gartner wrote Barring a neuroscience advance that enables us to embed knowledge and skills directly into brain tissue and muscle formation there will be no quantum leap in our ability to up skill people Learning takes time and practice which means it requires money lots of money to significantly change the skill set of a large cohort B Remy Cross assistant professor of sociology Webster University commented Lacking a significant breakthrough in machine learning that could lead to further breakthroughs in adaptive responses by a fully online system it is too hard to adequately instruct large numbers of people in the kinds of soft skills that are anticipated as being in most demand As manufacturing and many labor intensive jobs move overseas or are fully mechanized we will see a bulge in service jobs These require good people skills something that is often hard to train online John Bell software developer and teacher at Dartmouth College replied Even today access to information is not the limiting factor in skills education for anyone who can go online While there have been generational gains in the developments of online communities a large scale educational experience either MOOC or on demand broadcasts will not be able to duplicate that Stowe Boyd managing director of Another Voice and a well known thinker on work futures discussed the intangibles of preparing humans to partner with AI and bot systems While we may see the creation and rollout of new training programs he observed it s unclear whether they will be able to retrain those displaced from traditional sorts of work to fit into the workforce of the near future Many of the skills that will be needed are more like personality characteristics like curiosity or social skills that require enculturation to take hold Individual training like programming or learning how to cook may not be what will be needed And employers may play less of a role especially as AI and bot augmented independent contracting may be the best path for many rather than a job Homesteading in exurbia may be the answer for many with forty acres and a bot as a political campaign slogan of 2024 Luis Miron a distinguished university professor and director of the Institute for Quality and Equity in Education at Loyola University in New Orleans wrote Bluntly speaking I have little confidence in the educational sector K 16 having the capacity and vision to offer high quality online educational programs capable of transforming the training needs of the wider society The most important skills are advanced critical thinking and knowledge of globalization affecting diverse societies culturally religiously and politically Pamela Rutledge director of the Media Psychology Research Center wrote The core assumptions driving educational content are not adapting as fast as the world is changing Traditional models train people to equate what they do with who they are i e what do you want to be when you grow up rather than to acquire critical thinking and flexible skills and attitudes that fit a rapidly changing world We have traditional institutions invested in learning as a supply side model rather than demand side that would create proactive self directed learners This bias impacts the entire process from educators to employers It is changing but beliefs are sticky and institutions are cumbersome bureaucracies that are slow to adapt New delivery systems for skills related to technology will be more readily accepted than traditional ones because they avoid much of the embedded bias Successful education models will begin developing mixed methods to leverage technology with traditional delivery and rewrite certification processes with practice relevant standards Justin Reich executive director at the MIT Teaching Systems Lab observed There will continue to be for profit actors in the sector and while some may offer choice and opportunity for students many others will be exploitative with a great er focus on extracting federal grants and burdening students with debt than actually educating students and creating new opportunities John Paine a business analyst commented The competing desires 1 to make educational activity available to all and 2 to monetize the bejeezus out of anything related to the internet will limit the effectiveness of any online learning systems in a more widespread context danah boyd founder of Data Society commented I have complete faith in the ability to identify job gaps and develop educational tools to address those gaps I have zero confidence in us having the political will to address the socio economic factors that are underpinning skill training For example companies won t pay for reskilling and we don t have the political power to tax them at the level needed for public investment in reskilling Furthermore we have serious geographic mismatches underlying discriminatory attitudes and limited opportunities for lower to mid level career advancement What s at stake are not simply skills gaps it s about how we want to architect labor benefits and social safety nets And right now we talk about needing to increase skills but that s not what employers care about It just sounds nice When computer science graduates from CUNY and Howard University can t get a job what s at stake is not skills training Among the future worker capabilities with the highest value in these respondents eyes are the ability to adapt or pivot and the motivation to up skill as needed Many respondents emphasized that the most crucial skill is that people have to learn how to learn and be self motivated to keep learning My biggest concern with self directed learning is that it requires a great deal of internal motivation And I am not confident that individuals will find their way David BersteinDavid Bernstein a former research director wrote The most important skills needed to succeed in the workplace will be flexibility and the ability to adapt and continuously learn My biggest concern with self directed learning is that it requires a great deal of internal motivation And I am not confident that individuals will find their way just as those who enter college today don t know what they want to be when they grow up often until after they graduate So everyone will still need some basic skills interpersonal communications basic arithmetic along with some general culture awareness so they can have that flexibility Any 3 year old can use their parent s smartphone or tablet without reading the manual What I worry about is how well they will adapt when they are 35 or 55 Calton Pu professor and junior chair in software at the Georgia Institute of Technology wrote The most important skill is a meta skill the ability to adapt to changes This ability to adapt is what distinguished Homo sapiens from other species through natural selection As the rate of technological innovation intensifies the workforce of the future will need to adapt to new technology and new markets The people who can adapt the best and fastest will win This view means that any given set of skills will become obsolete quickly as innovations change the various economic sectors precision agriculture manufacturing 4 0 precision medicine just to name a few Therefore the challenge is not only to teach skills but also how to adapt and learn new skills Whether the traditional programs or new programs will be better at teaching adaptive learning remains to be seen Cory Salveson learning systems and analytics lead at RSM US responded The nature of work today and in future is such that if people want to keep increasingly scarce well paying jobs they will need to educate themselves in an ongoing manner for their whole lives Some of these experts say those who aren t motivated to continue to learn and grow will be left behind Scott Amyx CEO of Amyx said online training is advancing and will continue to evolve but The education system is at an inflection point Many ambitious federal and state programs have fizzled to produce dismal to no statistical change in the caliber of K 12 education It s those less educated and less skilled who are most sensitive to technological displacement Online mediums and self directed approaches may be limited in effectiveness with certain labor segments unless supplemented by human coaching and support systems Beth Corzo Duchardt a professor at Muhlenberg College replied Self directed study is a variable that changes the alchemy of teaching and learning It is true that most online courses require self direction Indeed when I advise students I don t recommend that students take online courses unless they have demonstrated an aptitude for self direction But in person courses may also be self directed This works well for some students but not others Students who are self directed often have had a very good foundational education and supportive parents They have been taught to think critically and they know that the most important thing you can learn is how to learn And they are also are more likely to come from economic privilege So not only does the self direction factor pose a problem for teaching at scale the fact that a high degree of self direction may be required for successful completion of coursework towards the new workforce means that existing structures of inequality will be replicated in the future if we rely on these large scale programs Among the 30 of respondents who said they did not think things would turn out well in the future were those who said the trajectory of technology will overwhelm labor markets killing more jobs than it creates They foresee a society where AI programs and machines do most of the work and raise questions about people s sense of identity the socio economic divisions that already distress them their ability to pay for basic needs their ability to use the growing amount of leisure time constructively and the impact of all of this on economic systems It should also be noted that many among the 70 who expect positive change in the next decade also expressed some of these concerns The problem of future jobs is not one of skills training it is one of diminishing jobs How will we cope with a workforce that is simply irrelevant Jennifer ZickermanCory Doctorow activist in residence at MIT Media Lab and co owner of Boing Boing boingboing net responded It s an article of faith that automation begets more jobs than it displaces in the long run but this is a theory free observation based on previous automation booms The current automation is based on general purpose technologies machine learning Turing complete computers a universal network architecture that is equally optimized for all applications and there s good reason to believe that this will be more disruptive and create fewer new jobs than those that came before Glenn Ricart Internet Hall of Fame member and founder and chief technology officer of US Ignite said Up to the present time automation largely has been replacing physical drudgery and repetitive motion things that can and should improve the quality of people s work lives But in the next decade or two there is likely to be a significant amount of technological innovation in machine intelligence and personal assistants that takes a real swipe out of the jobs we want humans to have in education health care transportation agriculture and public safety What are the new jobs we want these people to have If we haven t been able to invent them in response to international trade pacts why are we sure we will be able to create them in the future Richard Stallman Internet Hall of Fame member and president of the Free Software Foundation commented I think this question has no answer I think there won t be jobs for most people a few decades from now and that s what really matters As for the skills for the employed fraction of advanced countries I think they will be difficult to teach You could get better at them by practice but you couldn t study them much Jennifer Zickerman an entrepreneur commented The problem of future jobs is not one of skills training it is one of diminishing jobs How will we cope with a workforce that is simply irrelevant The question isn t how to train people for nonexistent jobs it s how to share the wealth in a world where we don t need most people to work Nathaniel BorensteinNathaniel Borenstein chief scientist at Mimecast replied I challenge the premise of this question that humans will have to be trained for future jobs The jobs of the future are likely to be performed by robots The question isn t how to train people for nonexistent jobs it s how to share the wealth in a world where we don t need most people to work Paul Davis a director based in Australia predicted Whilst such programs will be developed and rolled out on a large scale I question their overall effectiveness Algorithms automation and robotics will result in capital no longer needing labor to progress the economic agenda Labor becomes in many ways surplus to economic requirements This shift will dramatically transform the notion of economic growth and significantly disrupt social contracts labor s bargaining position will be dramatically weakened The nature of this change may require the world to shift to a Post Economic Growth model to avoid societal dislocation and disruption John Sniadowski a systems architect replied The skill sets which could have been taught will be superseded by AI and other robotic technology By the time the training programs are widely available the required skills will no longer be required The whole emphasis of training must now be directed towards personal life skills development rather than the traditional working career based approach There is also the massive sociological economic impact of general automation and AI that must be addressed to redistribute wealth and focus life skills at lifelong learning Tom Sommerville agile coach wrote Our greatest economic challenges over the next decade will be climate change and the wholesale loss of most jobs to automation We urgently need to explore how to distribute the increasing wealth of complex goods and services our civilization produces to a populace that will be increasingly jobless in the traditional sense The current trend of concentrating wealth in the hands of a diminishing number of ultra rich individuals is unsustainable All of this while dealing with the destabilizing effects of climate change and the adaptations necessary to mitigate its worst impacts Some of these experts projected further out into the future imagining a world where the machines themselves learn and overtake core human emotional and cognitive capacities Timothy C Mack managing principal at AAI Foresight said In the area of skill building the wild card is the degree to which machine learning begins to supplant social creative and emotive skill sets This section features responses by several more of the many top analysts who participated in this canvassing Following this wide ranging set of comments on the topic a much more expansive set of quotations directly tied to the set of four themes begins on Page 40 Baratunde Thurston a director s fellow at MIT Media Lab Fast Company columnist and former digital director of The Onion replied Online training and certification will grow significantly in part due to the high expense of formal higher education along with its declining payoffs for certain occupations Why go 100 000 in debt for a four year university when you can take a more targeted course with more guaranteed income generation potential at the end From the employer perspective this type of learning will only grow We are creating a system of on demand labor akin to cloud based labor where companies provision labor resources at will and release them at will not by the year or month but by the job labor unit or small time unit including minutes The automation of human labor will grow significantly And having a workforce trained in discrete and atomizable bits of skills will be seen as a benefit by employers This of course is a terrible soulless insecure life for the workers but since when did that really change anything There will also be a parallel call for benefits professional development and compensation that smooths out the rough patches in this on demand labor life but such efforts will lag behind the exploitation of said labor because big business has more resources and big tech moves too fast for human scale responses of accountability and responsibility To quote Donald Trump Sad Doc Searls journalist speaker and director of Project VRM at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society wrote I don t expect the evolution of work in the connected world to require new educational and training programs Instead I expect we ll see much more adaptive forms of education especially of the self made kind Look at Linux and open source development The world runs on both now and they employ millions of human beings Many or most of the new open source programmers building and running our world today are self taught or teach each other to a higher degree than they are educated by formal schooling Look at Khan Academy and the home schooling movement both of which in many ways outperform formal institutional education The main qualification for programming work isn t a degree It s proven capability This model for employment of self and others will also spread to other professions By the way I don t like the term job It demeans work and reduces the worker to a position in an org chart The great educator John Taylor Gatto who won many awards for his teaching and rarely obeyed curricular requirements says nearly all attempts to reform education make it worse We are by nature learning animals We are each also very different both from each other and from who we were yesterday As a society we need to take advantage of that and nurture our natural hunger for knowledge and productive work while respecting and encouraging our diversity a fundamental balancing feature of all nature human and otherwise Jeff Jarvis professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism wrote At a roundtable on the future convened by Union Square Ventures a few years ago I heard this economic goal presented We need to see the marginal cost of teaching another student fall to zero to see true innovation come to education allowing change to occur outside the tax based and thus safe confines of public education I don t think we ll ever reach zero MOOCs are not the solution But we will likely see a radical economic disruption in education using new tools and means to learn and certify learning and that is the way by which we will manage to train many more people in many new skills Cory Doctorow activist in residence at MIT Media Lab and co owner of Boing Boing boingboing net responded There is for the immediate and medium term a huge shortage of IT talent of course especially security researchers and professionals In part this is driven by the legal and educational framework that takes a zero tolerance approach to the hacking that kids historically engaged in on their way to becoming security researchers If a kid today hacks her school s censoring firewall to look at a blocked site she is expelled and possibly arrested not streamed into an Advanced Placement computer science class We also have a poorly constituted math curriculum for understanding algorithms which is really understanding the statistics of machine learning models An earlier and more enduring focus on stats and statistical literacy which can readily be taught using current affairs for example analyzing the poll numbers from elections the claims made by climate change scientists or even the excellent oral arguments in the Supreme Court Texas abortion law case would impart skills that transferred well into IT programming and especially security Amy Webb futurist and CEO at the Future Today Institute commented Gill Pratt a former program manager of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA recently warned of a Cambrian Explosion of robotics About 500 000 years ago Earth experienced its first Cambrian Explosion a period of rapid cellular evolution and diversification that resulted in the foundation of life as we know it today We are clearly in the dawn of a new age one that is marked not just by advanced machines but rather machines that are starting to learn how to think Soon those machines that can think will augment humankind helping to unlock our creative and industrial potential Some of the workforce will find itself displaced by automation That includes anyone whose primary job functions are transactional bank tellers drivers mortgage brokers However there are many fields that will begin to work alongside smart machines doctors journalists teachers The most important skill of any future worker will be adaptability This current Cambrian Explosion of machines will mean diversification in our systems our interfaces our code Workers who have the temperament and fortitude to quickly learn new menu screens who can find information quickly and the like will fare well I do not see the wide scale emergence of training programs during the next 10 years due to the emergence of smart machines alone If there are unanticipated external events environmental disasters new pandemics and the like that could devastate a country s economy and significantly impact its workforce which might catalyze the development of online learning opportunities Mike Roberts Internet Hall of Fame member and first president and CEO of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN responded MOOCs and related efforts are in their infancy so yes there will be considerable expansion as more is learned about what works and what doesn t work These developments are contributing to a crisis of self confidence in higher ed where traditional scholarship is being challenged on many fronts including the basic definition of education Human brains are complex and it becomes tiresome to see simplistic approaches to education issues Generally an educated person possesses a level of knowledge about the world that allows him or her to use analytical skills induction deduction probability etc to arrive at conclusions that guide behavior The jury is very much out on the extent to which acquisition of knowledge and reasoning skills requires human interaction We now have empirical evidence that a substantial percentage half or more can be gained through self study using computer assisted techniques The path forward for society as a whole is strewn with obstacles of self interest ignorance flawed economics etc If one believes in the singularity it doesn t matter because human machine symbiosis will bury the problem Judith Donath of Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society replied A lot has been written about the need for STEM science technology engineering and mathematics education Here I want to focus on other areas 1 Teaching and Healing As computers robots and other machines take over many jobs we need to reposition the social status of jobs that involve interpersonal care day care teachers nurse elderly coach The issue is not just training but cultural re evaluation of teaching and healing as highly respected skills While technology can assist with this work we mustn t lose sight of the importance of human connections as an end in and of themselves 2 Craft and Repair For the benefit of both the individual and the environment we need to strongly support learning design craft building repair Few of us make anything we use from the building we live in to the objects we own and these things are mostly manufactured as cheaply as possible to be easily bought discarded and bought again in a process of relentless acquisition that often brings little happiness Education here should be integrated into everyday life not just for when one is in school E g much rental housing is in bad repair with tenants waiting weeks months years for even simple fixes a running toilet broken lights a hole in a wall Very easily accessible learning for how to fix these things themselves and making it economically rewarding in the case of a common good is a simple basic example of the kind of ubiquitous craft learning that at scale would be enormously valuable Some of this can be taught online a key component is also online coordination 3 An Informed Citizen What should people know what skills should they have to be informed participants in a democracy Certainly science and technology are important but we need to refocus liberal education not ignore it History in all its complexity Critical thinking how to debate how to recognize persuasive techniques how to understand multiple perspectives how to mediate between different viewpoints Key skill how to research how to evaluate what you see and read David Weinberger a senior researcher at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society said Judging from what we re seeing happening now on the web it seems likely that many of the innovative platforms will be peer to peer Sites like Stack Overflow for software engineers demonstrate a new moral sense that learning in private is selfish Public learning is becoming the norm Brad Templeton chair for computing at Singularity University wrote We will see the start of these technologies but they will not be widespread at the hard problem of adult retraining in 10 years Instead most focus will be on childhood education for the poorer sectors of the world The most important skill flexibility won t be taught easily this way but must become a focus of K 12 education John Markoff former senior writer at The New York Times said We have now passed through the first generation of MOOCs and a new generation of online learning technology is beginning to emerge Udacity is a good example of the trajectory Sebastian Thrun was one of the inventors of the MOOC concept After starting a company to pursue the idea he pivoted focusing specifically on skill oriented education that is coupled directly to the job market Vint Cerf vice president and chief internet evangelist at Google and an Internet Hall of Fame member noted The internet can support remote training and learning These need not be MOOCs Even mobiles can be sources of education I hope we will see more opportunities arising for sharing this kind of knowledge Marcel Bullinga trend watcher and keynote speaker futurecheck replied The future is cheap and so is the future of education I saw an ad already for 1 000 bachelor s level training with an app of course Schools and universities will transform in the same way as shops have done in the past 10 years from analog human first to digital mobile AI first New online credential systems will first complement then gradually replace the old ones The skills of the future Those are the skills a robot cannot master yet Leadership design human meta communication critical thinking motivating cooperating innovating In my black and white moments I say Skip all knowledge training in high schools Main teaching goal We enable you to survive in an ever changing world with ever changing skills and not yet existing jobs of the future We make you better than a robot We let you cooperate with robots We build your self trust We turn you into a decent polite social person And most importantly we do not mix education with religion never Anil Dash entrepreneur technologist and advocate AnilDash predicted These credentials will start to become widespread but acceptance and quality of the training programs will map to the existing systemic biases that inform current educational and career programs Henning Schulzrinne Internet Hall of Fame member and professor at Columbia University wrote Training programs have had the problem that short duration generic programs are often not very effective except as a way to incrementally add very specific skills learn how to operate the new industry specific tool X in a week to the existing repertoire The subject matter specific part of a B S degree in a technical or scientific field takes at least two years often more and these are high intensity full time years often without other responsibilities such as family mostly for students at an age where learning is still natural and easy A large part of this time is spent not in a classroom but becoming fluent through monitored practice including group work internships and other high intensity high interaction apprentice like programs It is hard to see how workers can afford to spend two years without income support while still fulfilling their adult responsibilities such as taking care of their family or elderly parents There are possibilities for adding limited skill sets to otherwise qualified workers e g the ability to program in Python for somebody who already has an economics degree increasing their ability to get their work done The MOOC style programs have shown themselves to be most effective for this delta learning for practicing professionals not turning a high school graduate into somebody who can compete with a college graduate Jamais Cascio distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future responded We will certainly see attempts to devise training and education to match workers to new jobs but for the most part they re likely to fall victim to two related problems 1 The difficulty of projecting what will be the jobs of the future in a world where the targets keep shifting faster and faster Jobs that seem viable may fall victim to a surprising development in automation see for example filmmaking new categories of work may not last long enough to support large numbers of employees 2 We re in an era of general purpose computing which means that our systems are not physically or procedurally limited to a narrow type of work Automation and semi automation e g self checkout stands don t need to completely eliminate a job to make it unable to support large numbers of workers As learning systems improve we will soon if we re not already be at a point where adaptive algorithms can learn new jobs faster than humans Kate Crawford a well known internet researcher studying how people engage with networked technologies wrote We clearly need new educational and training programs to address the deepening precarity of the labor market But to make it successful in that the right training could be developed to make it possible that everyone will have jobs is very unlikely Paul Jones clinical professor and director at the University of North Carolina replied We learn more today by training and information sipping than in the past Training is useful but not the end of education only a kind of education As for sipping you need not know the name of every bear to know you should avoid bears Yet the continual construction of knowledge and cultures requires more from us So far training formally as in Kahn Academy and Lynda com are unarguably effective for continual updates for basic skills No programmer or developer could keep up without the informal training of Stack Overflow Wikipedia hasn t destroyed bar trivia but it has made a dent in our conversational expertise Who played guitar lead on All or Nothing No need for debate A little information sip will let us know We re fine and informed but not educated or learned But what is left out Collaborative construction of knowledge in new areas deeper investigation into known areas and the discovery of entirely new areas of knowledge This is our challenge how to create wisdom from knowledge not just jobs from training and information Bob Frankston internet pioneer and software innovator commented This is a nuanced question We trained generations of people to be phone operators by making it easy to operate the phone aka dialing Today programming is increasingly become a trade The problem with many websites is not so much the training of the programmers as much as getting managers and C level people who understand the new concepts of a world being redefined by software And that s even more true for policymakers We need to think about co evolving work and workers And as always critical thinking will remain the biggest challenge Frank Pasquale author of The Black Box Society The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information and professor of law at the University of Maryland said The biggest danger for the United States educational system is premature vocationalism Rigorous science and humanities courses help students learn how to learn Skills training all too often does not Of course it can complement core academic courses and is likely to be part of a lifetime of learning for those switching occupations But turning high school and college into narrow vocational education programs would make their graduates more vulnerable to robotic replacement not less We need to invest in higher education shoring up support for traditional universities and colleges lest they eventually become bastions for reproduction of an elite leaving the rest of society to untested experiments or online programs Online learning is a good complement for existing colleges but cannot replace them Online only programs emphasize the upside of high tech approaches but rarely grapple with the downside Big data surveillance will track the work students do ostensibly in order to customize learning Get stuck on a lesson Just keep interfacing with a keyboard camera and perhaps haptic sensors Or perhaps IM some reserve army of tutorial labor via digital labor platforms like Mechanical Turk or TaskRabbit Want to prove you aren t faking exams Just let cameras record your every move and keystroke perhaps your eye movements and facial expressions too With new platforms Silicon Valley has lured some universities into giving away lectures for free The colleges think they re establishing good karma with the public but disrupters hope for a more chaotic endgame students deciding to watch free courses then proving their credentials to certifiers who give out badges to signify competence in a skill set The certifiers most likely won t be burdened with any of the teaching research community service counseling career or otherwise recreation social events extracurriculars or other long standing features of residential university communities They will just verify that student X can do task Y It could be a very profitable business If students pay less for actual instruction by experts they have more money to spend on badges This is the for profit model shift money away from instruction and amenities and toward administrator salaries and marketing Unburdened by legacy staff and faculty ed tech firms could muster a just in time workforce to develop new educational technologies Investors could continue unbundling the university into least cost providers of content units student surveillance and badge granting That vision may draw capital but it probably won t be attractive to many students There are serious worries about rapid centralization and reuse of student data by under regulated firms For instance black boxed instructional technology is often run by algorithms that can t be accessed by the students it is assessing Tom Ryan CEO of eLearn Institute Inc responded The degree and perhaps the prestige of the institution gets you the first interview but it is your ability to do good work that keeps the job and move s you to the next level How individuals develop the skills will be less important than having the skills As mastery learning evolves so will our performance based assessment systems providing universities and businesses a greater set of evidence and qualifications then is currently available Our traditional educational systems are burdened by legacy bureaucratic practices that don t contribute to mastery of learning and distract from great teaching and learning People in rural areas don t have physical access to a higher education campus or highly skilled trainers Current job responsibilities don t allow flexible work schedules to seek skills to improve their position K 12 teachers are constantly pulled from class time with students for professional development or during class are required to take attendance complete grade assessments fill out grade checks practice fire drills all degrading quality teaching time If online systems just removed these barriers they would be a great benefit but there is so much more these systems can offer Many of the new skills necessary for jobs of the future require digital skills to be successful Too often education leaders and politicians make unilateral decisions about the interaction between teacher and learner instead of building and maintaining an environment for great teaching and learning to take place Large school systems can t scale major improvements in current systems without leveraging the tools that society and industry are using to transform their practice Barry Chudakov founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp replied One serious drawback to fast tracking needed educational and training programs the people who are creating the jobs of the future have so little time to reflect and gain perspective on the people they will need and how adding these people to their corporate culture changes that culture These entrepreneurs are so busy building technology infrastructures filing patents testing beta incarnations of ideas and processes not to mention navigating the thicket of regulations and restrictions that surround many emerging technologies and industries that they simply don t have time to look around and see the implications of the changes their companies are creating In the near future we will explode the notion of education as a rite of passage for youth happening within the walls of an institution Educational institutions will not disappear but they will change in ways that make them almost unrecognizable by today s models Just as Pokemon Go lifts people out of their chairs into real world environments to explore imaginary captures we will change learning from a passive to an active dynamic experience Three dynamics that will affect all learning and retraining efforts 1 Newer tools are changing our sense of identity 2 We are moving from the fixed point of view that the book gave us to a multiple simultaneous narrative of flow in a networked environment 3 Again since what we think is what we think through we are applying that logic of visual presentation to our presentation and sense of self The first skill needed to succeed in the workforce of the future will be the ability to understand manage and manipulate data Everyone in a technology based profession will need to be a quant quantitative analyst or keep up with the quants Because all human processes and activities can now be quantified and there is considerable exploration and technology development in the application of quantification to everything from our sleep patterns and shopping habits to our emotions and online behaviors many new and important business models are emerging from quantification and the learning algorithms that drive it The second and much more important skill needed to succeed in the workforce of the future will be the ability to find meaning and value in data combined with the problem condition or opportunity the data is outlining Said simply the greatest skill will be the ability to think through the cloud of facts data experience and strategic direction that products and services require Design thinking or visual thinking will be a critical part of managing a data driven world Data mining and management can be taught effectively Thinking problem solving reflection and visioning are difficult to teach at scale Elisabeth Gee professor at Arizona State University and author of What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy commented First many jobs of the future won t require workers with a lot of training Second degrees and credentials have been increasingly promoted by institutions more driven by profit than an interest in preparing students in any meaningful way for employment If the government doesn t step in to restrict such institutions we ll continue to see students graduate with huge debt and little prospect of decent employment Lastly we don t need large scale training of workers we need real education not job focused and opportunities for people to pursue diverse pathways for career development and lifelong learning Patrick Tucker technology editor at Defense One and author of The Naked Future observed Online education offers the opportunity to gather data on student performance continuously or telemetrically What telemetric education offers is the opportunity to continuously and constantly evaluate a student to gain a much more comprehensive understanding of ability retention of information even how other behaviors and factors such as time of day other calendar items nutrition amount of time on Pokemon Go influence learning It offers a more true moving score Learning will become easier and much more of it will happen outside of school settings all of which will diminish the importance of schools and teachers as we know them today But platforms like Coursera can amplify the talents of gifted and effective instructors and reduce the cost of education in the coming decade for all Some schools and colleges will thrive and prosper at a level not seen in their history But they will do so only by transitioning away from today s classroom model toward something else like data driven skills workshops at the high school level and startup incubators or problem solving workshops at the college level We may be conflicted about replacing classes with platforms but if we are to be honest with ourselves we know that we can t prepare coming generations for the challenges of a technological and globalized economy the same way we prepared previous generations to be factory workers The greatest thinker of the 21st century whoever he or she is will understand more about how she thinks and learns than any student in any previous generation and all before ever stepping foot inside a schoolhouse Imagine for a moment the power of knowing beforehand how well you would perform on a test Laura Matzen of Sandia National Laboratory and some of her colleagues have demonstrated that the brain s electrical activity detectable via electroencephalogram EEG predicts how well studied material has been incorporated into memory and thus how well a subject will perform on memory tests Telemetric education also offers the opportunity for everyone to raise his or her hand and be heard That opportunity doesn t come easily in a crowded classroom especially not for women or minority students many of whom feel that if they ask the wrong question or display ignorance they ll confirm some unflattering broadly held perception about their social group David Golumbia associate professor of digital studies at Virginia Commonwealth University commented As an educator I am completely unconvinced by the current rhetoric that says our educational system is unable to meet the needs of current or future workforces This whole argument is a sham meant to attack the fundamental purpose and basis of education Most empirical evidence shows that the premises of this question are incorrect most high skilled jobs of the sort implied here have an oversupply of qualified talent We need more of an emphasis on the fundamental purpose of education not on skills Stephen Downes researcher at the National Research Council of Canada commented We will see educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers because for the most part mechanisms will be in place that enable them to train themselves Within 10 years we should be beginning to see that the idea of providing training education or training is misguided because it s overly expensive and less effective than self managed learning I find it interesting even that the question itself presumes that skills must be taught Which of these skills can be taught effectively via online systems It s not that the skills are taught per se but rather that the skills are learned A wide range of activities may enable skills to be learned especially multidisciplinary skills such as critical thinking or social interaction without specifically teaching those skills There are very few skills that require specific and personal instruction from an expert to learn frankly I can t think of any which means that within 10 years we should at least be able to countenance the possibility that all or nearly all educational programs may be automated Of course they will continue to require the time and participation of the individual learner and in many cases social interaction with other learners but the labor intensive learning industry we have developed to this point will not be required I see no major objections to this argument 1 It may be argued that personal interaction is required in order to get to know a student and therefore anticipate what they need However in 10 years it will be arguable and probably demonstrable that your own computer networks will know you better than any individual instructor could even an instructor who worked with you your entire life Sure there are disasters like the Facebook news stream but people are already amazed at how much Google knows about them And we know that with enough data analytics can outperform humans even in complex tasks 2 It may be argued that personal interaction is required in order to evaluate a student s level of achievement Most actual assessment not to be confused with multiple choice tests in school or professional programs is based on expert recognition The submitted behavior an essay performance in surgery piloting an aircraft in a simulation is not assessed according to whether a set of indicators is achieved this would possibly be a necessary but never a sufficient condition The expert looks at the overall behavior and assesses whether that competency has been met The expert is serving as a proxy for the community at large With modern communications technology this proxy is no longer required Through the course of any given day as a person goes through various activities they interact with dozens of other people either in person or through online interaction Each person responds to them in some way not by testing them but by for example engaging them in conversation asking questions following advice etc These responses over time form a comprehensive and constantly changing assessment of the person An anonymous postdoctoral fellow at Rice University s Humanities Research Center observed So much has been said and challenged over the past three decades about online education I d like to answer this by asking a different set of questions which address recent developments in robotics and artificial intelligence How will autonomous factories in Chicago U S share what they ve learned with factories in Pingdingshan China What credentialing system will self driving cars require How will artificially intelligent laborers learn the skills needed to run a household business government institution or political organization When will universities allow artilect nonhuman artificial intelligence students to enroll in their traditional undergraduate and graduate degree programs and how would students learn the more ephemeral skills like critical thinking from a thinking machine

strong fiscal outlook is an essential foundation for a growing thriving economy Putting our nation on a sustainable fiscal path creates a positive environment for growth opportunity and prosperity With a strong fiscal foundation the nation will have increased access to capital more resources for future public and private investments improved consumer and business confidence and a stronger safety net However if we fail to act the opposite is also true If our long term fiscal challenges remain unaddressed our economic environment weakens as confidence suffers access to capital is reduced interest costs crowd out key investments in our future the conditions for growth deteriorate and our nation is put at greater risk of economic crisis If our long term fiscal imbalance is not addressed our future economy will be diminished with fewer economic opportunities for individuals and families and less fiscal flexibility to respond to future crises The following summarizes several of the negative ramifications of our growing debt Reduced Public Investment As the federal debt increases the government will spend more of its budget on interest costs increasingly crowding out public investments Over the next 10 years the Congressional Budget Office CBO estimates that interest costs will total 7 trillion under current law In just under a decade interest on the debt will be the third largest program in the federal budget and it is on pace to become the single largest by 2048 Interest costs however are not investments in programs that build our future Instead they are largely about the past And as more federal resources are diverted to interest payments fewer will be available to invest in areas that are important to economic growth Although interest rates are currently low we can t expect that situation to last forever As economic growth improves interest rates are likely to rise and the federal government s borrowing costs are projected to increase markedly By 2048 CBO projects that interest costs alone could be more than twice what the federal government has historically spent on R D nondefense infrastructure and education combined Reduced Private Investment Federal borrowing competes for funds in the nation s capital markets thereby raising interest rates and crowding out new investment in business equipment and structures Entrepreneurs face a higher cost of capital potentially stifling innovation and slowing the advancement of new breakthroughs that could improve our lives At some point investors might begin to doubt the government s ability to repay debt and could demand even higher interest rates further raising the cost of borrowing for businesses and households Over time lower confidence and reduced investment would slow the growth of productivity and wages of American workers Fewer Economic Opportunities for Americans Growing debt also has a direct real world effect on the economic opportunities available to every American Based on data provided by CBO in its report The Deficit Reductions Necessary to Meet Various Targets for Federal Debt the real inflation adjusted income for a 4 person family could be reduced by as much as 16 000 on average by 2048 as a result of rising federal debt That amount would represent a four percent loss of income compared to incomes if the debt is stabilized In addition the debt negatively impacts economic opportunity and social mobility because it crowds out investments that help Americans get ahead Higher interest rates make it harder for families to buy homes finance car payments or pay for college Fewer education and training opportunities would leave workers without the skills to keep up with the demands of a more technology based global economy Faltering support for research and development would make it harder for American businesses to remain on the cutting edge of innovation and would hurt wage growth in the U S Slower economic growth generally would also make our fiscal challenges even worse as lower incomes lead to smaller tax collections and put the federal budget further out of balance Vital safety net programs would come under even greater budgetary pressure threatening support for those who need them most Reduced Fiscal Flexibility High levels of debt also reduce our government s flexibility to respond to future emergencies unanticipated challenges wars or recessions Indeed one reason why the United States was able to recover from the Great Recession more quickly than other countries was because our debt was fairly low at 35 percent of GDP before the financial crisis began As a result U S policymakers had considerable flexibility in addressing the crisis If debt had been significantly higher at the start of the crisis as it is now it would have been difficult to respond Similarly the United States had the fiscal wherewithal to meet the considerable demands of fighting World War II because debt was relatively low before the war Key Drivers of the DebtBudget 101 The basics of the federal budget Read MoreRead MoreSign Up for Our Newsletter Connect with us to stay up to date on news and information about the fiscal and

growth in developed economies has been stagnating The most prominent explanations of this trend involve technology Technological progress is supposed to increase economies productivity and potential growth So what s going on Harvard s Martin Feldstein has argued persuasively that productivity growth is actually higher than we realize because government statistics grossly understate the value of improvements in the quality of existing goods and services and don t even try to measure the full contribution of new goods and services Over time he asserts these measurement errors are probably becoming more important Northwestern University s Robert Gordon is less optimistic He has argued also persuasively that today s innovations in areas like information and communications technology ICT cannot be expected to have as big an economic payoff as those of the past such as electricity and the automobile But it s possible that ICT and other new technologies are not just doing less to boost productivity than past innovations they may actually have some negative side effects that undermine productivity and GDP growth One need not be a modern day Luddite to acknowledge the potential productivity pitfalls of technological innovation The first might seem obvious technological disruption is well disruptive It demands that people learn new skills adapt to new systems and change their behavior While a new iteration of computer software or hardware may offer more capacity efficiency or performance those advantages are at least partly offset by the time users have to spend learning to use it And glitches often bedevil the transition 1The fast changing nature of today s digital technologies also raises security challenges Spam viruses cyberattacks and other kinds of security breaches can impose major costs on businesses and households Then there is the impact that connectivity has on our daily lives including our ability to work and learn Non work emails social media Internet videos and videogames can easily distract employees offsetting at least some of the productivity raising potential of that same connectivity Such disadvantages may become even more pronounced when workers telecommute Similarly the smart phone has shaped the minds of young people who barely remember what it was like before addictive activities from video games to social media were constantly at their fingertips According to one recent study recreational computer activities partly explain a decline in labor supply among men ages 21 to 30 Moreover research shows that laptops in the classroom slow student learning even when used to take notes rather than surf the web Moreover smart phones undermine physical safety in some contexts In the United States the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that 3 477 people were killed and 391 000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers in 2015 with texting being the biggest culprit particularly among young people Digital currencies like Bitcoin have also so far failed to live up to the hypesurrounding them Far from being more efficient as a means of payment or store of value than conventional money cryptocurrencies seem to encourage the diversion of resources away from productive uses They also harm the environment owing to the energy intensive mining process while the total anonymity they offer undermines law enforcement Beyond new technologies direct and indirect negative effects on productivity there is a risk that they are undermining people s quality of life Few people have positive feelings about say the automatic phone calls that have come to plague many of our lives Then there is the ever present fake news problem The advent of digital new media was once heralded as a democratizing trend that would give ordinary people a measure of control over the air waves at the expense of big companies or established institutions But it has lately become apparent that democratizing information may not actually be good for democracy For example fake news has been found to spread faster on Twitter than true news This has not only made citizens less informed in many cases it has also enabled public figures most notably US President Donald Trump to dismiss the truth as fake And these are just the downsides of information technology Other technological innovations with major obvious drawbacks include opiate painkillers and increasingly advanced weaponry To be clear I am not suggesting that the net effects of recent technological advances are negative On the contrary many have delivered huge benefits and that will probably continue to be the case Technologies may have productivity raising potential that is yet to be tapped Historians like Paul David and technology experts like Erik Brynjolfsson Daniel Rock and Chad Syverson argue that it has always taken time for major breakthroughs like the steam engine electricity or the automobile to yield net economic gains because businesses buildings and infrastructure need to be re configured Presumably the same will happen with recent technologies But this is not a reason to ignore the negative consequences of new innovations As a group of Silicon Valley technologists has warned Technology is hijacking our minds and society We must take back control ensuring that we do not just make our world smarter but also make sure we are smart about how we use it Written byJeffrey Frankel Professor Kennedy School of Government Harvard UniversityThis article is published in collaboration with Project Syndicate The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum NBER Working Paper No 19895 Issued in February 2014 NBER Program s Development of the American Economy Economic Fluctuations and Growth Productivity Innovation and EntrepreneurshipThe United States achieved a 2 0 percent average annual growth rate of real GDP per capita between 1891 and 2007 This paper predicts that growth in the 25 to 40 years after 2007 will be much slower particularly for the great majority of the population Future growth will be 1 3 percent per annum for labor productivity in the total economy 0 9 percent for output per capita 0 4 percent for real income per capita of the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution and 0 2 percent for the real disposable income of that group The primary cause of this growth slowdown is a set of four headwinds all of them widely recognized and uncontroversial Demographic shifts will reduce hours worked per capita due not just to the retirement of the baby boom generation but also as a result of an exit from the labor force both of youth and prime age adults Educational attainment a central driver of growth over the past century stagnates at a plateau as the U S sinks lower in the world league tables of high school and college completion rates Inequality continues to increase resulting in real income growth for the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution that is fully half a point per year below the average growth of all incomes A projected long term increase in the ratio of debt to GDP at all levels of government will inevitably lead to more rapid growth in tax revenues and or slower growth in transfer payments at some point within the next several decades There is no need to forecast any slowdown in the pace of future innovation for this gloomy forecast to come true because that slowdown already occurred four decades ago In the eight decades before 1972 labor productivity grew at an average rate 0 8 percent per year faster than in the four decades since 1972 While no forecast of a future slowdown of innovation is needed skepticism is offered here particularly about the techno optimists who currently believe that we are at a point of inflection leading to faster technological change The paper offers several historical examples showing that the future of technology can be forecast 50 or even 100 years in advance and assesses widely discussed innovations anticipated to occur over the next few decades including medical research small robots 3

jobs of the future tested public servants tech savviness global awareness and aptitude for collaboration and innovation Backed by two years of research it s part of an ongoing effort to understand the readiness of the world s civil servants for the coming digital revolution which is expected to eliminate 77 of administration and operations roles by 2030 Even if your result was The Luddite or Old School there s still time to learn about the technologies and disciplines that will be essential to getting things done in the public service of the future We ve isolated the most important trends here this is why they matter how governments can use them and the best online resources to learn them yourself Big data once a tool reserved for statisticians and intelligence personnel is now indispensable to the functioning of government With it public servants can use evidence to drive decision making rather than guesswork In the private sector a strong linkbetween effective data use and better financial performance has been established but much of government data still lives on paper or in old fashioned systems This coupled with a tendency to treat data analysis as an afterthought when crafting policy prevents governments from reaping its benefits Of course every civil servant need not be a data scientist but they should appreciate its potential to improve the lives of citizens help services function more efficiently and cut costs In the future of work all public servants will deal with data in service delivery which means overcoming a misconception of big data as amorphous and overwhelming Public servants should come to see it as a tool to help government do more for their citizens with less which in this era of shrinking budgets and growing technological innovation is crucial At a time when there is an urgent need to improve the efficiency of public services data analytics has huge potential Eddie Copeland NestaHow to use it Estonia saves more than 2 8 million hours of labour every year through a data exchange network that helped it digitise 99 of government services The system lets citizens pay their taxes in five minutes and incorporate companies in under

courses like Open data in a day for government and Managing risk with open data Coursera has a John Hopkins University sanctioned Launch your career in data science class Datacamp teaches data science skills like R SQL and python Dataquest offers beginner intermediate and expert level courses in data analysis and prediction General Assembly has a number of courses in data science and analysis In the US just 27 of citizens are happy with government s digital services Constituents want to interact with government more easily and governments leading the charge in bringing services online are using artificial intelligence AI to do so With AI systems learn from experience and keep improving their performance without humans having to explain how to complete tasks A prime example of this is chatbots virtual assistants that field questions from constituents who would normally have to call a public office or help desk Chatbots which learn from the questions they are asked to continually improve performance help governments serve constituents better and free up public servants time for higher value jobs AI has the potential to rid humans of monotonous work administrative tasks like data sorting filing and searching documents translating materials and drafting briefs among others saving federal governments up to 1 2 billion hu man hours and 41 1 billion annually City officials only work during the day 8am to 5pm Chatbots work 24 7 Ryan Johnson City of North CharlestonHow to use it Governments in the US Singapore and Jersey use chatbots to help citizens cut through

offers a beginner s guide to artificial intelligence machine learning and cognitive computing Policymakers are often accused of losing sight of the challenges everyday people face Design thinking is a way for governments to leverage the philosophy of user centric companies like Apple which puts customer experience at the centre of product design to solve problems and shape policy Design thinking puts end citizens at the centre of policy formulation in the iterative process public servants form theories about what constituents want by observing them prototype a product or service then test it out on real people This form of empathetic hands on policymaking helps government build services in concert with citizens to meet their needs rather than relying on detached experts The collaborative approach encourages public servants to break out of departmental siloes and tap into more risky innovative service design It s quite messy doing design work But the old ways of thinking just aren t working anymore Sarah Hurcombe the Australian Centre for Social InnovationHow to use it Denmark used design thinking to reorganise waste management in Copenahagen reduce tension between inmates and guards in prisons and transform services for mentally disabled adults in Odense Singapore has redesigned its employment centres to make them calm and easily navigable for stressed job seekers West

additional 100 000 organ donors a year doubled the number of army applicants and helped collect an additional 40 million a year from taxpayers Nudge units use empirical evidence to anticipate how people will react to policy options rather than assuming their response will be rational They have spread to governments across the world including Guatemala the US Australia Germany and Singapore but the use of behavioural insights is still nascent In the future it is expected to have a significant impact on solving problems that stem from ingrained or unconscious bias like gender inequality It s hard for government to admit that something it s doing might not work or that it s failed People are often running blind David Halpern UK Nudge UnitHow to use it The UK Australia and Singapore use a

Sat 12 Jan 2013 05 26 ESTThe cultural shift in the perception of local government When I was a civil servant sometimes you got the impression that one or two people thought they were a cut above local government staff The experience of the last few years including Sir Bob Kerslake s appointment to the head of the home civil service shows that such an attitude was based more on ignorance than reality Employ people with commercial experience At a time when councils are thinking about trading services commissioning services from an increasingly diverse range of providers releasing value from assets in all kinds of different ways etc commercial skills have never been more important The resignation of Norfolk county council s chief executive as he believed that he didn t have enough commercial skills and experience for the council s future direction emphasises the point Personal development should be continuous and encouraged It is important for those working within the public sector to have the attitude to strive to develop themselves to work to develop skill sets that can be utilised in many different work environments across the organisation Developing a portfolio of skills will enable greater innovation to solve tomorrow s problems Design a local government placement year This would have modules in public policy for degree programmes that are traditionally not industry based and would strengthen links between universities and local authorities Working in local government is exciting but challenging When we talk to prospective graduates who are interested in the NGDP we stress that we are looking for people with the ability to understand and help shape local communities It is about impacting on real lives through real jobs to make a difference hence the NGDP strapline Staff need to be supported to change There needs to be a balance between attracting the right behaviours to the sector and supporting those employees already in the sector who are struggling with the changing local government world Predicting future trends It s a question of what are the skills going to be and that enters a world of specifics around certain services and ultimately what role a local council needs to perform for its community Clearly as the population changes and there is a greater demand for services for older people we will need more skills in this area As councils strive to balance budgets and change the financial landscape of the business they are in we will see a shift towards valuing more technical skills in areas like commissioning procurement contracts asset management and drive for more innovative ways of doing business Mobile working will become more common The challenge of the new work landscape is that market forces have provided a mighty nudge to a process that was already emerging more people working flexibly changing directions and employers beginning to take more control over their working lives This is likely to encouraged as it is cheaper for employers to have a mobile workforce at the cost of organisational memory It is not an approach that everyone will embrace wholeheartedly but this is what our immediate working future holds and the challenge for each of us is to adapt and continue to do so Staff development is as important as saving money There is naturally a focus on downsizing and dealing with the nuts and bolts of delivering the financial challenge but that doesn t mean we can take our eye off the ball for the next five years and the skills we will need We ve lost some of our pride in local government There s so much in the press about public sector workers and it s hard not to get downtrodden and disengaged with the constant downsizing and savings The survivors are still delivering a good service with less people and less resources they care passionately about the service they deliver so there is a lot to celebrate and to shout about It s almost like we need a co ordinated approach to reinvigorating our brand so that we are attractive to talented people at all levels of their career Forget career routes and focus on attitude We do need to be sharper in moving on in a supportive way those colleagues who do not have either the desire or flexibility required to change or develop new skills We do still recruit too often on technical expertise rather than behaviour and attitude This is where the emphasis needs to be Look beyond qualifications I have just recruited a range of graduates to join the HR team at East Sussex council from a range of specialisms biology marine science statistics philosophy to name a few At entry level I am more interested in the attitude of an applicant rather than their technical knowledge I can always train colleagues to achieve a knowledge skill far quicker and easier than attitude You can read the debate in full here This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional Join the local government network for more comment

disruption of jobs experts say a wider array of education and skills building programs will be created to meet new demands There are two uncertainties Will well prepared workers be able to keep up in the race with AI tools And will market capitalism survive By Lee Rainie and Janna AndersonMachines are eating humans jobs talents And it s not just about jobs that are repetitive and low skill Automation robotics algorithms and artificial intelligence AI in recent times have shown they can do equal or sometimes even better work than humans who are dermatologists insurance claims adjusters lawyers seismic testers in oil fields sports journalists and financial reporters crew members on guided missile destroyers hiring managers psychological testers retail salespeople and border patrol agents Moreover there is growing anxiety that technology developments on the near horizon will crush the jobs of the millions who drive cars and trucks analyze medical tests and data perform middle management chores dispense medicine trade stocks and evaluate markets fight on battlefields perform government functions and even replace those who program software that is the creators of algorithms People will create the jobs of the future not simply train for them and technology is already central It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead Jonathan GrudinMultiple studies have documented that massive numbers of jobs are at risk as programmed devices many of them smart autonomous systems continue their march into workplaces A recent study by labor economists found that one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment to population ratio by about 0 18 0 34 percentage points and wages by 0 25 0 5 percent When Pew Research Center and Elon University s Imagining the Internet Center asked experts in 2014 whether AI and robotics would create more jobs than they would destroy the verdict was evenly split 48 of the respondents envisioned a future where more jobs are lost than created while 52 said more jobs would be created than lost Since that expert canvassing the future of jobs has been at the top of the agenda at many major conferences globally Several policy and market based solutions have been promoted to address the loss of employment and wages forecast by technologists and economists A key idea emerging from many conversations including one of the lynchpin discussions at the World Economic Forum in 2016 is that changes in educational and learning environments are necessary to help people stay employable in the labor force of the future Among the six overall findings in a new 184 page report from the National Academies of Sciences the experts recommended The education system will need to adapt to prepare individuals for the changing labor market At the same time recent IT advances offer new and potentially more widely accessible ways to access education Jobholders themselves have internalized this insight A 2016 Pew Research Center survey The State of American Jobs found that 87 of workers believe it will be essential for them to get training and develop new job skills throughout their work life in order to keep up with changes in the workplace This survey noted that employment is much higher among jobs that require an average or above average level of preparation including education experience and job training average or above average interpersonal management and communication skills and higher levels of analytical skills such as critical thinking and computer skills A central question about the future then is whether formal and informal learning structures will evolve to meet the changing needs of people who wish to fulfill the workplace expectations of the future Pew Research Center and Elon s Imagining the Internet Center conducted a large scale canvassing of technologists scholars practitioners strategic thinkers and education leaders in the summer of 2016 asking them to weigh in on the likely future of workplace training Some 1 408 responded to the following question sharing their expectations about what is likely to evolve by 2026 In the next 10 years do you think we will see the emergence of new educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers in the skills they will need to perform the jobs of the future The nonscientific canvassing found that 70 of these particular respondents said yes such programs would emerge and be successful A majority among the 30 who said no generally do not believe adaptation in teaching environments will be sufficient to teach new skills at the scale that is necessary to help workers keep abreast of the tech changes that will upend millions of jobs See About this canvassing of experts for further details about the limits of this sample Participants were asked to explain their answers and offered the following prompts to consider Several common expectations were evident in these respondents answers no matter how hopeful or fretful they were about the future of skills and capabilities training efforts It is important to note that many respondents listed human behaviors attributes and competencies in describing desirable work skills Although these aspects of psychology cannot be classified as skills and perhaps cannot be directly taught in any sort of training environment we include these answers under the general heading of skills capabilities and attributes A diversifying education and credentialing ecosystem Most of these experts expect the education marketplace especially online learning platforms to continue to change in an effort to accommodate the widespread needs Some predict employers will step up their own efforts to train and retrain workers Many foresee a significant number of self teaching efforts by jobholders themselves as they take advantage of proliferating online opportunities Respondents see a new education and training ecosystem emerging in which some job preparation functions are performed by formal educational institutions in fairly traditional classroom settings some elements are offered online some are created by for profit firms some are free some exploit augmented and virtual reality elements and gaming sensibilities and a lot of real time learning takes place in formats that job seekers pursue on their own A considerable number of respondents to this canvassing focused on the likelihood that the best education programs will teach people how to be lifelong learners Accordingly some say alternative credentialing mechanisms will arise to assess and vouch for the skills people acquire along the way A focus on nurturing unique human skills that artificial intelligence AI and machines seem unable to replicate Many of these experts discussed in their responses the human talents they believe machines and automation may not be able to duplicate noting that these should be the skills developed and nurtured by education and training programs to prepare people to work successfully alongside AI These respondents suggest that workers of the future will learn to deeply cultivate and exploit creativity collaborative activity abstract and systems thinking complex communication and the ability to thrive in diverse environments One such comment came from Simon Gottschalk a professor in the department of sociology at the University of Nevada Las Vegas The skills necessary at the higher echelons will include especially the ability to efficiently network manage public relations display intercultural sensitivity marketing and generally what author Dan Goleman would call social and emotional intelligence This also includes creativity and just enough critical thinking to move outside the box Another example is the response of Fredric Litto a professor emeritus of communications and longtime distance learning expert from the University of S o Paulo We are now in the transitional stage of employers gradually reducing their prejudice in the hiring of those who studied at a distance and moving in favor of such graduates who in the workplace demonstrate greater proactiveness initiative discipline collaborativeness because they studied online Other respondents mentioned traits including leadership design thinking human meta communication deliberation conflict resolution and the capacity to motivate mobilize and innovate Still others spoke of more practical needs that could help workers in the medium term to work with data and algorithms to implement 3 D modeling and work with 3 D printers or to implement the newly emerging capabilities in artificial intelligence and augmented and virtual reality Jonathan Grudin principal researcher at Microsoft commented People will create the jobs of the future not simply train for them and technology is already central It will undoubtedly play a greater role in the years ahead Seriously You re asking about the workforce of the future As if there s going to be one Anonymous scientific editorAbout a third of respondents expressed no confidence in training and education evolving quickly enough to match demands by 2026 Some of the bleakest answers came from some of the most respected technology analysts For instance Jason Hong an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University wrote There are two major components needed for a new kind of training program at this scale political will and a proven technology platform Even assuming that the political will and budget existed there s no platform today that can successfully train large numbers of people MOOCs Massive Open Online Courses have a high dropout rate and have serious questions about quality of instruction They are also struggling with basic issues like identification of individuals taking the courses So in short we can train small numbers of individuals tens of thousands per year using today s community colleges and university systems but probably not more Several respondents argued that job training is not a primary concern at a time when accelerating change in market economies is creating massive economic divides that seem likely to leave many people behind An anonymous scientific editor commented Seriously You re asking about the workforce of the future As if there s going to be one Employers either run sweatshops abroad or hire people in the first world to do jobs that they hate while more and more unskilled and skilled people end up permanently on welfare or zero hour contracts And the relatively job secure qualified people who work in the professions are probably a lot closer than they think they are to going over that same cliff The details of how they earn their credentials aren t going to be an issue Most participants in this canvassing wrote detailed elaborations explaining their positions though they were allowed to respond anonymously Their well considered comments provide insights about hopeful and concerning trends These findings do not represent all possible points of view but they do reveal a wide range of striking observations Respondents collectively articulated five major themes that are introduced and briefly explained in the 29 page section below and then expanded upon in more detailed sections Some responses are lightly edited for style or due to length The following section presents a brief overview of the most evident themes extracted from the written responses including a small selection of representative quotes supporting each point Some responses are lightly edited for style or due to length These experts envision that the next decade will bring a more widely diversified world of education and training options in which various entities design and deliver different services to those who seek to learn They expect that some innovation will be aimed at emphasizing the development of human talents that machines cannot match and at helping humans partner with technology They say some parts of the ecosystem will concentrate on delivering real time learning to workers often in formats that are self taught Commonly occurring ideas among the responses in this category are collected below under headings reflecting subthemes Most experts seem to have faith that rapid technological development and a rising wariness of coming impacts of the AI robotics revolution are going to spur the public private and governmental actions needed for education and training systems to be adapted to deliver more flexible open adaptable resilient certifiable and useful lifelong learning Educators have always found new ways of training the next generation of students for the jobs of the future and this generation will be no different Justin ReichJim Hendler a professor of computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute predicted The nature of education will change to a mix of models College education which will still favor multi year residential education will need to be more focused on teaching students to be lifelong learners followed by more online content in situ training and other such elements to increase skills in a rapidly changing information world As automation puts increasing numbers of low and middle skill workers out of work these models will also provide for certifications and training needs to function in an increasingly automated service sector Michael Wollowski an associate professor of computer science at the Rose Hulman Institute of Technology commented We will definitely see a vast increase in educational and training programs We will also see what might be called on demand or on the job kind of training programs We kind of have to as with continued automation we will need to retrain a large portion of the workforce I strongly believe employers will subscribe to this idea wholeheartedly it increases the overall education of their workforce which benefits their bottom line Nevertheless I am a big believer in the college experience which I see as a way to learn what you are all about as a person and in your field of study The confidence in your own self and your abilities cannot be learned in a short course It takes life experience or four years at a tough college At a good college you are challenged to be your best this is very resource intensive and cannot be scaled at this time Justin Reich executive director at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT Teaching Systems Lab observed Educators have always found new ways of training the next generation of students for the jobs of the future and this generation will be no different Our established systems of job training primarily community colleges and state universities will continue to play a crucial role though catastrophically declining public support for these institutions will raise serious challenges David Karger a professor of computer science at MIT wrote Most of what we now call online learning is little more than glorified textbooks but the future is very promising No matter how good our online teaching systems become the current four year college model will remain dominant for quite some time Online teaching will increase the reach of the top universities which will put pressure on lesser universities to demonstrate value One potential future would be for those universities to abandon the idea that they have faculty teaching their own courses and instead consist entirely of a cadre of less well paid teaching assistants who provide support for the students who are taking courses online A few respondents said already established institutions cannot be as fully successful as new initiatives Jerry Michalski founder at REX commented Today s educational and training institutions are a shambles They take too long to teach impractical skills and knowledge not connected to the real world and when they try to tackle critical thinking for a longer time scale they mostly fail The sprouts of the next generation of learning tools are already visible Within the decade the new shoots will overtake the wilting vines and we will see all sorts of new initiatives mostly outside these schooling academic and training institutions which are mostly beyond repair People will shift to them because they work because they are far less expensive and because they are always available Barry Chudakov founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp says education has been liberated because thanks to digital innovation everyone can embed learning continuously in their everyday lives He wrote The key to education in the next 10 years will be the understanding that we now live in a world without walls and so the walls of the school physical and conceptual need to shatter and never go up again In the hopefully near future we will not segregate schooling from work and real world thinking and development They will seamlessly weave into a braid of learning realization exposure hands on experience and integration into students own lives And again the experience of being a student now confined to grade school secondary school and university will expand to include workers those looking for work and those who want or need to retrain as well as what we now think of as conventional education One way we will break down these walls we are already doing so will be to create digital learning spaces to rival classrooms as places where learning happen s Via simulation gaming digital presentations combined with hands on real world experience learning and re education will move out of books and into the world The more likely enhancement will be to take digital enhancements out into the world again breaking down the walls of the classroom and school to inform and enhance experience An anonymous respondent echoed the sentiment of quite a few others who do not think it is possible to advance and enhance online education and training much in the next decade writing These programs have a cost and too few are willing to sacrifice for these programs More such arguments are included in later sections of this report Some respondents expressed confidence in the best of current online education and training options saying online course options are cost effective evolving for the better and game changing because they are globally accessible Those with the most optimism expect great progress will be made in augmented reality AR virtual reality VR and AI While some say 2026 will still be early days for this tech many are excited about its prospects for enhancing learning in the next decade Already today there are quite effective online training and education systems but they are not being implemented to their full potential Edward FriedmanEdward Friedman professor emeritus of technology management at the Stevens Institute of Technology wrote Already today there are quite effective online training and education systems but they are not being implemented to their full potential These applications will become more widely used with familiarity that is gained during the next decade Also populations will be more tech savvy and be able to make use of these systems with greater personal ease In addition the development of virtual reality AI assistants and other technological advances will add to the effectiveness of these systems There will be a greater need for such systems as the needs for new expertise in the workforce increase and the capacity of traditional education systems proves that it is not capable of meeting the need in a cost effective manner The president of a technology LLC wrote Training teaching are all going online partly because of high costs of campus education Richard Adler distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future predicted AI voice response telepresence VR and gamification techniques will come together to create powerful new learning environments capable of personalizing and accelerating learning across a broad range of fields Ray Schroeder associate vice chancellor for online learning at the University of Illinois Springfield commented It is projected that those entering the workforce today will pursue four or five different careers not just jobs over their lifetime These career changes will require retooling training and education The adult learners will not be able to visit physical campuses to access this learning they will learn online I expect that we will see the further development of artificially intelligent teaching specialists such as Jill Watson at Georgia Tech the virtual graduate assistant who was thought to be human by an entire class of computer science students I anticipate the further development and distribution of holoportation technologies such as those developed by Microsoft using HoloLens for real time three dimensional augmented reality These teaching tools will enable highly sophisticated interactions and engagement with students at a distance They will further fuel the scaling of learning to reach even more massive online classes Fredric Litto an professor emeritus of communications and longtime distance learning expert from the University of S o Paulo replied There is no field of work that cannot be learned totally or in great part in well organized and administered online programs either in traditional course formats or in self directed independent learning opportunities supplemented when appropriate by face to face hands on practice situations Tawny Schlieski research director at Intel and president of the Oregon Story Board explained New technologies of human computer interaction like augmented and virtual reality offer the possibility of entirely new mechanisms of education Augmented and virtual reality tools make learning more experiential they engage students with physical movement and they enable interactive and responsive instructional assets As these tools evolve over the next decade the academics we work with expect to see radical change in training and workforce development which will roll into although probably against a longer timeline more traditional institutions of higher learning Many respondents said real world campus based higher education will continue to thrive during the next decade They generally expect that no other educational experience can match residential universities capabilities for fully immersive person to person learning as well as mentoring and socializing functions before 2026 They said a residential university education helps build intangible skills that are not replicable online and thus deepens the skills base of those who can afford to pay for such an education but they expect that job specific training will be managed by employers on the job and via novel approaches Some say major universities core online course content developed with all of the new tech bells and whistles will be marketed globally and adopted as baseline learning in smaller higher education locales where online elements from major MOOCs can be optimally paired in hybrid learning with in person mentoring activities The most important skills to have in life are gained through interpersonal experiences and the liberal arts Human bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion empathy vulnerability and social emotional intelligence Frank ElavskyUta Russmann communications marketing sales professor at the FHWien University of Applied Sciences in Vienna Austria said In the future more and more jobs will require highly sophisticated people whose skills cannot be trained in mass online programs Traditional four year and graduate programs will better prepare people for jobs in the future as such an education gives people a general understanding and knowledge about their field and here people learn how to approach new things ask questions and find answers deal with new situations etc all this is needed to adjust to ongoing changes in work life Special skills for a particular job will be learned on the job Frank Elavsky data and policy analyst at Acumen LLC responded The most important skills to have in life are gained through interpersonal experiences and the liberal arts Human bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion empathy vulnerability and social emotional intelligence These skills are imperative to focus on as the future is in danger of losing these skillsets from the workforce Many people have gained these skills throughout history without any kind of formal schooling but with the growing emphasis on virtual and digital mediums of production education and commerce people will have less and less exposure to other humans in person and other human perspectives Isto Huvila professor at Uppsala University replied The difference between educating to perform and educating to make the future is the difference between vocational education and higher university education Spending four years at a university is not only about learning skills but about bildung self cultivation and socialising in a group that is capable of fostering collaboration much better than an ad hoc group of people But this does not mean that alternative means and paths of learning and accreditation would not be useful as complementary to the traditional system that has limitations as well Dana Klisanin psychologist futurist at Evolutionary Guidance Media R D wrote Educational institutions that succeed will use the tools of social media and game design to grant students access to teachers from all over the world and increase their motivation to succeed Online educational programs will influence the credentialing systems of traditional institutions and online institutions will increasingly offer meet ups and mingles such that a true hybrid educational approach emerges Will training for skills most important in the jobs of the future work well in large scale settings by 2026 Respondents in this canvassing overwhelmingly said yes anticipating that improvements in such education would continue However many believe the most vital skills are not easy to teach learn or evaluate in any education or training setting available today Dozens of descriptive terms were applied by respondents as they noted the skills capabilities and attributes they see as important in workers lives in the next decade The skills needed to succeed in today s world and the future are curiosity creativity taking initiative multi disciplinary thinking and empathy These skills interestingly are the skills specific to human beings that machines and robots cannot do Tiffany ShlainWhile coding and other hard skills were listed as being easiest to teach to a large group in an online setting soft human skills were seen by most respondents as crucial for survival in the age of AI and robotics Devin Fidler research director at the Institute for the Future predicted As basic automation and machine learning move toward becoming commodities uniquely human skills will become more valuable There will be an increasing economic incentive to develop mass training that better unlocks this value Susan Price a digital architect at Continuum Analytics commented Increasingly machines will perform tasks they are better suited to perform than humans such as computation data analysis and logic Functions requiring emotional intelligence empathy compassion and creative judgment and discernment will expand and be increasingly valued in our culture Tiffany Shlain filmmaker and founder of the Webby Awards wrote The skills needed to succeed in today s world and the future are curiosity creativity taking initiative multi disciplinary thinking and empathy These skills interestingly are the skills specific to human beings that machines and robots cannot do and you can be taught to strengthen these skills through education I look forward to seeing innovative live and online programs that can teach these at scale Ben Shneiderman professor of computer science at the University of Maryland observed Students can be trained to be more innovative creative and active initiators of novel ideas Skills of writing speaking and making videos are important but fundamental skills of critical thinking community building teamwork deliberation dialogue and conflict resolution will be powerful A mindset of persistence and the necessary passion to succeed are also critical Louisa Heinrich founder at Superhuman Limited commented Lateral and system thinking skills are increasingly critical for success in an ever changing global landscape and these will need to be re prioritised at all levels of education An anonymous technologist commented Programming and problem solving learning how to work with artificial intelligence and robotics will become more important and more and more workers will be replaced by software hardware based workers Automation will reduce the need for the current workforce and the divide between the upper class and the lower class will continue to eat the middle class Some who are pessimistic about the future of human work due to advances in capable AI and robotics mocked the current push in the U S to train more people in technical skills An anonymous respondent commented Teach a billion people to program and you ll end up with 900 000 000 unemployed programmers An anonymous program director for a major U S technology funding organization predicted We will see training for the jobs of the past and for service jobs The jobs of the future will not need large numbers of workers with a fixed set of skills most things that we can train large numbers of workers for we will also be able to train computers to do better Among the many other skills mentioned were process oriented and system oriented thinking journalistic skills including research evaluation of multiple sources writing and speaking understanding algorithms computational thinking networking and programming grasping law and policy an evidence based way of looking at the world time management conflict resolution decision making locating information in the flood of data storytelling using data and influencing and consensus building A few people mentioned that young adults need to be taught how to have face to face interaction including one who said they seem to be sorely lacking in these skills and can only interact with a cellphone or laptop Because so many intricacies of the workplace the human soft and hard are learned on the job respondents said they expect apprenticeships and forms of mentoring will regain value and evolve along with the 21st century workplace D Yvette Wohn assistant professor of information systems at the New Jersey Institute of Technology wrote Formalized apprenticeships that require both technical skills and interpersonal interaction will become more important Ian O Byrne an assistant professor of literacy education at the College of Charleston replied In the future we ll see more opportunities for online personalized learning This will include open online learning experiences e g MOOCs where individuals can lurk and build up capacity or quench interests I also believe that we ll see a rise in the offering of premium or pay content that creates a space where one to one learning and interaction will allow mentors to guide learners while providing critical feedback We will identify opportunities to build a digital version of the apprenticeship learning models that have existed in the past Alternative credentials and digital badges will provide more granular opportunities to document and archive learning over time from traditional and nontraditional learning sources Through evolving technologies e g blockchain this may provide opportunities for learners to document and frame their own learning pathways An instructional designer with 19 years of experience commented The pattern I m seeing is toward individualized learning almost on the level of tutoring or apprenticeship We ve seen again and again that the broader the audience focus the less the course seems to deliver As for what the skills of the future are they ll be specialized to their fields with a university degree assumed to be a certificate in the ability to learn more about a particular subject specialty You may get a degree in computer software development but the truth is that you still need to be taught how to write software for say the mortgage company or insurance company that hires you The key to the future will be flexibility and personal motivation to learn and tinker with new things As they anticipate the appearance of effective new learning environments and advances in digital accountability systems many of these experts believe fresh certification programs will be created to attest to workers participation in training programs and the mastery of skills Some predict that many more workers will begin using online and app based learning systems Charlie Firestone communications and society program executive director and vice president at The Aspen Institute replied There will be a move toward more precise and better credentialing for skills and competencies e g badging and similar techniques Employers will accept these more as they prove probative And online learning will be more prevalent even as an adjunct to formal classroom learning New industries such as green energy and telemedicine will increase new employment opportunities Despite all of these measures the loss of jobs from artificial intelligence and robotics will exceed any retraining program at least in the short run Sam Punnett research officer at TableRock Media wrote I suspect employers will recognize the new credentialing systems Particularly those certificates awarded for studies in emerging disciplines currently data science appears all the rage and those that reflect an upgrade of previously acquired skills Traditional credentials will continue to hold value but I believe they will be considered in light of a candidates perceived ability in learning how to learn The four year degree and subsequent graduate studies will continue to be less of a guaranty towards employment without work experience Certificates are being viewed more favourably and many universities are lagging in their connection between their pedagogies and working world requirements William J Ward a university communications professor DR4WARD commented Higher Education is doing a poor job of preparing students with the skills they need to succeed in the workforce Online and credentialing systems are more transparent and do a better job on delivering skills People with new types of credentialing systems are seen as more qualified than traditional four year and graduate programs Many workplaces place a higher value on real world work portfolios than they do on a degree or certification yet their hiring systems including AI bots programmed to scan resum s still use the commonly accepted credentials as a basis for interviewing candidates Some respondents hope to see change Schools today turn out widget makers who can make widgets all the same They are built on producing single right answers rather than creative solutions Jeff JarvisA software engineering and system administration professional commented The reliability of the traditional educational system is already being questioned in some fields it s considered common sense that certifications and degrees mean little and that a portfolio references and hands on interviews are much more important for assessing a candidate s ability The unfortunate reality is that many HR departments still post job listings saying degrees and certifications are required as a way of screening candidates Both of those cost a lot of money and neither mean a lot for a candidate s competence I hope this will change both job listings and quality of degrees certifications but don t see it happening soon Meryl Krieger career specialist at Indiana University Bloomington s Jacobs School replied Credentialing systems will involve portfolios as much as resum s resum s simply are too two dimensional to properly communicate someone s skillset Three dimensional materials in essence job reels that demonstrate expertise will be the ultimate demonstration of an individual worker s skills I see credentialing as a piece of a very complex set of criteria these will also incorporate an individual s ability to communicate and work with teams huge in employer requests for new employees which can more readily be documented and tracked through online portfolio tools than through traditional resume formats Thus the educational and training programs of the future will become in their best incarnations sophisticated combinations of classroom and hands on training programs The specific models will necessarily be responding to individual industry requirements Jeff Jarvis a professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism wrote Schools today turn out widget makers who can make widgets all the same They are built on producing single right answers rather than creative solutions They are built on an outmoded attention economy Pay us for 45 hours of your attention and we will certify your knowledge I believe that many not all areas of instruction should shift to competency based education in which the outcomes needed are made clear and students are given multiple paths to achieve those outcomes and they are certified not based on tests and grades but instead on portfolios of their work demonstrating their knowledge While the first three themes found among the responses to this canvassing were mostly hopeful about advances in education and training for 21st century jobs a large share of responses from top experts reflect a significant degree of pessimism for various reasons Some even say the future of jobs for humans is so baleful that capitalism may fail as an economic system The next themes and subthemes examine these responses A large share of respondents predicted that online formats for knowledge transfer will not advance significantly in the next decade The 30 who expressed pessimism were often deeply doubtful about the capabilities of current education systems to adapt to pivot to respond to new challenges as quickly as necessary Interestingly being able to adapt and respond to looming challenges was seen by nearly everyone in this canvassing as one of the most highly prized future capabilities these respondents especially agree that it is important and they say that our human institutions government business education are not adapting efficiently and are letting us down Many of them say that current K 12 or K 16 education programs are incapable of making adjustments within the next decade to serve the shifting needs of future jobs markets Among the other reasons listed by people who do not expect these kinds of transformative advances in job creation and job skill upgrading Some among the 70 of respondents who are mostly optimistic about the future of training for jobs also echoed one or more of the points above mentioning these tension points while hoping for the best Following are representative statements tied to these points and more from all respondents Thomas Claburn editor at large at Information Week wrote I m skeptical that educational and training programs can keep pace with technology Traditional models train people to equate what they do with who they are i e what do you want to be when you grow up rather than to acquire critical thinking and flexible skills and attitudes that fit a rapidly changing world Pamela RutledgeAndrew Walls managing vice president at Gartner wrote Barring a neuroscience advance that enables us to embed knowledge and skills directly into brain tissue and muscle formation there will be no quantum leap in our ability to up skill people Learning takes time and practice which means it requires money lots of money to significantly change the skill set of a large cohort B Remy Cross assistant professor of sociology Webster University commented Lacking a significant breakthrough in machine learning that could lead to further breakthroughs in adaptive responses by a fully online system it is too hard to adequately instruct large numbers of people in the kinds of soft skills that are anticipated as being in most demand As manufacturing and many labor intensive jobs move overseas or are fully mechanized we will see a bulge in service jobs These require good people skills something that is often hard to train online John Bell software developer and teacher at Dartmouth College replied Even today access to information is not the limiting factor in skills education for anyone who can go online While there have been generational gains in the developments of online communities a large scale educational experience either MOOC or on demand broadcasts will not be able to duplicate that Stowe Boyd managing director of Another Voice and a well known thinker on work futures discussed the intangibles of preparing humans to partner with AI and bot systems While we may see the creation and rollout of new training programs he observed it s unclear whether they will be able to retrain those displaced from traditional sorts of work to fit into the workforce of the near future Many of the skills that will be needed are more like personality characteristics like curiosity or social skills that require enculturation to take hold Individual training like programming or learning how to cook may not be what will be needed And employers may play less of a role especially as AI and bot augmented independent contracting may be the best path for many rather than a job Homesteading in exurbia may be the answer for many with forty acres and a bot as a political campaign slogan of 2024 Luis Miron a distinguished university professor and director of the Institute for Quality and Equity in Education at Loyola University in New Orleans wrote Bluntly speaking I have little confidence in the educational sector K 16 having the capacity and vision to offer high quality online educational programs capable of transforming the training needs of the wider society The most important skills are advanced critical thinking and knowledge of globalization affecting diverse societies culturally religiously and politically Pamela Rutledge director of the Media Psychology Research Center wrote The core assumptions driving educational content are not adapting as fast as the world is changing Traditional models train people to equate what they do with who they are i e what do you want to be when you grow up rather than to acquire critical thinking and flexible skills and attitudes that fit a rapidly changing world We have traditional institutions invested in learning as a supply side model rather than demand side that would create proactive self directed learners This bias impacts the entire process from educators to employers It is changing but beliefs are sticky and institutions are cumbersome bureaucracies that are slow to adapt New delivery systems for skills related to technology will be more readily accepted than traditional ones because they avoid much of the embedded bias Successful education models will begin developing mixed methods to leverage technology with traditional delivery and rewrite certification processes with practice relevant standards Justin Reich executive director at the MIT Teaching Systems Lab observed There will continue to be for profit actors in the sector and while some may offer choice and opportunity for students many others will be exploitative with a great er focus on extracting federal grants and burdening students with debt than actually educating students and creating new opportunities John Paine a business analyst commented The competing desires 1 to make educational activity available to all and 2 to monetize the bejeezus out of anything related to the internet will limit the effectiveness of any online learning systems in a more widespread context danah boyd founder of Data Society commented I have complete faith in the ability to identify job gaps and develop educational tools to address those gaps I have zero confidence in us having the political will to address the socio economic factors that are underpinning skill training For example companies won t pay for reskilling and we don t have the political power to tax them at the level needed for public investment in reskilling Furthermore we have serious geographic mismatches underlying discriminatory attitudes and limited opportunities for lower to mid level career advancement What s at stake are not simply skills gaps it s about how we want to architect labor benefits and social safety nets And right now we talk about needing to increase skills but that s not what employers care about It just sounds nice When computer science graduates from CUNY and Howard University can t get a job what s at stake is not skills training Among the future worker capabilities with the highest value in these respondents eyes are the ability to adapt or pivot and the motivation to up skill as needed Many respondents emphasized that the most crucial skill is that people have to learn how to learn and be self motivated to keep learning My biggest concern with self directed learning is that it requires a great deal of internal motivation And I am not confident that individuals will find their way David BersteinDavid Bernstein a former research director wrote The most important skills needed to succeed in the workplace will be flexibility and the ability to adapt and continuously learn My biggest concern with self directed learning is that it requires a great deal of internal motivation And I am not confident that individuals will find their way just as those who enter college today don t know what they want to be when they grow up often until after they graduate So everyone will still need some basic skills interpersonal communications basic arithmetic along with some general culture awareness so they can have that flexibility Any 3 year old can use their parent s smartphone or tablet without reading the manual What I worry about is how well they will adapt when they are 35 or 55 Calton Pu professor and junior chair in software at the Georgia Institute of Technology wrote The most important skill is a meta skill the ability to adapt to changes This ability to adapt is what distinguished Homo sapiens from other species through natural selection As the rate of technological innovation intensifies the workforce of the future will need to adapt to new technology and new markets The people who can adapt the best and fastest will win This view means that any given set of skills will become obsolete quickly as innovations change the various economic sectors precision agriculture manufacturing 4 0 precision medicine just to name a few Therefore the challenge is not only to teach skills but also how to adapt and learn new skills Whether the traditional programs or new programs will be better at teaching adaptive learning remains to be seen Cory Salveson learning systems and analytics lead at RSM US responded The nature of work today and in future is such that if people want to keep increasingly scarce well paying jobs they will need to educate themselves in an ongoing manner for their whole lives Some of these experts say those who aren t motivated to continue to learn and grow will be left behind Scott Amyx CEO of Amyx said online training is advancing and will continue to evolve but The education system is at an inflection point Many ambitious federal and state programs have fizzled to produce dismal to no statistical change in the caliber of K 12 education It s those less educated and less skilled who are most sensitive to technological displacement Online mediums and self directed approaches may be limited in effectiveness with certain labor segments unless supplemented by human coaching and support systems Beth Corzo Duchardt a professor at Muhlenberg College replied Self directed study is a variable that changes the alchemy of teaching and learning It is true that most online courses require self direction Indeed when I advise students I don t recommend that students take online courses unless they have demonstrated an aptitude for self direction But in person courses may also be self directed This works well for some students but not others Students who are self directed often have had a very good foundational education and supportive parents They have been taught to think critically and they know that the most important thing you can learn is how to learn And they are also are more likely to come from economic privilege So not only does the self direction factor pose a problem for teaching at scale the fact that a high degree of self direction may be required for successful completion of coursework towards the new workforce means that existing structures of inequality will be replicated in the future if we rely on these large scale programs Among the 30 of respondents who said they did not think things would turn out well in the future were those who said the trajectory of technology will overwhelm labor markets killing more jobs than it creates They foresee a society where AI programs and machines do most of the work and raise questions about people s sense of identity the socio economic divisions that already distress them their ability to pay for basic needs their ability to use the growing amount of leisure time constructively and the impact of all of this on economic systems It should also be noted that many among the 70 who expect positive change in the next decade also expressed some of these concerns The problem of future jobs is not one of skills training it is one of diminishing jobs How will we cope with a workforce that is simply irrelevant Jennifer ZickermanCory Doctorow activist in residence at MIT Media Lab and co owner of Boing Boing boingboing net responded It s an article of faith that automation begets more jobs than it displaces in the long run but this is a theory free observation based on previous automation booms The current automation is based on general purpose technologies machine learning Turing complete computers a universal network architecture that is equally optimized for all applications and there s good reason to believe that this will be more disruptive and create fewer new jobs than those that came before Glenn Ricart Internet Hall of Fame member and founder and chief technology officer of US Ignite said Up to the present time automation largely has been replacing physical drudgery and repetitive motion things that can and should improve the quality of people s work lives But in the next decade or two there is likely to be a significant amount of technological innovation in machine intelligence and personal assistants that takes a real swipe out of the jobs we want humans to have in education health care transportation agriculture and public safety What are the new jobs we want these people to have If we haven t been able to invent them in response to international trade pacts why are we sure we will be able to create them in the future Richard Stallman Internet Hall of Fame member and president of the Free Software Foundation commented I think this question has no answer I think there won t be jobs for most people a few decades from now and that s what really matters As for the skills for the employed fraction of advanced countries I think they will be difficult to teach You could get better at them by practice but you couldn t study them much Jennifer Zickerman an entrepreneur commented The problem of future jobs is not one of skills training it is one of diminishing jobs How will we cope with a workforce that is simply irrelevant The question isn t how to train people for nonexistent jobs it s how to share the wealth in a world where we don t need most people to work Nathaniel BorensteinNathaniel Borenstein chief scientist at Mimecast replied I challenge the premise of this question that humans will have to be trained for future jobs The jobs of the future are likely to be performed by robots The question isn t how to train people for nonexistent jobs it s how to share the wealth in a world where we don t need most people to work Paul Davis a director based in Australia predicted Whilst such programs will be developed and rolled out on a large scale I question their overall effectiveness Algorithms automation and robotics will result in capital no longer needing labor to progress the economic agenda Labor becomes in many ways surplus to economic requirements This shift will dramatically transform the notion of economic growth and significantly disrupt social contracts labor s bargaining position will be dramatically weakened The nature of this change may require the world to shift to a Post Economic Growth model to avoid societal dislocation and disruption John Sniadowski a systems architect replied The skill sets which could have been taught will be superseded by AI and other robotic technology By the time the training programs are widely available the required skills will no longer be required The whole emphasis of training must now be directed towards personal life skills development rather than the traditional working career based approach There is also the massive sociological economic impact of general automation and AI that must be addressed to redistribute wealth and focus life skills at lifelong learning Tom Sommerville agile coach wrote Our greatest economic challenges over the next decade will be climate change and the wholesale loss of most jobs to automation We urgently need to explore how to distribute the increasing wealth of complex goods and services our civilization produces to a populace that will be increasingly jobless in the traditional sense The current trend of concentrating wealth in the hands of a diminishing number of ultra rich individuals is unsustainable All of this while dealing with the destabilizing effects of climate change and the adaptations necessary to mitigate its worst impacts Some of these experts projected further out into the future imagining a world where the machines themselves learn and overtake core human emotional and cognitive capacities Timothy C Mack managing principal at AAI Foresight said In the area of skill building the wild card is the degree to which machine learning begins to supplant social creative and emotive skill sets This section features responses by several more of the many top analysts who participated in this canvassing Following this wide ranging set of comments on the topic a much more expansive set of quotations directly tied to the set of four themes begins on Page 40 Baratunde Thurston a director s fellow at MIT Media Lab Fast Company columnist and former digital director of The Onion replied Online training and certification will grow significantly in part due to the high expense of formal higher education along with its declining payoffs for certain occupations Why go 100 000 in debt for a four year university when you can take a more targeted course with more guaranteed income generation potential at the end From the employer perspective this type of learning will only grow We are creating a system of on demand labor akin to cloud based labor where companies provision labor resources at will and release them at will not by the year or month but by the job labor unit or small time unit including minutes The automation of human labor will grow significantly And having a workforce trained in discrete and atomizable bits of skills will be seen as a benefit by employers This of course is a terrible soulless insecure life for the workers but since when did that really change anything There will also be a parallel call for benefits professional development and compensation that smooths out the rough patches in this on demand labor life but such efforts will lag behind the exploitation of said labor because big business has more resources and big tech moves too fast for human scale responses of accountability and responsibility To quote Donald Trump Sad Doc Searls journalist speaker and director of Project VRM at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society wrote I don t expect the evolution of work in the connected world to require new educational and training programs Instead I expect we ll see much more adaptive forms of education especially of the self made kind Look at Linux and open source development The world runs on both now and they employ millions of human beings Many or most of the new open source programmers building and running our world today are self taught or teach each other to a higher degree than they are educated by formal schooling Look at Khan Academy and the home schooling movement both of which in many ways outperform formal institutional education The main qualification for programming work isn t a degree It s proven capability This model for employment of self and others will also spread to other professions By the way I don t like the term job It demeans work and reduces the worker to a position in an org chart The great educator John Taylor Gatto who won many awards for his teaching and rarely obeyed curricular requirements says nearly all attempts to reform education make it worse We are by nature learning animals We are each also very different both from each other and from who we were yesterday As a society we need to take advantage of that and nurture our natural hunger for knowledge and productive work while respecting and encouraging our diversity a fundamental balancing feature of all nature human and otherwise Jeff Jarvis professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism wrote At a roundtable on the future convened by Union Square Ventures a few years ago I heard this economic goal presented We need to see the marginal cost of teaching another student fall to zero to see true innovation come to education allowing change to occur outside the tax based and thus safe confines of public education I don t think we ll ever reach zero MOOCs are not the solution But we will likely see a radical economic disruption in education using new tools and means to learn and certify learning and that is the way by which we will manage to train many more people in many new skills Cory Doctorow activist in residence at MIT Media Lab and co owner of Boing Boing boingboing net responded There is for the immediate and medium term a huge shortage of IT talent of course especially security researchers and professionals In part this is driven by the legal and educational framework that takes a zero tolerance approach to the hacking that kids historically engaged in on their way to becoming security researchers If a kid today hacks her school s censoring firewall to look at a blocked site she is expelled and possibly arrested not streamed into an Advanced Placement computer science class We also have a poorly constituted math curriculum for understanding algorithms which is really understanding the statistics of machine learning models An earlier and more enduring focus on stats and statistical literacy which can readily be taught using current affairs for example analyzing the poll numbers from elections the claims made by climate change scientists or even the excellent oral arguments in the Supreme Court Texas abortion law case would impart skills that transferred well into IT programming and especially security Amy Webb futurist and CEO at the Future Today Institute commented Gill Pratt a former program manager of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA recently warned of a Cambrian Explosion of robotics About 500 000 years ago Earth experienced its first Cambrian Explosion a period of rapid cellular evolution and diversification that resulted in the foundation of life as we know it today We are clearly in the dawn of a new age one that is marked not just by advanced machines but rather machines that are starting to learn how to think Soon those machines that can think will augment humankind helping to unlock our creative and industrial potential Some of the workforce will find itself displaced by automation That includes anyone whose primary job functions are transactional bank tellers drivers mortgage brokers However there are many fields that will begin to work alongside smart machines doctors journalists teachers The most important skill of any future worker will be adaptability This current Cambrian Explosion of machines will mean diversification in our systems our interfaces our code Workers who have the temperament and fortitude to quickly learn new menu screens who can find information quickly and the like will fare well I do not see the wide scale emergence of training programs during the next 10 years due to the emergence of smart machines alone If there are unanticipated external events environmental disasters new pandemics and the like that could devastate a country s economy and significantly impact its workforce which might catalyze the development of online learning opportunities Mike Roberts Internet Hall of Fame member and first president and CEO of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN responded MOOCs and related efforts are in their infancy so yes there will be considerable expansion as more is learned about what works and what doesn t work These developments are contributing to a crisis of self confidence in higher ed where traditional scholarship is being challenged on many fronts including the basic definition of education Human brains are complex and it becomes tiresome to see simplistic approaches to education issues Generally an educated person possesses a level of knowledge about the world that allows him or her to use analytical skills induction deduction probability etc to arrive at conclusions that guide behavior The jury is very much out on the extent to which acquisition of knowledge and reasoning skills requires human interaction We now have empirical evidence that a substantial percentage half or more can be gained through self study using computer assisted techniques The path forward for society as a whole is strewn with obstacles of self interest ignorance flawed economics etc If one believes in the singularity it doesn t matter because human machine symbiosis will bury the problem Judith Donath of Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society replied A lot has been written about the need for STEM science technology engineering and mathematics education Here I want to focus on other areas 1 Teaching and Healing As computers robots and other machines take over many jobs we need to reposition the social status of jobs that involve interpersonal care day care teachers nurse elderly coach The issue is not just training but cultural re evaluation of teaching and healing as highly respected skills While technology can assist with this work we mustn t lose sight of the importance of human connections as an end in and of themselves 2 Craft and Repair For the benefit of both the individual and the environment we need to strongly support learning design craft building repair Few of us make anything we use from the building we live in to the objects we own and these things are mostly manufactured as cheaply as possible to be easily bought discarded and bought again in a process of relentless acquisition that often brings little happiness Education here should be integrated into everyday life not just for when one is in school E g much rental housing is in bad repair with tenants waiting weeks months years for even simple fixes a running toilet broken lights a hole in a wall Very easily accessible learning for how to fix these things themselves and making it economically rewarding in the case of a common good is a simple basic example of the kind of ubiquitous craft learning that at scale would be enormously valuable Some of this can be taught online a key component is also online coordination 3 An Informed Citizen What should people know what skills should they have to be informed participants in a democracy Certainly science and technology are important but we need to refocus liberal education not ignore it History in all its complexity Critical thinking how to debate how to recognize persuasive techniques how to understand multiple perspectives how to mediate between different viewpoints Key skill how to research how to evaluate what you see and read David Weinberger a senior researcher at Harvard University s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society said Judging from what we re seeing happening now on the web it seems likely that many of the innovative platforms will be peer to peer Sites like Stack Overflow for software engineers demonstrate a new moral sense that learning in private is selfish Public learning is becoming the norm Brad Templeton chair for computing at Singularity University wrote We will see the start of these technologies but they will not be widespread at the hard problem of adult retraining in 10 years Instead most focus will be on childhood education for the poorer sectors of the world The most important skill flexibility won t be taught easily this way but must become a focus of K 12 education John Markoff former senior writer at The New York Times said We have now passed through the first generation of MOOCs and a new generation of online learning technology is beginning to emerge Udacity is a good example of the trajectory Sebastian Thrun was one of the inventors of the MOOC concept After starting a company to pursue the idea he pivoted focusing specifically on skill oriented education that is coupled directly to the job market Vint Cerf vice president and chief internet evangelist at Google and an Internet Hall of Fame member noted The internet can support remote training and learning These need not be MOOCs Even mobiles can be sources of education I hope we will see more opportunities arising for sharing this kind of knowledge Marcel Bullinga trend watcher and keynote speaker futurecheck replied The future is cheap and so is the future of education I saw an ad already for 1 000 bachelor s level training with an app of course Schools and universities will transform in the same way as shops have done in the past 10 years from analog human first to digital mobile AI first New online credential systems will first complement then gradually replace the old ones The skills of the future Those are the skills a robot cannot master yet Leadership design human meta communication critical thinking motivating cooperating innovating In my black and white moments I say Skip all knowledge training in high schools Main teaching goal We enable you to survive in an ever changing world with ever changing skills and not yet existing jobs of the future We make you better than a robot We let you cooperate with robots We build your self trust We turn you into a decent polite social person And most importantly we do not mix education with religion never Anil Dash entrepreneur technologist and advocate AnilDash predicted These credentials will start to become widespread but acceptance and quality of the training programs will map to the existing systemic biases that inform current educational and career programs Henning Schulzrinne Internet Hall of Fame member and professor at Columbia University wrote Training programs have had the problem that short duration generic programs are often not very effective except as a way to incrementally add very specific skills learn how to operate the new industry specific tool X in a week to the existing repertoire The subject matter specific part of a B S degree in a technical or scientific field takes at least two years often more and these are high intensity full time years often without other responsibilities such as family mostly for students at an age where learning is still natural and easy A large part of this time is spent not in a classroom but becoming fluent through monitored practice including group work internships and other high intensity high interaction apprentice like programs It is hard to see how workers can afford to spend two years without income support while still fulfilling their adult responsibilities such as taking care of their family or elderly parents There are possibilities for adding limited skill sets to otherwise qualified workers e g the ability to program in Python for somebody who already has an economics degree increasing their ability to get their work done The MOOC style programs have shown themselves to be most effective for this delta learning for practicing professionals not turning a high school graduate into somebody who can compete with a college graduate Jamais Cascio distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future responded We will certainly see attempts to devise training and education to match workers to new jobs but for the most part they re likely to fall victim to two related problems 1 The difficulty of projecting what will be the jobs of the future in a world where the targets keep shifting faster and faster Jobs that seem viable may fall victim to a surprising development in automation see for example filmmaking new categories of work may not last long enough to support large numbers of employees 2 We re in an era of general purpose computing which means that our systems are not physically or procedurally limited to a narrow type of work Automation and semi automation e g self checkout stands don t need to completely eliminate a job to make it unable to support large numbers of workers As learning systems improve we will soon if we re not already be at a point where adaptive algorithms can learn new jobs faster than humans Kate Crawford a well known internet researcher studying how people engage with networked technologies wrote We clearly need new educational and training programs to address the deepening precarity of the labor market But to make it successful in that the right training could be developed to make it possible that everyone will have jobs is very unlikely Paul Jones clinical professor and director at the University of North Carolina replied We learn more today by training and information sipping than in the past Training is useful but not the end of education only a kind of education As for sipping you need not know the name of every bear to know you should avoid bears Yet the continual construction of knowledge and cultures requires more from us So far training formally as in Kahn Academy and Lynda com are unarguably effective for continual updates for basic skills No programmer or developer could keep up without the informal training of Stack Overflow Wikipedia hasn t destroyed bar trivia but it has made a dent in our conversational expertise Who played guitar lead on All or Nothing No need for debate A little information sip will let us know We re fine and informed but not educated or learned But what is left out Collaborative construction of knowledge in new areas deeper investigation into known areas and the discovery of entirely new areas of knowledge This is our challenge how to create wisdom from knowledge not just jobs from training and information Bob Frankston internet pioneer and software innovator commented This is a nuanced question We trained generations of people to be phone operators by making it easy to operate the phone aka dialing Today programming is increasingly become a trade The problem with many websites is not so much the training of the programmers as much as getting managers and C level people who understand the new concepts of a world being redefined by software And that s even more true for policymakers We need to think about co evolving work and workers And as always critical thinking will remain the biggest challenge Frank Pasquale author of The Black Box Society The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information and professor of law at the University of Maryland said The biggest danger for the United States educational system is premature vocationalism Rigorous science and humanities courses help students learn how to learn Skills training all too often does not Of course it can complement core academic courses and is likely to be part of a lifetime of learning for those switching occupations But turning high school and college into narrow vocational education programs would make their graduates more vulnerable to robotic replacement not less We need to invest in higher education shoring up support for traditional universities and colleges lest they eventually become bastions for reproduction of an elite leaving the rest of society to untested experiments or online programs Online learning is a good complement for existing colleges but cannot replace them Online only programs emphasize the upside of high tech approaches but rarely grapple with the downside Big data surveillance will track the work students do ostensibly in order to customize learning Get stuck on a lesson Just keep interfacing with a keyboard camera and perhaps haptic sensors Or perhaps IM some reserve army of tutorial labor via digital labor platforms like Mechanical Turk or TaskRabbit Want to prove you aren t faking exams Just let cameras record your every move and keystroke perhaps your eye movements and facial expressions too With new platforms Silicon Valley has lured some universities into giving away lectures for free The colleges think they re establishing good karma with the public but disrupters hope for a more chaotic endgame students deciding to watch free courses then proving their credentials to certifiers who give out badges to signify competence in a skill set The certifiers most likely won t be burdened with any of the teaching research community service counseling career or otherwise recreation social events extracurriculars or other long standing features of residential university communities They will just verify that student X can do task Y It could be a very profitable business If students pay less for actual instruction by experts they have more money to spend on badges This is the for profit model shift money away from instruction and amenities and toward administrator salaries and marketing Unburdened by legacy staff and faculty ed tech firms could muster a just in time workforce to develop new educational technologies Investors could continue unbundling the university into least cost providers of content units student surveillance and badge granting That vision may draw capital but it probably won t be attractive to many students There are serious worries about rapid centralization and reuse of student data by under regulated firms For instance black boxed instructional technology is often run by algorithms that can t be accessed by the students it is assessing Tom Ryan CEO of eLearn Institute Inc responded The degree and perhaps the prestige of the institution gets you the first interview but it is your ability to do good work that keeps the job and move s you to the next level How individuals develop the skills will be less important than having the skills As mastery learning evolves so will our performance based assessment systems providing universities and businesses a greater set of evidence and qualifications then is currently available Our traditional educational systems are burdened by legacy bureaucratic practices that don t contribute to mastery of learning and distract from great teaching and learning People in rural areas don t have physical access to a higher education campus or highly skilled trainers Current job responsibilities don t allow flexible work schedules to seek skills to improve their position K 12 teachers are constantly pulled from class time with students for professional development or during class are required to take attendance complete grade assessments fill out grade checks practice fire drills all degrading quality teaching time If online systems just removed these barriers they would be a great benefit but there is so much more these systems can offer Many of the new skills necessary for jobs of the future require digital skills to be successful Too often education leaders and politicians make unilateral decisions about the interaction between teacher and learner instead of building and maintaining an environment for great teaching and learning to take place Large school systems can t scale major improvements in current systems without leveraging the tools that society and industry are using to transform their practice Barry Chudakov founder and principal at Sertain Research and StreamFuzion Corp replied One serious drawback to fast tracking needed educational and training programs the people who are creating the jobs of the future have so little time to reflect and gain perspective on the people they will need and how adding these people to their corporate culture changes that culture These entrepreneurs are so busy building technology infrastructures filing patents testing beta incarnations of ideas and processes not to mention navigating the thicket of regulations and restrictions that surround many emerging technologies and industries that they simply don t have time to look around and see the implications of the changes their companies are creating In the near future we will explode the notion of education as a rite of passage for youth happening within the walls of an institution Educational institutions will not disappear but they will change in ways that make them almost unrecognizable by today s models Just as Pokemon Go lifts people out of their chairs into real world environments to explore imaginary captures we will change learning from a passive to an active dynamic experience Three dynamics that will affect all learning and retraining efforts 1 Newer tools are changing our sense of identity 2 We are moving from the fixed point of view that the book gave us to a multiple simultaneous narrative of flow in a networked environment 3 Again since what we think is what we think through we are applying that logic of visual presentation to our presentation and sense of self The first skill needed to succeed in the workforce of the future will be the ability to understand manage and manipulate data Everyone in a technology based profession will need to be a quant quantitative analyst or keep up with the quants Because all human processes and activities can now be quantified and there is considerable exploration and technology development in the application of quantification to everything from our sleep patterns and shopping habits to our emotions and online behaviors many new and important business models are emerging from quantification and the learning algorithms that drive it The second and much more important skill needed to succeed in the workforce of the future will be the ability to find meaning and value in data combined with the problem condition or opportunity the data is outlining Said simply the greatest skill will be the ability to think through the cloud of facts data experience and strategic direction that products and services require Design thinking or visual thinking will be a critical part of managing a data driven world Data mining and management can be taught effectively Thinking problem solving reflection and visioning are difficult to teach at scale Elisabeth Gee professor at Arizona State University and author of What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy commented First many jobs of the future won t require workers with a lot of training Second degrees and credentials have been increasingly promoted by institutions more driven by profit than an interest in preparing students in any meaningful way for employment If the government doesn t step in to restrict such institutions we ll continue to see students graduate with huge debt and little prospect of decent employment Lastly we don t need large scale training of workers we need real education not job focused and opportunities for people to pursue diverse pathways for career development and lifelong learning Patrick Tucker technology editor at Defense One and author of The Naked Future observed Online education offers the opportunity to gather data on student performance continuously or telemetrically What telemetric education offers is the opportunity to continuously and constantly evaluate a student to gain a much more comprehensive understanding of ability retention of information even how other behaviors and factors such as time of day other calendar items nutrition amount of time on Pokemon Go influence learning It offers a more true moving score Learning will become easier and much more of it will happen outside of school settings all of which will diminish the importance of schools and teachers as we know them today But platforms like Coursera can amplify the talents of gifted and effective instructors and reduce the cost of education in the coming decade for all Some schools and colleges will thrive and prosper at a level not seen in their history But they will do so only by transitioning away from today s classroom model toward something else like data driven skills workshops at the high school level and startup incubators or problem solving workshops at the college level We may be conflicted about replacing classes with platforms but if we are to be honest with ourselves we know that we can t prepare coming generations for the challenges of a technological and globalized economy the same way we prepared previous generations to be factory workers The greatest thinker of the 21st century whoever he or she is will understand more about how she thinks and learns than any student in any previous generation and all before ever stepping foot inside a schoolhouse Imagine for a moment the power of knowing beforehand how well you would perform on a test Laura Matzen of Sandia National Laboratory and some of her colleagues have demonstrated that the brain s electrical activity detectable via electroencephalogram EEG predicts how well studied material has been incorporated into memory and thus how well a subject will perform on memory tests Telemetric education also offers the opportunity for everyone to raise his or her hand and be heard That opportunity doesn t come easily in a crowded classroom especially not for women or minority students many of whom feel that if they ask the wrong question or display ignorance they ll confirm some unflattering broadly held perception about their social group David Golumbia associate professor of digital studies at Virginia Commonwealth University commented As an educator I am completely unconvinced by the current rhetoric that says our educational system is unable to meet the needs of current or future workforces This whole argument is a sham meant to attack the fundamental purpose and basis of education Most empirical evidence shows that the premises of this question are incorrect most high skilled jobs of the sort implied here have an oversupply of qualified talent We need more of an emphasis on the fundamental purpose of education not on skills Stephen Downes researcher at the National Research Council of Canada commented We will see educational and training programs that can successfully train large numbers of workers because for the most part mechanisms will be in place that enable them to train themselves Within 10 years we should be beginning to see that the idea of providing training education or training is misguided because it s overly expensive and less effective than self managed learning I find it interesting even that the question itself presumes that skills must be taught Which of these skills can be taught effectively via online systems It s not that the skills are taught per se but rather that the skills are learned A wide range of activities may enable skills to be learned especially multidisciplinary skills such as critical thinking or social interaction without specifically teaching those skills There are very few skills that require specific and personal instruction from an expert to learn frankly I can t think of any which means that within 10 years we should at least be able to countenance the possibility that all or nearly all educational programs may be automated Of course they will continue to require the time and participation of the individual learner and in many cases social interaction with other learners but the labor intensive learning industry we have developed to this point will not be required I see no major objections to this argument 1 It may be argued that personal interaction is required in order to get to know a student and therefore anticipate what they need However in 10 years it will be arguable and probably demonstrable that your own computer networks will know you better than any individual instructor could even an instructor who worked with you your entire life Sure there are disasters like the Facebook news stream but people are already amazed at how much Google knows about them And we know that with enough data analytics can outperform humans even in complex tasks 2 It may be argued that personal interaction is required in order to evaluate a student s level of achievement Most actual assessment not to be confused with multiple choice tests in school or professional programs is based on expert recognition The submitted behavior an essay performance in surgery piloting an aircraft in a simulation is not assessed according to whether a set of indicators is achieved this would possibly be a necessary but never a sufficient condition The expert looks at the overall behavior and assesses whether that competency has been met The expert is serving as a proxy for the community at large With modern communications technology this proxy is no longer required Through the course of any given day as a person goes through various activities they interact with dozens of other people either in person or through online interaction Each person responds to them in some way not by testing them but by for example engaging them in conversation asking questions following advice etc These responses over time form a comprehensive and constantly changing assessment of the person An anonymous postdoctoral fellow at Rice University s Humanities Research Center observed So much has been said and challenged over the past three decades about online education I d like to answer this by asking a different set of questions which address recent developments in robotics and artificial intelligence How will autonomous factories in Chicago U S share what they ve learned with factories in Pingdingshan China What credentialing system will self driving cars require How will artificially intelligent laborers learn the skills needed to run a household business government institution or political organization When will universities allow artilect nonhuman artificial intelligence students to enroll in their traditional undergraduate and graduate degree programs and how would students learn the more ephemeral skills like critical thinking from a thinking machine

or looking for work has increased globally in the past five years Despite this growth employers across the globe report skills shortages across a multitude of industries While skilled migration is at an all time high according to Hays Global Skills Index digitization is raising questions about who will do the work of tomorrow and what it will look like Over the next 10 to 20 years nearly half of jobs are at risk of being automated particularly in areas such as transportation and logistics office and admin support and manufacturing As AI machine learning and IoT becomes commonplace in professional environments it s critical that people have the skills to respond to these changes in a positive and productive way With such significant gaps in the contemporary workforce governments are creating initiatives to tackle this growing skills shortage by linking education and business to cultivate the employees of the future With the tagline Realise Your Aspirations SkillsFuture is 100 committed to giving Singaporeans the best possible professional opportunities imaginable This national movement to works to provide businesses and individuals with choices to maximize their skills on

economic trends will reshape labour markets we will have a better understanding of what we should be emphasizing in our educational and training systems to be as well prepared as possible for tomorrow s world Rapid advances in artificial intelligence and robotics have in particular created a new momentum to understand exactly how widespread the impacts of technology will be on jobs But what if this focus is misplaced The inherent unpredictability of technological progress means that even within the literature on automation there are projected ranges for developed countries from 5 percent of jobs to 50 percent of jobs being at risk of automation with figures even higher than this for developing countries The timeframes for these impacts are similarly broad ranging from 10 20 years to 50 years in other estimates Layered onto the direct uncertainty around depth of impacts and timescale are unanswerable questions around the social norms and preferences which may influence how quickly if at all technological solutions replace humans Then there is the question of technologies that are still at nascent stages or that will only emerge in the coming years Will emerging technologies such as blockchain make intermediaries like Airbnb and Uber less relevant in 2 years or 10 years How quickly will autonomous vehicles eliminate the jobs of drivers around the world Uncertainty makes policy responses to specific potential outcomes challenging and makes the need for non path dependent responses critical These challenges are exacerbated by the cross cutting nature of the future of work policy issue touching as it does on economic social regulatory and technological issues A forthcoming report from the Mowat Centre at the University of Toronto argues that policymakers should focus their attention on upgrading the systems that support workers and young people and ensuring those systems are prepared to thrive in a world of increased uncertainty volatility and disruption Whether the primary and secondary education systems unemployment and training schemes or housing health and social supports existing policy and service delivery frameworks in many countries were designed for the industrial age and do not take advantage of nor reflect the digital age in which we live today Policymakers should focus their attention on upgrading the systems that support workers and young people and ensuring those systems are prepared to thrive in a world of increased uncertainty volatility and disruption For instance unemployment schemes in both Canada and America are straining to meet the needs of labour markets characterized by more part time temporary and contract workers Both countries are at record low rates of coverage for income supports for the unemployed Fewer than one in three unemployed Americans now receive benefits and for those who qualify benefits replace a smaller percentage of wages than before 2 Similarly only 39 percent of unemployed Canadians receive regular benefits down from over 80 percent in 1978 3 As more workers are engaged in non standard forms of employment fewer workers are completing enough hours to pass eligibility thresholds Those who do qualify often do not receive payments for very long Developing unemployment programs that provide more targeted outcomes based and personalized supports is only going to become more pressing in a future where we can expect more workers in the contingent on demand workforce Reforms that focus on developing systems that are resilient and responsive are more likely to have relevance than re orienting programs around predictions about what types of occupations are likely to be in demand 10 or 20 years from now A clear example of the risks of future casting skills and occupations presents itself in the area of computer programming Governments from New York to England to Singapore have decided that coding will be a growth area in the economy and that they should begin to train young children to acquire these skills While there may well be value in training more young people to be comfortable with computers and how they work and skills such as problem solving and logic can be enhanced through such efforts there is an open question about whether coding will actually be an area where humans will have much of a role in the future As American software entrepreneur Mark Cuban has observed coding could well be automated within five years and a better focus for skills development could be creative thinking 4 Which brings us back to the original conundrum future casting skills is hugely challenging and future casting skills overlaid against occupations likely to be in demand is even more difficult The significant time and effort involved in re orienting educational systems from the primary to tertiary levels means that policymakers who get their projections wrong could have an entire generation with skills that are not particularly useful For policymakers facing an uncertain future the best course is to redesign the systems that will support workers and young people engaged in the work force or preparing to enter it Many of the changes that are required across policy and service delivery frameworks will have the added benefit of not just laying the groundwork for the future but also addressing the real and pressing needs of those who are ill served today by schemes that were designed for a different time What particular characteristics should inform the design of social and employment supports Successful programs and systems in the future will be Two promising examples of new interventions that align with these criteria are Singapore s SkillsFuture program and France s Personal Activity Accounts Both programs are designed to provide citizens with easier access to services that they need when they need them Singapore s program provides a digital platform for citizens to access lifelong learning resources including information about education and training opportunities integrated training supports and an individualized credit of 500 that is periodically topped up by the government for skills development The French model provides customized training supports and credits for people facing different life situations including the employed education system drop outs and those who engage in voluntary and charitable work The ability of governments to pivot programs towards these types of models delivering targeted programs quickly adjusting them on the fly based on rigorous evaluation and partnering with other societal actors should be the primary focus of reform in the short to medium term Anticipating specific competencies and hard skills which will be in demand in the future and re aligning training and educational systems towards them should be undertaken with extreme caution In the longer term exploring the effectiveness of more transformative approaches such as a guaranteed annual income may be required But adjusting existing supports to better reflect today s world of work will go a significant ways towards addressing concerns about the future of work currently bedeviling policymakers around the world The more those supports are customized digital integrated focused on outcomes and rigorously evaluated the more likely it is they will meet the challenges of an uncertain ever evolving future This piece was originally published in The Future of Work in the Global South edited by Hernan Galperin and Andrea Alarcon International Development Research Centre 2017 Sunil JohalJan

levels of the workforce which alongside other factors can help to improve productivity and economic prosperity To ensure sustainable and effective talent and succession planning organisations need to understand their current and future business needs but also remain aware of the wider skills context and policy environment in the countries in which they operate This factsheet examines the nature and key aims of the UK s skills policy and explores the current skills situation in the UK covering issues surrounding low productivity including the provision of careers advice the graduate labour market and skills mismatch among others As the professional body for HR and people development our purpose is to champion better work and better working lives for all We know that employees who are able to fully use their skills at work and are given opportunities to grow their capabilities are more productive and have greater job satisfaction We are working to champion greater investment in skills development and more effective use of existing workforce capability that will lead to improved wages job satisfaction engagement and productivity benefitting individuals their organisations and wider society To support more effective use of skills and encourage investment in training and development we work with key stakeholders to promote better leadership and management and progressive

Please note that some of our resources are for members only In today s competitive and fast changing world the skills and capabilities of the workforce are vital to economic sustainability and growth Workplace skills include the ability to These skills are at the heart of how organisations function in the digital age Other attributes such as the ability to work well with customers and clients and being caring and creative are also highly valued in some jobs although these are harder to pin down as specific skills and are often referred to as soft skills or employability skills Skills are not the same as qualifications although they are often treated interchangeably However the process of gaining a qualification undoubtedly builds on and improves skills Qualifications also provide specialist knowledge and they signal to employers a wide range of desirable attributes These complement the generic skills we use in the workplace but are distinct from them Both qualifications and skills matter as a workforce with a low level of qualifications is also one likely to have low levels of skills Skills are important for economic growth and prosperity The economic prosperity of a country depends on how many people are in work and how productive they are in the workplace Better use of skills available in the workforce alongside increased investment in skills and training has been shown to improve productivity Growth in productivity and prosperity build the conditions for improvements in real earnings creating a virtuous cycle individuals and organisations For the individual skills determine their employment and earning potential For organisations skills are vital to meeting both current and future business demands To be successful and competitive businesses must ensure their talent management and succession planning take into consideration what skills need to be sourced nurtured developed and retained now in order to create successful and productive workforces of the future To tackle the UK s underlying skills deficit it s not enough to focus on initial education and training The vast majority of the 2030 workforce are already in work Employers understand the importance of investing in and improving the skill levels of employees including on the job training in house development programmes and coaching At a national level too many UK businesses are built around low skilled low value jobs Employers design and structure work in a way that limit their staff s use of skills resulting in skills to job mismatches and stagnant productivity The UK also suffers from poor basic skills weakness in the vocational education system and low investment in workplace training Research for our report Making the UK s skills system world class shows that whilst the UK performs well internationally on the provision of high level qualifications with a large proportion of the workforce is educated to degree level we record only mediocre to poor scores on most other measures A high proportion of our workforce has poor literacy numeracy and computer skills and evidence suggests that employers are training less and investing less in their workforces than they were two decades ago At the heart of addressing the UK s low productivity level and the associated high proportion of low skilled and low paid jobs in the economy is the improvement of how skills are both developed and used This requires better leadership and management capabilities and improved people management practices Our recent report Over skilled and underused investigating the untapped potential of UK skills found that more than a third of workers have the skills to cope with more demanding duties than they currently have At the opposite end of the scale one in ten employees said they lacked all the skills needed to carry out their job effectively Reducing this skills mismatch would help improve UK productivity with analysis by the OECD suggesting that average labour productivity could be increased by as much as 5 if the degree of skills mismatch in the UK was brought into line with OECD best practice levels Organisations in particular SMEs need support to invest and develop their HR and people management capability to enable them to invest in the skills of their workforce and make best use of existing workforce capabilities We have been working to support small firms improve their leadership and management capabilities through our People Skills pilots our report Building HR capability in UK small firms sets out the key lessons for policy makers and practitioners It could be argued that successive governments have prioritised the expansion of the high education system at the expense of further and vocational education Indeed the OECD has identified a gap in the UK in terms of the provision of intermediate and technical level skills Whilst the UK government has prioritised increasing the number of apprentices the overall budget for post 16 provision has experienced significant funding cuts Our Over qualification and skills mismatch research has highlighted the issue of graduate over qualification with government estimating that 75 will not earn enough to fully repay their student loans while too few young people consider vocational routes into work such as apprenticeships While the current Government is pushing for a bigger focus on apprenticeships they are still often seen as a poor relation to higher education Our research Over skilled and underused Investigating the untapped potential of UK skills gives an up to date picture of the state of the UK s skills base and how well workers skills are being used and developed at work The UK s skills policy needs to address the following challenges Skills policy in the UK is devolved which means that any policy initiatives are entirely the remit of the devolved administrations in Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland and only of the UK government when it comes to England The approach to skills policy in each of the four nations within the UK is different However there are some common core themes and approaches including The main development in skills policy in the UK recently has been the focus on apprenticeships and technical education Apprenticeship reforms date back to 2012 and the Richards Review which put forward recommendations to simplify the system and put employers in the driving seat These included the development of new employer led apprenticeship standards and reforms to apprenticeship funding A key aspect of this policy has been the introduction of the apprenticeship levy in April 2017 which sees employers with a wage bill of over 3 million pay 0 5 of their total pay bill In 2016 the CIPD surveyed 275 employers on their reactions to the levy We found that nearly one third of organisations believed the levy would encourage them to develop an apprenticeship programme that would help them to build key skills A similar proportion thought the levy would help them to increase the quantity of apprenticeships they offered However concerns were raised that the levy may have negative unintended consequences squeezing out training opportunities for other sections of the workforce Our survey found that almost a third of organisations thought the levy would cause them to reduce their investment in other areas of workforce training and development A further 22 believed it could also encourage employers to accredit training they would otherwise be running anyway as apprenticeship schemes Interestingly only one in five respondents thought the levy would drive up the quality of apprenticeship schemes The Government is also reforming technical education as result of the Sainsbury Review of Post 16 skills The broad objectives of the reforms are to create a system that supports learners to achieve sustained skilled employment and that meets the skills needs of a changing economy In particular the reforms aim to streamline a complex system of overlapping qualifications into a common framework of 15 routes or T Levels which group occupations together in a two year college based programme with a high quality work experience placement aligned to apprenticeships Our latest research Reforming technical education uncovered a concerning lack of awareness amongst employers about the new qualifications highlighting the need for greater employer engagement and consultation if the reforms are to be successful Education Skills Funding AgencyOECD Learning for jobsDEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION

years ago Google s People Analytics division launched Project Aristotle to understand the components of productive teams embracing research that groups are more creative than individuals Private sector businesses are automating tedious tasks augmenting workers with artificial intelligence technologies reskilling and upskilling their workforces focusing on employee wellness and hungrily recruiting talent Government will have to catch up Perhaps nowhere is the gap between the public and private sector greater than in workforce management Most public sector organizations are still locked into decades old employee policies such as rigid job classifications lockstep pay and a reliance on seniority as a substitute for capability The reality is that government agencies are increasingly called upon to address society s most complex challenges while using workforce approaches rooted in the distant past The good news Change is possible and beginning to happen A new Deloitte study explores some of the ways the nature of government work the public workforce itself and the workplace it occupies will all need to continue to evolve Work New technologies can transform the capabilities of a government worker Artificially intelligent chatbots for example can perform triage on citizen questions freeing human attention for less routine queries The Army s recruitment chatbot SGT STAR does the work of 55 recruiters answering 94 percent of questions A Deloitte analysis of AI s potential found that automation could save the federal government as much as 1 2 billion hours of work annually What AI doesn t automate it can enhance Child welfare caseworkers who according to one study spend just 9 percent of their time with children but 37 5 percent of their time on paperwork could use technology to auto populate documentation freeing time for visits AI also can correlate hospital truancy and arrest records to flag children in danger Some restaurant health inspectors already analyze big data to identify likely candidates for inspections In Chicago for instance tests found 24 percent more critical violations and on average isolated dangers from the food system a week earlier For effective work redesign it s helpful to adopt a two pronged strategy of zooming in and zooming out A zooming in approach hones in on individual tasks and processes that have the most potential to be optimized through automation Zooming out entails looking at the bigger picture to define what work redesign means for entire job classifications departments and the organization as a whole Workforce Specialists in fields like cybersecurity agile development and artificial intelligence are not likely to commit decades to one government position and if they did they d still need to swap into the tech sector periodically to sharpen their skills That s why some government technology programs are taking a tour of duty approach letting private sector experts serve in the public sector for a few years on specific projects without locking them into a lifetime of government work At the federal level the General Services Administration s 18F digital services agency the Oak Ridge Institute for Science Education and the Presidential Innovation Fellows program all help government solve problems with temporary outside hires At the state level Michigan s Cyber Civilian Corps a volunteer group of cybersecurity professionals from the private sector and academia as well as government can be called upon if the governor declares a cyber emergency And long term government workers don t need to be stuck in one place A talent cloud can prepare for unexpected staffing needs by identifying in advance workers with special skills and applying them to tasks suited to their expertise Canada is experimenting with letting multiple agencies dip into a talent cloud and hire workers for specific missions Workers keep their union membership rights and benefits but may be called into service by any agency Workplace Empirical science rarely guides hiring But management is becoming more data driven Applying the newest science on team building personal efficiency and employee wellness to government agencies can upgrade the workplace to better attract retain and utilize talent Insights from studies of the composition and functioning of effective teams can inform decisions about using talents more effectively Organizational network analysis for example can use metadata from emails and other sources to map communication patterns in organizations accurately predicting individuals who will be high performers detecting unsatisfied employees six months before they actually quit and identifying leadership behaviors that correlate with success Modern workplace wellness programs are also extremely impactful Improving employee wellness can reduce lost work days increase retention and fuel productivity After the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center provided a physician and nurse case manager for employees it saw an 80 percent decline in lost work days over six years for a cost savings of 1 5 million In short the future of government work will require a level of dynamic workforce management far beyond the current practices of the public sector The potential for government agencies to unlock more human capital potential and make the public sector a magnet for talent is enormous As Buffalo s former mayor demonstrated to bring the right people together you have to know what it takes to make a project succeed Local governments are using internet surveys to better gauge residents needs Some states are finding ways to make rules easier to navigate and less costly for business while continuing to protect the public s interests The amount of missing and unusable public sector data is stunning Every jurisdiction should be comparing itself with its peers to identify problematic practices increase productivity and reduce costs It s
