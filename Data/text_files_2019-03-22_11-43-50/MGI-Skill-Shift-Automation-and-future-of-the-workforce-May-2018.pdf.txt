SKILL SHIFT  
AUTOMATION AND 
THE FUTURE OF 
THE WORKFORCE 



Copyright © McKinsey & Company 2018

Since its founding in 1990, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) has sought 
to develop a deeper understanding of the evolving global economy. As the 
business and economics research arm of McKinsey & Company, MGI aims 
to provide leaders in the commercial, public, and social sectors with the facts 
and insights on which to base management and policy decisions.  

MGI research combines the disciplines of economics and management, 
employing the analytical tools of economics with the insights of business 
leaders. Our “micro-to-macro” methodology examines microeconomic 
industry trends to better understand the broad macroeconomic forces 
affecting business strategy and public policy. MGI’s in-depth reports have 
covered more than 20 countries and 30 industries. Current research focuses 
on six themes: productivity and growth, natural resources, labor markets, 
the evolution of global financial markets, the economic impact of technology 
and innovation, and urbanization. Recent reports have assessed the 
digital economy, the impact of AI and automation on employment, income 
inequality, the productivity puzzle, the economic benefits of tackling gender 
inequality, a new era of global competition, Chinese innovation, and digital and 
financial globalization.

MGI is led by three McKinsey & Company senior partners: Jacques Bughin, 
Jonathan Woetzel, and James Manyika, who also serves as the chairman 
of MGI. Michael Chui, Susan Lund, Anu Madgavkar, Jan Mischke, 
Sree Ramaswamy, and Jaana Remes are MGI partners, and Mekala Krishnan 
and Jeongmin Seong are MGI senior fellows. 

Project teams are led by the MGI partners and a group of senior fellows, 
and include consultants from McKinsey offices around the world. These 
teams draw on McKinsey’s global network of partners and industry and 
management experts. Advice and input to MGI research are provided by 
the MGI Council, members of which are also involved in MGI’s research. 
MGI Council members are drawn from around the world and from various 
sectors and include Andrés Cadena, Sandrine Devillard, Richard Dobbs, 
Tarek Elmasry, Katy George, Rajat Gupta, Eric Hazan, Eric Labaye, Acha Leke, 
Scott Nyquist, Gary Pinkus, Sven Smit, Oliver Tonby, and Eckart Windhagen. 
In addition, leading economists, including Nobel laureates, act as research 
advisers to MGI research.

IN BRIEF 

SKILL SHIFT: AUTOMATION AND 
THE FUTURE OF THE WORKFORCE 
Automation and artificial intelligence (AI) are changing the nature of work. In this discussion 
paper, part of our ongoing research on the impact of technology on the economy, business, 
and society, we present new findings on the coming shifts in demand for workforce skills and 
how work is organized within companies, as people increasingly interact with machines in the 
workplace. We quantify time spent on 25 core workplace skills today and in the future for the 
United States and five European countries, with a particular focus on five sectors: banking and 
insurance, energy and mining, healthcare, manufacturing, and retail. Key findings: 

  Automation will accelerate the shift in required workforce skills we have seen over the past 
15 years. Our research finds that the strongest growth in demand will be for technological 
skills, the smallest category today, which will rise by 55 percent and by 2030 will represent 
17 percent of hours worked, up from 11 percent in 2016. This surge will affect demand 
for basic digital skills as well as advanced technological skills such as programming. 
Demand for social and emotional skills such as leadership and managing others will rise 
by 24 percent, to 22 percent of hours worked. Demand for higher cognitive skills will grow 
moderately overall, but will rise sharply for some of these skills, especially creativity.  

  Some skill categories will be less in demand. Basic cognitive skills, which include basic 
data input and processing, will decline by 15 percent, falling to 14 percent of hours worked 
from 18 percent. Demand for physical and manual skills, which include general equipment 
operation, will also drop, by 14 percent, but will remain the largest category of workforce 
skills in 2030 in many countries, accounting for 25 percent of the total hours worked. Skill 
shifts will play out differently across sectors. Healthcare, for example, will see a rising need 
for physical skills, even as demand for them declines in manufacturing and other sectors. 

  Companies will need to make significant organizational changes at the same time as 
addressing these skill shifts to stay competitive. A survey of more than 3,000 business 
leaders in seven countries highlights a new emphasis on continuous learning for workers 
and a shift to more cross-functional and team-based work. As tasks change, jobs will need 
to be redefined and companies say they will need to become more agile. Independent 
work will likely grow. Leadership and human resources will also need to adapt: almost 20 
percent of companies say their executive team lacks sufficient knowledge to lead adoption 
of automation and artificial intelligence. Almost one in three firms are concerned that lacking 
the skills they need for automation adoption will hurt their future financial performance. 

  Competition for high-skill workers will increase, while displacement will be concentrated 
mainly on low-skill workers, continuing a trend that has exacerbated income inequality 
and reduced middle-wage jobs. Companies say that high-skill workers are most likely 
to be hired and retrained, and to see rising wages. Firms in the forefront of automation 
adoption expect to attract the talent they need, but slower adopters fear their options will be 
more limited.

  Almost half of the companies we surveyed say they expect to take the lead in building 
the workforce of the future, but all stakeholders will need to work together to manage the 
large-scale retraining and other transition challenges ahead. Firms can collaborate with 
educators to reshape school and college curricula. Industry associations can help build 
talent pipelines, while labor unions can help with cross-sector mobility. Governments 
will need to strengthen safeguards for workers in transition and encourage mobility, 
including with a shift to portable benefits, as ways of working and the workplace itself are 
transformed in the new era.

1. HOW WILL DEMAND FOR WORKFORCE SKILLS 
CHANGE WITH AUTOMATION?

employment, and productivity, January 2017; Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of 
automation, December 2017; Artificial intelligence: The next digital frontier? June 2017; and Notes from the AI 
frontier: Insights from hundreds of use cases, April 2018. For a discussion of technology and productivity, see

Education, report 20, December 2014.

Over the next 10 to 15 years, the adoption of automation and artificial intelligence 
technologies will transform the workplace, as people increasingly interact with ever smarter 
machines. These technologies, and that human-machine interaction, will bring numerous 
benefits, in the form of higher economic growth, improved corporate performance, and 
new prosperity. Automation will replace aging workers at a time when the working-age 
population in many countries is declining. It will help solve societal problems as well; 
already AI-powered machines are more adept than expert doctors at diagnosing some 
diseases from X-rays and MRIs. Our prior research suggests that automation and AI 
could give a boost to productivity growth, which has waned in advanced countries over  
the past decade, and generate considerable value for companies across sectors, from 
agriculture and media to healthcare and pharmaceuticals. Firms use these technologies 
to conduct predictive maintenance in manufacturing, personalize “next product to buy” 
recommendations, optimize pricing in real time, and identify fraudulent transactions, among 
other uses.1 

These technologies will also change the skills required of human workers—the focus of this 
discussion paper.

Skill shifts in the workforce are not new; indeed, skill requirements have changed ever since 
the first Industrial Revolution reconfigured the role of machines and workers (see Box 1, 
“Skill shifts in the past and present”). Companies in many countries complain that they have 
trouble finding the talent they need, and workers often complain about being underqualified 
or even overqualified for their jobs.2 Skill shortages and mismatches have negative 
implications for the economy and the labor market. They can result in increased labor costs, 
lost production due to unfilled vacancies, slower adoption of new technologies, and the 
implicit and explicit costs of higher unemployment rates.3 Conversely, appropriate skills 
can boost economic growth: one study that has sought to quantify the linkage finds that an 
increase in educational achievement by 50 points in the OECD’s PISA student assessment 
tests translates into a 1 percentage point higher long-run growth rate.4 

In this opening chapter, we look at the demand for skills used by the workforce today 
and we model how that could change as new automation technologies including artificial 
intelligence are increasingly deployed in the workplace. To understand which skills will be 
needed more—and those needed less—we looked at the economy as a whole and in depth 
at five sectors: banking and insurance; energy and mining; healthcare; manufacturing; and 
retail. MGI’s hallmark micro-to-macro approach uses micro insights from industries and 
companies to inform broader macroeconomic trends. This has enabled us to identify some 
of the key skill shifts in the future that will profoundly affect not just individual workers, but 
also companies and organizations.

Technical innovation brought about shifts in skills needed in the workplace long 
before the advent of today’s automation technologies. During the Industrial 
Revolution in Europe and the United States in the early 19th century, the steam 
engine and other technologies raised the productivity of workers with primarily basic 
manual skills, enabling them to undertake work that had previously been done by 
high-skill and high-paid laborers, including master weavers and other artisans. In our 
era, computers and robots have had the opposite effect, increasing the productivity 
and complementing the work of high-skill workers, even as they substitute for the 
routine tasks previously undertaken by low-skill workers, such as those working on 
assembly lines or as switchboard operators.1  

This has contributed to a decline in middle-wage jobs across advanced economies 
over the past three decades.2 In the United States, for example, the share of adults 
living in middle-income households has declined from 61 percent in 1971 to just 50 
percent in 2015. While about one-third of those have shifted down to lower-middle 
and the lowest income households, two-thirds of this shift has been up, to upper-
middle and higher income households, creating an hourglass-like effect.3 

In the past 50 years alone, the skills used in several professions have fundamentally 
changed—even as the professions themselves have continued thriving. The 
changes can be seen by comparing official descriptions of roles as defined by the US 
Department of Labor.4 For example, coal miners in the past used to carry out heavy 
physical and manual tasks requiring gross motor skills and physical strength. Today, 
they increasingly operate machines that do the heavy and dangerous toiling, and 
need to apply more complex skills by monitoring equipment and problem solving. 
Nurses in 1957 were required to administer medicines, monitor patients by taking 
their pulse and temperature, and help with therapeutic tasks including bathing, 
massaging, and feeding patients. Today, they still administer medicines to patients 
but also help perform diagnostic tests and can analyze the results—employing skills 
and filling roles that were more common to doctors a half-century ago. Bank tellers, 
too, have shifted from mainly handing out cash or collecting deposits to handling 
customers’ queries and complaints, and selling financial products. 

A still-unanswered question about AI and the latest automation technologies is 
whether they will continue to favor high-skill workers over low-skill ones—or perhaps 
affect workers at all skill levels. One risk is that the recent decline of middle-income 
jobs and growing inequality could intensify as companies compete for talent to 
overcome both an excess supply of some skills and an excess demand for others. 
The impact on wages for different job profiles could be a greater polarization even 
than today, with people who carry out nonrepetitive, digital work seeing above-
average wages, while pay for repetitive, nondigital jobs might be below average. 
Today, we have the advantage of foreseeing the skill shifts to come, which gives 
us some time to anticipate and adjust for these and other social changes that may 
accompany automation and AI adoption.

ALREADY, THERE IS EVIDENCE OF SKILL MISMATCHES IN THE UNITED 
STATES AND EUROPE 
A growing body of evidence suggests a mismatch between the skills the workforce has 
and the skills employers are looking for. The OECD, for example, finds mismatches both in 
the skills of individuals and in the educational credentials they hold, compared with what 
companies need.5 In the European Union, there is evidence of a long-standing qualification 
mismatch over the past decade, with more than 20 percent of workers receiving either more 
or less formal education than is required for their job.

A mismatch in the skills of the workforce (as opposed to the educational credentials) is 
even more pronounced. In a 2015 survey of LinkedIn users, 37 percent of respondents 
said their current jobs did not fully use their skills.6 The OECD finds that the percentage of 
the workforce reporting a skill mismatch does not fall below 30 percent in any of the 34 
countries it analyzed. In the United States, researchers at the Brookings Institution and 
elsewhere have focused on changing skill requirements for middle-skill employment, which 
increasingly demands technical and digital skills lacking in the workforce.7 

In parallel, many employers report that they face recruitment problems due to skill 
shortages. According to one survey, the time it took to fill a vacancy in 2016 was markedly 
higher than in 2005—28 days versus 20 days—even though the unemployment rate in both 
years was comparable, around 5 percent.8 A 2013 survey commissioned by McKinsey 
found that only 43 percent of employers in nine countries (Brazil, Germany, India, Mexico, 
Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States) said they could 
find enough skilled entry-level workers.9 

Academic research suggests that these skill mismatches are partly the result of a changing 
labor market, with the decline of some occupations such as production and clerical jobs, 
which require relatively little education, and the growth of other occupations in healthcare 
and other service sectors that require more postsecondary education—and which are 
proving the hardest to fill.10

companies to fill vacancies, an analysis of the Beveridge curve for the US economy published by the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics in April 2018 suggests that a structural shift in terms of job openings took place in the 
timeframe analyzed. Specifically, the US job openings rate has been about 0.50 to 0.75 percentage points 
higher between 2009 and 2018 than it was in the 2001–07 period across a range of unemployment levels.

Technological skills are one specific area of mismatch. Several countries report shortages 
of specialized information technology workers and data scientists. For example, France 
expects a shortage of 80,000 workers in IT and electronics jobs by 2020.11 Prior MGI 
research has estimated that there could be a shortfall of some 250,000 data scientists in 
the short term in the United States.12 The skill shortage also extends to more basic digital 
skills. A British parliamentary report in 2016 found that 23 percent of the UK population, or 
12.6 million people, lacked basic digital skills, at a time when about 90 percent of new jobs 
require them.13 A survey of business leaders that we conducted for this report corroborates 
this finding. The top three areas identified by respondents as having the largest skill 
shortages today are data analytics, IT/mobile/web design, and R&D.14 

AUTOMATION WILL PROMPT A LARGER SHIFT IN DEMAND FOR WORKFORCE 
SKILLS AS IT TRANSFORMS OCCUPATIONS 
Economists, other researchers, and organizational practice experts use different definitions 
when discussing workforce “skills.” The US Labor Department’s occupational information 
network (O*NET), for example, differentiates between abilities (“enduring attributes of the 
individual”) and skills (“developed capacities”) in order to define and track a comprehensive 
list of 87 attributes that affect a worker’s ability to carry out a particular job.15 The OECD’s 
survey of adult skills focuses on three foundational skills—literacy, numeracy, and problem 
solving in technology-rich environments—to allow for consistent quantification and 
comparison of skill levels in different populations over time.16 

To understand the nature and magnitude of the coming skill shift, we take a business-
oriented approach to our definition. We include both intrinsic abilities (for example, gross 
motor skills and strength, creativity, and empathy) and specific learned skills, such as those 
in advanced IT and programming, advanced data analysis, and technology design. This 
allows us to build a comprehensive view of the changing nature of workforce skills and 
provide a sufficient level of detail to motivate concrete actions and interventions.

We end up with a set of 25 skills across five broad categories: physical and manual, basic 
cognitive, higher cognitive, social and emotional, and technological skills. Within each 
category are more specific skills (Exhibit 1). For instance, within social and emotional skills, 
we include advanced communication and negotiation, interpersonal skills and empathy, 
leadership and managing others, entrepreneurship and initiative taking, adaptability 
and continuous learning, and teaching and training others. We have also separated 
technological skills from higher cognitive skills, although some of the former require higher 
cognitive capabilities (see Box 2, “Our sources of insight for this paper”).

6 McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

AUTOMATION IS LIKELY TO ACCELERATE SKILL SHIFTS COMPARED WITH 
THE HISTORICAL TREND 
Our analysis highlights significant shifts in workforce skills that will be in demand in an 
automated future. The biggest change will take place in technological skills, both in 
advanced skills such as programming, advanced data analysis, and tech design, for 
example, and also in more basic digital skills relating to the increasing prevalence of digital 
technologies in all workplaces. Other skills will also see a significant increase in demand, 
including various types of social and emotional skills. A shift will take place from basic to 
higher cognitive skills. Demand for physical and manual skills as a predominant skill set will 
continue to decrease, although these skills will remain a major component of the workplace 
of the future.

Assessing the accelerating impact of automation on skill shifts 
To measure the acceleration of skill shifts from automation and AI, we first examined 
historical skill shifts from 2002 to 2016 in the United States and modeled skill shifts going 
forward to 2030 (Exhibit 2). (See the technical appendix for details on how we model skill 
shifts to 2030).

While the demand for technological skills has been growing since 2002, it accelerates in 
the 2016 to 2030 period. Similarly, the increase in the need for social and emotional skills 
will also accelerate. By contrast, both basic cognitive skills and physical and manual skills 
will decline.

Box 2. Our sources of insight for this paper 
The research is based on four main sources of insight. For 
details of our methodology, see the technical appendix at 
the end of this paper. 

  First, we define a new taxonomy of 25 workforce skills 
and quantify time spent using each skill. We group 
skills into five categories: physical and manual, basic 
cognitive, higher cognitive, social and emotional, and 
technological skills. We quantify the time workers 
spend on each of the 25 skills today and how the 
amount of time worked will shift post-automation. 
While workers use multiple skills to perform a given 
task, for the purposes of our quantification, we 
identified the predominant skill used. For example, 
in banking and insurance, we mapped “prepare 
business correspondence” and “prepare legal or 
investigatory documentation” to the skill “advanced 
literacy and writing,” which is grouped in the category 
of higher cognitive skills. In retail, we classified “stock 
products or parts” into gross motor skills and strength 
in the category of physical and manual skills, while 
“greeting customers, patrons, or visitors” is mapped 
to basic communication skills, in the basic cognitive 
category. 

  Second, we quantify how automation will shift the 
demand for workforce skills in 2030. We use the MGI 
automation model to assess which work activities 
will decline, as described in our January 2017 report, 
A future that works: Automation, employment, and 

productivity. However, we build on that model by 
also considering jobs lost to productivity gains, 
and then compare jobs gained both from adoption 
of automation and AI directly, as well as from the 
productivity gains created by automation and AI. 
This enables us to examine in depth the coming 
occupational and skill shifts within five industry case 
studies (banking and insurance, energy and mining, 
healthcare, manufacturing, and retail). 

  Third, we conducted a detailed executive survey of 
3,031 respondents in Canada, the United States, and 
five European countries: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, 
and the United Kingdom. The survey targeted C-level 
executives from organizations familiar with at least 
one automation or AI technology and its application in 
business. The findings complement the quantitative 
results and highlight differences in the way extensive 
and limited adopters of automation and AI view the 
opportunities created by these technologies and how 
they are responding to shifting skill requirements. 

  Fourth, we conducted in-person interviews with 
chief human resources officers and other industry 
executives on their current and future skill mismatches 
and their strategies for building the workforce of the 
future. We also drew on the industry and function 
expertise and client experience of our colleagues at 
McKinsey & Company. 



7McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

Exhibit 3 shows the shift in broad skill categories between 2016 and 2030 including the 
impact of automation for the United States and 14 Western European countries.17 There are 
interesting nuances in the changes of demand for specific skills within each category, which 
we discuss below.

Our analysis is based on an automation adoption scenario that is in the middle of the range 
set out in prior MGI research.18 We also tested what would happen to skill shifts in the event 
that automation adoption were faster or slower than our midpoint baseline, and found that 
the broad trends would remain the same, although the rate of decline of demand for physical 
and manual and basic cognitive skills would be considerably higher if automation were more 
rapid, whereas the need for social and emotional skills and higher cognitive ones would 
be larger.

All technological skills, both advanced and basic, will see a very substantial 
growth in demand 
Advanced technologies require people who understand how they work and can innovate, 
develop, and adapt them—and service them in the workplace. Occupations requiring 
technological skills include big data scientists, IT professionals and programmers, 
technology designers, engineers, advanced technology maintenance workers, and 
scientific researchers. Our research suggests that the time spent on these skills will grow 
rapidly as companies deploy automation, robotics, AI, advanced analytics, and other new 
technologies. Overall, we find that time spent on advanced technological skills will increase 
by 50 percent in the United States and by 41 percent in Europe.

The demand for specific advanced technological skills differs. We expect the fastest 
rise in the need for advanced IT and programming skills, which could grow as much as 
90 percent between 2016 and 2030. As AI and automation become a core part of each 
sector, companies will need to significantly increase their tech talent, well beyond what 
they may have had in the past. Demand for other skills that constitute this category, 
including advanced data analysis and mathematics, technology design, engineering and 
maintenance, and scientific research and development, will also grow, but not as strongly.

10 McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

While advanced technological skills are essential for running a highly automated and 
digitized economy, people with these skills will inevitably be a minority. However, there 
is also a significant need for everyone to develop basic digital skills for the new age of 
automation. We find that basic digital skills are the second fastest-growing category among 
our 25 skills—after advanced IT and programming skills. They increase by 69 percent in 
the United States and by 65 percent in Europe. Our executive survey indicates that workers 
in all corporate functions are expected to improve their digital literacy over the next three 
years, and especially employees in functions including sourcing, procurement, and supply-
chain management.

This anticipated increase in demand to 2030 marks the continuation of existing trends. 
Research by Mark Muro at Brookings identified a substantial increase between 2002 
and 2016 in the digital component of occupations such as nurses and construction 
workers, which traditionally did not require digital skills.19 Indeed, whereas just over half 
of occupations had only low digital requirements in 2002, that proportion dropped to 
30 percent in 2016, Brookings has estimated (Exhibit 5).

11McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

Demand for social and emotional skills will grow rapidly 
Accompanying the adoption of advanced technologies into the workplace will be an 
increase in the need for workers with finely tuned social and emotional skills—skills that 
machines are a long way from mastering.

Our research finds that workers of the future will spend considerably more time deploying 
these skills than they do today. In aggregate, between 2016 and 2030, demand for these 
social and emotional skills will grow across all industries by 26 percent in the United States 
and by 22 percent in Europe. While some of these social and emotional skills are innate, 
such as empathy, they can also be honed and, to some extent, taught more easily than 
technological skills—for example, advanced communication.

Among all the skill shifts our analysis indicated, the rise in demand for entrepreneurship and 
initiative taking will be the fastest growing, with a 33 percent increase in the United States 
and a 32 percent rise in Europe. Other social and emotional skills, such as leadership and 
managing others, also showed strong increases.

This is part of an ongoing trend. Academic research has shown that nonroutine 
interpersonal and analytical tasks in occupations have been rising over the past 50 years, 
even as routine manual and cognitive tasks have declined.20 At the same time, jobs such 
as caretaker and manager which require astute social skills grew as a share of total 
employment and wages between 1980 and 2012, even as the employment share of 
manufacturing and support roles declined.21 

Demand for cognitive skills will shift from basic to higher ones, although the 
need for some types of higher cognitive skills will decline with automation 
Our research also finds a shift from activities that require only basic cognitive skills to those 
that use higher cognitive skills (Exhibit 6). Indeed, the decline in work activities that mainly 
require basic cognitive skills is the largest across our five categories of skills. For cognitive 
skills, both basic and higher, we also looked at the supply of skills, not just demand for them, 
to gauge potential mismatches (see Box 3. “An analysis of the supply of cognitive skills 
suggests a potential growing mismatch”).

Demand for higher cognitive skills such as creativity, critical thinking and decision making, 
and complex information processing will grow through 2030, at cumulative double-digit 
rates. We estimate that demand for these skill categories will increase by 19 percent in the 
United States and by 14 percent in Europe, from sizable bases today. The growing need for 
creativity is seen in many activities, including developing high-quality marketing strategies. 
The rise in complex information processing, meanwhile, is related to the need to be aware 
of market trends and the regulatory environment that affect a company’s operation, or the 
need to understand and explain to customers the technical details of a company’s products 
and services.

Other types of higher cognitive skills—such as advanced literacy and writing, and 
quantitative and statistical skills—will not see a similar increase in demand, and indeed our 
analysis suggests the need for them could remain stable or even decline to 2030. In writing 
and editing, computer programs already produce basic news stories about sporting results 
and stock market movements for many newspaper chains. Of course, the decline in this skill 
does not imply that there will be no authors, writers, or editors in the future—but as in many 
other occupations, some of the more basic aspects of the work will shift to machines.

Box 3. An analysis of the supply of cognitive skills suggests a potential growing mismatch 

1 Survey of adult skills (PIAAC), OECD, www.oecd.org/skills/piaac/. See also a report on the initial PIAAC study, Skills of US unemployed, young, 
and older adults in sharper focus: Results from the program for the international assessments of adult competencies (PIAAC) 2012/2014, 
National Center for Education Statistics, March 2016.

While our analysis for this paper focuses mainly on 
demand for skills in the future, we also tried to assess 
the extent to which there may be a growing mismatch of 
skills. Cognitive skills lend themselves to this exercise, 
because of a wealth of data from the OECD’s program 
for the international assessment of adult competencies 
(PIAAC). This program tests adult literacy and numeracy 
skills, as well as problem-solving skills in technology-rich 
environments among 16 to 65-year-olds in 24 countries.1 
We used the result of the second PIAAC survey dated 
2014—16 to project supply of these skills in 2030 in a 
number of countries. 

Our analysis finds that supply of problem-solving skills 
in technology-rich environments in Germany, the United 
Kingdom, and the United States could grow by between 
5 and 10 percent to 2030. These skills match some of the 

higher cognitive skills in our taxonomy, although there 
are differences in methodology and categorization. This 
additional supply corresponds to our calculation of a 
growth of demand for higher cognitive skills in 2030 of 
8 percent in Europe and 9 percent in the United States. 
This analysis suggests that the current balance (or 
imbalance) between the supply and demand for cognitive 
skills may remain stable. 

However, looking at basic literacy and numeracy skills 
in the PIAAC database, which approximates our basic 
cognitive skills, we see that there could be a growing 
excess of supply in some countries, since the work 
tasks that require these skills as the predominant skill 
will decrease, whereas the supply will remain stable or 
increase slightly. 



13McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

The lack of growth in demand for simpler quantitative and statistical skills may reflect 
the potential for a range of back-office functions to be automated, including in financial 
reporting, accounting, actuarial sciences, insurance claims processing, credit scoring, 
loan approval, or tax calculation. Computer algorithms and “robotic process automation” 
can drastically reduce the time and manpower devoted to these activities. At one bank, 
for instance, the financial reporting process for producing quarterly financial results was 
cut from ten days to four, 70 percent of tasks were automated, and costs were reduced by 
30 percent. While automation transformed manufacturing in the past 15 years, large swaths 
of white-collar jobs within corporate headquarters may be affected in the next 15.

Work activities that require only basic cognitive skills will particularly decline as automation 
advances. Basic data input and processing skills will be especially affected by automation, 
falling by 19 percent in the United States and by 23 percent in Europe in the 2016 to 2030 
period, according to our analysis. The decline will be in virtually all sectors, as machines 
increasingly take over straightforward data input tasks. Along with general equipment 
operation and navigation and inspecting and monitoring, this is the largest decline among 
our 25 skills. The biggest factor in this decline is the expected drop in the need for basic data 
processing, which is highly susceptible to automation and can be found across sectors.

Unlike data processing, basic literacy, numeracy, and communication will remain useful 
overall but will likely not suffice in the future without additional skill sets. In the United States, 
for example, demand for basic literacy declines by 6 percent across the entire economy, 
but by 27 percent in banking and insurance. However, in retail and healthcare, demand for 
basic literacy and communication skills will rise by 12 percent and 8 percent, respectively, 
as personal interaction continues to be important in some occupations. Examples of these 
types of activities include greeting customers, assisting them, or answering their questions 
in retail, and referring patients to the right resources or providing information and supporting 
them in healthcare.

While the need for most physical and manual skills will decline, they will remain 
the single largest category of workforce skills by 2030 
Finally, the demand for physical and manual skills will continue to decline, as it has for 15 
to 20 years, in most but not all sectors. Demand for these skills will decline by 11 percent 
overall in the United States and by 16 percent overall in Europe between 2016 and 2030, 
according to our analysis. The mix of physical and manual skills required in occupations will 
change depending on the extent to which work activities can be automated. For example, 
operating vehicles or stocking and packaging products are more susceptible to automation 
than assisting patients in a hospital or some types of cleaning. Our findings suggest that 
general equipment operation and navigation (skills used by manufacturing assembly 
workers and drivers) and inspecting and monitoring skills will decline faster than other 
physical and manual skills.

The overall trend of declining demand for physical and manual skills does not hold true for 
some individual sectors, however. In the US healthcare sector, for example, our analysis 
finds the need for both gross and fine motor skills will increase by about 30 percent, as an 
aging population drives demand for nursing, doctor, and physical therapy activities.

Perhaps more surprisingly, physical and manual skills will continue to be the single largest 
category of skills (measured by time spent) even in 2030, based on our analysis. In all, this 
category will shrink from 31 percent of workers’ time in 2016 to 25 percent in 2030 across 
the United States and Western Europe. But this is still 20 percent more time than workers 
will spend using social and emotional skills, and about 50 percent more time than they will 
spend using technological skills.



14 McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

SKILL SHIFTS WILL PLAY OUT DIFFERENTLY ACROSS COUNTRIES, 
DEPENDING ON ECONOMIC STRUCTURE, SECTOR MIX, AND LEVEL OF 
DIGITIZATION 
We find differences in how skill shifts play out in the countries we focused on for this 
research. These largely reflect different economic structures and sector mixes, including the 
degree of digital technology adoption. While we have already discussed cross-geography 
trends above, in this section we look more closely at individual European countries 
(Exhibit 7).

The United Kingdom, for example, has the lowest proportion of physical and manual skills 
today and the highest share of social and emotional skills, partly reflecting the size of its 
knowledge-based economy. Financial services, which account for a significant proportion 
of the UK’s GDP, barely use physical and manual skills, for example, while the manufacturing 
and energy and mining sectors, which require physical and manual skills, are relatively small 
in the United Kingdom, at just 9 percent of the UK economy compared with 20 percent 
in Germany and 19 percent in Italy. Moreover, the manufacturing sector in the United 
Kingdom appears to be more highly automated than in the United States. For example, 
while US workers spend considerable time operating, packaging, and measuring, their

15McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

British counterparts in manufacturing devote more work hours to installing, testing, and 
controlling—activities that are less susceptible to automation.

The United Kingdom’s significant share of social and emotional skills is expected to remain 
a feature of the economy in 2030, according to our analysis. These skills accounted for 
more than 21 percent of the working hours across the economy in 2016 compared with 
18 percent in the United States, and we estimate that this proportion will rise to 26 percent in 
2030 versus 21 percent in the United States. The main difference is related to the number of 
hours spent on tasks including directing, supervising, managing, and coordinating.

In Spain and Italy, by comparison, physical and manual skills remain the most significant skill 
sets, and we estimate that this will remain the case in 2030. Indeed, the share of physical 
and manual skills in these two countries even in 2030 are projected be as high as they are 
today in the United States and some other countries. One explanation is the continuing 
importance of manual skills in manufacturing and healthcare. For example, 32 percent of the 
skills in healthcare in Spain are manual, compared with 27 percent in the United States and 
26 percent in the United Kingdom.

In Germany, meanwhile, our analysis suggests that basic digital skills will grow relatively 
slowly compared with our other focus countries. This is likely to reflect Germany’s 
relatively advanced application of technology in the workplace already today, especially in 
manufacturing, and the different sector mix. But Germany will see further increases in its 
share of technology design skills to 2030, according to our analysis, to just over 4 percent in 
2030. That proportion is more than double that of the United Kingdom, the second highest, 
where technology design skills rise to just 2 percent in the same period, and two and a half 
times the share in the United States, where technology design skills only rise to 1.7 percent 
in 2030. This relative importance and growth may be explained by the prevalence of 
industrial-equipment design activities in Germany. The manufacturing sector there focuses 
heavily on developing new manufacturing technology and equipment, whereas the United 
States skews relatively more toward using pre-existing technology. There are signs that this 
gap could be narrowing, however, as technology design skills grow by almost double the 
rate in the United States (31 percent) as they do in Germany (17 percent).

In three of the countries we looked—France, Germany, and the United Kingdom—the share 
of physical and manual skills in the economy will decline by 2030 such that this is not the 
largest skill group. In France and the United Kingdom, it is overtaken by social and emotional 
skills, while in Germany, it is overtaken as the largest category by higher cognitive skills.

EXECUTIVE SURVEY CONFIRMS GROWING SKILL SHIFTS, WITH LEADING 
AUTOMATION AND AI ADOPTERS PULLING AHEAD IN ADDRESSING THE 
SHIFT 
The results of the executive survey we conducted reveal that almost all executives foresee 
a skill mismatch in the future, and the findings are largely consistent with our quantitative 
analysis.22 Whereas the quantitative analysis sizes the shifts in skills, the survey highlights 
corporate expectations. Some findings stand out.

The survey confirms the paramount importance of advanced IT and programming skills. 
These are viewed as the most important skills needed in the next three years (Exhibit 8). 
Advanced data analysis and mathematical skills are also seen as very important. Higher 
cognitive skills and social and emotional skills will also be more in demand, according to 
company executives.

22 Executives in the survey came from 14 sectors: high tech/IT/technology, manufacturing, construction, retail/
trade, media and entertainment, telecommunications, tourism/hospitality/leisure, travel/transport/logistics, 
financial services/banking/insurance, professional services, education, healthcare, energy/mining/oil and gas/
utilities, and government. See technical appendix for details.

17McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

Respondents across industries expect declines in the need for physical and manual skills, 
and particularly for gross motor skills and strength needed for occupations such as movers, 
machine feeders, and warehouse packers. They also expect declines in basic cognitive 
skills, particularly in the need for basic data input and processing skills that are used by data 
entry clerks, typists, and in a range of back-office functions.

Along with these general observations, which largely hold true across sectors and countries, 
our survey indicates that larger companies—as measured by the size of their current labor 
force—expect a more pronounced skill shift than smaller companies. Specifically, they 
expect a stronger decrease in the demand for physical and manual and basic cognitive 
skills, and an even stronger increase in the demand for technological skills, than their 
smaller peers. This may be because they plan to adopt automation and AI technologies at 
greater rates than midsize and smaller companies, reflecting their ability to finance the large 
investments needed. Prior MGI research has found that small and medium-size businesses 
overall have been slower to adopt digital technologies.23 

Our survey also confirms that workers in all corporate functions will need to improve their 
digital literacy, moving from the ability to use basic digital tools to more advanced digital 
skills. In particular, employees in the corporate functions of sourcing, procurement, and 
supply-chain management will need to use more advanced digital technologies over the 
next three years.

Functions that are the most automated today experience the largest skill 
mismatches 
Our survey shows that functions that are already the most automated are experiencing the 
largest skill mismatches. These functions include data analytics, IT/mobile/web design, and 
research and development (Exhibit 9). This finding holds true across almost all sectors, with 
the notable exception of manufacturing, where skill mismatches are expected to be largest 
in production and manufacturing operations.

Skills of today and skills of tomorrow: Today’s experience and perceptions of 
future needs 
Contrasting the importance of skills needed today with those required in the future reveals 
an interesting pattern. Based on our survey responses, Exhibit 10 shows individual skills 
based on their perceived importance today and whether employers expect to need more 
or less of those skills in the future. Overall, employers expect to need more of the social 
and emotional, higher cognitive, and technology skills in the future, and less of the basic 
cognitive and physical and manual skills.

Four specific groups of skills stand out. Those in the upper-right quadrant are perceived 
as very important today and needed even more in the future. They include leadership, 
advanced communication, advanced IT and programming, and critical-thinking skills. In the 
lower-right quadrant are skills that are ranked as less important today but growing strongly 
in the future: advanced data analysis, complex information processing, adaptability—as well 
as teaching and training.

Exhibit 9

On the left side of the chart are skills that employers expect to need less in the future. In 
the upper-left quadrant, physical and manual and basic cognitive skills that are key today 
will experience a stark decline in coming years. These skills include basic data input and 
processing; basic literacy, numeracy and communication; and general equipment operation 
and navigation. Similarly, gross motor skills are perceived as less important today and will 
decline in the future. It is interesting to note, however, that while gross motor skills were 
identified as being less important today, they are one of the largest skill categories in both 
the United States and Europe, accounting for more than 10 percent of hours worked.

2. SHIFTING SKILL REQUIREMENTS 
IN FIVE SECTORS 

24 The data for skill shifts in these sectors are based on MGI’s mid-point automation adoption scenario. The 
variation in skill distribution will  be larger or smaller if AI diffusion is faster or slower. AI diffusion may take place 
at different speeds, depending on country.

25 Daniel Goleman, Emotional intelligence, New York, 1996.

Our analysis of skill shifts in five sectors highlights many similarities in changing patterns of 
skills’ requirements, but also some considerable variation (Exhibit 11). For example, while 
social and emotional skills will be in growing demand across all five sectors, the need for 
basic cognitive skills will decline in banking and manufacturing but stay flat in healthcare 
and only fall back slightly in retail. Exhibit 12 shows the key skills categories in each sector.24 
(A more detailed set of infographics at the end of this chapter highlights the anticipated skill 
shifts for each sector).

In general, while the range of required skills varies from sector to sector, workers in all 
sectors will need to become more adaptable in the future, as automation and AI adoption 
transform the workplace. Just as emotional intelligence was recognized in the 1990s as an 
increasingly important determining factor for individual success, alongside more general 
intelligence, adaptability may become a significant differentiator for workers in a future with 
automation.25

22 McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

Banking and insurance 
Financial services have been at the forefront of digital adoption, and banking and insurance 
is likely to be one of the sectors with the most pervasive workforce transition in the years 
ahead, with significant implications for skill shifts.26 Machine learning and new capabilities 
in deep learning—which include artificial neural networks, among the most advanced AI 
techniques—will allow for more intelligent predictions concerning assessing and managing 
risk for loan underwriting and fraud detection.27 The potential AI use is also significant in 
marketing and sales, where evolving technologies enable personalized targeting of products 
for customers. Functions including those undertaken by paralegals, insurance underwriters, 
and sales agents, could be increasingly automated.

The next wave of smart automation will have a sizable impact on the industry: 38 percent 
of employment is currently in back-office jobs that are more susceptible to automation and 
which will see a decrease in total hours worked by 2030 of as much as 20 percent. Our 
analysis indicates that jobs such as tellers, accountants, and brokerage clerks will decline 
substantially as automation is adopted. As a result, the need for a workforce using only 
basic cognitive skills, such as data input and processing and basic literacy and numeracy, 
will likely decline sharply in this sector. The number of technology and other professionals 
will grow, and we also see growth in customer interaction occupations, including managers. 
This will drive strong growth in demand for social and emotional skills. All financial 
institutions will also continue to hire technologists and AI experts who will develop and 
manage their applications, hence lifting demand for technological skills, although not as 
strongly as for other sectors, as banking is already one of the most digitized sectors.

Energy and mining 
Digital technologies and automation have already begun to change the basic materials and 
energy industries (including mining, oil and gas, and utilities), enabling companies to tap 
into new reserves and increase extraction efficiency. Fully integrated digital platforms can 
optimize material and equipment flow and anticipate equipment failures, as well as enable 
real-time operations management.28 AI applications could have a significant impact in 
extraction and production, including through analytics-driven lean programs, in operations 
focusing on predictive maintenance, and in support functions, where smart capital spending 
programs could reduce financing costs, for example.

As automation is increasingly deployed in the industry, as much as 30 percent of predictable 
manual work will be displaced, including activities carried out by power plant and welding 
machine operators, along with administrative jobs that involve data manipulation, such as 
meter readers. Conversely, our analysis shows strong growth in technological jobs along the 
tech value chain and including software developers and computer systems analysts. As a 
result, physical and manual skills along with basic cognitive skills are expected to decrease, 
while demand for all other skills in higher cognitive, social and emotional, and technological 
categories should grow.

Healthcare 
The healthcare sector is expected to grow significantly as populations age. At current trends 
in expenditures, total spending on healthcare could reach 20 percent or more of GDP in 
Western European countries and up to 24 percent in the United States by 2030. Digital 
will play a big part of this growth through connectivity, enabling patient co-management, 
real-time analytics, and automation that will improve patient experience, clinical outcomes, 
and provider efficiency. Healthcare employment growth in the United States and Europe 
has been driven by demographic change, as populations in these countries age, and could

23McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

continue increasing. However, growth could be constrained by the availability of suitable 
talent. Care providers such as nursing assistants, registered nurses, and home health aides 
have become fast-growing occupations (although shortages of nurses and other caring 
professionals may constrain their growth going forward).

AI and automation will change the interaction between patients and healthcare 
professionals, as AI technologies complement care providers as part of their daily 
routine.29 In terms of jobs, care providers such as nurses will continue to see growth, while 
office support staff will see decreases due to automation of tasks in record keeping and 
administration. Overall total employment is expected to grow. Advanced IT skills, basic 
digital skills, entrepreneurship, and adaptability will see the largest double-digit cumulative 
growth. However, demand for skills such as inspecting and monitoring patient vitals and 
medical equipment will stagnate, despite the overall growth in healthcare, as machines take 
over more routine tasks.

Perhaps more surprisingly, healthcare is the only sector in our analysis in which the need for 
physical and manual skills will grow in the years to 2030. This reflects the gross motor skills 
and strength needed for occupations such as eldercare and physical therapy, and the fine 
motor skills required of registered nurses inserting IVs and other medical devices, and of 
surgeons and other doctors. Nonetheless, the share of physical and manual skills and basic 
cognitive skills in the workforce will still decrease compared to other skills.

Manufacturing 
AI and automation should drive considerable value along the manufacturing value chain 
to 2030, including with predictive maintenance and automated supply chain, real-time 
production, and smart robotics and autonomous machines. Employment in the sector has 
been falling in the United States and Europe, although in the United States, it started rising 
again in the past five years, even as productivity has been growing about 2.5 percent per 
year there and in Europe.

Industry 4.0 will disrupt production functions in factories through better analytics 
and increased human-machine collaboration. It will also have an impact on product 
development and on marketing and sales.

Jobs will be significantly affected by automation adoption, especially in predictable manual 
occupations such as assembly workers, which represent 46 percent of employment in 
the sector today. Occupations such as machine feeders or packaging machine operators 
could decrease by close to 50 percent, according to our analysis. The need for physical and 
manual skills overall in the sector is decreasing at more than twice the rate for the whole 
economy. Similarly, the need for basic cognitive skills decreases as office support functions 
are automated.

At the same time, professional occupations such as sales representatives, engineers, 
managers, and executives are expected to grow. This will lead to growth in the need for 
social and emotional skills, especially advanced communication and negotiation, leadership 
and management, and adaptability. The need for technological skills will increase, both for 
advanced IT skills and basic digital skills, as more technology professionals are required 
but also more technology-enabled jobs such as engineers are created. Finally, the need 
for higher cognitive skills will grow, driven by the need for greater creativity and complex 
information processing.

24 McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

Retail 
Digital technologies will drive significant skill shifts in the retail sector in the years to 2030. 
E-commerce and online channels are now standard for all major retailers, and this has 
prompted a shift in employment within the industry. Customer interaction, managers and 
executives, and professional occupations have grown rapidly within retail, while office 
support and predictable manual skills, used in activities such as stocking, have been flat 
or declining.

AI and smart automation will continue to reshape the revenue and margins of retailers.30 
In the United States, self-checkout machines will replace cashiers, robots will restock 
shelves, machine learning will improve prediction of customer demand, and sensors will 
help inventory management—and transform how stores operate. The transformation could 
be dramatic.

Our analysis shows that the share of predictable manual jobs, such as drivers, packers, 
and shelf stockers, will decline substantially, by more than 25 percent. Jobs that remain 
will be concentrated in customer service, management, and technology deployment 
and maintenance. Demand for all physical and manual skills and for basic data input 
and processing will decline by cumulative double-digit percentages, while growth will 
be very strong in skills required to help customers find goods and make sales: creativity 
and interpersonal skills and empathy will grow by close to 50 percent. Advanced IT skills 
and programming alongside complex information processing skills will also see a surge 
in demand, as retailers harness the potential of data analytics and AI. Many large retail 
chains will find they need more flexible workers, who can alternatively help customers, 
answer queries, and take on supervisory roles. They will need fewer workers with only basic 
cognitive skills, including cashiers collecting payments. Even after factoring in rising incomes 
and population growth to 2030, total employment in the industry may decline in Europe and 
grow only slightly in the United States as new technologies raise productivity.

Some of this will be offset by growth in e-commerce fulfillment centers.31 E-commerce 
is projected to grow by 12.3 percent annually in the United States and by 8.5 percent 
annually in Western Europe over the next five years to 2022, reaching $700 billion 
in sales in the United States and $400 billion in Western Europe.32 But the shift to 
e-commerce will translate into changing demand for a range of skills, including less need 
for basic communication skills, as workers in fulfillment centers do not directly interact 
with customers.

••• 

Skills are shifting. As occupations are transformed by the rise of automation and AI 
technologies, the requirements for workers will also change markedly. Some basic physical 
and cognitive skills will no longer suffice to ensure that people find work, as machines 
take over activities from assembly-line processing to routine data entry. At the same time, 
advanced skills—both technological and more broadly higher cognitive—will see a growth 
in demand. Social and emotional skills will be at a premium, as some caring professions 
in healthcare and other occupations requiring human interaction continue to employ 
people, and as creativity, problem solving, and people leadership grow in importance. The 
implications of these changes are highly significant for companies and for the workers they 
employ. In the next chapter, we explore how the changes could play out in the workplace.

Introduction
Automation and digital 
technologies have already 
begun to change the mining 
and energy industries, 
enabling companies to tap 
new reserves, increase 
extraction efficiency, and 
optimize material and 
equipment flow. The next 
wave of AI and smart 
automation will enable further 
improvements, enabling more 
accurate demand forecasts, 
predictive maintenance, and 
fully automated extraction 
operations. 

Predictable manual work, 
such as drivers and field 
operators, is susceptible to 
being displaced, as are 
administrative jobs and those 
that involve data 
manipulation, such as meter 
readers, while demand for 
technological jobs will be 
buoyant. As a result, demand 
for physical and manual skills 
along with basic cognitive 
skills are expected to 
decrease, while demand for 
all other skills in higher 
cognitive, social and

categories are expected to 
grow.

Introduction
Demand for healthcare is 
expected to grow significantly 
as populations age, although 
cost pressures and potential 
shortages of care workers 
may constrain growth. 
Automation and AI will enable 
large gains in both efficiency 
and quality, enabling patient 
co-management, real-time 
analytics, and improved 
treatment methods. 

Care providers such as 
nurses will continue to see 
growing demand, while office 
support staff will see 
decreases due to automation 
of tasks in record keeping 
and administration. Advanced 
IT skills, basic digital skills, 
entrepreneurship, and 
creativity will see the largest 
double-digit growth in 
demand. However, demand 
for skills such as inspecting 
and monitoring patient vitals 
and medical equipment will 
stagnate. Healthcare is one of 
the few sectors that will see 
growing need for physical and 
manual skills, reflecting gross 
motor skills and strength 
needed for eldercare and 
physical therapy, and fine 
motor skills required of 
registered nurses inserting 
IVs, and of surgeons and 
other doctors.

Introduction
The next wave of automation 
and AI in manufacturing will 
continue to disrupt production 
functions in factories through 
better analytics, predictive 
maintenance, and increased 
human-machine 
collaboration. It will also have 
an impact on product 
development and on 
marketing and sales. 

Demand for physical and 
manual skills overall in the 
sector is decreasing at more 
than twice the rate for the 
whole economy, and demand 
for basic cognitive skills is 
also declining as office 
support functions are 
automated. Professional 
occupations such as sales 
representatives and 
engineers will grow, as will 
production technicians. This 
will drive an increase in the 
need for social-emotional and 
higher cognitive skills, such 
as communication and 
negotiation, adaptability and 
continuous learning, and 
leadership. The need for 
technological skills will also 
increase, both for advanced 
IT skills for technology 
professionals and basic 
digital skills required of 
technicians and others.

Introduction
Digital technologies will drive 
significant skill shifts in the 
retail sector. E-commerce and 
online channels are now 
standard for all major 
retailers, and AI and smart 
automation will transform the 
retail experience, as self-
checkout machines replace 
cashiers, robots restock 
shelves, and machine 
learning improves prediction 
of customer demand. 

Jobs requiring physical and 
manual skills will decline, 
such as drivers, packers, and 
shelf stockers. Positions 
requiring mainly basic 
cognitive skills, such as 
cashiers, will also decline. 
Jobs that remain will be 
concentrated in customer 
service, management, and 
technology deployment and 
maintenance. The sector will 
see strong growth in workers 
with interpersonal skills, 
creativity, and adaptability. 
Advanced IT skills and 
programming skills will also 
see a surge in demand, as 
new technologies are 
deployed and maintained 
across the sector.

3. HOW WILL ORGANIZATIONS ADAPT? 

33 Survey conducted in March 2018 among 3,031 C-level executives from companies with more than 30 
employees in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States, across 14 
sectors: high tech/IT/technology, manufacturing, construction, retail/trade, media and entertainment, 
telecommunications, tourism/hospitality/leisure, travel/transport/logistics, financial services/banking/
insurance, professional services, education, healthcare, energy/mining/oil and gas/utilities, and government; 
see appendix for details.

Automation adoption will not only accelerate skill shifts for individual workers. It will also have 
profound implications for the workplace and the way companies are organized. To harness 
the new technologies to their full effect, firms will need to rethink and retool their corporate 
structure and their approaches to work. That means redesigned business processes and a 
new focus on the talent they have—and the talent they need.

In this chapter, we look at the changing paradigms around work as new technologies alter 
long-established patterns of corporate organization. Contrary to much conventional wisdom 
in the public debate over AI, companies do not expect that adoption of these technologies 
will reduce aggregate employment in the short term; indeed, companies that have already 
extensively adopted automation and AI expect to raise headcount rather than reduce it, as 
they innovate and grow. Our research also highlights the expectations of business leaders 
that organizations in the future will be flatter, with more cross-functional teams and greater 
use of external contractors. We may see a significant reallocation of some tasks between 
workers of different skill and qualification levels, creating “new collar” jobs, as firms seek to 
deploy their talent pool more effectively—a development that could help boost middle-wage 
jobs. Human resources (HR) departments, but also executive leadership teams, will need to 
evolve along with the workforce and structure of their organizations.

MOST COMPANIES EXPECT THE SIZE OF THEIR WORKFORCES IN EUROPE 
AND THE UNITED STATES TO STAY THE SAME OR GROW AS THEY ADOPT 
AUTOMATION 
A finding of our executive survey concerns overall employment levels over the next three 
years.33 About 77 percent of the respondents in our survey expect no net change in the size 
of their workforces either in the United States or in Europe as a result of adopting automation 
and AI technologies. Indeed, over 17 percent expect their workforces on both sides of the 
Atlantic to grow. The composition of jobs and skills will shift, however. Some jobs will shrink 
after automation, while others will expand. And about 6 percent of companies foresee an 
overall decline in the size of their US and European workforces.

The expectation of a growing or unchanged workforce in the short term is most pronounced 
among companies that see themselves as extensive adopters of automation and AI, with 
almost one in four saying they expect their workforces to grow (Exhibit 13). Extensive 
adopters also see a substantial financial upside from their automation strategies, and are 
focused on new growth opportunities from adopting these technologies rather than cost-
cutting (see Box 4, “Extensive adopters invest heavily in automation and AI, and expect 
substantial revenue gains, amplifying ‘superstar’ dynamics”).

This survey only gauges relatively short-term expectations for the next three years. 
Nonetheless it confirms other findings, both from other surveys and from our own prior 
quantitative modeling, that support the idea of no substantial aggregate employment 
declines relating to automation and AI adoption. A McKinsey & Company survey in 
February 2018 that asked similar questions about employment prospects found that top 
executives expect far smaller changes in the size of their workforces than others fear. 
C-suite respondents to that survey said they expected only 5 percent of the workforce 
would be displaced and about 19 percent of employees to move laterally into different or 
new roles. This forecast outcome was different from that given by midlevel managers at the 

36 McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce



same companies, who expected 10 percent of employees to be displaced, or double the 
proportion envisaged by senior managers.34 

In a previous report on workforce transitions, we modeled job losses from automation and 
AI compared with the jobs potentially gained from the higher productivity and new products 
and services enabled by new technologies.35 That research, along with the work of others, 
confirms the broader finding that automation will likely lead to aggregate job increases 
rather than decreases.36 In addition, history shows that many new jobs of the future will be 
in occupations that do not exist today. One study found that 0.56 percent of new jobs in the 
United States each year are in new occupations, implying that roughly 7 percent of jobs in 
2030 will be in occupations that do not currently exist.37 A key question for policy makers, 
companies, and individual workers will be to ensure that the job reallocation happens faster 
than the shift in skills.

34 See the results of a 2018 McKinsey & Company Global Survey on automation, to be published in June 2018.
35 We estimated that between 400 and 800 million workers could be displaced under automation adoption 

scenarios on the one hand, and, on the other hand, that labor demand from selected catalysts could create 
work for between 555 and 890 million full-time equivalents in the same period. Those catalysts include rising 
incomes, especially in emerging economies, rising healthcare needs of aging populations, and investment in 
infrastructure, energy and technology development itself. Ibid. Jobs lost, jobs gained, December 2017.

Box 4. Extensive adopters invest heavily in automation and AI, and expect 
substantial revenue gains, amplifying “superstar” dynamics 

1 Digital America: A tale of the haves and have-mores, McKinsey Global Institute, December 2015; and Digital 
Europe: Pushing the frontier, capturing the benefits, McKinsey Global Institute, June 2016. 

Our prior work on digital technologies has highlighted the “winner takes all” dynamics and 
superior performance of companies at the frontier of adopting digital technologies and AI 
compared with lagging firms.1 Firms that are early adopters of automation might benefit from 
technology investments through product and service innovations and extensions. This in turn 
would likely lead to the rise of new “superstar” companies that have a high-skill and highly paid 
workforce doing digital, nonroutine tasks. On the other hand, a cohort of companies that are 
late adopters of automation—or do not adopt it at all—might also emerge. However, absent 
retraining efforts, these would lose market share to early adopters and would have difficulties 
sourcing the talent they need. 

The companies in our survey largely reflect these trends, with the more extensive adopters of 
automation and AI having better financial performance than their peers and investing more 
in new technologies. Two-thirds of the companies that classified themselves as extensive 
adopters of automation and AI technologies invest more than 25 percent of their total 
investment budgets on digitization technologies—and 71 percent of them expect revenue 
increases of more than 10 percent. Four in five of these extensive adopters also report better 
financial performance than their peers. (Extensive adopters claim to have adopted automation 
and AI technologies in most of their business processes or throughout their entire operating 
model; limited adopters claim to have adopted these technologies in none or only some minor 
aspects of their business.) 

These expectations are significantly higher than the revenue expectations and reported 
financial performance of limited adopters, which are less inclined to invest heavily and which 
expect less top-line payoff from adopting automation and AI. Perhaps what most starkly 
sets limited and extensive adopters apart is their vision for the adoption of automation and AI 
technologies. While extensive adopters seek to fundamentally redesign their business model, 
most limited adopters are looking for incremental business process improvements and cost 
advantages (Exhibit 14). 

As with the adoption of other technologies, the pattern of significant growth and revenue gains 
going to firms at the forefront of adoption looks set to continue. Their ability to reinvest these 
gains and pull even further ahead of competitors may create an insurmountable advantage, and 
increases the importance of all companies to consider how automation and AI could affect their 
businesses. 

The most advanced adopters of AI and automation will also have an advantage when it comes 
to hiring, as they will tend to attract talent and can offer higher wages, if they successfully 
reap the productivity and performance gains from the technology adoption. They will have the 
freedom of choice to hire, as well as potentially contracting or retraining as suits their approach 
to ensuring that they have the relevant skills they need. This may be much harder for companies 
at the other end of the spectrum, those slow to adopt AI and automation, or are resistant to it. 
The risk for these firms is that their attractiveness to talent may be limited and that the wages 
they offer may be lower as a result of not reaping the economic benefits from the technologies 
as much as their superstar peers. This will in turn limit their strategic talent choices, forcing them 
to depend more on retraining and contracting. 

This bifurcation between leaders and laggards may have macroeconomic consequences. The 
lack of people upgrading skills sufficiently fast at the laggard companies might limit the return 
on investment in AI technology itself. And limited wage growth of workers doing nondigital, 
nonroutine work might, by consequence, also limit the overall economic benefit from overspill to 
overall consumption in other sectors.  



39McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

NEW TECHNOLOGIES WILL REQUIRE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN 
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES AND WAYS OF WORKING 
Many companies expect organizational changes will be necessary as they adopt 
automation and AI. This expectation is consistent with a growing body of evidence—and 
sometimes painful experiences—with previous attempts at technology implementation. The 
first wave of information and communications technologies and the internet, which began 
in the 1990s, took many years before companies began to realize the benefits, which they 
only felt after they redesigned their business processes to harness the power of the new 
technologies.38 The productivity improvements from adoption of computer technology took 
time to show up in overall economic data, a lag often known as the “Solow paradox,” after 
the MIT economist Robert Solow, who was among the first to point it out in his famous quip: 
“You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.”39 

In our survey, four in ten of the business leaders who are extensive adopters expect to 
“fundamentally” change their companies’ organizational structure as a result of adopting 
automation and AI. Among the moderate adopters, more than one in four expect a 
fundamental organizational reorganization, but that drops to one in ten for the limited 
adopters (Exhibit 15).40

40 McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

Our findings suggest that organizations will change in four key ways.41 First, companies will 
undergo a mindset shift: a key to their future success will be in providing continuous learning 
options and instilling a culture of lifelong learning throughout the organization. Second, the 
basic organizational setup will change: there will be a strong shift toward cross-functional 
and team-based work, more agile ways of working with less hierarchy, and new business 
units may need to be created. Third, the allocation of work activities will be altered, with work 
being “unbundled” and “rebundled.” This will allow companies (and particularly extensive 
adopters) to make the most effective use of different qualification levels in their workforce. 
Fourth, workforce composition will shift. More work will be contracted to freelancers 
and other contractors, boosting the emerging “gig” or “sharing” economy (Exhibit 16). To 
orchestrate these changes, senior leadership and certain functions will be key. CEOs and 
their top executives who will face these challenges will need to adopt the right automation 
and AI mindset, along with the knowledge they need to navigate the change. Human 
resources departments will also have to undergo profound change in the way they work, as 
skills and roles change and as talent grows in importance.

41 For a discussion of workplace changes, see Jacques Bughin, Susan Lund, and Jaana Remes, “Ten new work

41McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

Continuous learning is viewed as the most important element for a changing 
workforce 
Irrespective of their expected level of automation adoption, a large portion of the companies 
we surveyed see a significant need for their workforce to upgrade their skills and continue 
to learn and adapt throughout their working lives. In fact, establishing a culture of lifelong 
learning was ranked by companies across most sectors as the change most needed for 
developing the workforce of the future.

This is in line with our finding that providing on-the-job training is essential for preparing 
the workforce for the skills of the future, which all sectors and levels of adoption agree on 
(38 percent of respondents in total). Similarly, 34 percent of respondents say that providing 
lifelong learning opportunities for employees is a top priority for navigating the change.

The need to continuously retrain and provide new skills to the workforce applies to all 
companies, even tech giants, such as Google. When the Mountain View, California-based 
internet company moved from a desktop-first to a mobile-first and then to an AI-first 
mindset, skills had to be upgraded accordingly—especially among the engineers. The 
firm introduced a “Learn with Google AI” training program as a fast-paced introduction 
to machine learning and trained more than 18,000 employees globally over two years, a 
third of its engineering headcount. The course has now been made available publicly free 
of charge.42 In mining, Rio Tinto is increasingly adopting autonomous vehicles in some 
of its mines, which will require workers to develop new vehicle repair, operation, and 
maintenance skills.43

Moving to an agile corporate structure that features less hierarchy and more 
collaborative team networks 
Just as “lean management” became a major trend starting in the 1970s, “agility” has 
become a core management topic in recent years, as companies have sought to shift 
from “mechanical” to “organic” organizations (see Box 5, “Taking “lean” to the extreme: 
the “Holacracy” self-management system”). Agility has acquired a specific meaning in 
management terms, as the ability of an organization to renew itself, adapt, change quickly, 
and succeed in a rapidly changing, ambiguous and sometimes turbulent environment.44 
In management literature, this has come to embrace different types of teams and 
organizational units known as “chapters,” “guilds,” “squads,” and “tribes,” as well as modes 
of working, such as “sprints.” In place of siloed departments governed by hierarchies, 
organizations see themselves shifting toward a more flexible system in which individuals 
move among teams and projects (Exhibit 17).45

McKinsey & Company, December 2015.

45 Management literature on the theme of agility has proliferated. See, for example,The five trademarks of agile 
organizations, McKinsey & Company, January 2018; Leadership & organization blog, “Getting agile right 
in your organization,” McKinsey & Company blog post by Aaron De Smet, February 5, 2018; Jeff Boss, “5

Unlike traditional hierarchies, which are designed mainly for stability, agile organizations are 
designed for both stability and dynamism. They typically consist of a network of teams and 
are notable for rapid learning and fast decision cycles. Companies that have adopted team-
based and project work have experienced a boost in productivity—if they match the right 
people with the right jobs.46 Leadership indicates the direction and enables action but gives 
teams end-to-end accountability. The teams can thus act and are free to navigate flexibly 
and make changes quickly.

Companies that move to more fluid team-based working environments experience a 
boost in productivity of their workforces from better matching of employees to tasks and 
from higher employee engagement. In our survey, companies listed agility and working 
together in teams that collaborate across functional lines as among the most important 
organizational changes that will result from adopting automation and AI technologies. 
More than 20 percent of respondents said that introducing more agile ways of working 
will be a major organizational change, and a similar proportion described more cross-
functional collaboration as a key going forward. As companies redesign work to harness 
new technologies, they often find that processes can become adaptable, requiring a more 
flexible workforce.

Quarterly, March 2016.

The Lean Enterprise Model was introduced by Toyota 
in the 1970s and quickly found admirers around the 
world. Lean thinking—based on the reduction of 
waste and inefficiencies and the elimination of non-
value adding activities, among other things—has led 
to numerous organizational changes to improve the 
efficiency of internal processes. These include a reduced 
hierarchical structure, teams as basic building blocks, 
and blurred boundaries between the different parts of the 
organization. As such, it has much in common with the 
more recent push for corporate agility.1 

Today, more “extreme” forms of lean management and 
agility are being tested. They include “Holacracy,” a 
self-management practice for organizations based on 
the elimination of job titles and manager roles, increased 
autonomy for teams and individuals, and an adaptable 
organizational structure. Rigid job descriptions are 
replaced by fluid roles, manager authority is distributed 
to teams and roles, and decisions are made locally. 
Organizational structures are regularly revisited and 
revised—and transparent. The method was created 
in 2007 by software developer Brian Robertson and 

Tom Thomison, an engineer. who say that hundreds of 
companies worldwide have since adopted the method.2 

One of the most prominent adopters of Holacracy—
and, with more than 1,500 employees, also by far the 
largest—is Zappos, the Las Vegas-based online shoe and 
apparel retailer. The company decided to topple classic 
organizational hierarchies and adopt the Holacracy 
method in 2013. This meant distributing decision-
making authority in self-organizing circles, made up 
of employees who hold multiple roles, with each circle 
arranged around a purpose statement. Zappos founder 
Tony Hsieh says he hopes this makes the company more 
adaptable, innovative, and resilient, and that it empowers 
employees to find the intersection of what they are good 
at, passionate about, and adds value to the business.3 
The company’s organizational chart changes numerous 
times a day, but is always available in real time online, 
and employees can view every other employee’s roles 
and responsibilities. Hsieh says Zappos employees have 
turned into mini-entrepreneurs who are fully empowered 
to pursue their ideas and interests, while being united by 
common values and a joint purpose. The experiment has 
attracted considerable media attention.4 



44 McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

Company leaders in our survey also ranked “less hierarchy” among the coming top seven 
organizational changes they envisaged. This is consistent with more agility, as moving to 
team-based work removes some layers of middle management. In practical terms, less 
hierarchy also means moves toward flatter organizations, in which employees make more 
lateral career moves to gain experience in different areas, in contrast to the traditional model 
of vertical promotions up a career ladder. Some consider that the hierarchical, ladder-like 
progression is outdated, and is being supplanted by a more supple “lattice” structure.47 This 
enables workers to build a wider variety of skills and engage in continuous learning.

For some companies, more team-based work and reduced hierarchy lead to private offices 
with open work spaces. There is increasing recognition among executives that the design of 
office space can foster collaboration and innovation—or hinder it. Open offices, in particular, 
are drawing criticism.48 

Examples of companies across different sectors who have been integrating such changes 
in their operations include:

  In financial services, the Dutch banking group ING in 2015 shifted its traditional 
organization to an “agile” model inspired by companies such as Google, Netflix, and 
Spotify. Comprising about 350 nine-person “squads” in 13 so-called tribes, the new 
approach at ING has already improved time to market, boosted employee engagement, 
and increased productivity.49 

  In manufacturing, 3M, a US maker of office supplies and other products, created an 
internal workforce planning platform that increased mobility within the company and 
flexibility in forming teams; it experienced a 4 percent overall boost to productivity as a 
result.50 

  In automotive manufacturing, after years of building robotic factories, BMW in South 
Carolina is ramping up hiring of human workers. It says that combining people with 
machines on its automotive assembly lines increases the flexibility to build multiple 
models in smaller batches and thus respond to shifting customer demands more 
quickly.51 

  In tech, software company Adobe redesigned its Manhattan office, the use of which was 
declining as many employees chose to work remotely. The company decided to move 
away from a layout consumed with individual offices. Instead of just opting for more 
collaborative space, Adobe management involved their employees to determine what 
they needed to support their daily work. The result was a more transparent office space 
that allowed for greater perspective on others’ activities and more technology to support 
collaboration—both virtual and in-person.52

The “new collar” jobs: unbundling and rebundling tasks into jobs 
As business processes are redefined and automation and AI take over some activities, 
companies have an opportunity to reassess which workers do which tasks. In particular, 
they can reallocate tasks among workers of different qualification levels, for example shifting 
some activities previously undertaken by their most skilled and best-paid talent to workers 
with lower skills, who would thus be empowered to take on more complex tasks. Such 
unbundling and rebundling raises company efficiency—and it can also create a new set of 
middle-skill jobs.53 For example, registered nurses and physician assistants now do some of 
the tasks that primary care physicians once carried out, such as administering vaccinations, 
prescribing medication, and examining patients with routine illnesses. At utilities, grid 
technicians can spend more time on problem solving instead of logging inspection status 
by hand. Other examples are proliferating across industries, as companies seek to free up 
time of their top talent and harness their creativity. One of the effects of this reallocation is to 
reduce the need for middle management.54 

As manufacturing employment declines across advanced economies, these new, 
rebundled jobs may form the next “middle class.” Research by Anthony Carnevale and 
colleagues at Georgetown University has identified “good jobs” in the United States, those 
that require less than a four-year college degree but pay more than the median wage.55 In 
fact, there are about 30 million “good jobs” that do not require an undergraduate degree and 
will pay an average of $55,000, and minimum of $35,000.

In our survey, 40 percent of companies describing themselves as extensive adopters 
of automation and AI expect to extensively shift tasks currently performed by high-skill 
workers to lower-skill ones. This is significantly higher than for companies with less 
ambition for their automation: only 20 percent of moderate adopters and 11 percent of 
limited adopters expressed the expectation of this type of unbundling and rebundling. This 
reflects the greater willingness—and perhaps experience to date—of extensive adopters of 
automation to fundamentally reorganize their businesses and workplaces as they harness 
new technologies.

Companies are already beginning to alter work activity allocation as new job profiles 
are being created in response to robotic automation. IBM is one company that has 
started to embrace these “new-collar workers”—individuals with job profiles at the nexus 
of professional and trade work, combining technical skills with a higher educational 
background. IBM CEO Virginia Rometty says these entirely new jobs will be relevant in fields 
such as AI and cybersecurity. To source this new stratum of jobs, IBM is partnering with 
vocational schools to shape curricula and build a pipeline of future new-collar workers.56 

New collar jobs at the nexus of traditional blue collar jobs and white collar managerial jobs 
could redefine the workforce broadly across sectors. For example, as sales organizations 
use automation to generate leads and identify opportunities for cross-selling and upselling,

frontline salespeople will have more time to interact with customers and improve the quality 
of offers. Mortgage-loan officers could spend less time inspecting and processing rote 
paperwork and more time reviewing exceptions. Automation thus will have a tangible effect 
on job profiles across different industries, yielding new job descriptions.57 

Growing role of independent contractors and freelancers as project-based 
work gains in prominence 
Another important byproduct of the move toward more team-based work and agile 
organizations is the potential for companies to hire independent contractors to supply 
specific skills at specific times. In our survey, greater use of various types of freelancers and 
temporary workers is one of the top organizational changes. When asked about what types 
of labor company leaders were planning on using most in the future, 61 percent said they 
expected to hire more temporary employees (Exhibit 18). Another option is to use external 
contractors on an individual basis or through agencies.

For companies, growing use of contractors has several benefits. It enables them to hire 
specific types of talent and fill gaps in their workforce skills, and to transform some of the 
fixed costs. Digital platforms have allowed companies to source specific types of skills and 
talent to identify potential candidates. The independent workforce could consequently 
continue its growth in the future.58 

Digital platforms create large-scale marketplaces where workers connect with buyers of 
services. In doing so, they are transforming independent work, building on the ubiquity of 
mobile devices, the enormous pools of workers and customers they can reach, and the 
ability to harness rich real-time information to make more efficient matches. Specifically, 
there are three types of platforms for independent work. First, platforms for labor services 
match individual workers with customers who desire their services (for example, Upwork, 
Freelancer.com, Uber, Lyft, or Deliveroo). Second, platforms for selling goods function as

e-commerce marketplaces. Some of these platforms are sector specific. For example, in 
retail, platforms such as Etsy and DaWanda enable individual artisans including potters and 
blanket knitters to sell their goods directly to customers globally. In healthcare, San Diego-
based Freelance Physician, provides a marketplace for healthcare professionals. Finally, 
there are platforms for renting out assets. These have given rise to the sharing economy 
model. Besides pioneer Airbnb, other platforms allow people to make use temporarily 
of assets including cars (for example, BlaBlaCar), fashion (Rent the Runway), and yachts 
(Boatsetter). In 2016, these online marketplaces were used by 15 percent of independent 
workers. The rapid growth of the largest platforms suggests that we may only have just 
begun to see their impact. Companies could also use platforms internally to match the best-
suited talent when staffing teams.

Previous MGI research documented both the large share of the workforce earning 
income through independent work and the strong satisfaction of many of those who work 
independently out of choice.59 MGI research finds that up to 30 percent of the working-age 
population in the United States and in the EU-15 earn income through independent work 
arrangements, including freelancers, contractors, temporary workers placed by staffing 
agencies, and participants in the online gig or sharing economy. Over 70 percent of these 
people participate in independent work by choice. A survey by Upwork and the Freelancers 
Union projects that at current growth rates, over half of the labor force will be independent 
workers by 2027.60 

C-SUITE EXECUTIVES AND HUMAN RESOURCE FUNCTIONS WILL ALSO NEED 
TO ADAPT TO THE NEW AUTOMATION ERA 
To bring about these changes is not simply a question of giving orders. Changes of skills 
and of mindset are also needed in C-suite and HR departments, as companies seek to 
reap the full benefits of automation and AI. An understanding of the technology is a starting 
point. In our survey, 19 percent of respondents said their top executives lacked sufficient 
understanding of technologies to lead the organization through the adoption of automation 
and AI—the second-highest rated barrier to automation and AI adoption. Senior executive 
acceptance of technology adoption is crucial.61 An executive team that itself does not 
understand the technology enough to see all the potential opportunities cannot lead the 
significant business process redesign and organizational transformation required. While 
we are not saying that CEOs and their teams need to become AI experts, they do need a 
basic understanding of the different types of AI and how they can be applied in a business 
setting.62 

Human resources will also need to change as technology alters the way organizations 
work and the size and nature of the workforce. Nearly all business leaders we surveyed 
(88 percent) said they believe HR functions will need to adapt at least moderately. 
However, there are stark differences in perceptions depending on the expected adoption 
of automation; 36 percent of extensive adopters expect HR functions will need to be 
fundamentally changed, compared with 19 percent for limited adopters (Exhibit 19).

Across industries, leading companies are promoting the role of the chief human resources 
officer (CHRO) to join the CFO and CEO as the leadership core.63 By linking talent and 
financing, the G3 will work constantly to ensure that both talent and finance will be

appropriately linked in all mission-critical decisions, operations, and planning. “People 
allocation is as powerful as financial allocation,” explains Aon CEO Gregory Case, 
who works closely with CHRO Tony Goland and CFO Christa Davies to make sure the 
multinational has the right talent to meet the challenges of the future. “We work together 
to make talent decisions and integrate solutions. Pure capital allocation standpoint is 
essential, but that’s not enough. Do we have the right talent in place? How should we think 
about talent development?”64 For the CHRO to play this strategic role, knowledge of the 
business operations is essential. This is why many companies are developing business unit 
executives rather than HR experts for the CHRO role. These CHROs delegate the more 
administrative aspects of the job to others and focus on the strategic and operational issues 
of building the workforce of the future.

••• 

Adopting automation and AI in the workplace will be an organizational challenge for 
companies, with significant repercussions for how they think about their operations and 
how they deploy their workforces. The skill shifts of their workforces will be both a driver of 
their organizational changes and one of its consequences. In the final chapter, we look at the 
different options companies have in building the workforce of the future.

4. BUILDING THE WORKFORCE OF THE FUTURE 

65 See Bengt-Åke Lundvall, The learning economy and the economics of hope, London, Anthem, 2016; Joseph 
Stiglitz, “Creating a learning society,” The Amartya Sen Lecture, June 28, 2012. 

66 In a February 2018 McKinsey survey of 750 executives, almost 30 percent of respondents perceived the skills 
gap to be the biggest challenge their companies would confront they began their automation efforts. This was 
the second most cited response after the need to understand the business opportunity of automation and AI.

At a time of more rapidly changing skill requirements and new organizational structures, 
companies face a substantial challenge in preparing their workforces for the new era. As 
we have seen from the results of our survey, most firms do not foresee mass substitution of 
humans by machines as the answer (although in some specific industries and occupations, 
this may be the case). Rather their focus is on building a workforce with the right skills to 
complement the new technologies and enable the company to harness their power. That 
will be a significant challenge not just for the companies themselves, but for society more 
broadly as it seeks to construct a “learning economy” in which workers’ skills continue to 
evolve, keeping pace with innovation.65 

In this chapter, we lay out actions that companies can take to build a workforce that is 
appropriate for their future, and we discuss the experience of some organizations that have 
already undertaken this mission. The right mix of actions will vary from sector to sector and 
from company to company, depending on sector dynamics, company positioning, and 
other considerations. But some elements are common to all sectors across the economy: 
the imperative to continuously upgrade skills of all workers over time; the need to retrain and 
redeploy some employees as business models change; the importance of being able to hire 
or contract new talent to fill gaps (particularly individuals with advanced technology skills); 
and the need to manage the individual and societal implications when workers are released. 
The stakes are high for both companies and workers, whose wages could stagnate or even 
decline, if they are unable to upgrade their skills to meet the requirements of the new era.

LACK OF SKILLS SEEN AS A BARRIER TO REAPING BENEFITS OF 
AUTOMATION 
Companies view lack of talent and skill mismatches as barriers to reaping the benefits of 
automation. If they cannot source the talent they need to deploy the new technologies, 
and if they cannot upgrade the skills of their workers fast enough, business leaders worry 
that this could hurt their financial performance, impede their growth, and lead to the 
departure of top-performing employees. Their main concerns include employees who do 
not upgrade skills fast enough, are not sufficiently adaptable to move to new types of work, 
or lack requisite technical skills (Exhibit 20). These survey results largely corroborate other 
barometers of company sentiment about concerns over workforce skills and their potentially 
negative impact on performance.66

FIVE ACTIONS TO BUILD THE WORKFORCE SKILLS THAT MATTER IN THE 
FUTURE 
There are five main types of actions that companies will take to build the workforce of the 
future: retrain, redeploy, hire, contract, and release. The combination of options that firms 
adopt will depend to a significant degree on the automation potential for their businesses 
and their current workforce skills and dynamics. Companies that seek to aggressively 
invest in automation to innovate, grow, and capture market share will face a different 
challenge from those focused on using automation to heighten efficiency in slower-
growing businesses.

Each of these categories includes several different specific actions that can be taken and 
different options that can be pursued. We explore the details of each in the sections below.

Exhibit 20

Q: When you think about your organization’s 
skill needs in the future, what are your 
biggest concerns?

Q: What do you expect to be repercussions of 
your organization not being able to get the future 
workforce skills you need?

Employees won't upgrade 
skills fast enough Financial performance will suffer

Workers will not be 
adaptable enough

Top-performing employees will 
leave

Employees will lack 
requisite technical skills

Will not achieve our growth
aspiration

Unable to attract and 
retain talent needed

Will not be able to fully capture 
value from automation or AI 
technologies

Skills needed in the future 
will change more rapidly 
than in the past

Will not be able to expand into 
new markets

Companies fear that their financial performance will suffer if their workforce does not acquire the skills needed for 
the automation era.

Retrain 
This involves three distinct actions: raising the skills capacity of current employees by 
teaching them skills that are new or qualitatively different; raising the existing skills of an 
employee to a higher level or to keep pace with technological change; or hiring entry-level 
employees with the goal of training them in the new skills needed.67 All of these types 
of retraining and training ensure that in-house functional knowledge, experience, and 
understanding of company culture are preserved, even as employees acquire the skills they 
need. This type of investment in human capital can also affect worker motivation and loyalty. 
Training may require longer-than-usual lead time, however, and the setup costs may be high. 
A key choice for companies will be whether to pursue training using in-house resources and 
programs tailored to the company, or to partner with an educational institution to provide 
external learning opportunities for employees (see Box 6, “A tale of two companies: Differing 
approaches to the retraining challenge”). Our executive survey responses show that 
companies plan to focus retraining efforts on skills that are deemed of strategic importance 
to the company, such as advanced IT skills and programming, advanced literacy skills, 
critical thinking, and problem solving. In contrast, they are more likely to hire from outside for 
less complex skills. As discussed in the first chapter of this paper, retraining employees for 
specific technology or STEM skills is more apparent today than figuring out how to upgrade 
or impart “soft skills” such as empathy, managing others, and communication, or “intrinsic 
skills” such as critical thinking or creativity.68 Making progress in these latter categories of 
skills will become increasingly important for companies and, more broadly, for educators.69 
Other research we have conducted on the impact of automation and AI in individual 
Northern European countries highlights the significant return on investment that can be 
achieved through retraining (see Box 7, “The return on investment from retraining: Evidence 
from Northern Europe”).

Redeploy 
A second action is for companies to redeploy workers with specific skills around the firm, 
thereby making better use of the skills capacity already available to them. They can do 
this by unbundling the tasks within a job and then rebundling them in different ways, as 
discussed in the second chapter of this paper; by shifting parts of the workforce to other 
tasks that are of higher importance or to other entities; or by redesigning work processes, 
the execution of which depends only partially, or not at all, on external stakeholders. 
Examples include the German postal service, which is piloting a joint project with the city of 
Bremen, healthcare services, and welfare associations. Instead of just distributing letters, 
mail carriers will also look after elderly citizens as part of their daily routes. They will ring 
the bell of senior inhabitants, ask about their well-being, provide information about care 
services, or call medical aid in case of emergency. This could both boost revenues for the 
postal service and reduce cost for care providers.70 Such redeployment activities ensure 
that skills are used where they are needed. However, redeployment does not increase the 
overall capacity of skills within the workforce. In a McKinsey survey of company leaders 
in February 2018, 55 percent of respondents from companies with $1 billion or more in 
annual revenue said they would move more people laterally into different or brand-new roles 
than release them, which underlines the importance of redeployment in conjunction with 
retraining.71

Irrespective of their expected level of automation 
adoption, most companies we surveyed see a significant 
need for their workforces to upgrade their skills and 
continue to learn and adapt throughout their working 
lives. Two companies on either side of the Atlantic provide 
a contrast in approaches to retraining: SAP and AT&T.1 

Both firms are incumbents in the technology and telecom 
industries with business models that are undergoing 
rapid change. AT&T has moved from being a telephone 
company to a data-powered entertainment and business 
solution company that requires advanced technical skills, 
including coding and data science. SAP, a software 
company, is adopting an Industry 4.0 growth strategy that 
involves disrupting its existing value chains and product 
portfolios toward offering more advanced solutions, such 
as public cloud and machine learning. Each company is 
starting with a relatively educated workforce, but one that 
lacks the cutting-edge skills needed. Both plan to retrain 
up to half their current workforces. 

SAP has taken an in-house approach to raising workforce 
skills. The company first undertook an action-oriented 
analysis of the current skills supply relative to the future 
skills demand based on its future product portfolio 
derived from its strategic business priorities. This led 
to the quantification of a “skills gap”—and the definition 
of action areas to address it—both for the existing 
workforce and for external resources. To source the 
needed external talent, contracting and strategic hiring 
were envisaged. As for the current employee base, 
retraining was designed to address the largest portion 
of workers, while redeployment in the form of physical 
relocations accounted for a minor fraction. To fill its future 
skill needs, SAP mapped comprehensive end-to-end 
“learning journeys” for thousands of employees to help 
them transition into new roles or content areas. These 
learning journeys are based on a blended approach 
that relies on a sequence of classroom training courses 
provided in-house, followed by several weeks of on-
the-job practice in the new roles or content areas and 
underpinned by coaching. Overall learning journeys may 

take between six and 18 months to complete. Shorter-
term learning modules were also developed to close 
specific skills gaps.

AT&T’s approach focuses on external partnerships with 
educators and employee choice. Like SAP, it began by 
mapping out how its workforce skills will change in the 
coming years and posting the roles that it believes will 
decline or grow.2 An online portal allows employees to 
see which jobs are available, the credentials and skills 
required, and whether the role is projected to grow or 
decline. As part of the transition, AT&T also radically 
simplified role profiles, consolidating 250 roles into only 
80. To enable its workforce to gain the skills needed, 
AT&T developed a broad set of partnerships with 32 
universities and multiple online education platforms to 
enable employees to earn the credentials needed for 
the new digital roles. For instance, with Georgia Tech, it 
has created an online master’s degree in programming. 
It has also created “nanodegree” programs with the 
online platform Udacity that allows employees to learn 
specific skills in less time. AT&T covers the tuition for these 
training programs, and individuals pursue them on their 
own time. So far it has spent more than $250 million on 
training and tuition aid for employees since 2013. The 
results are starting to show: as of March 2018, more than 
half of its employees have completed 2.7 million online 
courses in areas such as data science, cybersecurity, 
agile project management, and computer science. The 
company has awarded 177,000 virtual “badges” to about 
57,000 employees on their internal career profile pages, 
indicating they’ve completed the coursework. According 
to the company, employees that are currently retraining 
are two times more likely to be hired into one of these 
newer, mission-critical jobs and four times more likely to 
make a career advancement.3 

As a result, both companies are seeing substantial 
numbers of employees changing their roles or activities. 
At AT&T, retrained workers are twice as likely to obtain 
technology and operations management roles than non-
retrained workers. 



53McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

Hire 
Acquiring individuals or entire teams of people with required skill sets is another option—
although in aggregate the supply of talent in the market may be insufficient for all companies 
to pursue this strategy. The total cost of hiring may be lower than some of the other options, 
including retraining, depending on the skills needed. However, hiring is always a risk as to 
how a person will perform on the job, and is susceptible to talent shortages in the market. 
To succeed at hiring key talent, companies need to offer an attractive culture and benefits, 
and consider hiring from nontraditional sources. New digital tools can vastly improve the 
ability to source, assess, and recruit new talent. By using a variety of data sources, such 
as social media profiles, online reputational signals, and gamified tests for job candidates, 
companies can obtain a granular and rich insight into the skills, working styles, and 
attributes of potential hires (see Box 8, “How digital tools are revolutionizing recruiting, hiring, 
and retaining talent”). This leads to better matching of workers with jobs, raising employee 
productivity.72 Similar tools can streamline the process of interviewing and onboarding 
candidates as well, freeing up valuable time of the employees who previously undertook 
those tasks.73 Previous MGI research has found that full use of the suite of digital talent 
management tools can raise overall profit margins by 350 basis points on average—and by 
far more in industries that rely on highly skilled, highly paid talent.74 Beyond hiring, retaining 
employees with scarce talent, or increasing the hours they work, may similarly increase 
internal skills capacity.

Box 7. The return on investment from retraining: Evidence from Northern Europe 

1 Shaping the future of work in Europe’s digital front-runners, McKinsey and Company, October 2017.

Other research we have conducted suggests that the return on investment from retraining 
programs can be significant. 

We examined AI and automation adoption in nine Northern European countries that 
are digital front-runners, in terms of acceptance and deployment of the fast-evolving 
technologies.1 However, given the current trajectory and potential from AI, these countries 
will likely see an increase in the imbalance in the skills most in demand, which in turn will 
affect the productivity gains potential of the technology adoption. To overcome this potential 
future skills gap will require large-scale retraining. Our ongoing research finds that this 
retraining will generate returns that will likely increase in coming years. 

The Netherlands is one example. The ongoing research estimates that about 800,000 Dutch 
workers will need to upgrade their skills. Historical returns to retraining investments amount 
to between 7 and 9 percent, divided 70-30 between employers and employees. The gains 
to society are directly related to positive productivity and labor effects. Retraining programs 
for AI have a higher return of between 13 and 25 percent, according to this preliminary 
analysis, based on an estimated 15 percent increase in productivity. 

In Sweden, the ongoing research also finds potential future mismatches for several skills 
categories, including advanced cognitive and some social and emotional skills, as well 
as digital skills. As in the Netherlands, successful retraining and upgrading of skills could 
give a substantial boost to productivity, as well as leading to a more mobile workforce and 
ensuring that workers are more readily employable. Overall, this could generate a return 
on investment in skills training estimated to be as high 30 percent after tax, according to 
ongoing research.

Technology can help with recruiting efforts. Online talent platforms are increasingly 
important tools for both individual workers and companies to connect talent with jobs.1 
Digital tools—now typically based on machine learning algorithms that improve with use—
allow companies to expand the pool of potential applicants they consider, more rigorously 
assess their skills and aptitudes, and streamline the hiring process. In our survey, 22 percent 
of companies say they will rely more on digital tools for their hiring. 

Getting recruiting right is a high-stakes business. Most companies review a large number 
of résumés—250 on average—for each position they fill.2 Hiring executive search firms is 
expensive. Moreover, up to 80 percent of employee turnover is due to bad hiring decisions.3 

New data analytics, online gamified assessment tools, and machine learning algorithms 
are turning hiring decisions from being made on a “hunch” to hard analytics. Analytics can 
review source data and current employee performance to identify the best channels for 
hiring and the types of candidates to target. Automated résumé screening and identification 
of most successful candidates can reduce the time and cost to hire. Analytics can also 
identify new, non-traditional sources of hiring and remove unconscious bias in recruiting, 
thereby increasing diversity.4 

While large companies often create their own proprietary HR analytics tools, external 
providers are also available. Pymetrics, for example, combines behavioral data from 
neuroscience exercises with machine learning algorithms to match candidates with 
jobs. Unilever and Nielsen are among its clients. Candidates play online games that test 
candidates on 80 attributes, from memory to risk appetite, circumventing the traditional 
résumé altogether and helping candidates without conventional qualifications. The hotel 
chain Hilton shortened the average time it takes to hire a candidate from 42 days to five with 
the help of HireVue, a startup. It analyzes videos of candidates answering questions and 
uses AI to judge their verbal skills, intonation, and gestures.5 

Once companies have hired and onboarded employees, they also need to retain them. 
Arena is a startup that works with hospitals and nursing home companies, where turnover is 
high. It helps firms consider retention even during hiring. By using data from job applications 
and third parties to predict which applicants are likely to stay more than a year, Arena says 
it has reduced its clients’ median turnover by 38 percent.6 Machine learning programs can 
help employers spot individuals at risk of leaving. A major insurance company, for instance, 
was experiencing an inexplicably high attrition rate, despite offering retention bonuses. It 
deployed machine learning algorithms using internal data to predict which employees were 
at high risk of leaving. With this information, the employer could ensure that supervisors 
recognized these individuals and addressed concerns about career advancement, 
workplace issues, and the like. This approach cut the attrition rate in half and eliminated the 
need for retention bonuses, bringing significant savings. 



55McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

Contract
Another set of options is to bring in skills from outside the organization, for example by 
using contractors, freelancers, or temporary workers from staffing agencies. Companies 
could also form strategic partnerships, or outsource entire functions. Contracting allows 
companies to rapidly acquire the skills they need (if such talent is available). As organizations 
become more agile and work is done in team-based settings, integrating contract workers 
into the organization becomes more seamless. As we discussed in Chapter 2, the size of 
the “independent workforce” in both the United States and Europe is already large and is 
expected to grow further.75 The potential downsides to this move include potential loss of 
proprietary knowledge and intellectual property, and poor fit with the company culture. 
The survey respondents also plan to use contracting to fill mainly noncore or low-skill roles, 
rather than using it to find high-skill talent. This is a business model we already see in some 
industries, such as high-tech companies; in these situations, the core engineers are hired 
on a permanent basis and groomed, while other business functions rely heavily on contract 
workers. There is some evidence that this focus on contracting mainly lower-skill workers 
may shift. One of the fastest-growing segments of the independent workforce is highly 
educated people, with graduate degrees in law and business and even PhD scientists.76 
These skilled workers increasingly recognize their value in the marketplace and are attracted 
by the flexibility and autonomy that independent work enables. On the freelance platform 
Upwork, the highest paid occupations can earn up to $200 an hour, including for freelancers 
with skills in network analysis, computer vision, and chef.io (a programming language).77 For 
nontech positions, intellectual property lawyers and other legal experts do well. As work 
is redesigned around new technologies, tapping into this pool of independent workers 
may grow.

Release
Releasing employees may be necessary in some companies, particularly in industries 
that are not growing very rapidly and in which automation can substitute for labor in a 
significant way. Often, this can be accomplished by reducing or freezing new hiring while 
allowing normal attrition and retirement to proceed, or by reducing the work hours of some 
employees. But sometimes it may require laying off workers. Releasing workers can be 
an opportunity to accelerate workforce transformations, with potentially significant cost 
savings. However, the risk is that knowledge of the company, culture, and operations is lost. 
Layoffs can also diminish employee productivity and satisfaction, and can be difficult and 
costly to carry out. In the face of potentially large workforce displacement, many executives 
believe their companies have an obligation: in our survey, about 90 percent of respondents 
express that they have “some” or even “significant” responsibility to help laid-off employees 
learn new skills or find new jobs.

56 McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

THE MIX OF WORKFORCE ACTIONS TAKEN WILL DIFFER BY INDUSTRY 
DYNAMICS, CURRENT SKILLS, AND NATIONAL FACTORS 
Companies will need to make strategic choices among those options, and numerous 
approaches are possible and likely, depending on the company profile, its workforce, the 
sector in which it operates, and the ambitions and scope of automation adoption. Exhibit 21 
lays out three distinct but non-exhaustive examples of companies in different situations, to 
illustrate possible approaches.

In the first example, the “core disruptor” company is significantly shifting its product 
portfolio and business model to take advantage of new technologies. Software, media, 
telecommunications, and other technology companies are examples, along with some 
business functions such as marketing. As the AT&T and SAP examples show, their 
approach to building the workforce skills needed for the future will rely heavily on retraining 
and redeploying their existing talent, much of which is already highly educated. While some 
employees will receive training before being redeployed to new and potentially very different 
roles, new hires and contractors will also be brought in to drive the technology adoption. 
Only few employees might eventually need to be released.

The second example shown is that of an “efficiency enhancer.” These could typically be 
companies that find themselves in highly competitive industries with pressure on margins 
and lower overall market growth. Automation may offer significant opportunities to raise 
efficiency and productivity through labor substitution. Retail, labor-intensive manufacturing, 
and banking and insurance are examples, along with corporate back-office functions such

and current skill mix.

as accounting and financial reporting across industries. These industries and functions have 
significant work activities that can be done by machines. For them, cost reduction will be 
a key strategic goal of automation. In such environments, releasing employees will be the 
key action. Some employees may be retrained and redeployed to modified roles, and new 
hires will focus on technologists, data scientists, and similar roles to create and maintain the 
deployed technologies.

A third example, which we refer to here as a “human-machine collaborator,” is a company 
for which new technologies are mainly complements to the workforce rather than a 
substitution. Automation in these industries raises the quality of products and services 
delivered, but does not require completely new business models. Healthcare, advanced 
manufacturing, and functions such as marketing and sales are examples. The workforce 
in these industries is mainly high- and moderate-skilled already, and these companies will 
look to upgrade the skills of the workforce and redesign work in ways to ensure optimum 
collaboration between humans and machines. With this approach, many employees will 
receive training required to augment their roles. A mix of new hires and some temporary 
contractors will drive the adoption of technology, while few workers will be redeployed and 
few if any will be released as the business model does not change.

Other possibilities could depend either on the environment, the sector, or the size and the 
dynamism of the company itself. For example, some fast-growing companies—especially 
online firms—that are equally ambitious in their automation strategies may have fewer needs 
to retrain workers. For these dynamic firms, ensuring that they can continuously recruit 
top talent is a strategic imperative; by consequence their approach will be to leverage their 
attractive culture to hire actively. They may potentially tap additional external skills through 
contracting, when required, but their rapid growth makes redeployment and releasing 
largely unnecessary.

Companies operating in less competitive environments with less potential for automation, 
such as education and government, may take a different approach altogether, especially 
if their ability to hire or release is constrained by unions or regulation. Such companies 
or organizations can see benefits from automation in terms of efficiency and improved 
quality. But they will typically hire sparingly, partly because it is not seen as a strategic 
priority and partly because they might have difficulties attracting digital talent for reasons of 
culture, remuneration, or geography. Retraining is their primary lever to enable their current 
employees, while technology adoption can be implemented by hiring contractors.

Companies will need to define a portfolio of workforce initiatives and develop 
strong employee value propositions 
Building a workforce that is commensurate with a company’s ambitions for automation and 
AI adoption will require a strategic approach—and time. A first step will be to understand 
the future talent needs and where critical gaps are to be found in the organization. This 
assessment stage will need to address questions about the business value at stake in the 
skills gap.

A second step will be to define a portfolio of initiatives to attend to critical talent needs. As 
we have noted, CEOs and their teams will need to find the appropriate mix of retraining, 
redeploying, hiring, contracting, and releasing. They will also need to evaluate how 
much of the workforce could potentially be retrained and the extent to which hiring and 
other initiatives could address talent needs. Finally, CEOs will need to execute the talent 
strategy and leverage existing partnerships, including external stakeholders, to ensure 
smooth implementation.



58 McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

Developing a value proposition for employees with the sought-after skills will also be 
essential. We see four main dimensions to building attractiveness that can be summed up 
thus: a great company, with great leaders, offering a great job, with attractive benefits. These 
dimensions touch on a wide range of issues, from whether there is a well-defined business 
culture with appealing values, and how well leadership motivates and inspires employees, 
to how interesting the work is, what the opportunities for advancement are, and how 
employees are recognized and rewarded for their performance. Research by our McKinsey 
colleagues suggests that people working at companies which successfully develop strong 
employee value propositions are three times more likely to be satisfied. Such companies 
are able to attract and retain almost all high performers—and they tend to outperform their 
peers in long-run stock returns.78 

National and local factors will also matter, with significant differences between 
Europe and the United States 
Geography also plays a role in determining workforce skills decisions, with a net difference 
between US and European companies. In Europe, a much larger proportion of companies—
just under half—aims to focus primarily on retraining the existing workforce, whereas in the 
United States that proportion is substantially lower, at just over one-quarter (Exhibit 22). In 
the United States, by contrast, hiring is an attractive choice, with 35 percent of companies 
planning to improve workforce skills only or mainly by hiring, versus just 7 percent in 
Europe.79

These differences likely reflect labor market and cultural factors. In general, releasing 
workers is a slower and more complicated process in Europe. The Employment Flexibility 
Index is a measure that combines World Bank data on labor market regulation such as for 
hiring, working hours, or termination of work contracts. The index shows a range between 
the United States, ranking second highest with 92.4 of 100 possible points, and large 
European economies such as Germany (63.5 points), and France, ranking lowest, with 39.4 
points.80 These differences translate into a reluctance to hire—and release—employees 
in European countries. Moreover, European companies can have incentives to retain their 
workforces, even in difficult times.81 

COMPANIES WILL NEED TO BECOME MORE ADAPTABLE AS THEY 
TRANSITION THEIR ORGANIZATIONS AND WORKFORCES TO THE NEW 
AUTOMATION AGE 
Adaptability will be a hallmark of the transition to a new era. We use the term adaptability 
to express a company’s ability to adjust its organization and workforce for the transition 
toward a more automated future.82 We used our survey responses to help gauge the level of 
that adaptability.

The survey asked respondents about the structural changes they plan to make as they 
automate work, and one possible response is to increase their organizational agility. We 
also ask about whether they believe their workforce will need to become more (or less) 
adaptable in the future. Exhibit 23 shows the results of those two questions, with responses 
grouped by sector. Organizations in some sectors, such as education and government, do 
not plan to increase their organizational agility and see little need to increase their workforce 
adaptability. Not surprisingly, these sectors also rank low on their level of digitization, 
according to MGI’s Industry Digitization Index.83 Other sectors, including banking and 
insurance, energy and mining, and manufacturing, are experiencing a great deal of 
disruptive change and have plans for increasing organizational agility and believe they need 
to boost workforce adaptability.

Overall, more companies are planning to increase agility in their organizations than see 
adaptability of workers as a constraint. This reflects rigid internal structures and lack of 
flexibility today that will stand in the way of transformation and innovation. Not surprisingly, 
companies that plan to increase their agility in general also see the need for a more 
adaptable workforce. As discussed in Chapter 2, changes in both top management and in 
HR teams will be needed to enhance the adaptability of firms and enable them to seize the 
opportunities presented by new technologies.

In the future, several dynamics may increase the need for adaptability of organizations. First 
is the potential disruption of a sector, reflected in factors such as the speed of automation 
and AI adoption, the rise of new competitors in the sector, or an overall strengthening of 
competitive pressures. Second is how flexible or rigid a company’s internal operations are. 
The third factor is how much of the workforce will be affected by automation adoption—
in other words, the relative amounts of retraining, redeployment, hiring, contracting, or 
releasing as percentages of a company’s current workforce. Companies facing high 
levels of disruption and workforce change, and with rigid internal structures, will have the 
greatest need to improve their adaptability. The core disruptors highlighted above require 
high levels of adaptability as they embark upon new business models and large-scale 
workforce transformations. For efficiency enhancers, in contrast, adaptability is somewhat

COMPETITION FOR TALENT WILL BRING HIGHER WAGES AND BENEFITS 
FOR THE HIGHLY SKILLED, WHILE WAGES FOR OTHERS MAY STAGNATE OR 
DECLINE 
In our survey, we can already see the beginnings of intensified competition for top talent 
taking shape: companies announce that they will be hiring by adopting a diverse set of 
actions. About one in four said they would try to use connections to industry associations, 
offer more attractive wages than competitors, hire from them directly, or broaden their 
talent sources to attract the talent they need. In some sectors, such as high tech, retail, and 
healthcare, companies plan to raise wages to get the talent they need, while in banking and 
insurance, respondents mostly plan to poach from competitors (presumably through more 
attractive wages and other benefits as well).

Salaries for highly educated workers are set to rise 
Respondents in our survey said that individuals with a college degree or higher are more 
likely to be hired or contracted, more likely to receive retraining, and less likely to be 
displaced. Likewise, our survey indicates that salaries are also more likely to rise as the 
educational level of individuals increases, with nearly half of respondents expecting salaries 
of workers with a graduate degree to rise (Exhibit 24). For lower-skill workers, our survey 
suggests that more than half of the business leaders surveyed expect no change in wages, 
with only about one in four expecting an increase.

For some lower-skill workers, wages may fall 
More than 20 percent of respondents in the survey see wages for low-skill workers 
decreasing, and more than half expect them to stagnate. If this expectation becomes a 
reality, it will exacerbate the already-existing bifurcation of wages between non-routine 
digital workers whose wages will rise, and lower-skill routine and non-digital workers. Prior 
MGI research has highlighted the way that rising income inequality in advanced economies 
following the 2008 financial crisis has stoked political and social tensions.84 

Companies have varying degrees of confidence about their ability to hire the 
talent they need 
Prior MGI research highlights a growing gap between digital leaders and laggards, with 
leaders not only benefiting from higher productivity and stronger revenue growth but also 
paying their workforces higher wages.85 Our survey suggests that this disparity also extends 
to confidence about hiring talent. Extensive adopters are highly confident about attracting 
talent, with 54 percent saying they will be “rather” or “extremely” confident to source the 
workforce they need, whereas only 18 percent of limited adopters are as confident.

OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ALSO HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN BUILDING THE 
WORKFORCE OF THE FUTURE 
Companies can do much to shape the workforce of the future, but other stakeholders also 
have an active role to play: educational institutions, industry associations, labor agencies, 
and policy makers, as well as non-profit organizations including foundations (Exhibit 25). 
Sometimes, partnerships across the ecosystem can be most effective. For now, only 
23 percent of US companies and 30 percent of European companies responding to our 
survey rank partnering with external stakeholders other than educational institutions in 
the three most important actions to be taken in regard to retraining. Yet already, there are 
some collaboration programs in a few countries which might provide ideas or inspiration for 
others. In this chapter we discuss some ideas, while acknowledging that we only skim the 
possible actions.

Companies can work with educational institutions to help shape curricula and 
develop needed skills 
For now, many companies tend to think in isolation about their retraining programs. In our 
survey, most firms saw themselves as being responsible for developing and delivering these 
programs. Only 37 percent of respondents considered it important to build partnerships 
with educational institutions for effective retraining, for example, compared with 47 percent 
who planned to do so internally. At the same time, a range of higher education institutions

and other experts have called for universities, colleges, and other educators to play a more 
active role in filling the needs of the labor market. For example, a 2017 report on German 
higher education by an association of businesses and foundations called for universities to 
become more adept at identifying labor market trends and reacting accordingly, including 
by increasing data science and other high-tech courses.86 The US Council on Foreign 
Relations, in a 2018 report on the US workforce, calls for stronger links between education 
and employment outcomes.87 

Technology can provide some ways of bridging the gap between educators and companies. 
Virtual and remote programs are cheaper than classic in-person courses. Ad hoc methods 
such as massive open online courses (MOOCs), boot camps, and code schools have 
attracted rising public interest and can sharply reduce the time needed to acquire some 
skills that previously required classic, degree-oriented programs. Part-time education 
programs or nondegree certificate courses also allow for broader access than classic full-
time programs, especially for the education of adults. However, while MOOCs increase the 
access to learning opportunities in general, research suggests that people who are already 
highly educated are overrepresented among today’s participants in such courses. To further 
strengthen the retraining of those underserved today, improved coordination between 
companies and educational institutions would be beneficial.88 The case of AT&T discussed 
above is one example. Companies may find talent with the skills they require more easily if 
they embrace the benefits of these programs and increase their acceptance of such new 
formats of education.89 

The shift in skills that we observe has consequences for the credentialing systems that 
educational institutions use today. School or university degrees tend to focus on grades that 
measure skills or knowledge levels in subjects rather than for skills such as problem solving, 
stakeholder management, or creative thinking—which are becoming more important. 
Some approaches to measure skills more broadly exist in some countries; in Germany and 
Switzerland, for example, student behavior is often graded.90 In principle, such metrics can 
be a measure of social and emotional skills beyond subject matter. However, grades are not 
typically determined in separate, dedicated courses for soft skills, but rather synthesized 
from observations by teachers as to whether students collaborate well or behave 
respectfully, made in subject matter courses. Educators may need to consider redesigning 
and establishing new metrics to measure skills in a broader sense. They could also look to 
teach soft skills such as problem solving or collaboration in a way that is less subject related, 
for example through making presentations in class, providing detailed critiques on written 
assignments, and encouraging deeper thinking that explores questions of why and how.91 

Industry associations and organized labor can improve matching of jobs and 
skills, including through retraining and talent pipelines 
Industry associations and labor unions, working together as social partners, have 
traditionally played central roles in training efforts in several European countries. Both sets 
of stakeholders have potentially significant roles to play in addressing shortages of certain 
skills and retraining in the automation era.

65McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

At a time when competition for talent is heightening, industry associations can enable 
employers to collaborate on building more talent faster within a particular sector. In the 
United States, for example, the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of 
Manufacturers (NAM), an industry association, have formed the Quality Pathways program 
to create and strengthen “earn and learn” opportunities.92 The aim is to help employers gain 
access to the skills they need while providing more affordable career pathways for learners 
and workers. Their approach is to create a high-quality quality assurance system with 
increased employer leadership and investment to provide an alternative to accreditation-
style business models. In Germany, industry associations typically partner with the labor 
agency in regional labor markets to identify companies’ labor needs. In cities such as 
Dusseldorf, a strong network of industry associations, educational institutions, and the 
labor agency informs potential employees about developments on the labor market and 
educational offers.93 Associations can also develop and expand apprenticeships, on-the-job 
training, and other work-study initiatives, to develop required skills in young people. Various 
programs are successful in Germany and Switzerland.94 

Labor unions on their own can engage in training initiatives. In the United Kingdom, for 
example, the Union Learning Fund recruits low-skill workers to participate in relevant 
training.95 In some countries with a long tradition of union-management cooperation, 
joint initiatives are starting to show some success. In Sweden, for example, job security 
councils funded by companies and unions, but not the state, coach individuals who become 
unemployed. They provide temporary financial support, transition services and retraining, 
helping the unemployed find new jobs quickly. They also advise employers and trade 
unions. Such arrangements among the social partners ensure that more than 85 percent of 
affected workers find new jobs within a year, causing Sweden to lead the OECD ranking in 
helping displaced workers.96 

Labor agencies and policy makers can strengthen support for workers in 
transition and improve mobility, including with a shift to portable benefits 
Appropriate action on retraining and workforce benefits will differ among countries, 
depending on cultural differences around individual responsibility and the role of the state. 
In the changing skills environment, policy makers will need to clarify the roles of individuals, 
companies, and state agencies. Examples of such action include:

  Revamping labor agencies. Several European countries have changed the way their 
national labor agencies operate, by shifting public employment policy from “passive” 
(unemployment compensation) to “active” (employment agencies becoming “job 
centers” that manage and facilitate retraining of the unemployed). In Germany, labor 
market reforms dating to 2002 have helped bring down unemployment from 12 percent 
in 2005 to 5 percent in 2017 and at the same time raised labor participation. While 
the number of Germans working has increased, total hours worked have remained 
constant. This reflects a paradigm shift in which more work has become “shared,” that 
is, more people work in part-time jobs or “mini-jobs.”97 In the United Kingdom, a “work

first” principle makes benefits and support for job seekers conditional—with sanctions if 
criteria are not met.98 

  More effective spending on adult education. Higher public spending on adult 
education does not automatically translate into more participation of employees in 
such programs. In particular, there is little evidence that it increases the participation of 
disadvantaged adults, who could profit most.99 In the United States, an analysis of the 
Trade Adjustment Assistance Program to retrain displaced workers showed that workers 
who participate in retraining activities have less income than peers not only while they 
undergo training, but even several years thereafter.100 Some research also suggests 
that unemployment assistance and other types of insurance including disability may 
discourage work.101 Policy makers will thus need to investigate ways to make funding for 
adult education programs more effective. Some countries seek to offer the opportunity 
to all workers to upgrade their skills. Singapore, for example, has introduced “SkillsFuture 
Initiative,” which provides all Singaporeans aged 25 and above credit of about $400 
to pay for approved work-skills related courses.102 Belgium uses training vouchers to 
help small and medium-size enterprises raise the skills of their employees.103 This is 
particularly effective as companies with fewer than 50 employees can spend as much as 
80 percent less on educational training than their larger peers.104 

  Moving to “portable” benefits to boost mobility. One obstacle to the growth of the 
gig economy is that, under current rules in many countries, independent workers have 
difficulty obtaining the same social and pension benefits as full-time employees.105 Past 
research has focused on establishing key principles for addressing this omission. For 
example, benefits could be designed to be “portable,” that is, not tied to a particular job 
or company and owned by the workers. Portable benefits would focus on the entire life 
cycle of a worker, rather than on a specific phase when working for a particular employer. 
A second principle is for these benefits to be proportionate, in other words, linked to 
the money earned or time worked. Third, the benefits can be universal, available to all, 
including independent workers.106 Some companies that rely heavily on independent 
workers have recently joined such calls for action.107 In the United Kingdom, an 
independent review has proposed clarifying the rights of a third category of workers, 
between traditional employees and the self-employed, called “dependent contractors.” 
These workers would receive some of the labor market protections of employees, 
such as the national minimum wage, but would retain the ability to work on flexible

contracts.108 In the United States, where companies often provide health insurance and 
retirement benefits, the idea of portable benefits is gaining momentum.109 

  Simplifying cross-sector mobility. Another area that is becoming a focus of attention 
is cross-sector mobility—that is, the challenge of helping individuals use their skills in new 
occupations and sectors. Just as digital ecosystems are forming in which businesses 
overcome traditional sector boundaries and evolve toward broader, more dynamic 
alignments, worker mobility will become increasingly important.110 One example for such 
efforts is the Australian Industry and Skills Committee, which improves worker mobility 
through recognition of qualifications between occupations. Cross-sector training 
programs address new or emerging skills such as general digital skills, automation, 
cybersecurity, and big data.111 One flagship project identifies automation skills needed 
by multiple industry sectors and develops a corresponding training package with the 
goal of furthering cross-sector employability of those who receive the training.112 In 
order for cross-sector mobility to become a common practice, companies will need 
to agree on definitions and qualifications for specific types of skills. A report by the 
European Commission finds that a generally accepted skills taxonomy is lacking, and 
recommends that skill categories need to be updated to ensure greater transferability.113 
Some initiatives are trying to address this, including the Europass CV, which improves 
recognition of qualifications and skills across borders.114 

Nonprofit organizations and foundations can work with companies to help 
workers acquire new skills 
Non-profit organizations have a flexibility to develop innovative approaches to issues relating 
to skills, and some have been testing novel approaches. The Markle Foundation is piloting 
a program called Skillful which aims to help workers without a college degree upgrade and 
market their skills. The idea is to focus on both job seekers and employers, and on skills 
rather than degrees. It brings together companies including Microsoft and LinkedIn, the 
state government, and local partners, and aims to give educators a clearer picture of which 
skills are in demand in their areas—and give businesses a better sense of which skills are 
available in their applicant pools.115 

Some companies have launched philanthropic initiatives or work with foundations on skills-
related issues. Generation provides one example. Launched in 2015, it is an independent 
non-profit youth employment organization, founded by McKinsey, that seeks to close the 
skills gap for young people. Generation recruits unemployed and underemployed young 
adults, trains them in one of 23 professions across four sectors—customer service and 
sales, technology, healthcare, and skilled trades—and then places them in career-launching 
jobs. Generation operates in six countries—Hong Kong (China), India, Kenya, Mexico, Spain, 
and the United States—and will launch in another several countries this year. So far, 19,000 
young people have graduated, with a job placement rate of 82 percent at three months 
post-program with 2,000 employer partners and $55 million in cumulative salary earned 
to date.116 The program is now broadening to apply its approach to retraining midcareer 
workers through ReGeneration.

•••

Skills are a key challenge of this era. The stakes are high. A well-trained workforce 
equipped with the skills required to adopt automation and AI technologies will ensure that 
our economies enjoy strengthened productivity growth and that the talents of all workers 
are harnessed. Failure to address the demands of shifting skills could exacerbate social 
tensions and lead to rising skill and wage bifurcation—creating a society split between those 
gainfully employed in rewarding work and those stuck in traditional jobs with diminishing 
wage prospects. To ensure the former scenario—and ward off the latter—will depend 
in large part on how well the workforce is trained, and how adaptable companies and 
workers will prove to be in the face of multiple new challenges from automation adoption. 
For companies, the organizational and human resources implications are significant. 
The options of retraining, redeploying, hiring, contracting, and releasing workers may 
be clear, but finding the appropriate combination will depend on a range of factors, from 
strategic automation ambitions to the ability to find the required talent to execute on those 
ambitions. This is not just an issue for companies. Policy makers, labor agencies, non-
profit organizations, and business associations and unions will need to work with business 
leaders to ensure that the conditions are in place for the skills upgrade that will be required. 
The new imperative of our automation age is the shift to a “learning economy,” in which 
human capital is paramount. The future prosperity of our societies, and the wellbeing of our 
workforce, depends on whether we are able to attain that goal.

TECHNICAL APPENDIX 

117 Our other ongoing research, for example in Sweden, suggests that primary skills account for 50 percent 
of hours worked, while secondary skills are used less than 20 percent of the time. This suggests that our 
methodology is robust.

In this discussion paper we quantify the nature and size of skills in the workplace in 
the period 2016 to 2030, and we also report on the results of an executive survey. The 
quantitative analysis described below is based on models created by the McKinsey 
Global Institute for two previous reports, A future that works: Automation, employment, 
and productivity (January 2017) and Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a 
time of automation (December 2017). Each report contains a detailed technical appendix 
describing methodology and assumptions.

In this technical appendix, we describe how we assigned skills to tasks and how we modeled 
skill shifts to 2030. We also provide details of the survey we conducted among business 
leaders to gauge the impact of automation and AI on organizations, workers, and skills.

HOW WE ASSIGNED SKILLS TO TASKS 
We sought to quantify the skill shift using a set of 25 workforce skills in five categories: 
physical and manual, basic cognitive, higher cognitive, social and emotional, and 
technological skills. These skills are based on previous MGI work, mainly the 17 skills used 
in the June 2017 report, Artificial intelligence: The next digital frontier? as well as other 
frameworks used externally.

We mapped these skills to individual work tasks by assigning each of the 2,000 workplace 
activities from the US Department of Labor’s O*NET database to a specific skill required 
to perform the activity. While workers use multiple skills to perform a given task, for the 
purposes of our quantification, we identified the main skill used.117 For example, in banking 
and insurance, we mapped “prepare business correspondence” and “prepare legal or 
investigatory documentation” to the skill “advanced literacy and writing,” which is grouped 
in the category of higher cognitive skills. In retail, we classified “stock products or parts” into 
gross motor skills and strength in the category of physical and manual skills, while “greeting 
customers, patrons, or visitors” is mapped to basic communication skills, in the basic 
cognitive category.

To quantify skills, we then looked at the number of hours that workers spend performing 
the activities mapped to that skill. To allocate a specific number of hours to each activity, we 
combined data on the frequency of each activity in O*NET with the overall number of hours 
worked in a given occupation. As the number of hours in each activity (by country and by 
sector) changes with automation and future job growth, so does the number of hours spent 
exercising different skills.

Since our approach ties each individual activity to a single skill, only pure IT activities such 
as operating a computer were tagged under “basic digital skills.” This understates the 
importance of this group of skills, as workers’ aptitude at working with digital technologies 
has increasingly become a core part of many jobs that are not typically thought of as 
“IT” jobs, for example designers today need to be able to work with computer-based 
design software, and their fluency with digital is a pre-requisite. We consequently applied 
a digital refinement to correct for the digital component of work not being fully reflected 
in the activities associated with most jobs. We re-allocated a portion of hours from 
activities requiring non-technological skills to basic digital skills, to account for their digital 
requirements. For example, professional driving now often requires the use of GPS and 
thus some basic digital skills. To determine the magnitude of this reallocation appropriate 
for each occupation, we use the digital score devised by Mark Muro and colleagues at the 
Brookings Institution. We relate the digital score to a job’s digital content by extrapolating 



70 McKinsey Global Institute Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce

the relationship we identified among the top 50 most common occupations in the ICT sector 
where the digital component is captured more explicitly. We also assume a continued 
digitization trend in line with the shift observed in the 2002 to 2016 period.

MODELING SKILL SHIFTS TO 2030 
To model skill shifts in the period 2016 to 2030, we quantified net job changes resulting from 
automation and other macroeconomic trends using an employment model for the period. 
We also looked at the impact of automation on individual tasks within a given job. This model 
has four drivers of job loss and gain from both AI and non-AI factors:

  Job loss due to automation. We applied automation adoption rates leveraging an 
automation adoption rate by activity, job, industry, and geography, based on previous 
MGI research. For this, we assessed the technical potential for automation and then 
modeled different scenarios for its adoption based on technical and economic feasibility, 
and adoption and deployment scenarios. Our base case assumes job displacement 
using midpoint automation adoption rates by 2030 as a percentage of 2016 employment 
(24 percent for Western Europe, and 25 percent for the United States), defined as an 
average of rates from our latest and earliest scenarios (respectively 3 and 45 percent for 
Western Europe, and 4 and 46 percent for the United States). 

  Job loss due to non-AI productivity gains. We assume that the historical effect of 
productivity gains on employment of the pre-automation era remains unchanged. As 
productivity increases, the employment necessary to generate equivalent levels of 
output decreases, leading to a reduction in total hours worked at constant GDP. Hours 
worked over real GDP was observed for at least the past ten years, for the United States 
(-1.2 percent per year) and Western European countries (-0.7 percent per year, where the 
range is from -0.9 percent for Germany to 0 percent for Italy). These productivity gains 
are assumed equal going forward.

  Direct job gain from automation. We assume half of the job loss due to automation in 
each sector results in direct job gains in the same sector, which come from innovation 
generated by the application of AI in new products and services. This accounts for both 
new technology jobs and other innovative jobs that enable and support AI. We first 
calculate total job gain in the sector, then assume a percentage of this gain is in tech 
jobs that follow the distribution of occupations in the ICT sector, which we consider as 
more advanced. We consider the remaining percentage gain comes from innovative 
jobs distributed based on an average between the ICT sector and the given sector’s 
occupation distribution.118 

  Job gain due to macroeconomic drivers, including indirect effects from automation. 
We leverage MGI modeling from previous work on the future of employment, adjusted 
to our 2030 employment estimates (based on historical and projected productivity gains 
and employment data). We reflect the micro-modeled impact of the seven job growth 
drivers previously introduced in our December 2017 Jobs lost, jobs gained report. 
The seven are: rising incomes; aging population; education retraining; investment in 
technology; domestic services; investment in infrastructure; investment in buildings; and 
energy transitions. These gains include the indirect productivity gains from automation 
that will be reinvested in the economy by 2030.

118 We define ICT as a subset of the NAICS Information sector, comprising telecommunications, data processing 
and hosting services, and other services including Internet publishing and web search portals.

We then quantified skill shifts implied by the net change in work activities. Because we 
mapped hours spent on work activities to skills, we can calculate the shift between skills 
needed today and those needed in the future as a combination of the net change in 
the distribution of jobs in each sector and the changing mix of activities that constitute 
each individual job. For each skill, we primarily looked at the relative change between 
2016 and 2030 to capture significant increases even among skills that are comparably 
less common today. This analysis allows us to see a shift in the skills needed to perform 
a specific occupation as well as to analyze the aggregate trends on an industry or 
country level.

This methodology has several limitations that we fully acknowledge. First, we used US 
data from O*NET on the activities within each occupation and assumed that workers in 
other countries spend similar amounts of time on each activity. Second, our mapping of 
activities to skills was simplified, as in reality workers may use multiple skills while performing 
a specific task. Third, we assumed that the skills we assigned to work activities in our 
mapping remain unchanged. Finally, we could not observe the true skill set of each worker 
and thus were unable to observe latent skills they may possess but not deploy. Indeed, as 
noted in the paper, surveys of worker sentiment reveal that large portions of the workforce 
believe they have more skills than are used.

OUR SURVEY ON THE IMPACT OF AUTOMATION AND AI ON ORGANIZATIONS, 
WORKERS, AND SKILLS 
The survey of companies we quote in this paper was conducted by London-based 
ResearchNow in March 2018. The sample covered 14 specific sectors of the economy 
in seven countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the 
United States. Companies surveyed had workforces ranging from 30 to more than 1,000 
employees and described their level of automation and AI adoption that enabled us to 
characterize them as limited, moderate, or extensive adopters. We categorized companies 
that have adopted automation and AI technologies in most of their business processes 
or throughout their entire operating model as extensive adopters. Limited adopters were 
classified as those that have not yet adopted automation and AI technologies or only 
adopted them in some minor business processes. We used quotas for countries, industries 
(especially the five focus industries of this report), and levels of automation and AI adoption 
to ensure significant sample sizes per segment (Exhibit A1).

The final survey sample after quality checks and data cleansing consisted of respondents 
from 3,031 companies. The survey targeted C-level executives from organizations familiar 
with at least one automation, AI, or advanced digital technology and its application in 
business from the following list: big data and advanced analytics, machine learning/
artificial intelligence algorithms, autonomous vehicles, image recognition, robotic process 
automation, virtual agents, back-office process automation, wearables, internet of things, 
personalized pricing and promotions, 3D printing, and blockchain and distributed ledger.

The survey consisted of three sets of questions in addition to basic information about the 
company and the respondent. The first set asked respondents about the use of automation 
and AI in their organization, and their attitude towards automation and AI. The second set 
inquired about how much the adoption of automation and AI is affecting their organization, 
their structural design, and their workforces. The third set of questions asked how much the 
adoption of automation and AI has affected the composition of skills in their organization, 
whether it has created any potential skill mismatches and, if so, among which types of 
workers. It also asked how organizations plan to address such skill mismatches.

Results were weighted by level of AI adoption, industry, and country. Level of 
adoption weights were based on an AI intensity score by industry based on the 
diffusion of AI per sector such that the results reflect the relative representation 
of different levels of adoption in each sector. Industry weights were based on 
the number of employees per sector in the different countries such that the 
results reflect the relative economic importance of sector employment on a 
national level. Country weights were based on the total number of employees 
per country such that the results reflect relative economic importance of 
national workforce sizes. The reported results were tested for statistical 
significance at the 95 percent confidence level.
