 Privacy, Ethics and Liability Issues 125 Will Keynes Prediction of a World of Leisure Prove Correct? 136 Conclusion 145 About the Oxford Martin School 148 The Oxford Martin Programme on Technology and Employment is a new research programme established in January 2015 with support from Citi. It has been created to investigate the implications of a rapidly changing technological landscape for economies and societies. The programme will provide an in-depth understanding of how technology is transforming the economy, to help leaders create a successful transition into new ways of working in the 21st century. The programme is part of a wider research partnership between the Oxford Martin School and Citi, analysing some of the most pressing global challenges of the 21st Century. January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 7 Executive Summary1 The debate over the impact of automation has been going on for several centuries, from the Luddites in 1811 to John Maynard Keynes’ prediction of technological unemployment in the 1930's, to Stephen Hawking's recent warnings over Artificial Intelligence.
 Most recently, the topic has been chosen as the primary theme for the 2016 World Economic Forum meeting in Davos and the Financial Times awarded their 2015 Business Book of the Year to Martin Ford’s ‘The Rise of the Robots’. In our February 2015 Citi GPS report Technology At Work we cited three primary reasons why we believed the impact of technology change on the economy was different this time: (1) the pace of change has accelerated; (2) the scope of technological change is increasing; and (3) unlike innovation in the past, the benefits of technological change are not being widely shared — real median wages have fallen behind growth in productivity and inequality has increased. In the report that follows, Citi again teams up with Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne from the Oxford Martin School to answer a number of the questions that were generated post the original report – on a range of topics from susceptibility to solutions. There seems little doubt that the pace of technology change has accelerated. Whereas it took on average 119 years for the spindle to diffuse outside of Europe, the Internet spread across the globe in only 7 years. Going forward, as argued in the Citi GPS Disruptive Innovations III report, the cost of innovation continues to fall as cheaper smartphones will help bring 4 billion more people online.
 The next stage of connectivity will move from people to 'things' with Cisco estimating 500 billion devices will be connected by 2030, up from 13 billion in 2013. Increasing digital connectivity is fuelling a data boom, with data volume estimated to be doubling every 18 months, and computers are likely far better able to handle this volume than people. In 2015, the Edelman Trust Barometer found that more than half of the global "informed public" believe that the pace of development and change in business today is “too fast" with 70% citing technology as the driver of change. Over 96% of institutional clients who participated in Citi’s survey on technology and work believe that automation will accelerate over the next five years vs. the previous five years. Our work also suggests the scope of technology change is increasing.
 The big data revolution and improvements in machine learning algorithms means that more occupations can be replaced by technology, including tasks once thought quintessentially human such as navigating a car or deciphering handwriting. Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne's original study on employment2 suggested 47% of US jobs were at risk of computerisation. In the chapter ‘How Susceptible are Countries Worldwide?’, we use data from the World Bank to show that the risks of automation are actually higher in many other countries —- for example in the OECD the data shows on average 57% of jobs are susceptible to automation, this number rises to 69% in India and 77% in China. 1 The authors are very grateful to Andrew Pitt and Professor Ian Goldin for guidance in framing this report, as well as to Anushya Devendra at the Oxford Martin School for advice and editorial support 2 Frey, C.

 Robert Garlick Global Equity Product Head, Citi Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions January 2016 © 2016 Citigroup 8 Increased automation in low-wage countries, which have traditionally attracted manufacturing firms, could see them lose their cost advantage and potentially lose their ability of achieving rapid economic growth by shifting workers to factory jobs. In a survey that we conducted with institutional clients, 70% of our clients also believe that automation and the developments in 3D printing will encourage companies to move their manufacturing process closer to home — with North America gaining the biggest advantage from this development and China having the most to lose. A growing concern of ‘premature deindustrialisation’ in emerging and developing countries could require new growth models and a need to upskill the workforce. Historically, new technologies have not only transformed regions, industries and companies, but also cities. In the US, the computer revolution has shifted the fortunes of many cities with some, such as San Francisco, experiencing rapid growth while others spiral towards bankruptcy. Cities that specialised in cognitive work gained a comparative advantage in new job creation, mirroring trends in population and wage growth over the same period.
 The expanding scope of automation in the 21st century may shift the fortunes of US cities once more, affecting a different set of cities than the ones historically impacted by computerisation and offshoring. Berger, Frey and Osborne in their most recent analysis3 suggest that the exposure of cities in the US to future automation ranges from 54% in Fresno to 38% in Boston. The best way forward for cities to reduce their exposure to automation is to boost their technological dynamism and attract more skilled workers. The chapter ‘What Jobs do We See Ahead’ emphasises the importance of acquiring skills for future employment. The European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) estimated that in the EU nearly half of the new job opportunities will require highly skilled workers. Today’s technology sectors have not provided the same opportunities, particularly for less educated workers, as the industries that preceded them.
 This downward trend in new job creation in new technology industries is particularly evident starting in the Computer Revolution of the 1980s. For example, a study by Jeffery Lin4 suggests that while about 8.2% of the US workforce shifted into new jobs during the 1980s which were associated with new technologies; during the 1990s this figured declined to 4.4%. Estimates by Thor Berger and Carl Benedikt Frey further suggest that less than 0.5% of the US workforce shifted into technology industries that emerged throughout the 2000s, including new industries such as online auctions, video and audio streaming, and web design.
5 Despite these low numbers to date, a number of forecasts suggest good opportunities for future job creation in the information technology, industrial (i.e. robot engineers and technicians) and green sectors. In addition, the health sector is set to create the largest job openings, estimated at more than 4 million new jobs in the US from 2012 to 2022. This is not surprising given that many people in advanced countries are living for longer. This, together with a reduction in fertility rates, is changing the demographics in many advanced and some emerging nations 3 Berger, T.

 554-574. While the estimates by Lin are not necessarily directly comparable, they speak to further studies showing a downward trend in new job creation. 5 Berger, T. and Frey, C.B., “Industrial Renewal in the 21st Century: Evidence from U.
S. Cities”, Regional Studies, forthcoming. January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 9 (e.g. Japan and China) as described in the chapter ‘Demography vs Automation: Will We Run Out of Workers or Out of Jobs?’ In these countries, automation is seen as a possible solution to the changing demographics, however we conclude that automation could pose more risks to jobs than demographic changes.
 Incremental productivity gains through automation should offset some of the demographic developments; however we are currently also facing a ‘productivity paradox’ as described in more detail in the chapter ‘Impact of Automation on Productivity’. If, as we believe, progress in technology is so rampant, we should see healthy productivity improvements. However across advanced economies, labour productivity growth has slowed from 4% in 1965-75, to about 2% from 1975-2005 and further lower to 1% from 2005-2014. Rather than taking the view that the 'lowhanging fruits' of innovation have been plucked, we see limitations in the current measurement of productivity, a lag effect in measurement and a wider distribution of productivity across firms and workers. We found that institutional clients agree — 95% of clients in our survey expect automation and technology will drive an increase in productivity growth to some degree over time (60% to a significant degree and 35% to a minor degree). While we are positive on productivity, the chapter ‘Impact of Automation on Inflation’ argues that the rise in automation and technology is likely to reinforce the current low inflation environment due to increased uncertainty and the narrow distribution of productivity gains.
 There is also good reason to suspect that current price deflators and measures of inflation are overstated. We may already be observing some of these effects given the Phillips curve has flattened. To close output gaps, demand stimulus will continue to be needed, with monetary policy remaining accommodative and more creative in most advanced economies. Whilst the first half of the report discusses the effect that automation could have on countries and cities and on productivity and inflation, in the second half of the report we look at changes that are already occurring in a number of industries. We highlight a number of sectors such as the food industry, call centres and factories that are already automating a number of different processes which could ultimately affect (or are already affecting) a number of different jobs. In addition, with the cost of robots expected to decrease over time, economic barriers to the expansion of automation in different sectors are expected to fall.
 This is discussed in detail in the chapter ‘What are the Barriers to Automation?’ which shows that payback periods for some industrial robots would reduce to 1.2 and 2.6 years in China and Thailand respectively by 2017. Barriers still exist for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME’s) however the flexibility and affordability of co-bots could offer appropriate solutions for these companies. Looking at the macroeconomic and microeconomic effects of technological change, we find further evidence that the pace, scope and benefits of this change will be a challenge to societies.
 The remainder of the report focuses on potential policy options. The chapter ‘Response: Policy and Job Risk from Automation’ details active labour market policies which could help people find jobs: from training, to earned income tax credits (EITCs) or lowering tax wedges, to incentives to support self-employment. We believe EITCs are more appropriate than current moves to raise minimum wages given the latter could lead to higher unemployment. If selfemployment is becoming a new norm, this also has policy implications — 34% of the total US workforce, or 53 million people, are currently freelancers (see Figure 34). Some argue a basic income or benefits (healthcare, housing, pensions) should be provided, yet we fear changes in taxation that may be required to pay for solutions will impede an effective policy response. At the same time, local, regional, Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions January 2016 © 2016 Citigroup 10 and state governments could face challenges in maintaining tax revenues from income disparities and from the difficulties in effectively taxing the digital economy.
 With technological change a key driver for the demand of both the level and type of skills needed ahead, it is no surprise that the number one policy suggestion in our client survey was for increased investment in education. Although it is clear that more information & communication technology (ICT) skills will be needed, significant differences currently exist in IT skills between countries, with the US and the UK lagging behind other countries on some measures. While many argue science, technology, engineering & math (STEM) skills are needed, intermediate level skills in STEM seem to be a riskier educational investment. Non-cognitive skills can be increasingly important, but malleability of these skills should not be assumed. These factors could complicate the ability of education to adapt to the pace and scope of technological change described above. With careers likely to be more disrupted than at any other point in the past, individuals should anticipate the need to retrain in the future.
 A talent mismatch already exists in many countries, with many well-educated workers finding employment in lower-skilled jobs. To combat this, greater coordination will be needed between the educational, training and employment sectors. One of the paths involving the least commitment for policy makers to adapt to accelerated technological change would be to look to shorter working weeks. This is starting to take place in some countries; for example Sweden is moving to a standard 6 hour week day with the aim of improving productivity. Annual hours worked per person have already fallen by 35% in France from 1950-2014 and by 10% in the US. Leisure time in the US has increased by 6-8 hours per week between 1965-2003 for men and 4-8 hours for women.
 When we add in longer lives and retirements, cumulative lifetime leisure time has increased 26% from the 1930s. Could automation increase leisure time further whilst also maintaining a good standard of living for everyone? The risk is that this increased leisure time may only become a reality for the under-employed or unemployed. When we polled opinions on many of these issues in the third quarter of 2015, 85% of respondents felt automation posed a challenge to societies and policymakers, of which 64% said it was a major challenge. However, and encouragingly, 76% also said they were techno-optimists on the outlook for productivity and profits, with policy adapting to share increasing abundance. Only 21% were techno-pessimists on the outlook for growth, employment, inequality, and disruption of company profit pools.
 We agree with the optimists that the opportunities for increased innovation and productivity can be very beneficial, providing policy, education and workers can adapt to the challenges faced from accelerating technological change. January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 11 How Susceptible are Countries Worldwide? Jobs at Risk of Automation Highlights  Advances in technology are now making a broader range of non-routine tasks automatable, with computers mainly substituting for low-income low-skill workers over the next decades.  Building on Frey and Osborne's original work showing 47% of the US workforce is at risk of automation as a result of these trends, recent data from the World Bank suggests the risks are higher in many other countries. For example, their estimates suggest that the equivalent figures for China and India are 77% and 69%, respectively.  Although there has been convergence in adoption lags of technology between rich and poor countries, divergence in long-run penetration rates once technologies have been adopted, explain divergent income patterns between the Western and non-Western world since the Industrial Revolution.
  A growing concern of ‘premature industrialisation’ in emerging and developing countries could require new growth models and a need to upskill workforces. In the past, the comparative advantage of computers relative to human workers has been confined to routine rule-based activities that can easily be specified in computer code. Following recent advances in technology, however, a broader range of non-routine tasks are now equally automatable. The expanding scope of automation mainly relates to advances in Machine Learning technology, including Data Mining, Machine Vision, Computational Statistics and other sub-fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), turning a wide range of knowledge work into well-defined problems. This is, in turn, made possible by the provision of relevant data. For example, companies such as Work Fusion sell software to automate non-routine tasks, previously performed by office workers.
 Specifically, the software divides the job into smaller tasks, automates the routine work and then recruits freelance workers through crowdsourcing platforms to perform the non-routine work. As the software monitors the workers it learns from them, meaning that over time it can automate more of the non-routine tasks. In other words, the freelance workers train the system to replace them. Similarly, a growing body of digitalised translated text allows sophisticated software, such as Google Translate, to benchmark and improve the performance of translation algorithms. In healthcare, IBM’s Watson computer now provides automated chronic care and cancer treatment diagnostics, drawing upon piles of data that a doctor would not be able to process, including information from more than 1.5 million patient records and clinical trials, as well as 2 million pages of text from medical journals.
 Connected devices, advances in user interfaces, and cheaper and better sensors are all drivers of the big data revolution. For example, implantable monitors, such as pulmonary artery pressure measurement systems, enable significant reductions in heart failure hospitalisation. These devices rely upon sophisticated machine-tomachine communication to spot and signal potential warning signs. Advances in speech recognition also allow computer-controlled technologies to respond directly to human actions and requests: SmartAction, a provider of call automation services is able to realise cost savings of 60 to 80 percent over a traditional call centre. Thus, in short, machine learning algorithms are now, in many cases, better at basic Carl Benedikt Frey Co-Director for the Oxford Martin Programme on Technology and Employment and Oxford Martin Citi Fellow Big data is the key driver behind the expanding scope of automation Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions January 2016 © 2016 Citigroup 12 knowledge work than human workers. Although we do not know what the impact on labour markets of these developments will be, some estimates suggest that algorithms could displace around 140 million knowledge workers globally.
6 The big data provided by improved sensors also allow engineers to overcome a wide range of engineering bottlenecks that have hindered robotic development in the past. Three-dimensional maps of road networks, for example, have been a crucial enabler of autonomous vehicle navigation. This is not least illustrated by Google’s use of vast datasets for its driverless cars. Meanwhile, more advanced robots are gaining enhanced sensors and manipulators, allowing them to perform non-routine manual tasks. A well-known example is Baxter — a robot that requires no programming. Instead Baxter is able to memorise new working patterns as a human worker guides the robot arms through the motions needed to complete a task.
 Its physical flexibility is also enhanced by different attachments that can be installed on its arms, allowing Baxter to perform a much broader scope of work tasks. Similarly, surgical robots have become significantly more flexible and with a greater range of motion now perform more operations, while commercial service robots are now able to perform more complex tasks in elderly care, food preparation, and cleaning. In Japan, some hotels already use robots for check-in and to guide guests to their rooms. The robotic receptionist can also speak different languages depending on the preferences of the guest. Thus, in short, while sophisticated algorithms for big data can perform more knowledge work, the potential scope for the automation of physical labour is expanding in tandem. The Engineering Bottlenecks to Automation As the potential scope of automation is expanding, where will human workers still hold the comparative advantage?
 Importantly, the expanding scope of automation is not suggestive of the end of work, as has been proclaimed by several commentators and scholars. This is because despite significant advances in machine learning and mobile robotics, several engineering bottlenecks to automation remain. Specifically, Frey and Osborne identify three key bottlenecks: creative intelligence, social intelligence, as well as perception and manipulation. In this section, we briefly describe these bottlenecks, each in turn. Creative work, involving the development of novel ideas and artifacts — requiring the ability to achieve desired goals without explicit instruction — is difficult to automate by definition as computerisation usually requires some explicit instruction. To be sure, there are humanoid robots that can interpret music and make improvisations on the part of other performers, and drawing programs, such as AARON, have generated thousands of drawings being exhibited in galleries worldwide.
 Nevertheless, human workers still maintain the comparative advantage in creative work as replicating the kind of implicit reservoirs of knowledge and judgment drawn upon by human creators is extremely difficult, largely because we find it difficult to define creativity ourselves. Thus, although it is clearly possible to design an algorithm that can churn out an endless sequence of paintings, it is difficult to teach the algorithm to differentiate between the emotionally powerful and the rest. 6 MGI (2013), “Disruptive technologies: Advances that will transform life, business, and the global economy”, McKinsey Global Institute. Creative intelligence, social intelligence, and perception and manipulation are three potential bottlenecks to expanding the scope of automation January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 13 The reason tasks requiring social intelligence are difficult to automate is largely similar: social intelligence requires a wealth of tacit knowledge, about social and cultural contexts, and thus involve a wider range of subtleties that are difficult to specify and often give rise to misinterpretations, even among humans. The state-ofthe-art of automation technology in the context of social interactions is best captured by Eugene Goostman, a software chatterbot, managing to convince a third of judges on a panel that it was human based on five minutes of text communication. Nevertheless, it did so by pretending to be a 13-year old boy using English as a second language.
 Thus, more challenging forms of social intelligence, including coordination, teaching, negotiation and mentoring, is today far from automatable. Which Skills Are Least Automatable? Technology is leading to increasing automation, but not all work skills are equally replaceable. In recent work (by Linda Perkio and Michael A Osborne), we make use of advanced machine learning techniques to highlight which job characteristics are most likely to be associated with that job being computerised. Our findings reinforce the conclusions found in the previous work of Frey & Osborne that originality and social intelligence are the most profound bottlenecks to automation. Our analysis is built on the 2010 edition of O⋆NET, a service developed for the US Department of Labor.
 O⋆NET provides a "standardised, measurable set of variables", comprising 277 quantitative descriptions of the skill requirements for each of 702 detailed occupations in the US. O⋆NET was originally collected by labour market analysts, but has been subsequently updated and revised with the use of surveys of both incumbent workers and experts, enabling it to reflect the changing nature of job tasks. We consider 67 of the 277 variables: we selected those that provide data for all or most occupations, and excluded other variables with much missing data. These variables capture a diverse range of different skills, and include examples that typify social and creative bottlenecks. We list the names and definitions of some pertinent example variables below.  Originality: "The ability to come up with unusual or clever ideas about a given topic or situation, or to develop creative ways to solve a problem.
"  Service Orientation: "Actively looking for ways to help people."  Manual Dexterity: "The ability to quickly move your hand, your hand together with your arm, or your two hands to grasp, manipulate, or assemble objects."  Gross Body Coordination: "The ability to coordinate the movement of your arms, legs, and torso together when the whole body is in motion." Each variable gives, for each occupation, an integer between 0 and 100, which quantifies the level at which a certain skill or ability is required. For example, for the attribute Manual Dexterity, a low level corresponds to "Screw a light bulb into a light socket"; medium level is exemplified by "Pack oranges in crates as quickly as possible"; high level is described as "Perform open-heart surgery with surgical instruments". To make the link to automatability, Frey and Osborne (2013) identified a training set of 70 occupations using these O⋆NET variables, along with O⋆NET's open-ended descriptions of the tasks performed by each occupation.
 This training set described the occupations that were most emblematically either automatable (e.g. Data Entry Keyers) or non-automatable (e.g. Clergy). Specifically, occupations were chosen for which the question: "Can the tasks of this job be sufficiently specified, conditional on Michael Osborne Co-Director for the Oxford Martin Programme on Technology and Employment and Associate Professor in Machine Learning at the University of Oxford Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions January 2016 © 2016 Citigroup 14 the availability of big data, to be performed by state of the art computer-controlled equipment?
" could be most confidently answered. We next proceeded to use a probabilistic classification algorithm to learn the relationships between the labels of automatability and the O⋆NET variables. We additionally performed feature selection to choose the variables that were most informative in predicting the labels. Those labels that were chosen can be thought of as those that are most strongly correlated with automatability: high scores on these variables are likely to render an occupation secure from automation. Crucially, a variable's significance cannot be assessed in isolation: even if poor individually, it may contribute in conjunction with another. For example, it is clear that while Gross Body Coordination is relatively uninformative on its own, it can substantially assist classification if Originality is also available.
 For this reason, we used a non-linear classifier that is able to benefit from these correlations. Multiple methods of classification and feature selection were trialled: our confidence in our conclusions is reinforced by the consistency in their results. Firstly, Originality was by some way the most important individual feature. This supports the argument that human creativity is the most difficult human faculty to automate. It is certainly possible to design an algorithm that can churn out an endless sequence of paintings, but it is still difficult to teach such an algorithm the difference between the emotionally powerful and the dreck. In a study with UK charity Nesta, Frey and Osborne (2014) found, for both the UK and the US, that almost 90% of creative jobs are at low or no risk of automation.
 Secondly, the best pair of variables was the combination of Originality with Service Orientation. Recall that we listed social intelligence as the second bottleneck to automation. Social intelligence is such a bottleneck because subtle interactions with other people, such as the anticipation of others' needs that Service Orientation embodies, draw upon implicit reservoirs of knowledge and judgement that are difficult to represent explicitly in code. Our conclusion is hence that a job is particularly well-insulated from automation if it combines high originality with a high requirement for active interaction with other people. The challenge of automating tasks requiring perception and manipulation skills can more fully be described as the challenge of perceiving and interacting with unstructured physical environments. Consider, for example, the task of cleaning a home, and associated sub-tasks such as the identification of dirty objects.
 Understanding that a plant pot containing a plant is not dirty, while similar dirt on a floor needs to be cleaned is intuitive to most humans, but difficult to grasp for a robot. In addition to the challenge of perceiving and distinguishing between various objects, a generalist robot that is able to manipulate all sorts of irregular objects contained in a home is difficult. For example, manipulating an object with some understanding of its material characteristics, to make sure that it is not damaged in the process, requires a deep understanding which is difficult to reproduce within software. Thus, in time-varying, heterogeneous environments, the tacit knowledge and pliable hands possessed by humans are likely to remain superior to robotic labour for some time. January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 15 Impacts on the US Labour Market So how significant will these developments be in terms of their employment impact? According to research by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, 47 percent of the US workforce is at risk of automation as a result of these trends.
7 This does not necessarily imply that all of these jobs in fact will be automated. A job is considered to be “exposed to automation” or “automatable” if the tasks it entails allows the work to be performed by a computer, even if a job is not actually automated. Although many cashiers have been displaced by self-service technology, for example, there are still more than 3 million cashiers in employment in the United States. A wide range of jobs are exposed to recent trends in technology. Jobs in transportation, logistics, as well as office and administrative support, are among the most susceptible. As autonomous vehicles are already being developed and augmenting cars with advanced sensors is becoming more cost-effective, this prediction is seemingly accurate.
 Algorithms for big data are similarly already capable of displacing human workers in most tasks that involve the storing or processing of information, making a substantial share of office and administrative support jobs automatable. In the light of the recent expansion of jobs in non-tradable services, however, the most interesting finding is perhaps that many service occupations, where the most job growth has occurred over the past decades, are now susceptible to computerisation. Yet there is already some evidence that this trend is underway. According to some estimates, the market for personal and household service robots is now experiencing annual growth rates of around 20 percent.8 As machines will get better at performing tasks involving mobility and dexterity over time, the pace of displacement in service occupations is likely to increase even further. Nevertheless, around 33% of US employment remains at low risk of automation, while another 19% is categorised at medium risk.
 Jobs at the low risk of automation consist of generalist occupations requiring knowledge of human heuristics, and occupations involving the development of novel ideas and artifacts. In other words, the common denominator for low risk jobs is that they are intensive in social and creative skills. Most management, business, and finance occupations, which are intensive in work requiring social skills, are largely confined to the low-risk category. This is also true of most occupations in arts and media, as well as jobs in education and healthcare. The low susceptibility of engineering and science occupations to computerisation, on the other hand, is largely due to the high degree of creativity skills they require. Finally, while there is plenty of anecdotal evidence about knowledge work becoming increasingly automated, low- skilled jobs are the ones that are most susceptible to automation.
 In other words, Frey and Osborne predict a shift from the computerisation of middle-income jobs to computers mainly substituting for low-income, low-skill workers over the next decades. Developing Countries at Risk As emerging technologies increasingly substitute for low-skilled workers, what are the impacts on developing economies likely to be? 7 Frey, C. B. and Osborne, M. A.
 (2013). The Future of Employment: How Susceptible are Jobs to Computerisation? Oxford Martin School Working Paper No. 7. 8 MGI (2013), “Disruptive technologies: Advances that will transform life, business, and the global economy”, McKinsey Global Institute. Jobs in transportation and logistics as well as office and administration support are among the most susceptible to automation The pace of displacement in service occupations is also expected to increase Low-skilled jobs are the ones that are most susceptible to automation in the future Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions January 2016 © 2016 Citigroup 16 Throughout the 20th century, the adoption of new technology has been an essential component of countries development strategies.
 The way the Industrial Revolution provided the foundation of sustained growth in the West, industrialisation has permitted a number of emerging economies to catch up, including Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. These remarkable growth stories were achieved by shifting workers from labour-intensive production to more capital-intensive products such as motor vehicles, and more recently to human capital-intensive activities such as information and communication technology. China has similarly managed the transition to capital-intensive products, and with a per capita income of about $8,280, it has now become a middle-income country. Sometimes this phase is referred to as a middle-income trap, as history suggests that countries entering the middle-income bracket often come to experience stagnant growth. The Great Divergence Despite a number of non-Western economies having successfully managed the industrialisation process, income inequalities across the globe have grown significantly since the Industrial Revolution. In 1820, incomes in Western countries were 1.
9 times the average of incomes in the non-Western world.9 Over the course of the next 180 years, the West experienced a “Great Divergence” from the rest: by 2000, their per capita income was 7.2 times the average of non-Western countries. One of the main reasons for this divergence is that while emerging economies have become better at adopting new technologies, they are getting worse at putting them into widespread use. For example, in a recent study, Diego Comin and Martí Mestieri Ferrer asked the question: if technology has arrived everywhere, why has income diverged? Doing so, they show that lags in technology adoption across countries have declined significantly over the past two centuries, and this decline has recently accelerated: while it took 131 years for steam and motor ships to reach Indonesia, after their initial adoption in Britain, it took 11 years for the computer to diffuse from the United States to Vietnam.
 By contrast, however, the degree to which new technologies diffuse across the population after their initial adoption has widened over the same period. Thus, in short, although there has been convergence in adoption lags between rich and poor countries, there has also been divergence in long-run penetration rates once technologies are adopted, explaining divergent income patterns since the Industrial Revolution: the divergence in penetration rates can account for 82 percent of the increase in the income gap since 1820.10 ‘Premature Deindustrialisation’ Although a number of Asian economies have managed to catch up over recent decades, the developing world as a whole has shown little sign of closing the income gap. One exception, however, is in manufacturing industries, which have experienced unconditional convergence in labour productivity across countries.11 Because manufacturing companies produce goods that are traded on international markets, and thus operate under constant competitive threat from abroad, these firms constantly need to improve production processes to remain competitive. Furthermore, since manufacturing processes are not subject to external conditions, such as soil and weather, in the same way as agriculture, they are easier to standardise and automate, and therefore more similar across geographies.

 The divergence in penetration rates of technology adoption can account for 82% of the increase in income gap across the globe January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 17 As a result, manufacturing is becoming less labour-intensive in the emerging and developing world also, contributing to a growing concern over “premature deindustrialisation.” For example, a recent study by Dani Rodrik has persuasively shown that over the course of the 20th century, peak manufacturing employment has declined among emerging economies.12 Manufacturing employment in the United Kingdom, for example, peaked at 45% of total employment just before World War I. Today’s emerging economies, in contrast, including Brazil and India, have already seen manufacturing employment peak at no more than 15% (See Figure 1). Furthermore, in Africa, a recent report by the UN’s Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) estimates that between 1980 and 2013 the manufacturing sector’s contribution to total economic activity on the continent declined from 12% to 11%. In most of sub-Saharan Africa, the manufacturing share of output has persistently declined over the past 25 years.
 The share of jobs in manufacturing is even smaller: just over 6% of all jobs. This figure barely changed over the course of the three decades leading up to 2008, while manufacturing employment in Asia grew from 11% to 16% over the same period. Figure 1. Peak Manufacturing Employment Share and GDP per Capita When It Peaked Source: GGDC-10 Sector database, World Bank Development Indicators, Citi Research The reason for this is that manufacturing processes, also in low- and middle-income countries, are more automated today than in the past. A recent report by Citi and the Oxford Martin School shows that China, has already replaced the US as the largest market for industrial automation. This is indeed part of the country’s development strategy: in China’s 12th Five Year Plan, workforce automation recently emerged as a strategic area, seen as essential to maintain the country’s competitiveness in manufacturing, and potentially prevent production from shifting to low-income destinations where labour is cheaper.
 Some emerging economies have, however, also experienced declines in manufacturing output which cannot be explained by production processes being increasingly automated. Rodrik (2015) thus argues that globalisation provides an alternative, albeit complementary, explanation for countries experiencing premature 12 Rodrick, D.

Crucially, while many 20th century technologies, including the telephone, the container ship, and the computer, contributed to the surge in international trade by allowing companies to shift production to locations with an abundance of cheap labour, recent developments in robotics and additive manufacturing now allow firms in advanced economies to locate production closer to domestic markets in automated factories. For example, despite a secular decline in its share of manufacturing employment, the US manufacturing output share has remained roughly constant.
 In other words, although the US has not produced many new jobs in production, as computer technologies provide an increasingly cheap substitute for workers, it remains a competitive manufacturing location. Even in middle-income countries, such as China, industrial automation provides an increasingly cheap substitute for labour. Recent estimates by Citi Research shows the payback period for industrial robots in China is now less than two years. (This is discussed in more detail in the chapter on barriers to automation.) In the light of these technological developments, industrialisation is likely to yield substantially less manufacturing employment in the next generation of emerging economies than in the countries preceding them. Hence, it will be increasingly difficult for African and South American manufacturing firms to create jobs in the same numbers that Asian companies have done.
 In other words, today’s lowincome countries will not have the same possibility of achieving rapid growth by shifting workers from farms to higher-paying factory jobs. In the absence of export-led manufacturing growth as a path to prosperity, developing countries will need to search for new growth models. Service-led growth constitutes one option, but many low-skill services are now becoming equally automatable. Building on the work of Frey and Osborne, a recent World Bank Report shows that developing countries are highly susceptible to the expanding scope of automation, even relative to advanced economies where labour costs are high. As shown in Figure 2, the susceptibility to automation across the developing world ranges from 55% in Uzbekistan, to 85% in Ethiopia, with a substantial share of the workforce being at high risk of automation in countries such as China and India (77 percent and 69 percent, respectively). These figures, in turn, can be compared to the OECD average, which the World Bank estimates at 57 percent.
 Furthermore, countries with a higher share of their workforce “at risk” typically exhibit lower levels of GDP per capita, as highlighted by Figure 3. Thus, there are reasons to be concerned about the future of income convergence, as low-income countries are relatively vulnerable to automation. Due to an increase in automation in manufacturing, low income countries will not achieve rapid growth by shifting workers from agriculture to factory jobs The susceptibility to automation across developing countries ranges from 55% in Uzbekistan to 85% in Ethiopia January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 19 Figure 2. Developing Countries Susceptibility to Automation Figure 3. Countries Susceptibility to Automation is Negatively Associated with their GDP per Capita Source: World Bank Development Report 2016; based on Frey and Osborne (2013) methodology, Citi Research Source: World Bank Development Report 2016; World Bank national accounts data. Note: For Angola and Malta 2013 GDP per capita figures were used, Citi Research A crucial reason why developing countries are more susceptible to automation relative to high-income countries however is that while many jobs are “automatable” in the developing world, automating them is not yet economically feasible due to the abundance of cheap labour.
 As shown by a number of studies, labour-saving inventions may only be adopted if the access to cheap labour is scarce or prices of capital are relatively high.13 For example, case study evidence suggests that mechanisation in 18th century cotton production initially only occurred in Britain because wage levels were much higher relative to prices of capital than in other countries.14 In addition, recent empirical research reveals a causal relationship between the access to cheap labour and mechanisation in agricultural production, in terms of sustained economic transition towards increased mechanisation in areas characterised by low-wage worker out-migration. Thus, in essence, while the potential labour market disruption associated with the expanding scope of automation is likely to affect the developing world later than advanced economies, it may be potentially more disruptive in countries with little consumer demand and limited social safety nets. Developing countries would thus do well to plan ahead of such an event. This means investing more in education and boosting domestic demand.
 Because skilled jobs are substantially less susceptible to automation, the best hope for developing and emerging economies alike is to upskill their workforce. That has indeed also been the lesson from regional development patterns in advanced economies. For example, while Ford and General Motors have some of the most advanced production facilities in the world, the city of Detroit has failed to create employment opportunities in new occupations and industries. By contrast, the cities that have successfully managed the renewal process, including New York, Boston and San Francisco, have done so by educating and attracting pools of talent. We examine the implications of the expanding scope of automation for regional development in a later chapter but first we look at how automation is changing the trend of offshoring to low cost regions. 13 Habakkuk, Hrothgar John (1962), American and British technology in the nineteenth century: The search for labour-saving inventions, Cambridge University Press.

Highlights  After a period of Global Value Chain proliferation, there are clear signs that the pace of goods production fragmentation across borders is slowing.  Seventy percent of clients surveyed believe automation and the developments in 3D printing will encourage companies to move their manufacturing closer to home. North America is seen as having the most to gain from this trend, while China has the most to lose.
  As technology advances, emerging market (EM) countries need to diversify and find ways to move up the value-added chain to stay competitive. They must also boost service productivity growth. ICT Revolution and ‘Second Unbundling’ in Global Value Chains The scope and nature of globalisation have changed dramatically over human history. The first major wave of globalisation starting in the latter half of the 19th century was triggered by significant reduction in transportation costs (steam engine, railroads, ‘industrial revolution’), which facilitated the geographic separation between where goods are produced and where they are consumed, alongside the transfer of ideas. Further technological advancements in transport in the last century, including containerisation and air cargo, plus the entry of major economies like China and India into the global trading system, allowed this process to accelerate. This is what Baldwin (2006) calls the ‘first unbundling’.
15 However, a second and different type of ‘unbundling’ (overlapping with the first one) took place in recent decades with the ICT revolution that helped pave the way for proliferation of Global Value Chains (GVC), or the fragmentation of production across borders. Rapidly declining cost and increased power of computing and advances in communication technology have made it increasingly economical to unbundle various tasks depending on comparative advantages, with much improved ability to coordinate and monitor production across large distances. Goods production became increasingly fragmented into stages spread out across borders — but beyond this, even the ability to offshore services has risen rapidly over the last two decades. Global value chain linkages can be decomposed into two types: (1) ‘backward linkages’, wherein domestic firms use foreign intermediate value added as inputs for its exports; and,(2) ‘forward linkages’, wherein a country’s exports are inputs to other countries’ exports, the sum of which we use as a measure of GVC participation rate, shown on Figure 4. 15 Baldwin, Richard, (2006), “Globalisation: The Great Unbundling(s)”. Economic Council of Finland, 2006.
 Johanna Chua Head of Asia Pacific Economics and Market Analysis, Citi January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 21 GVC trade expanded significantly since the 1990s and we think advancing technology, plus trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) liberalisation and improved logistics infrastructure, facilitated this. Supply chain fragmentation will mean goods will cross borders many times to undergo various phases of ‘processing’ until they reach their final destination. This helps explain why, in previous decades, (goods) trade elasticity was very high relative to income. East Asia as well as parts of Europe were very active in the global supply chain, as can be seen by their relatively high and rapidly increasing GVC participation rates from 1995 to 2005 (Figure 4). We believe such trade engagement was a significant driver of productivity-driven growth, generating technology/knowledge transfer, employment and higher incomes in East Asia. However, there are now clear signs that the pace of goods production fragmentation across borders is slowing, a trend even preceding the Great Financial Crisis (GFC).
 We view this as an important structural factor compounded by cyclical weakness that explains why global trade growth has been so subdued relative to GDP growth. Constantinescu et al. (2015) estimate that the elasticity of trade to income in the 2000s halved relative to the 1990s.16 We think China is at the forefront of this dynamic, given that more of its supply chain is shifting domestically as seen by the declining share of processing trade to global trade (Figure 5). China's growing market size, technology upgrading, and more recently, significant excess capacity in many upstream industries, has enabled it to source more of its intermediate inputs onshore (i.e.
 'backward linkages' has fallen more over the years and likely continues to do so; see Figure 6). Figure 5. China- Share of Processing Trade has been Coming Off Figure 6.

 We look closely at how domestic value added (DVA) in 'manufactured goods' exports (to remove distortions from the commodities trade) have evolved in Figure 11. Unfortunately, data are released with a significant lag.17 In the last several years, DVA of manufactured goods exports have grown in China, the Philippines, Singapore, and Malaysia. For parts of industrialised Asia (KR, TW, JP), sadly even for mid-income Thailand, and parts of EM (Turkey), they are not only losing goods export market share (except for Korea) but also face diminishing DVA, which could be signs of growing competitiveness challenges.

While demand for goods and services should be correlated, we find that services trade growth has diverged relative to goods trade in some areas over the last few years (Figure 10).
 Perhaps the digital world may have shifted the trade in value added from physical to virtual goods over time, which may to a degree explain the weakness in goods trade. Or perhaps productivity gains from GVC trade in services has not yet reached its peak the way it has for goods, and improving technology plus growing efficiencies from 'economies of scale' remain conducive to further service offshoring. We think this will continue to benefit more the populous low-income English-speaking economies (notably India and Philippines), which look relatively competitive (Figure 9). -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% Sep-10 Sep-11 Sep-12 Sep-13 Sep-14 Sep-15 US & EA 19 EA-Services US-Services EA-Goods US-Goods Rolling 6M Sum (%YoY) -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% Sep-10 Sep-11 Sep-12 Sep-13 Sep-14 SepChina & Taiwan CN-Services TW-Services CN-Goods TW-Goods Rolling 6M Sum (%YoY) -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% Sep-10 Sep-11 Sep-12 Sep-13 Sep-14 Sep-1 India & Philippines PH-Services IN-Services PH-Goods IN-Goods Rolling 6M Sum (%YoY) Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions January 2016 © 2016 Citigroup 24 These rankings would also suggest China, Malaysia, and Vietnam could also benefit but, on net service trade balance of what we believe to be the more technology-induced tradable services — ICT and ‘Other Business Services’ — only the Philippines, India, Taiwan (though small relative to its weak goods trade), some Eastern European countries and marginally China (small relative to its GDP) seem to be making inroads (Figure 11). Meanwhile, Japan, Korea and others in ASEAN (except we have no data to validate Vietnam) look increasingly uncompetitive. Figure 11.
 Net ICT and Business Services Exports (% of GDP) Figure 12. Domestic Value Added of Service Exports is Very High Source: CEIC, Haver, Citi Research Source: OECD Tiva, Citi Research While the value of service trade is much smaller than goods trade for EM Asia, accounting for only an average of ~ 25% of its annual nominal value (China and Indonesia being low at 17% of goods trade, and the Philippines and India being high at 45% and 37% of goods trade, respectively), the domestic value added is so much higher in services (Figure 12) – averaging 82% versus 65% for manufactured goods. Thus, we should not underestimate the spillover impact of tradable services on the domestic economy and, among other things, this helps explain why India and Philippines growth have outperformed the region. Meanwhile, with relatively weak goods trade performance on top of already-weak services sector productivity and competitiveness, the growth prognosis remains more challenging for industrialised Asia, especially Singapore and Korea where services productivity growth is low,18 and even Thailand seems to have limited dynamism in services trade outside of tourism. Industrial Robotics Revolution – Conducive to ‘Rebundling’? Beyond advances in ICT, we think significant advances in the use of automation and industrial robotics to aid manufacturing processes in recent years will also have a significant impact on global supply chains.
 The use of robotics is at least a fourdecade phenomenon, but the process appears to have accelerated since the global financial crisis, seeing average robot sales rise on a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 17% per year in 2010-14 (in fact, up almost 29% year-over-year in 2014 alone!) versus only average CAGR 3% per year in 2004-08. This comes even while global growth, especially industrial production growth, had actually decelerated in recent years versus the pre-GFC period (Figure 13). We think there are three main 18 For an earlier discussion, see Asia Macro and Strategy Outlook - Dematerialized World (March 2015) -10 -8 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 PH IN TW PL CZ CN US TH RU KR SG MY ID JP % of GDP ICT & Other Business Services Balance 2005 2009 Jul-14-Jun15 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 US CN JP TR ID IN EA5 PH TW CEE TH KR VN MY SG % Domestic VA Foreign VA Automation and industrial robots could also have a significant impact on global supply chains January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 25 drivers of this record acceleration of robotic use. First, rapid wage gains (plus aging populations) in large manufacturing-producing countries – especially China – have induced demand for automation.19 Second, the prices of hardware and ‘enabling’ software have declined markedly, making it an increasingly attractive investment; and third, technological advances (everything from vision sensors, gripping systems, etc.
) have increased the scope and usability of robotics, not only making robots smarter, safer and more applicable across a broader range of processes, but also delivering more consistent and better product quality. Thus, even relatively lowwage countries, India and Indonesia, for example, have seen brisk robotic sales. Figure 13. World – Industrial Robot Sales have Outpaced IP Figure 14. Trends in Manufacturing Compensation Costs (2003=100)* Source: World Robotics, CPB Netherlands, Citi Research Source: Conference Board, Research; Note: In US$, also includes benefits Nonetheless, not all industries can benefit equally from the developments of robotics. International Federation of Robotics (IFR) data shows that robotic usage is highly concentrated in three major industry groupings (all under SITC code 7) — vehicles & transportation equipment, electronics & electrical equipment, and machinery (Figure 16).
 Interestingly, these are also the same industries that historically had been very susceptible to production fragmentation via GVC given the complexity of products and processes involved. Thus, rapid growth of automation/robotics will likely have significant implication on GVC trade in the future, on top of ability of other countries to benefit from participating in this GVC. 19 While hourly manufacturing compensation costs in China are only estimated to be 8% that of the US in 2013, it was only 2% of the US a decade earlier. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 Volume of Industrial Robot Sales Industrial Production ex Construction 2005=100 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2005=100 CN KR GE US JP Figure 15.

 …and Five Countries Dominate Robotic Use Source: IFR World Robotics 2015, Citi Research (Note: In Units) Source: IFR World Robotics, Citi Research Given that robotics are historically expensive and more efficient when used at a large scale, robotic installations are very geographically concentrated — about 75% of industrial robots globally go to five countries — China, Germany, Japan, Korea, and the US. China is, by far, the fastest growing market (Figure 17) and its still relatively low robot density relative to peers leaves significant room for future growth (Figure 15). According to Boston Consulting Group projections, at least 85% of the production tasks in these robotic-intensive industries (under SITC code 7) can be automated. With wages in these industries also higher than the average for manufacturing given its higher skill requirements, they are ripe for continued automation over time. The impact on relative cost saving from automation is expected to be higher among those with relatively high labour costs to begin with. For example, BCG estimates that, as robotics systems cost around $10-$20 per hour, on average, to own and operate in the US in these sectors — already lower than US manufacturing wages — and are projected to decline further such that, in ten years, robots are estimated to eventually perform about 40-45% of production tasks versus <10% today.
 20 The top suppliers for industrial robotics who can benefit from this growth are concentrated in developed markets — Japan (Yaskawa, Fanuc and Kawasaki), Germany (Kuka) and Switzerland (ABB) — though there are new entrants from China with government also backing the industry through its "Made in 2025" program, though for now, China is still, technology-wise, lagging significantly behind. 21 20 For a comprehensive discussion, please see Sirkin, H. et al.

We can tangentially analyse this by looking at the export market share of the most robot-intensive industry, Road Vehicles & Transport Equipment — Germany continues to dominate, but even the US (alongside Mexico) is gaining ground (Figure 18).
 In the electronics/ electrical equipment industry where there are likely to be more diverse tasks (in some cases, dealing with very small components that can still be more cheaply handled by hand), East Asia continues to do well but, interestingly, production is increasingly concentrated in a few countries, notably China but, more recently, we see a catch-up in Vietnam (Figure 19). Scope for automation and industrial robotics will likely significantly alter manufacturing competitiveness, and we think could lead to some ‘rebundling’ or ‘reshoring’ of some manufacturing supply chains in critical geographical hubs. Will automation and developments in 3D printing encourage companies to move their manufacturing closer to home?

Based on pace of robotic adoption (high in parts of East Asia and the Czech Republic, slower in Brazil and even higher wage economies like Australia or Spain) relative to trends in wage costs (low wage countries like Indonesia and India will see less impact on reducing costs), BCG estimates that manufacturing cost competitiveness by 2025 from robotics could tilt in favour of the existing industrial powerhouses. Sirkin et al (2015)22 estimate that Korea, Germany, China, Japan, and US are expected to be in a stronger position via larger cost competitiveness gains in the coming decade from the use of robotics, while select EM countries including Indonesia, India, and Mexico will be less so.
 EM economies could more than compensate for any robotic cost disadvantage via other means, such as improved logistics infrastructure. Nonetheless, depending on the speed at which robotic technology progresses, what may look like a small impact now could snowball to larger cost competitiveness shifts over time, and could disadvantage EM economies that do not keep up from a manufacturing cost-competitiveness standpoint. 22 For a comprehensive discussion, please see Sirkin, H. et al. "The Robotics Revolution - The Next Great Leap in Manufacturing" Boston Consulting Group (September 2015). Korea, Germany, China, Japan, and the US are expected to obtain large competitive gains from the use of robotics January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 29 Financial and technological hurdles for robotic/automation adoption are expected to decline over time, and more sectors could enter a “turning point” wherein adoption could accelerate in nonlinear ways.
 For now, a lot of the scope for automation and robotic use is relatively more limited in other industries and services, especially in EM where labour costs are still low and humans are still the most cost-efficient means for assembly. In the case of robots used for services, annual sales are only about 11% of those used for industry, according to the International Federation of Robotics, the bulk of which – 45% of total –are used in defence applications (e.g. drones). Nonetheless, with the rapid developments in big data analytics, advances in artificial intelligence and autonomous machines (e.g.
 self-driving cars, self-service kiosks), the scope for labour displacement would grow such that even many ‘outsourced’ labour intensive-professional services, like data entry and medical transcription, could become increasingly automated. Thus, Asia needs to continue to find ways to move up the value-added chain to stay competitive, not just with other EM economies, but with advanced economies that may be increasingly equipped with technology. China seems to be following in the footsteps of other industrialised Asian economies in terms of spending more on R&D to upgrade technology, and we think they are in a relatively strong position to catch up in manufacturing from more advanced peers. A recent report from Citi Strategy highlighted that China’s R&D expenditure ranks globally at No.2, and R&D as a % of GDP has jumped fourfold in 20 years to 2.1%.
23 However, in a world where labour-substituting technology continues to expand, this means employment among EM economies, as in developed markets (DM), will remain highly skewed to the services sector, which may be less productive and, in the EM context, mired in informality and small-scale enterprises. The extent to which countries can boost service productivity growth comparable to manufacturing will be important and will depend on the ability to upgrade skills, provide a conducive regulatory environment, harness technology and tap into widely disseminated ‘global knowledge’ to catch up with the frontier. This is easier said than done. We next look at the susceptibility of automation within countries, focusing on US cities. Figure 22. R&D Expenditures (% of GDP) – 2013 and 10-yr Change Figure 23.

Cities at Risk Highlights  Historically, new technologies have not only transformed companies and industries, but cities and regions. The expanding scope of automation to low end service jobs may shift the fortunes of US cities once more, affecting a different set of cities than those impacted by offshoring.  Recent work by Berger, Frey and Osborne suggests major US cities exposure to future automation ranges from 54% in Fresno to 38% in Boston.  New jobs have emerged in locations different from the ones where old jobs are likely to disappear, potentially exacerbating income disparities between US cities. Why Have Some Cities and Regions Been Better Able to Adapt to the Arrival of New Computer Technologies than Others?
 Historically, new technologies have significantly transformed companies and industries. For example, Clayton Christensen has shown in some detail how disruptive technologies have reshaped a wide range of industries, from computer hardware to retail, causing leading companies to fail in the process.24 Notably, out of the 17 companies populating the disk drive industry in 1976, only IBM’s disk drive business had not failed or been acquired by 1995. Rapid technological progress had even caused the demise of relatively large, diversified corporations such as Ampex, Control Data, Diablo, EMM, and Memorex. Similarly, by the turn of the 20th century, rail transport and the mail order catalogue fundamentally changed the retailing business, making it possible for companies like Sears Roebuck to compete in local markets across the United States. Following this disruption, Sears was regarded as the leading retailing corporation in the world for decades.
 Yet, the emergence of the online retail market changed the nature of the retailing business once more, causing Sears to lose market share as they lagged behind more adaptive companies such as Amazon. Such technological upheaval can sometimes shift the fortunes of entire cities, causing some to prosper and others to decay. For example in 1879, when George Eastman invented the emulsion-coating machine in Rochester, New York City was the centre of the photographic industry. The Eastman Kodak company soon took over the market for photographic film and Rochester replaced New York as the leading city in film production. In the 1960s, Kodak was still the largest employer in Rochester with over 60,000 employees. Yet, as with many other companies, Kodak did not manage the transition to digital photography.
 When the company finally shut down its largest research and production facility in Rochester, known as Kodak Park, the population of Rochester had not just witnessed the decline of an industrial giant, but the decline of an entire city. As Kodak's workforce dropped by almost 80 percent between 1993 and 2006, Rochester rapidly lost population. Similarly, the arrival of steel mini mills did not only result in a restructuring of the steel industry, but significantly contributed to the decline of leading steel cities, such as Pittsburgh and Youngstown.25 In other words, cities that have remained locked into old jobs, 24 Christensen, C. (1997), The innovator’s dilemma: when new technologies cause great firms to fail. Harvard Business Review Press.

Carl Benedikt Frey Co-Director for the Oxford Martin Programme on Technology and Employment and Oxford Martin Citi Fellow January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 31 that are gradually made redundant by a new technology, have eventually become subject to urban decline.
 The Computer Revolution and the Shifting Fortunes of US Cities The Computer Revolution has perhaps shifted the fortunes of US cities even more significantly than technologies of the past. Indeed, although computers have arrived everywhere, US cities have fared very differently over recent decades — while some cities have experienced rapid growth, others have virtually disappeared. In a recent study, Thor Berger and Carl Benedikt Frey show how the arrival of the personal computer (PC) in the early 1980s changed the types of jobs that were created in the US labour market, in turn leading to a shift in the fortunes of US cities. Throughout the 1970s, when technological change mainly created routine jobs, human capital abundant cities had a comparative disadvantage in new job creation, as these jobs mainly emerged in routine task-intensive industries — jobs that have since been automated away. By contrast, since the Computer Revolution of the 1980s, cities specialised in cognitive work, gained a comparative advantage in new job creation that has persisted since, mirroring trends in population and wage growth across cities over the same period. Thus, in tandem with the US labour market experiencing a secular decline in jobs intensive in routine tasks, which can easily be expressed in computer code and readily automated, cities have adjusted differently to the Computer Revolution of the 1980s.
 While places historically specialised in routine work have adopted computers to substitute for labour, human capital abundant cities that have a comparative advantage in using skill-intensive computer technologies have created new types of jobs. This is indeed also consistent with popular perceptions of urban success and decline in the US, emphasising the relative decline of old manufacturing cities such as Buffalo, Cleveland or Detroit — cities that all historically specialised in routine work. At the heart of the decline of these cities was their failure to create new employment opportunities as old ones were being eroded. Having nearly filed for bankruptcy in 1975, New York has become a primary example of how to adapt to technological change. While average wages in Detroit were slightly higher than in New York in 1977, they are now less than 60 percent of average New York incomes.26 At a time when Detroit successfully adopted computers and industrial robots to substitute for labour, New York adapted by creating new employment opportunities in professional services, computer programming and software engineering.
 Emerging Technologies and their Impacts on Cities The expanding scope of automation may shift the fortunes of US cities once more. Recent developments in Data Mining, Machine Vision, Computational Statistics and other sub-fields of AI, are widely being regarded as the beginning of a ‘Second Machine Age’. In a recent study, Thor Berger, Carl Benedikt Frey, and Michael Osborne, analysed how these technologies may impact on US cities, relative to computer technologies of the past. Importantly, they find that cities with a low exposure to the automation of routine work will for the first time find a significant share of their workforce exposed to computerisation. The potential impact of future automation is also distinct from the labour market impacts of globalisation, suggested by the fact that there is no significant overlap with the susceptibility of 26 Glaeser, E.L.
, and Ponzetto, G. (2007), Did the Death of Distance Hurt Detroit and Help New York? NBER Working Papers 13710, National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc. The arrival of the PC changed the types of jobs that were created in the US, affecting the fortunes of UScities Cities have adjusted differently to the Computer Revolution where places like New York have become a primary example of how to adapt to technological innovation Cities with low exposure to automation of routine work will for the first time find that a significant share of their workforce is exposed to computerisation Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions January 2016 © 2016 Citigroup 32 cities to offshoring. In other words, workforce automation in the 21st century will potentially affect a different set of cities than the ones that have historically seen workers made redundant by computerisation and offshoring. The exposure of US cities to future automation ranges from 54% in Fresno, to 38% percent in Boston (see Figure 24).
 Notably, the cities with the highest share of their workforce exposed to automation (with the exception of Grand Rapids), do not include any Rust Belt manufacturing cities, such as Buffalo, Cleveland, and Detroit. Instead, some of the cities most at risk, include places in the Sun Belt that have recently faded: both Fresno and Las Vegas suffered some of the steepest drops in housing prices during the Great Financial Crisis, becoming plentiful in empty homes and office buildings. The cities that are least susceptible to automation, in contrast, include well-known examples of skilled cities, such as Boston, New York, San Francisco and Washington D.C. Figure 24.

 If people are willing to commute between various towns those towns together constitute a local labour market. For example Toms River is the largest of many towns that people commute between. Explaining the Exposure of Cities to Automation The variation in the exposure of cities to the expanding scope of automation can at least partly be explained by industry specialisation patterns. In general, more specialised cities have a larger share of jobs at ‘high risk’ of automation, while diversified cities are more resilient to the expanding scope of automation. In other words, industrial diversification can make cities more resilient to negative demand shocks in any specific industry. Fresno and Las Vegas are the most exposed to automation, whilst Boston and Washington D.
C. are the least exposed Specialised cities have a larger exposure to automation January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 33 Figure 25. Manufacturing Cities Remain More Susceptible to Automation Source: Berger, Frey and Osborne (2015) The type of industries cities have specialised in also matter. For example, cities specialised in manufacturing continue to be relatively exposed to automation, and without efforts to create new industries, manufacturing cities are likely to experience continued decline. In addition, cities specialised in service jobs are now, for the first time, exposed to automation. This contrasts with the experience of the past decades, when most US job growth occurred in service occupations.
27 Cities that remain relatively safe from automation are the ones that have specialised in relatively skilled industries, including information, finance, insurance & real estate (FIRE), education, and professional services, or creative industries, such as the arts. 27 Autor, D. and Dorn, D., (2013), The Growth of low skill service jobs and polarization of the US labour market, American Economic Review, Vol. 103(5), pp. 1553-97.

 Cities with New Industries are Less Susceptible to Automation Source: Berger, Frey and Osborne (2015) The research by Berger, Frey, and Osborne further suggests that the best way forward for cities looking to reduce their exposure to automation is to boost their technological dynamism and attract more skilled workers. The cities that are least exposed to automation have been substantially more innovative in terms of patent output, have created more new businesses and managed to shift their workforce into new and emerging industries, over the past decade. Examples of such industries include video and audio streaming, online auctions and web design. Because technological change has recently been skill-biased, attracting skilled workers is also increasingly crucial. As shown by Berger and Frey, new industries that emerged throughout the 2000s are substantially more skill-intensive than other industries. Furthermore, workers in industries that experienced rapid technological change earn much higher wages: the average wage for workers in new industries is more than twice the US median wage.
 In other words, initially skilled cities have created even more jobs for skilled workers. Crucially, these new industries have mainly appeared in urban locations. In particular, cities that were already dense in college-educated workers experienced substantially more additions of new industries (Figure 27). It is also noteworthy that many cities with high fractions of new industries are well-known for their specialisation in information technology. The highest employment shares in new industries, for example, are exhibited by San Jose and Santa Fe, incorporating Silicon Valley and the Info Mesa cluster respectively. Other cities where new industries are prominent include Washington, D.
C. and San Francisco, where Instagram, Dropbox, Uber, Internet Archive and Twitter are all located or began. 35 40 45 50 55 60 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.

Cities With Higher Share of College Educated Workers Have Created More Jobs in New Industries Source: Berger and Frey (2015) The Great Divergence of US Cities In tandem with the polarisation of labour markets, prosperity has already become increasingly unevenly distributed across locations within the United States. According to Enrico Moretti the Great Divergence of cities in the United States has its origins in the 1980s, when skills started to dictate the fortunes of US cities. Thor Berger and Carl Benedikt Frey further show that this tendency is intimately associated with the Computer Revolution of the 1980s, as new computer-related jobs overwhelmingly concentrated to initially human capital abundant cities.
 Over the forthcoming decades this trend is likely to continue. As shown by Thor Berger, Carl Benedikt Frey, and Michael Osborne, over the course of the 2000s, new jobs have emerged in places that are relatively safe from automation, while cities with a larger share of their workforce exposed to the expanding scope of automation have failed to create new jobs. The expanding scope of automation is likely to further exacerbate income disparities between US cities. Cities that exhibited both higher average levels of income in 2000 as well as the average income growth between 2000 and 2010, are less exposed to recent trends in automation. Thus, cities with higher incomes, and the ones experiencing more rapid income growth, have fewer jobs that are amenable to automation. Similarly, cities with a higher share of top-1% income earners are less susceptible to automation, implying that inequality between the 1 percent and the 99 percent may widen as workforce automation continues.
 In contrast, cities with a larger share of middle class workers also are more at risk of computerisation. Hence, new jobs have emerged in different locations from the ones where old jobs are likely to disappear, potentially exacerbating the ongoing divergence between US cities. Looking forward, this trend will require workers to relocate from contracting to expanding cities. Supporting such relocation is particularly important since the arrival of new technology jobs creates additional demand for local services. For 0.0 0.

Thus, while technology does perhaps not create as many jobs directly as in the past, its indirect impact on service employment is substantial.
 Nevertheless, because new technology jobs overwhelmingly cluster in highly skilled cities, low skilled workers will inevitably have to follow, making economic activity even more concentrated.

New Jobs in a New Economy Highlights  This chapter highlights the new and emerging job openings over the next decade in a number of different sectors.  In the EU, it is estimated that there will be job openings in all sectors with additional jobs estimated at over 9.5 million and replacement jobs at 98 million between 2013 and 2025.
  In the US the largest number of job openings is predicted to be in the health sector (> 4 million). New jobs are also needed in the green sector and industrial sector.  The IT sector should continue to create new employment opportunities including: security analysts; data scientists; cloud architects; and the implementation and analysis of the Internet of Things. Robots will replace jobs but also generate new jobs for engineers and technicians.  The new types of jobs that will be created will require people to be highly skilled; in fact it is forecasted that nearly half of the new opportunities in the EU will require high skilled workers. In 1961, Time magazine published a story called “The Automation Jobless” which stated that “The number of jobs lost to more efficient machines is only part of the problem.
 What worries many job experts more is that automation may prevent the economy from creating enough jobs.” Two years later Life Magazine held up a picture of a device called the MilwaukeeMatic, an innovative industrial machining tool, surrounded by the 18 workers that it could replace. Automation and joblessness became such a huge issue that President Lyndon established the ‘Blue-Ribbon National Commission on Technology, Automation and Economic Progress’. The Commission studied the effects on productivity, labour, and automation and concluded that automation did not as such threaten employment and there were more important factors at stake: “Thus technological change (along with other forms of economic change) is an important determinant of the precise places, industries, and people affected by unemployment. But the general level of demand for goods and services is by far the most important factor determining how many are affected, how long they stay unemployed, and how hard it is for new entrants to the labour market to find jobs. The basic fact is that technology eliminates jobs, not work”.
28 Clearly in the past, automation and technological progress have not made human labour obsolete, in fact we have managed to adapt by creating new jobs to compensate for the loss of labour. In 1900, 41% of the US workforce was employed in agriculture; however by the year 2000, that share had fallen to 2%, mostly due to mechanisation of the sector. In the developed world, industrialisation moved people into factories and then moved them out again into services. Throughout these changes the number of jobs has always increased. US employment increased from 1950 to 2014, and the unemployment rate in 2015 (5%) is returning back to its average after the financial recession of 2008/2009 (Figure 30 below). 28 Autor D.
H., (2015), Why are there still so many jobs? The History and Future of Workplace Automation, Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol. 29, No. 3 pp 3-30. Elizabeth Curmi Thematic Analyst, Citi Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions January 2016 © 2016 Citigroup 38 Meanwhile, today’s newer technology sectors have not provided the same opportunities, particularly for less educated workers, as the industries that preceded them.
 This downward trend in new job creation in technology industries is particularly evident since the Computer Revolution of the 1980s. A study by Jeffery Lin suggests that while about 8.2% of the US workforce shifted into new jobs — associated with the arrival of new technologies throughout the 1980s — the equivalent number for the 1990s was 4.4%. Using updates of official industry classifications, Thor Berger and Carl Benedikt Frey further document that less than 0.5% of the US workforce shifted into technology industries that emerged throughout the 2000s, including digital industries such as online auctions, video and audio streaming, and web design.
 Fifty-one of the 71 new industries that emerged during this period were directly related to digital technologies.29 Figure 29. Labour Force in the US (1950-2014) Figure 30. Unemployment Rate in the US (1950-2015) Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics, Citi Research Source: US Bureau of Labor, Citi Research What is clear is that technology has already changed the way we work and will continue to do so. Whether it will create more jobs than it will replace is another question in itself. What we are interested in answering in this chapter is the following question: ‘What types of new jobs are emerging and will be created over time?
’ What we find is that is that there are a number of new and emerging job openings in different sectors including the IT, industrial, and health sector. At all skill levels, most jobs in demand will be characterised by non-routine tasks which are not easily replaced by technology or organisational change. Nearly half of the new job opportunities in the EU are estimated to require highly skilled workers, therefore acquiring these skills is extremely important for future employment and could affect the susceptibility of automation at both a country and city level. Jobs of the Future Predicting the types of jobs and skills that will be in demand in the future is challenging and often uncertain, but various detailed data sets are helping us observe such evolving trends. The European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) estimates that in the EU there will be job openings in all sectors with additional jobs estimated at over 9.5 million and replacement jobs estimated at 98 million from 2013 to 2025.
 However their results indicate some risk of job polarisation as the new jobs (replacement and expansion) will be created on the top or the bottom of the job sector. At all skill levels, most jobs in demand will be 29 Berger, T. and Frey, C.B., “Industrial Renewal in the 21st Century: Evidence from U.S.

One key feature that it has is the compilation of a list of ‘bright outlook’ occupations, where new job opportunities are likely to be in the future or at least until 2022.
 It categorises these occupations as: (1) those that are projected to grow much faster than the average (employment increase of 22% or more); (2) those that are projected to have a large number of openings; and (3) new and emerging occupations which include new workforce requirements, including changes in technology, society, law or business practices and are leading to new and emerging occupations in the US.30 The data show that the information technology career cluster has the highest percentage of occupations (62%) considered to have a ‘bright outlook’, followed by marketing, sales, and service (50%) and health science (45%).31 If we just look at the new and emerging occupations, the largest number of job opportunities in the US are estimated to be in the health sector (>4 million job openings).

 Results of Survey- Promising Industries/Technologies for New Job Creation Source: Citi Research The Digital Economy: New Jobs Created by the IT Sector Over the years, computers and their applications have changed the way businesses function and the way we work. The Internet today is considered a fundamental infrastructure in most countries and has over the years and it has created jobs either directly related to technology such as Internet engineers and hardware specialists or jobs directly related to its eco-system — such as the creation of apps and the analysis of data. Employment in the computer and IT sector is expected to increase as applications such as the Internet of Things, Big Data, AI and others expand over time. In fact the top job trends on indeed.com’s website are all related to the computer and IT sector including HTML5 Developer jobs which grew by over 350,000 % from January 2010 to January 2015, MongoDB specialists (database technology), IOS, Android, Hadoop (open software that enables distributed processing of large data sets), cloud architects and others.32 According to Indeed’s industry employment trends, information technology job postings have increased by 8% in the US since September 2014 with a total of 329,244 job postings during this period.
 According to Cisco, by 2020 there will be a staggering 50 billion devices around the globe connected to the Internet and collecting data, and as the number of connected devices explodes, the number of developers around the world contributing to the Internet of Things (IoT) would increase from 500,000 to 4.5 32 Technology job openings have increased by 8% in the US Linkedln’s job site has nearly 39,000 data scientist job openings January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 41 million people.33 In this expanded digital economy, private enterprises connected to the Internet of Things can use Big Data and analytics to develop algorithms and speed up efficiency, productivity, and lower the marginal cost of producing and distributing products.34 Big Data is also being used in a number of other applications from e-commerce, marketing, medical, AI, and others. For every Big Data problem, the solution often rests with a data scientist. The Harvard Business Review dubbed Data Scientist as the ‘sexiest job of the 21st century.
’ According to Dr. Tara Sinclair, Indeed.com’s Chief Economist, the number of job openings for Data Scientists grew 73.5% in the first quarter of 2015.35 As of January 2016 there are currently over 30,000 Data Specialist job openings on Linkedln’s job site in the US alone.36 The US Bureau of Labor Statistics has made forecasts of future job opportunities in 2022 for IT and computer-related work (Figure 33 below).
 It is difficult to divide these jobs into the different applications, however it is interesting to see that the largest percent increase between 2012 and 2022 is in Information Security Analysts (37% increase), Computer System Analysts (25%) and Software Development (22%) with total job openings in the IT sector estimated at 650,000 in the same period. However, this seems to be quite low when compared to Indeed’s analysis where over 329,000 jobs in IT have opened from September 2014 to present. The difference could be in definition: the Bureau of Labor Statistics defines occupations differently than job websites, and therefore IT jobs required in certain sectors such as Data Scientists in the healthcare and medical sectors could be counted within the health sector occupational analysis. Even though IT jobs are estimated to grow over almost 18% to 2022, they only form a small part (<3%) of the overall employment in the US, estimated at 160 million in 2022. Figure 33.

 The Internet has also helped open up markets for home-based business; in fact 33 Cisco, How many jobs will IoT create by 2020? many-jobs-will-iot-create-by-2020- 34 The Office of Jeremy Rifkin, A Smart Green Third Industrial Revolution 2015-2020. 35 36 650,000 jobs are estimated to open in the IT sector Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions January 2016 © 2016 Citigroup 42 there are currently 53 million Americans that are working as freelancers, equivalent to approximately 34% of the total US workforce. Forty percent of these freelancers are independent contractors, 27% are moonlighters —professionals who have a traditional job but also freelance — and 18% are people with multiple sources of income (see Figure 34). Figure 34. Types of Freelancers (53 Million Freelancers in the US) Source: Freelancers Union & Elance-oDesk37, Citi Research In the UK there has also been a sharp increase in self-employment, accounting for two-thirds of the job growth since 2008.
 Self-employed individuals now account for one in seven of the British workforce.38 This increase is driven by new infrastructure such as freelancer support, plus good communication platforms such as Skype, and an increase in available funds through schemes such as peer-to-peer lending and through start-ups such as Uber, Task Rabbit and Handy (part of the sharing economy), which are transforming the way consumers access goods and services. While we lack the data to examine the net employment effects of the sharing economy, it is clear that it facilitates a new range of jobs. The sharing economy allows individuals to share products and services such as renting a room in one’s house (Airbnb), driving passengers to destinations (Lyft), and finding a number of tasks that one can do through apps such as Task Rabbit or Handy. The industry is growing and providing a number of jobs to freelancers and other individuals. For example Handy, which is a market for online and mobile cleaning and home repair booking services, has received over $1 million in bookings per week in the last year.
 Lyft, an app which matches drivers with passengers who request rides, states that some drivers can make more than $800 just driving weekends. Task Rabbit- a web based platform that allows you to outsource errands that you don’t want to do and connects you with qualified people who are available to help, has over 30,000 people signed up. Taskers set their own rates and according to Jamie Viggiano, vice president of marketing for the company, 10-15% of the subscribers can earn $6,000 to $7,000 a month.39 37 Freelancers Union & Elance-oDesk, Freelancing in America: A national survey of the new workforce. 38 ONS, 2015. 39 40% 27% 18% 10% 5% Independent Contractors Moonlighters Diversified workers Temporary workers Freelance Business Owners New infrastructure such as freelancer support and communication platforms are enabling people to move into selfemployment The sharing economy is providing a number of jobs and opportunities to freelancers January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 43 Could the future of work lie in self-employment, multiple job holdings, short duration and temporary employees?
 This theory has been questioned as today the majority of workers have full time jobs and full time jobs bring stability and other perks such as private pensions etc. However as stated in our previously Citi GPS report Technology at Work, as the economy becomes even more digitised, selfemployment may become the new norm. The sharing economy is expected to grow over time; with PwC estimating that the five main sharing sectors (peer-to-peer financing, online staffing, peer-to-peer accommodation, car sharing and music video sharing) have the potential to increase global revenues from around $15 billion to $335 billion by 2025.40 Is Technology Creating New Jobs in the Industrial Sector? As robots become smarter, faster and cheaper they will be doing tasks that go beyond repetitive, dull, and dangerous and will be used in other industrial sectors besides the auto industry (where today’s majority of industrial robots are used).41 Although robots will replace a number of jobs, they will also generate a number of new job positions.
 The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) estimate that growth in robot use over the next five years would result in the creation of one million high quality jobs. In 2012, there were 133,000 robot engineers who research, design, develop, and test robotic applications and 17,000 robotics technicians that build, install, test or maintain robot equipment or related automated production systems in the US.42 The numbers for these jobs are expected to increase by an estimated 30,000 for robot engineers and over 4,000 for robot technicians from 2012 to 2022 in the US. Figure 35 below shows the estimated direct jobs that are related to the increase in robotics including computer controlled machine operators and mechanical engineering technicians. There are also indirect jobs that could be created through the expansion of robotics including software programmers and data analysts; these are discussed in more detail in the section on information technology. 40 41 Auschitzky et al.

Estimated Direct Jobs Related to Robotics in the US Source: O*NET, Citi Research The auto industry has been using industrial robots in its manufacturing process for many years. However, job opportunities in the auto sector are expected to increase over time and new jobs are also emerging in this sector because of new technologies that are available. Automotive engineers who develop new or improved designs for vehicles and automotive engineer technicians who assist engineers in determining the practicality of the proposed design are both new job types in the auto industry and are expected to grow on average between 3% and 7% in the US from 2012 to 2022, with new job openings estimated at nearly 100,000 and 12,000, respectively. The skills required for these jobs have changed over time and now include analytical software design, computer aided manufacturing, development of environmental software, and others which reflect the effect that technology and regulation is having on the auto sector.
 Driverless cars, directly or indirectly can also create new jobs (even though they would definitely replace others). These cars could free up as much as 50 minutes a day for users, who instead of driving will be able to spend time working, relaxing or accessing entertainment. According to McKinsey, driverless cars could generate global digital-media revenues of €5 billion ($5.5bn) per year for every additional minute people spend on mobile Internet while in a car.43 This will undoubtedly create some jobs, in fact KPMG estimate that connected and autonomous vehicles could create an additional 320,000 jobs in the UK by 2030, 25,000 of which would be in automotive manufacturing.44 Most of the job creation would occur indirectly because of improvements to productivity and greater mobility of workers and in adjacent sectors such as telecoms and digital media as new markets will be created by connected and autonomous vehicles.

In fact a company called Measure has just recently been given permission for 324 commercial drones to be used for a number of applications. The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International has stated that precision agriculture and public safety are the most promising commercial and civil markets for drones.
 They estimate that the economic impact of the integration of UAS into the National Airspace System will total more than $13.6 billion in 2017 and will create more than 34,000 and 50,000 new manufacturing jobs in 2017 and 2025 respectively with a total job creation estimated at 103,776 by 2025 (this includes both direct and indirect jobs). However unmanned aircraft systems will replace other jobs such as some farming jobs (even though the agriculture sector in the US has automated the majority of its processes), surveillance of oil and gas pipelines, construction site monitoring etc. and if Amazon succeeds in using drones for its delivery services, some delivery driver jobs could also be lost. New Jobs that are ‘Needed’ in Society There are many other new and emerging jobs that are being created and will continue to be created over time. In this section we focus on two particular industries which are growing — the health sector and the environmental/green sector.
 Both industries are experiencing growth because there is a particular need or ‘requirement’ for them in today’s society. The health sector is expected to add more than 4 million new jobs in the US from 2012 to 2022 and is projected to become one of the fastest growing industries in the US economy (Figure 36). Health care job openings in the US have increased by 23% from September 2014 to September 2015, reaching a staggering 852,200 job openings in that time period.45 In the EU it is estimated that the health care sector accounts for about 17 million of all jobs and is predicted to continue growing with an estimate of 8 million openings between 2010 and 2020.46 A number of factors are expected to lead to the growth in this sector and therefore job opportunities including: (1) a growing population; (2) an increase in life expectancy; (3) chronic conditions such as obesity and diabetes which increase the demand for health care to prevent, manage and/or treat such conditions; (4) improvement in medicine and technology which is expected to increase the demand for health care services; and (5) more people getting health care insurance (especially in the US). 45 46 The European Observatory on Health Systems and Polices, (2014) “Health Professional Mobility in a Changing Europe”, edited by James Buchan, Matthias Wismar, Irene A.

49 The health systems in most EU Member States are also coming under pressure as a result of people living longer, while its health workforce itself is aging. The European Commission projects a shortage of around 1 million health professionals in the EU in 2020 (590,000 nurses, 230,000 medical doctors and 150,000 dentists, pharmacists and physiotherapists), if no measures are taken to encourage people to work in this sector. In Japan the situation is not much better; it is estimated that an additional 800,000 more health workers would be needed in nursing care in the coming decade, with a shortage of workers estimated at 380,000.50 The Japanese government is taking steps to secure enough nursing care workers to meet this growing demand, including increasing compensation, providing incentives to lure back staff who have left the industry, and encouraging robot technology to be developed to assist the elderly. The increase in digital healthcare is also fuelling demand for specialised skills which range from managing electronic records to analysing the data generated by remote patient monitoring devices. For example doctors can now remotely monitor one’s heart beat or levels of sugar for diabetes.
 This generates a mountain of data that needs to be analysed, stored, and acted upon. Technological changes will call for a different type of healthcare worker. In fact the O⋆NET have identified a number of new and emerging jobs in this sector, including bioinformatic technicians, informatic nurse specialists and clinical data managers, which are all estimated to grow well above average. 47 Torpey, E., (2014), Healthcare: Millions of jobs now and in the future, Office of Occupational Statistics and Employment, Spring 2014. 48 The European Observatory on Health Systems and Polices, (2014) – see footnote above.

In the UK, the Office for National Statistics estimated that in 2012 the green economy added £26.3 billion ($37.5 billion) to the UK economy and contributed 357,200 full time equivalent jobs, an increase of 5.
3% since 2010. Wastewater and waste management services contributed to the largest value added and employment at £9.4 billion ($13.4 billion) and over 120,000 full time jobs. However other sectors such as renewable energy are also growing. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), global renewable energy jobs reached an estimated 7.
7 million globally in 2014 (excluding large hydropower), which is an 18% increase from the previous year51 with the majority of the jobs (over 3 million) found in China. The Citi GPS report Energy Darwinism II estimated that the use of renewable energy in the power sector under Citi’s ‘Action’ scenario would increase from 6% in 2012 to 34% by 2040 which will undoubtedly create new jobs in this sector. In the US, there are currently 2.1 million people working in the renewable sector (solar, wind and geothermal). This is number is estimated to increase to 2.8 million by 2022 (Figure 37).
 These figures could increase even further following the deal being reached on climate change at the UN COP21 meeting in Paris at the end of 2015. Figure 37. Solar and Wind Jobs Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics, Citi Research It is not just wind turbine engineers and solar panel installers who can look forward to more work, new careers in this sector will spring up across many areas. Most companies today are either measuring or thinking about measuring their greenhouse gas emissions, their water use, and how to make their supply chains more sustainable. Other new and emerging jobs in the US mentioned on the O*NET website include energy auditors (+202,000 jobs in 2022), climate change analysts (+39,700 jobs in 2022), and fuel cell technicians (+99,700 jobs in 2022). 51 ew_2015.

Where will my children be? I want to leave something for them because they could be in terrible straits”. This quote by economics professor and Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller sums up the fears that people are having on the advancement and acceleration of technology, be it at work, in everyday life, or in the choices that they make.
 How can we better prepare ourselves for such a change and ensure that we have the adequate skills to ensure future employment? The new types of jobs that are being created over the next decade will require people to be highly skilled with the know-how required to create the next generation of products and services. The increasing use of technology and the drive for productivity will raise the demand for high skilled workers, while in some cases depressing growth for low skilled workers. Cedefop estimate that of the 107 million job opportunities in the EU projected from 2013-2025, about 46 million will be for jobs requiring high-level qualifications, 43 million for medium-level qualifications and 10 million for low- or no-level qualifications- mostly due to replacement demands (refer to Figure 38). In terms of absolute numbers, in 2025 the proportion of people with high, medium and low qualifications is forecast to be 39%, 44%, and 15%, respectively (Figure 39). The US shows a similar picture with occupations that typically require a Master’s degree for entry predicted to grow the fastest (18.
4%) from 2012 to 2022, however the majority of the job openings from 2012 to 2022 are projected to be in occupations that typically can be entered with a high school diploma (4.6 million jobs). These occupations include retail salespersons, combined food preparation and serving workers, and secretaries and administration assistants. If economists and IT experts are correct some of these jobs and others could be automated. Figure 38. Total Job Openings in the EU by Qualification (2013-2025) Figure 39.

A charity called Go.On.UK has stated that currently in the UK, over 12 million people and a million small businesses do not have the skills to prosper in the digital era.
 The organisation produced a digital exclusion heat map showing the areas in the UK that are most likely to miss out on the digital revolution. McKinsey estimate that by 2020, there will likely be a shortage globally of 40 million high skilled workers unless adequate training and education is given.52 They state that technological innovation will demand a new set of skills in the workforce; it will change work tasks, automate jobs and also increase the skills gap for the jobs that remain. However, this is not something new. We have already seen this happen and we have managed to cope with such changes even though our work and skills have changed. Autor and Price (2013) analysed the change in job tasks in the US from 1960 to 2009 (Figure 40).
 They argue that the share of non-routine analytical and interactive job tasks (tasks that require expert thinking and complex communication skills) performed by American workers has increased steadily since 1960, whilst the share of routine cognitive and manual tasks began to decline in the early 1970’s and 1980’s — coinciding with the introduction of computers and automated production processes. The share of non-routine tasks also declined over the years but stabilised in the 1990’s, possibly due to the fact that some of these tasks could not be computerised. Figure 40. Trends in Routine and Non-Routine Tasks in Occupations (US, 1960 to 2009) Source: Source: Autor and Price (2013)53, Citi Research ** Routine cognitive tasks such as book keeping and data entry; Routine manual tasks such as repetitive production and monitoring jobs performed on an assembly line; Non-routine analytical- requires analytical skills such as engineering and science, Non-routine interpersonal involving managerial and interpersonal skills, Nonroutine manual which demand situational adaptability, visual and language recognition and in-person interaction 52 Dobbs, R., Manyika, J. and Woetze,l J.

 Beginning in the 1970s and continuing to pick up speed in the 1990s with the opening up of trade with China, India and Eastern Europe, competition from foreign imports forced US firms to outsource or automate their manufacturing process. This led to a reduction in manufacturing jobs in the US, estimated at 2.6 million between 1960 and 2013 and 7 million between 1978 (when manufacturing was at its highest) and 2014.54 However, during this period the unemployment rate in the US remained at an average level, even though different US states were affected by this change. As manufacturing jobs declined, retail jobs took over, increasing from 5.5 million in 1960 to 15.
5 million in 2014 (Figure 41 below). This parallel shift from manufacturing to a service economy also led to the parallel shift from a high school to a college economy. This prepared the workforce for an attainment of higher skills and enabled other industries to expand, such as business and financial services. Skill sets did change over time with highly analytical and managerial skills increasing over this period but the US workforce had time to prepare and was ready for such changes. Figure 41. US Employment in Manufacturing and Retail Industry, 1960-2014 Source: US Bureau Labor Statistics, Citi Research So is it different this time?
 One of the differences lies in the speed of change, with technology already affecting the type of tasks that we are required to do in today’s workplace. This means that we have to adapt quickly and enhance our current skills to reflect what is needed; not a simple task. In the past moving from a manufacturing job to a retail sales job demanded a change in skills, albeit a set of skills — interpersonal skills, customer services and sales skills — that could be easily obtained through training. This training was usually provided on site and could last from a few days to a few months depending on the type of business. However, training to become, for example, a data scientist requires an advanced quantitative degree in mathematics and statistics, computer science or engineering (88% of the people applying for data scientist roles have at least a Master’s degree and 46% have a PhD).55 Acquiring such high skills is not an easy task, and requires an investment in education and training for a number of years.

Citi asked its institutional clients this question, and over 52% of the respondents thought that one should definitely have some sort of IT/computer skills, whilst 17% mentioned other STEM subjects such as mathematics and physics (Figure 42 below). Surprisingly (or maybe not) over 14% also mentioned the importance of creativity and soft skills and 7% mentioned that we need to be constantly re-learning and be flexible in our job choices. One quote by a respondent captures the spirit and importance of creativity skills and constant re-learning brilliantly: “Focus less on pure academics, and more on creativity and presentation skills.
 The enormous likelihood is that however good you are at STEM subjects, there are likely to be people in the world who are infinitely better than you — this is to say nothing of the computers that will eventually take over all STEM related roles. Communication skills, creativity and the ability to adapt to change are hugely more valuable and a much better differentiator medium-term”. Figure 42. Where Should Individuals Focus their Learning? Source: Citi Research Other studies have highlighted the importance of adapting our current skills for future employment. One such study is the work that has been done by the Institute for Future Work, which identified ten skills as being important and most relevant to the workforce of the future.
 These include:  Sense-making - the ability to determine the deeper meaning of significance of what is being expressed,  Social intelligence  Novel and adapting thinking  Cross-cultural competency  Computational thinking  New Media Literacy  Transdisciplinarity - literacy in and the ability to understand concepts across multiple disciplines The respondents to our survey believe that IT skills and STEM subjects are important for future work Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions January 2016 © 2016 Citigroup 52  Design mindset - ability to represent and develop tasks and work processes for desired outcomes  Cognitive load management- ability to discriminate and filter information for importance  Virtual collaboration – the ability to work productively, drive engagement, and demonstrate presence as a member of a virtual team Geoff Colvin in his book ‘Humans are Underrated: What High Achievers Know That Brilliant Machines Never Will’ states that our inbuilt propensity for social interaction, communication, and empathy is what makes people special — something that machines can never replace. According to the author, these are the qualities that women are exceptional at, putting them in the driving seat. In our Citi GPS report ‘Women in the Economy’, we highlighted the importance of women in the labour market, where even just a 50% reduction in the gender gap in the labour market can lead to a 5% increase in global GDP. With an even more important role to play in the digital economy, women can become an even greater asset in the labour market. Predicting what future jobs and skills might be available or needed in the future is extremely difficult. O*NET uses the US Bureau of Labor Statistics data that analyses future employment for approximately 300 detailed industries and 800 occupations.
 The accuracy of projections of these individual occupations is subject to error because of the many unknown factors that may affect the US economy over the time period studied. Other jobs that the data highlight as ‘bright outlook’ jobs include traditional jobs such as baristas (268,000 job openings from 2012-2022), child care workers (570,000 job openings), and lawyers (197,000 job openings) which are all estimated to increase over the time period. Innovations in technology are likely to continue to reduce the need for labour to do routine work and cognitive work in the near future; however this is not to say that labour markets would not absorb the impact, as technology has been making inroads into labour for a number of decades. The nature of work will likely change and the new jobs that will be created will require a different skill set to the ones that we currently have or are training for. We therefore need to be better prepared, and aim to achieve skills that will allow us to work with machines rather than compete against them. Government, lawyers and educational boards should be better prepared to handle such changes.
 What is clear is that the largest job openings are expected in the health sector, this is not surprising given that we are living longer- demographic change is occurring in advanced and some emerging countries, this is discussed in more detail in the next chapter.

Highlights  The working age population in industrial countries peaked in 2011 at 388 million and is expected to decline by 30 million by 2030. Growth in working age populations for industrial countries has slowed from 1% per year in 1970-90 to 0.4% per year in 1990-2010 and is expected to fall by 0.3% per year over the next 20 years.
 Growth in human capital may also slow.  We calculate that the change in demographics could impact living standards by about -0.2% per year over the next 20 years, or the equivalent of 26 million workers.  Incremental productivity gains through automation could plausibly offset the demographic developments in a number of countries. However automation could pose more risks to jobs than demographic changes. The long-running decline in fertility rates in industrial countries over the last few decades — the average number of children per woman has fallen from 2.
8 in 1960 to 1.7 recently — is leading to some major demographic changes. According to UN data, the working age population (defined as the population ages15 to 64) in industrial countries peaked in 2011 at 388 million people and is expected to decline by roughly 30 million people by 2030. In Japan, the working-age population (WAP) already peaked in 1995 and in Germany in 1998 (even though most recently, high inward migration is leading to some growth in the working-age population); while in the US the peak is projected to occur in 2026. The recent decline in working-age populations and its projected continuation, stand in sharp contrast to previous decades. Between 1995 and 2011, the working-age population in industrial countries increased by roughly 50 million, after increasing by roughly 70 million between 1980 and 1995.
 Even though globally the working-age population is still growing (and indeed foreseen by the UN to continue to grow for the rest of this century), declining working-age populations are not exclusively an industrial country phenomenon: for instance, working-age populations in Eastern Europe peaked in 2008 and in China in 2014. In general, the peak in total populations is expected to follow the peak in working-age populations with some delay (e.g. for the industrial country age, the total population is expected to start falling in 2041). Meanwhile, as fertility rates have fallen and life expectancy risen, median population ages have been rising in most industrial countries, from 29.5 years in 1960 to 34.
4 in 1990 in the industrial country average, reaching 41.0 years in 2014. By 2030, the median age will probably have gone up by another 3-4 years (Harper, 2014).56 56 Harper, S., (2014), Economic and Social implications of Aging Societies, Science, Vol 346, Issue 6209.

Median Age in US, UK, and Japan Source: UN Population Statistics, Citi Research Source: UN Population Statistics, Citi Research The fall in working-age populations and the projected continued decline has been cited as a major drag on future growth — indeed, a slowdown in population growth was at the heart of the original ‘secular stagnation’ hypothesis of Alvin Hansen in the 1930s. The question is therefore whether, far from being a challenge that needs to be addressed by policy, technological change, including automation, could be the answer to the challenges that demographic developments pose. Demographics and Economic Growth Demographic developments can have a very significant effect on economic growth prospects. In a stylised way, economists think of potential growth as reflecting the contributions of growth in the size of the labour force, investments in capital and improvements in the efficiency of using the factors of production (labour and capital), including through technological innovation. Demographics can have an effect on all three.
 The most direct effect of demographics on growth may be through its effect on the labour supply. Growth in working-age populations for industrial countries has indeed slowed down substantially, from around 1% per year in 1970-90 to 0.4% per year in 1990-2010. Over the next 20 years, the UN predicts the average working-age population in the advanced economies to fall by 0.3% per year. In addition to the slowdown in the growth of the working-age population, the growth in ‘human capital’ may be slower than previously, as a lot of the low-hanging fruit as regards educational improvements may have been plucked: primary- and secondary-school attendance in industrial countries is nearly universal and improvements in tertiary education may not be equivalent to the overall improvements in educational coverage in previous decades.
 But abstracting from changes in educational quality, the labour-supply effect alone may imply that demographics would slow down average growth prospects in industrial countries in the order of around 0.5%pa over the next 20 years relative to the 1990-2010 period.57 57 As noted above the difference in average growth of the WAP is around 0.7% per year. To arrive at the rough effect on growth, this difference needs to be multiplied by the share of labour in production, which we assume to be two thirds. 0 200000 400000 600000 800000 1000000 1200000 19 50 19 60 19 70 19 80 19 90 20 00 20 10 20 20 20 30 20 40 20 50 20 60 20 70 20 80 20 90 W or ki ng A ge P op ul at io n (T ho us an ds ) Year Industrial Regions China 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 19 50 19 60 19 70 19 80 19 90 20 00 20 10 20 20 20 30 20 40 20 50 20 60 20 70 20 80 20 90 M ed ia n Ag e Year US UK Japan Demographic changes can affect labour force, investments in capital and improvements in factors of production The labour supply effect alone could slow down growth by 0.
5% per year in industrial countries January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 55 The effect of falling WAPs on GDP growth is not limited to its effect on the labour supply. There are good reasons to believe that slower population growth and older populations may weigh on investment and perhaps efficiency, too, even though in principle the effects could go either way. For investment, smaller populations (or at least slower population growth) may mean that existing capacities may suffice for longer and therefore lower investment needs. Or falling WAPs may push up wages and therefore increase the incentive to substitute capital for labour. Similarly, older populations may have bias political economy incentives against production and therefore hurt efficiency. Or a shortage of workers may stimulate labour-saving technology — after all, the drive to install robots in Japan has been linked to its poor demographic prospects.
 Figure 45. China’s Population Age Structure in 2015 Figure 46. China’s Population Age Structure in 2050 Source: UN Population Statistics, Citi Research Source: UN Population Statistics, Citi Research Overall, slower population growth is, other things equal, likely to be associated with slower GDP growth. However, when it comes to standards of living, it is mostly GDP growth per capita rather than GDP growth that is of interest. But GDP growth per capita is also likely to be dampened by lower population growth. The reason is that, at least for some time, lower working-age population growth is likely to be associated with rising dependency ratios (the ratio of those of working-age population relative to those too young or too old to work).
 The average dependency ratio (specifically the number of people aged up to 15 and above 64 divided by the number of people aged 15-64) in industrial countries fell from 58 per 100 people in 1960 until it troughed in 2005 at 47.5. In 2014, it stood at 50.8 and continues to rise quickly. By 2030, the UN estimates the average dependency ratio to be 64, with the dependency ratio to be around or above 70 in Germany, Italy or Japan (the dependency ratio in the US and UK is forecast to be close to the industrial country average). In China, the rise in dependency ratios is also likely to be quite dramatic, in part due to its ill-fated one-child policy: China’s working-age population is expected to decrease from 1 billion people in 2015 to 960 billion in 2030 and 800 billion people in 2050, whilst its population aged 65 and over is projected to increase by 240 million people by 2050 (Figure 45 and Figure 46).
 Its dependency ratio is set for a steep rise: from 36 in 2014 to 47 in 2030 and 70 by 2050. 100 50 0 50 100 0-4 5-9 10-14 15-19 20-24 25-29 30-34 35-39 40-44 45-49 50-54 55-59 60-64 65-69 70-74 75-79 80-84 85-89 90-94 95-99 100+ Population (in millions) Ag e Female Male 100 50 0 50 100 0-4 5-9 10-14 15-19 20-24 25-29 30-34 35-39 40-44 45-49 50-54 55-59 60-64 65-69 70-74 75-79 80-84 85-89 90-94 95-99 100+ Population (in millions) Ag e Female Male China’s dependency ratio is set to increase from 36 in 2014 to 70 by 2050 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions January 2016 © 2016 Citigroup 56 Figure 47. Comparison of Population by Age Group in Japan, China, and the US Under a Medium Fertility Scenario (%) Source: UN population estimates, Citi Research Another way to illustrate the rise in dependency ratios in various countries is to plot the change in the population shares of those below and above working-age, as in Figure 47. There we see in particular how the share of those above 65 years of age is set to rise strongly in China and Japan in coming decades (and somewhat less so in the US).58 Therefore it is not a surprise that we many job openings in the health sector as described in the previous chapter. Similar to our basic calculations above, we can quantify the direct effect of changing demographics on the growth of GDP per capita: above we highlighted that the estimated slowdown in GDP growth due to slower growth in WAPs in the industrial country average would be around 0.
5% per year. Meanwhile, the slowdown in population growth between say 1990-2010 and the next twenty years is estimated to be in the order of 0.3% per year. These basic calculations therefore suggest that the direct cost to living standards due to demographics may be around 0.2% per year. Another way to illustrate the demographic effects is that to keep the WAP ratio in industrial countries constant in 2035 at estimated 2015 levels, we would need 26 million additional workers.
 58 According to the Pew Research Center the principal driver of US population growth is likely to be immigration; the US is home to more immigrants than any country estimated at 42.8 million people in 2010.

Various indirect effects are likely to apply. We mention two: (1) congestion and depopulation effects and (2) political economy effects.
  Congestion and depopulation. Above we noted that GDP growth may be less relevant than GDP growth per capita. But economies or diseconomies of scale may apply. The former are particularly relevant when there are fixed costs of production or operation. For instance, a road or a school may be economic when there are sufficient users and prohibitively expensive when there are too few. Conversely, a congested road may increase travel times substantially.
 The net overall effects of these non-linearities for economic growth are difficult to sign, let alone quantify.  Political economy. Political economy factors are highly likely to have a significant impact. As we noted above, median population ages are rising across the advanced economies (and many emerging markets). Meanwhile, turnout rates tend to be higher for older people. For instance, in the 2012 US election, the voter turnout rate for those 60 years and above was roughly 70%, compared to 40% for those between 18-29 years and around 55% for those 30-44.
59 Unless these patterns reverse dramatically, population aging is therefore likely to put more political power into the hands of the old. Figure 48. Percentage Point Difference in Voting Rates Between Those 55+ Years Old and Those 16-35 Years Old Source: OECD60, Citi Research What effects such shifts in the demographic balance of political power can have is difficult to predict, but the presumption should be that, given that a rising share of the electorate will be in retirement, these shifts may be growth-unfriendly, other things equal. 59 Source: 60 OECD, 2011, Society at a Glance. -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Pe rc en ta ge P oi nt D iff er en ce Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions January 2016 © 2016 Citigroup 58 However, there are likely to be some mitigants for the demographic effects on growth, including longer (and often healthier) working lives (and higher participation rates for the old), policies to boost fertility and increased scope for migration to advanced economies.  Labour force participation.
 In the Eurozone, the labour force participation rate for those aged 65-69 rose from 7% in 2005 to 10% in 2015. In the UK, the increase was from 15% to 22%, while average participation rates for the old have also increased in Japan and the US. Policies to increase labour force participation rates are increasingly prominent, including to tighten benefit eligibility for the inactive (e.g. in the UK) and policies that would boost participation rates for women (e.g.
 in Japan).61 However, on average older workers tend to work less hours and are somewhat less productive than the average workforce: one study suggests that the combination of the two implies that a worker above 65 will tend to add just below 80% of the productive potential of the average worker below 65.62  Migration. Migration rates could potentially pick up, even though for now there seems little political appetite to allow large-scale migration (which, given that the demographic challenges affect a large number of advanced economies, would mainly have to be migration from EMs to advanced economies). The UN estimates that total migration to ‘more developed regions’, which include all of Europe, North America, Australia/New Zealand and Japan, is expected to amount to less than 12 million people over the 2010 period, or roughly 0.2% per year.
 The future projections imply a roughly stable flow of net immigrants (which is already incorporated into the projections for the total and working-age population cited above).  Fertility. Some countries are also trying to boost fertility rates. For instance, China’s recent decision to formally scrap its one-child policy should be seen in that context, even though it remains unclear how effective this move will be in raising birth rates and any effect on working-age populations will be many years in coming. Despite these mitigants, the economic effects of demographic change could well be significant, even though these effects may also differ quite widely across countries. The economic effects of demographic change are not limited to those on growth only.
 For instance, demographic changes may have distributional effects, too. As noted above, a shortage of workers could lead to higher growth in average wages and rising labour shares and therefore potentially reverse some long-standing distributional trends in many advanced economies, including in income and wealth inequality — and those distributional effects may be more welcome than the dampening effect of falling WAPs on average growth rates. In addition, shrinking and aging populations would, other things equal, likely have significant implications for interest rates and inflation, too. 61 Women in the Economy, Global Growth Generators, Citi GPS. 62 Barry Bluestone and Mark Melnick, 2010, After the Recovery: Help needed, The coming labour shortage and how people in encore careers can help solve it. An increase in labour force participation, migration and increase in fertility rates could all be solutions for demographic challenges January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 59 Can Automation Offset Demographics?
 A central thesis of our ongoing work on technological change and innovation has been that these changes are significant in both a micro and a macro sense. Pinning down the precise effects remains difficult, but the above rules of thumb at least give us a sense of how significant technological innovation needs to be to offset some of the economic effects of demographic change. Above we derived simple estimates of the economic effect of demographic change on the workforce, which suggested that those effects could be in the order of 0.2% per year or 26 million additional workers over 20 years. Could innovation therefore offset the (macro) effects of demographic change? Indeed, embracing automation has been among the strategies being pursued by various countries, including China and Japan, to address demographic developments.
 Even though forecasting the contribution of demographic change remains extremely uncertain, we suspect that the answer is therefore quite conceivably yes. For instance, a previous Citi GPS report highlighted that up to 47% of current US employment is at risk of being automated, a report by Deloitte and Frey and Osborne (2014) suggested 35% of UK jobs are similarly at risk and a Nomura and Oxford Martin School study put the share of Japan’s workforce at risk at 49%.63 Even though these shares are not to be interpreted as productivity gains, they suggest to us that the incremental productivity gains are potentially very significant and could plausibly offset the demographic developments. However when we compare the effect that automation could have on the labour force itself we could potentially see a different picture. For example Japan faces a large demographic challenge ahead with 8 million additional workers (12% of working age cohort in 2030) needed in 2030, if they are to maintain the same working age ratio as 2015. This is below the potential jobs that could be susceptible to automation (49%).
 So ultimately automation could pose more risks to jobs than demographic changes. However, we caution against seeing the race between demography and automation as purely one-dimensional. Both developments are multi-faceted and the effects of each are unlikely to always be offsetting. For instance, above we noted that demographic change is likely to have a number of political economy consequences, including through the rising political power of the old. Those are unlikely to be significantly altered by automation (unless the robots rapidly acquire voting rights) and are likely to have significant economic, social and political consequences, even if they are hard to predict for now. In general, the effects of demography and innovation are unlikely to offset each other exactly at the individual or sectoral level, even if they happened to do so in the aggregate.
 That is, those losing their job to a robot, will not necessarily land an equivalent job of someone who just retired. And those benefiting from technological innovations will not necessarily see their benefit withered away by increasing prices of other goods they demand. In general, the supply and demand effects of demographic change on the one hand and automation on the other may only in part overlap, if at all, for individuals and sectors. At the policy level, that means that rather than offsetting the challenges from shrinking and aging populations, rapid technological change may offer another layer of growing challenges, potentially complicating the necessary policy response and possibly magnifying it. 63 The Wall Street Journal, “Nearly half all jobs in Japan could be done by robots, AI: report”, December 3rd 2015. Embracing automation could also be solution to demographic change; a strategy that is being pursued in various countries Automation could pose more risks than demographic changes The effects of demography and innovation are unlikely to offset each other exactly at the individual or sectoral level Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions January 2016 © 2016 Citigroup 60 At the industry level, that means there will be opportunities as well as challenges, too.
 Demographic effects in each sector reflect the fact that spending levels change dramatically over the consumer’s life cycle. Figure 50 below illustrates this point for seven sectors in the US. Each sector with the exception of healthcare exhibits an inverted-U shape; this shows how consumers increase spending through their midlife years and reduce spending when they get older. The demand for health care is likely to rise substantially as populations age, and in particular countries, such as China, where healthcare remains underdeveloped. Meanwhile, it remains to be seen how well technologies can progress to satisfy the increased demand. On the other hand, transport services are among those that may be less in demand as populations age, while innovation in transport, including driverless cars, is likely to be rapid.
 In fact per capita spending in the US on transport declines by 48% going from the 45-54 to 75+ age group. In total it is estimated that cumulatively through 2030, the evolution of demographics in the US will subtract $360 billion from personal consumption expenditure to the current demography to growth.64 Figure 49. Average Annual Per Capita Income and Expenditure (US$ in 2013) Figure 50. Average Annual Per Capita Expenditure Based on Age Groupings and Sectors (US$ in 2013) Source: BLS65, Citi Research Source: BLS, Citi Research In conclusion demographic change is likely to have a number of consequences to an economy. Automation could offset some of the macro effects of demographic change - however this will depend on a number of factors as described above.
 Automation is seen in a number of countries as a solution to demographic challenges in lieu of the fact that it could ultimately increase productivity- however we are currently facing a productivity paradox- this is described in more detail in the next chapter. 64 Perspectives: How Demography is Transforming Consumer Spending: Evidence from the United States 65 Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Expenditures Vary by Age, December 2015 0 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000 60000 70000 80000 90000 Under 25 25–34 35–44 45–54 55–64 65–74 75 and older Pe r c ap ita In co m e an d ex pe nd itu re (U S$ ) Age Group Income Expenditure 0 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 25,000 Under 25 25–34 35–44 45–54 55–64 65–74 75 and older Av er ag e an nu al p er c ap ita l e xp en di tu re (U S$ ) Age Group Housing Transportation Food Pensions & social security Healthcare Entertainment Clothing January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 61 Impact of Automation on Productivity: Are Traditional Measurement Tools Failing to Capture Productivity and GDP Improvements? Highlights  We face a productivity paradox - if technological progress and innovation are so rampant, why do we not see it in the productivity statistics? Across advanced economies, labour productivity growth has slowed from 4% in 1965-75, to about 2% from 1975-2005 and 1% from 2005-2014.  Rather than a view that the 'low-hanging fruit' of innovation has been plucked we see limitations in the current measurement of productivity, a lag effect in measurement and a wider distribution of productivity across firms and workers  In our client survey 81% responded that technological developments are inadequately reflected in productivity statistics and 95% expect automation and technology will drive some kind of an increase in productivity growth over time. The New Productivity Paradox If technological progress and innovation are so rampant, should we not expect to see it in productivity statistics?
 Yet, across the advanced economies (and many EMs), measured productivity growth is low in historical comparison (see Figure 51). Across the advanced economies, labour productivity (LP) growth has on average slowed significantly, from around 4% in 1965-75 to roughly 2% from 1975-2005 and 1% from 2005-14, with no sign of a pickup in the most recent data (see Figure 52).66 Figure 51.

Indeed, some have argued that the ‘low-hanging fruit’ of innovation have been picked, as the benefits of previous transformative innovations (such as electrification or indoor plumbing) have been exhausted and that recent innovations have been much less significant than innovations in the past.67 In our view, three alternative explanations are more relevant.
 First, we point to several limitations in the measurement of productivity. Second, even though productivity may not be mis-measured in a strict sense, changes in the composition of production have taken place that imply a wider distribution of productivities across firms and workers. In addition, it is likely, in our view, that sometimes the drastic changes in technology we see today require significant adaptation and learning to develop their full productive potential and there is reason to believe that the progress in various technologies seen to date will spawn even more significant innovations in the future.68 Measurement Issues The view that current national account statistics are increasingly inadequate for modern economies and are therefore in need of some overhaul is gaining currency and has e.g. in the case of the UK led to an official review to suggest improvements in the statistics.
69 There is indeed evidence that current national account statistics probably understate quality improvements in a number of areas. Such understatements of quality improvement seem to be particularly evident for IT-related activity, such as the production of software (see Figure 53), where Copeland (2013) found that the US national account statistics probably understate the improvements in the quality of pre-packaged software by a factor of two.70 Other areas where quality improvements are probably insufficiently reflected are healthcare, education, government services, R&D and transportation.71 Note that for such mismeasurement to account for even part of the slowdown in measured productivity; its scope must have grown over time. However, in our view, there is good reason to believe so, as the share of the sectors most likely to be affected by such biases has grown over time. 67 See e.
g. Tyler Cowen (2011), “The Great Stagnation.” Also, Robert Gordon (2014), “The Demise of U.S. Economic Growth: Restatement, Rebuttal, and Reflections,” NBER Working Paper No. 19895.
 68 Our clients are also skeptical that a slowdown in innovation is to blame for the productivity slowdown in advanced economies, with a slowdown in investment and measurement problems the most widely cited factors. 69 See for-evidence/press-notice-charles-bean-kicks-off-review-to-future-proof-uk-statistics 70 See Copeland (2013), “Seasonality, Consumer Heterogeneity and Price Indices: The Case of Pre-Packaged Software”, Journal of Productivity Analysis, February 2013. Quality improvements for non-prepackaged software (custom and own-account software) are likely to be even more understated, as the methodology used for those product types does not incorporate much scope to reflect improvements in quality. 71 To potentially explain the slowdown in measured productivity, it is not sufficient that quality improvements may be understated, but rather they would need to be increasingly so. Even though an increase in the size of the bias for these products is often hard to establish, the growing size of the relevant sectors would suggest that a stable bias per sector indeed suggests an increasing overall bias in understating quality improvements. We offer three explanations for the low growth in measured productivity National accounts statistics are underestimating quality improvements in several areas January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 63 Figure 53.

Graph with Productivity Growth Based on Old Weights Note: Hardware refers to the ‘computers and peripheral equipment’ component of nonresidential fixed investment. Source: BEA and Citi Research Note: The custom and own-account deflators are virtually identical, due to a similar way in which the indexes are calculated. The Copeland (2013) line adapts the prepackaged software deflator by applying the bias found in Copeland (2013) from 1996 to 2013. Source: BEA, Copeland (2013) and Citi Research The measurement of productivity may also suffer from the fact that some types of activity do not appear at all in national account statistics.
 These include many activities that are usually not explicitly remunerated (such as the unremunerated services usually provided in the home referred to as ‘household production’, such as child-rearing, cleaning, cooking, tending the garden, etc.), and activities that are not categorised as value-added in national account statistics (e.g. some types of investment in intangibles, such as in brands). Current surveys may miss some of the production that is now more fragmented and produced by individuals (e.g.
 as part of the ‘app economy’), while other innovations that increase the ability to use existing capacity (such as ways to survey available capacities in real-time) are also often not included in GDP and productivity statistics. Improvements that save time but are not readily converted into monetary equivalents may also only be insufficiently reflected in national accounts. However, it is worth noting that the fact that some of these activities are not reflected adequately in GDP and productivity statistics does not necessarily imply that productivity growth is currently understated relative to the past. GDP statistics have always omitted a significant share of economic activity – e.g. a BEA study noted in 2012 that accounting for non-market household production would have raised nominal GDP in the US by 26% in 2010.
 One significant source of omitted activity, household production, has probably fallen over time relative to the size of the formal economy (the BEA notes that average weekly hours spent by women on home production fell from 40 hours in 1965 to 26 hours in 2010). And the shift from household production to formal work probably biased down the measurement of productivity in the past. In general, our clients seem to share the view that there are significant measurement difficulties- 81% think that recent technological developments are inadequately reflected in productivity statistics, and 36% think that this inadequacy is significant (see Figure 55 below). 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 Hardware Software Index, 1985=100 0.5 1.0 1.

In addition, compositional factors are likely to play a major role.
 One factor that may well be important is that there is some evidence that the dispersion of productivities across firms and workers has increased over time, a phenomenon we call ‘rising polarisation’ in productivity. For instance, a recent OECD study showed that productivity growth of the globally leading firms did not slow in the 2000s (the data run from 2000-2009) and was still 3½% per year on average in the manufacturing sector. But productivity growth slowed for the ‘laggard’ firms to a mere 0.5% per year, and the discrepancy between productivity growth for the leading firms and the laggards has been growing. 72 The divergence between the productivity growth of leading firms and the remainder was even larger for firms in the service sector (Figure 56). Figure 56.

For example, a paper by the New York Fed recently noted that the share of recent college graduates that have low quality (low-paid or parttime) jobs has risen over time.
 Compositional changes in the labour force (e.g. due to more migration, due to higher labour force participation in general or of women and older people) may also have contributed to lower measured productivity growth. The nature of recent innovation may also have played a part, as various of our studies have argued, i.e. recent innovation may well have become more disruptive and recent technological developments are increasingly of a ‘winner take all’ nature.
 This could be because recent innovations are less complementary (and more substitutive) to widely available skills than in the past and could therefore potentially replace and destroy a large(r) number of jobs. For instance, there is recent — and increasing — evidence of growing labour market polarisation. For example, the employment shares of both high- and low-skill workers have recently risen at the expense of the ‘squeezed middle’ in many advanced economies (see Figure 57).74 Autor (2015) notes that in the US out of seven broad occupational categories ranked by pay (as a proxy for skill) employment shares of the higher-skilled/higherpay occupations generally expanded between 1940 and 1980. Since 1980, however, the employment shares of low-pay and high-pay jobs have expanded, while the number of middle-pay jobs has fallen and a similar pattern holds across a range of other advanced economies, too. The winner-take all nature of competition in some sectors is also likely to be relevant here.
 Furman and Orszag (2015) note that the share of firms earning very high returns in the US has risen over time (with the bulk of these firms residing in the technology or healthcare sectors). Some of These Shifts are Likely Temporary It is possible, indeed plausible, that some of the developments we discuss will fade over time. The measurement of activity is likely to improve and to in part catch up with the changes in the economy. Recent years have already seen a number of changes in national account statistics, including widening the scope of intangible investment included in GDP statistics. In this context, it is worth noting that measures of GDP and productivity growth in the mid-1990s were revised up, sometimes substantially, as time went on. For instance, Figure 58 shows that LP growth for 1996 was revised up from roughly 1% originally to close to 3% eventually.

Cost of Sequencing a Human-Sized Genome (Base 10 Scale, Thousands of USD), 2001-2015 Source: Anderson and Kliesen (2006) and Citi Research Source: National Human Genome Research Institute and Citi Research On a substantive level, it is possible that for some of the recent technological changes to translate into meaningful increases in actual productivity, changes to skills, processes and capital are required.
 This adaptation takes both time and resources. That is, it may not be that current productivity is just mis-measured, but that actual productivity is subdued as the economy reorganises and retools to take full advantage of the opportunities that new technology has created. Indeed, the academic literature on general purpose technologies (GPTs) suggests the possibility of a temporary productivity slowdown, as the required adaptation takes place to use the new technology before productivity growth takes off.76 For instance, Brynjolfsson and Hitt77 highlight that in the 1990s it required complementary investments in organisational capital and new processes for ITrelated innovations to deliver productivity gains, which eventually materialised, while Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2011) note that electrification took 30 years in the US to produce major productivity gains.78 Systematic empirical evidence of such effects associated with GPTs is very limited, in part because there are so few observations of these big technological changes.79 Nevertheless, we certainly regard it as plausible that we are in the adaptation stage for some of the more recent innovations and that the productivity benefits of some of the recent innovations are yet to be reaped.
 In addition, there are good reasons to believe that the interaction of progress in the various technologies that are currently enjoying major (often exponential) progress will lead to additional major by an average of 0.4pp per year. The notable revisions prior to 1999 mainly reflect better measurement of source data, particularly in the durable goods manufacturing sector. 76 See e.g. Eichengreen (2015), “Secular Stagnation: The Long View”, NBER Working Paper 20836.

Figure 60.
 95% of Respondents Believe that Automation and Technology will Help Drive Productivity Growth Source: Citi Research Productivity ≠ Innovation or Living Standards It is also worth keeping in mind that the translation of productivity into the issues we truly care about (such as changes in living standards or the capacity to supply, which, given demand, determines the path for inflation and interest rates) is far from perfect. In particular, GDP and productivity are based on spending, which implies that they are not automatically good reflections of consumer surplus (the value consumers’ capture over and above what they pay for). The fact that GDP and productivity statistics are based on expenditure weights also implies that fastimproving sectors are likely to have increasingly smaller shares in consumption (unless the elasticity of demand in those sectors is very large). The discrepancy between GDP statistics and living standards may well be increasing. This is because in the world that is populated increasingly by products with very low (sometimes zero) marginal cost, the consumer surplus is often very high relative to the price paid, and it is only the latter that is counted in GDP and productivity statistics. Similarly, when it comes to increases in potential activity, measured productivity may not be the best guide.
 For instance, the sharing economy (including Uber, Airbnb, etc.) increases effective supply without finding their way into measured productivity statistics. 80 Pratt (2015), “Is a Cambrian Explosion Coming for Robotics?”, Journal of Economic Perspectives, Summer 2015. 81 See Boston Consulting Group, “The Robotics Revolution: The Next Great Leap In Manufacturing”, 23 September 2015, robotics-revolution-next-great-leap-manufacturing/ Measured productivity may also not be the best guide Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions January 2016 © 2016 Citigroup 68 Impact of Automation on Inflation: What Does this Point Imply for Economic and Interest Rate Cycles? Highlights  The rise in automation and technology is likely to reinforce the current low inflation environment, due to increased uncertainty and the narrow distribution of productivity gains.
 There is also good reason to suspect that current price deflators and measures of inflation are overstated.  We may already be observing some of these effects given the Phillips curve has flattened. To close output gaps, demand stimulus will continue to be needed, with monetary policy remaining accommodative and more creative in most advanced economies. In recent years low inflation – sometimes referred to as ‘low-flation’ – has been common across most advanced economies (see Figure 61). Anecdotally, the technological changes we describe seem to be pushing down prices in a growing number of industries – and even beyond the digital ones into those where innovations are inputs. The rapid advances in technology therefore raise the question of whether they may put even more downward pressure on prices and therefore either prolong this low-flation scenario or push inflation down even further.
 Figure 61. Selected Countries, Headline Consumer Price Index Inflation Source: National Statistics Offices and Citi Research The implications of a relentless rise in automation on inflation and interest rates are likely to be complex. Ultimately we think that the major rise in automation will probably reinforce the low inflation environment that we have observed in at least the advanced economies in recent years and probably also low (nominal and real) interest rates, but whether it does so will depend both on the predictability of the ‘Rise of the Robots’ as well as the distribution of the gains in productivity. However, the reasoning does not quite follow the conventional logic that current productivity gains are per se disinflationary, but owe much to their unpredictability and the narrow distribution of productivity gains. -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Canada Euro Area Japan U.K.

As Milton Friedman famously remarked, inflation tends to be a monetary phenomenon. In general (or under the assumption that monetary policy is effective), monetary policy can steer inflation towards its desired range by varying demand through adjusting the various instruments at its disposal. Our exposition of the impact of innovation on inflation here proceeds under the assumption that monetary policy is either ineffective or indeed simply assumed to be invariant for expositional purposes to trace out the effects of automation and other types of innovation in the absence of an effective monetary policy reaction.
 In market economies, prices are the main tool to guide production decisions: prices are there to equilibrate supply and demand. If supply exceeds demand, prices should fall and if supply falls short of demand, prices should rise. To find out whether prices and inflation will rise or fall therefore depends on the effect of innovation on the balance of supply and demand (again, taking policy to be constant). The direct impact of the increase in productivity is an increase in potential supply. Other things equal, we would therefore expect inflation to fall, i.e.
 innovation would have a disinflationary impact. But usually there is an indirect impact too: as Say’s law indicates supply usually creates its own demand. So even abstracting from monetary policy, it is not automatically true that productivity increases will be disinflationary, and indeed they have not been so as a general rule. But increases in productivity may well be expected to continue in the future. In that case, the future would be even better than the — already improved — situation today. Households anticipating such a bright future would in general then be inclined to try to take advantage of some of those future gains and smooth their consumption by increasing consumption already today – for instance by borrowing.
 Companies would be tempted to invest today in anticipation of high returns (and, again, potentially try to borrow to do so). The expectation of persistent productivity gains could therefore on balance raise demand today even relative to the increase in supply. In this scenario, where productivity increases are expected to continue in the future and their spoils are likely to be distributed fairly evenly across the population, both real interest rates and, other things equal, inflation would rise, and therefore imply that nominal interest rates would rise even more. Such implications are not just theoretical, but can be observed fairly regularly (and at least locally) in the face of positive productivity shocks. For instance, major discoveries of natural resource deposits usually boost investment, consumption and the prices of nearly all products in its vicinity and sometimes for a country as a whole. The big boom in IT productivity in recent years in the Silicon Valley has also pushed prices of many other products (notably rents and house prices) up rather than down.
 Far from having a disinflationary impact, predictable and widely shared future productivity gains would therefore likely lead to higher inflation and higher real and nominal interest rates, not lower ones. Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions January 2016 © 2016 Citigroup 70 The Predictability and Distribution of Productivity Gains Matters Ultimately, the question of how productivity changes will impact inflation and interest rates will hinge on whether demand will rise faster than supply. For innovation to be disinflationary, demand must rise less than supply. What could hold back demand? The main candidates are uncertainty or a very unequal distribution of the spoils of innovation. If the technological changes spur increases in uncertainty – uncertainty about the trajectory of innovation or more generally – desired saving rates may rise for everyone.
 If the spoils of the innovations are highly concentrated, the saving rates of the techno-entrepreneurs may well fall and their demand rise. But meanwhile, the desired saving rates of those negatively affected or at least at risk of being negatively affected may well rise. If the number of people in the latter category is much larger than in the former category, the result could be an increase in the average desired saving rate in the economy – which would be disinflationary. Innovation Will Likely Reinforce Low-flation In our view, both conditions for demand to be held back are likely to be satisfied. First, forecasting the future is always uncertain, but for now, the lively debate about whether innovation even today is fast or lacking suggests that current uncertainty about future progress and innovation is unusually large. This is not only the uncertainty about the path that the technologies will take, but also what impact they will have on economies and societies.
 The pervasive increase in uncertainty will most likely boost precautionary saving motives for many households that consider themselves at risk from some of these potential changes, while the fear of disruption may weigh on the desire of many firms to invest. Absent significant changes in policy, the gains from these innovations are also likely to be very highly concentrated. As noted above, there is already some evidence of a ‘winner take all’ nature of some recent innovations, with large between-firm differences in returns and income growth. There is, of course, also plenty of evidence by now that income and wealth inequalities have risen across most economies. It is therefore quite likely, in our view, that – absent an effective policy response – inequalities in wealth and income will widen further and that those increases in inequality in turn will boost average desired saving rates. Taken together, we therefore expect that even the prospect of persistent technological advances will probably boost supply today in the near future more than it will boost demand, which should reinforce the low-inflation outlook.
 In addition, the starting points are likely to be off. As we noted above, there are good reasons to suspect that current economic statistics understate quality improvements in many products. This would imply that many current price deflators — and current measures of inflation — would be overstated, as these price indices are mostly calculated on a quality-adjusted or ‘constant-quality’ basis. If much of the bias of understanding quality improvements in the statistics originates in investment spending, the investment goods deflator is likely to be most biased upwards and to a lesser extent that would also apply to the overall GDP deflator or the personal consumption expenditure (PCE). The question of how productivity changes will impact inflation depends on whether demand will rise faster than supply Absent an effective policy response, wealth inequality will increase and this will boost saving rates. Taken together technological advances will increase supply more than demand – this will reinforce the low-inflation outlook January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 71 Interestingly, our clients seem to be split on the effects of automation and innovation on job prospects: 51% of respondents in our client survey expect that innovation will create fewer jobs than it destroys, while 48% think that jobs created will exceed those lost.
 On inflation, the verdict seems clearer, with 66% expecting disinflationary effects to some degree (see figure below). Figure 62. Over 60% of Respondents Believe that Automation will Put a Downward Pressure on Inflation Source: Citi Research An interesting question is whether we may already be observing some of these effects. After all, unemployment rates in a range of advanced economies, including Japan, the UK, and the US are relatively low by historical standards and yet inflation is even lower (relative to historical norms). Indeed, there is plenty of literature by now on the observation that so-called Phillips curves (the usually negative relationship between inflation rates and the amounts of slack in the economy) have flattened. Put differently, there are signs that lower measured slack in the economy now puts less upward pressure on inflation than it used to in the past.

As noted above, there is some evidence that even these very low inflation rates are still overstated and we think that the rapid advances in technology will likely reinforce the current low-flation trend, due to the uncertainty associated with them and the narrow distribution of the productivity gains. Figure 64. Selected Countries: 2015 CPI Inflation Forecast (%) Figure 65.
 Selected Countries: Output Gap 2001-15 Source: Citi Research Source: IMF and Citi Research It is therefore likely that the current gaps between supply and demand – which according to most estimates are large – will remain ample or possibly even widen. To close the gap, some type of demand stimulus will therefore continue to be needed. Even though fiscal policy probably has a major – and growing – role to play, as we discuss below, the use of fiscal policy in most advanced economies will probably continue to face major challenges and constraints. It is therefore highly likely, in our view, that monetary policy will continue to be and have to be very accommodative in most advanced economies. In the first place, that implies that policy interest rates are likely to remain low across most advanced economies for a long time. This is not to say that we will never see rate hikes, but we suspect that rate increases will be few and far between, often short-lived and sometimes reversed.
 Indeed, we expect that the historical lows for policy interest rates will be tested in more and more countries and that negative policy interest rates will become increasingly common. In addition, asset purchases — fast becoming the most conventional of the socalled ‘unconventional’ monetary policy tools will continue to be used widely. But since even the more conventional of the unconventional tools of monetary policy (both on the interest rate side and on the asset purchase side) are already fairly stretched it is likely that monetary policy will become even more creative over time, including through buying an even wider range of assets than to date, more negative policy rates or explicit targets for certain asset prices (including the exchange rate).82 82 See High Time To Get Low: Getting Rid Of The Lower Bound On Nominal Interest Rates. -1.5 -1 -0.

Highlights  Robots are extending their functions in manufacturing and are increasingly being used across supply chains, warehouses and transportation. 3D Printing could alter both manufacturing and supply chains.  We find increasing examples that technology is increasingly impacting lower-end service jobs. Restaurant automation of both ordering and paying, via tablets in store or mobiles out of store, is starting to impact labour.  Natural Language Processing could impact jobs in call centres and report writing, while automated decision support systems can impact tasks.
  Technological change is expected to further impact employment in the media and telecom sectors, while Cloud computing could have a significant impact on IT employment. In the previous chapters we analysed the susceptibility of automation in countries and US cities and the effect on productivity and inflation. In this section our analysts report on the changes that they are already see happening in various different industries. Much of the work around the risks of jobs from automation looks at susceptibility over the next couple of decades. A natural follow on question has been- which areas look at higher risk in the near to medium term (3-5 years). Citi analysts highlighted a wide number of areas in the first Technology At Work GPS report and in this chapter we narrow in on several sectors including the food sector, journalism and business, call centres, factories and others impacted both by technological change and employing a large number of people.
 Figure 68 shows the ten most endangered jobs in the US in 2015, as listed on a website called Career Cast who used data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to estimate the jobs that have a negative growth outlook from 2012 to 2022.

Technology and computerisation is directly affecting at least four of these jobs including mail carriers and meter reader jobs which are expected to lose around 28% and 19% respectively of their workforce by 2022, logging workers (-9%) and drill press operators (-6%). Most of these also have a high probability score of being automated. For example it was estimated that meter readers and mail carriers have a 0.85 and 0.

 Casual dining operators have also increased automation efforts in recent years through the use of table-top tablet systems. Darden, Chili's and Buffalo Wild Wings have all implemented tablet-based solutions. These systems typically enable guests to see menu items, play games, view news, order food/beverages, and pay their bill at their table. One of the largest third-party restaurant tablet operators is Ziosk, which is currently installed at over 1,400 restaurants across the country (including Chili's and Olive Garden). Ziosk’s tablets enable restaurants to increase table turns and grow the average check. Additionally, the technology drives higher guest frequency, improves guest satisfaction, and increases the amount of guest feedback a restaurant receives.
 While there is a potential opportunity to save on labour, most companies who have deployed Ziosk to-date are focused on driving increased traffic and table turns, though we believe the potential labour savings could be a larger benefit moving forward. Industry commentators have frequently pointed towards increased labour competition as one of the most significant challenges facing today's restaurant operators. With numerous concepts expanding domestic unit counts, along with an overall improving employment picture in the US labour market, hiring and retaining workers has been a front-of-mind concern for operators for most of 2015. Restaurant wages have been steadily rising over the past several years and recent comments from Wendy's management suggest that the combination of rising minimum wages and increased competition is having a meaningful impact on operations. Given the changing environment the company could look to offset rising costs through self-service technologies. Internet & Mobile 20% Telephone 37% Walk-In 41% Other 2% Tablets like Ziosk are increasingly being used in restaurants and have the potential to lead to labour savings January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 77 "We continue to see pressure on wages on two fronts, one is minimum wages at the state level continue to increase, and as there is a war on talent to make sure that we're competitive in certain markets.
 So we've made some adjustments to that starting wage in certain markets. The impact hasn't been material at the moment, but we continue to look at initiatives on how we do work to offset any impact to future wage inflation through technology initiatives, whether that's customer self-order kiosks, whether that's automating more in the back of the house in the restaurant, and you'll see a lot more coming on that front later this year from us." Todd Penegor, Wendy's CFO (2Q EPS 8/5/15) Recent comments from Domino's management have also noted labour savings as an increasing portion of overall orders come through digital channels, although meaningful savings took longer than initially anticipated: "When we were first getting digital ordering going, I will tell you that we expected labour efficiency faster than we saw it. We didn't really start seeing a lot of labour efficiency in the stores until we got to kind of the 15% to 20% digital order range….And the reality is that you've got a fixed amount of labour in stores to cover shift, to cover the basic functions in the store. And when it was a relatively low level of digital orders, your ability to offset labour was pretty minimal.
 As it's gotten higher, we started to see more impact from that. And we're in the range now with digital sales around 50% that we clearly can see some savings in the store." Patrick Doyle, Domino's CEO (3Q EPS 10/8/15)86. Natural Language Processing To Impact Call Centres Interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has grown by leaps and bounds over the past few years, thanks to IBM’s Watson (on the Jeopardy! show in the US) and Apple’s Siri. NLP is the ability of a computer program (machine) to understand and interpret human speech.
 Ideally, the human should not have to radically change the natural way they speak. While this sounds simple, it is mathematically intensive as it requires algorithms that perform word and sentence tokenisation, text classification and sentiment analysis, spelling correction, information extraction, parsing, meaning extraction, and question answering. There are a number of examples of NLP usage in our everyday lives. Obviously Apple’s Siri was mentioned above. Similarly, Google has an advanced NLP application that is used in searches. The Human-Machine Interface (HMI) of an advanced car can recognise and interpret over 5,000 words — this is often used in a car’s entertainment system to change channels or to call a person from a list.
 But when one considers productivity enhancing corporate applications, the use of NLP in call centres likely tops the list. In fact, when you call a live call centre agent and hear “this conversation may be recorded for training purposes”, it is most likely the NLP algorithms that are being trained! Simple voice recognition techniques have been used in call centres for over a decade. We are all familiar with IVR (interactive voice response) systems, which employ a combination of voice recognition and DTMF (dual-tone multi-frequency) tones input via the phone pad. IVR systems help improve call centre efficiency and reduce costs. They are now widely used in call centres to direct the flow of calls and answer simple questions.
 However, they are fairly primitive deployments of voice 86 Ashwin Shirvaiker, CFA US Computer Service & IT Consulting Analyst, Citi IVR systems are widely used in call centres to direct flows and answer simple questions Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions January 2016 © 2016 Citigroup 78 techniques that tend to use key words and scripts that prompt the caller with specific questions and options. The leap forward is to understand context so that the machine-based speech interaction is as close to human interaction as possible. To be an effective service, NLP-based systems have to rely on open-ended questions — for example, “How may I help you?” — and understand not just the specific words a caller says, but also what that caller means. There are a couple of different impacts from such technology advancements.  There is already a loss of billable hours – this can either be outright job loss or fewer available hours for humans.
 This does not happen in every part of the call centre industry but has started to occur in both the telemarketing and the medical transcription areas of the broader call centre industry.  The “human” focus has shifted higher up in the stack of available jobs. In other words, simpler “Level 1” and “Level 2” jobs — those that involve simple information gathering, basic product knowledge and form-based trouble-shooting — can be automated. This implies that the average call handling time goes up since the remaining work is necessarily more complex. The three largest call centre destinations are the US, the Philippines and India. The US has over 2 million call centre jobs (this includes both in-house and outsourced jobs) while the Philippines is the largest outsourced call centre destination with over 1 million call centre jobs.
 While the above-mentioned impacts are difficult to quantify (especially the part where technology causes a job to change from full-time to parttime status), we believe that the trend will continue to be towards fewer but highervalue and higher-paid call centre jobs. Natural Language Processing in Journalism & Business The production of language is notably easier than the complexities of interpreting language. The Associated Press (AP) is already producing thousands of financial stories through its joint venture with Automated Insights, a company that specialises in automated writing. They produce primarily fact reporting pieces currently. However, with the increase in computing capacity and machine expertise the complexity and number of fields automated writing can handle is increasing rapidly. The AP has also started sports reporting where articles were either unwritten or written by employed people.
 Similarly, companies such as Arria offer combined automated data analysis and report writing. These products combine statistics and pattern recognition-based data analysis with natural language reporting. As computers increase in speed and algorithms improve the analysis, automated report writing will only improve. The amount of written content produced daily is extraordinary, and the number of people involved in writing content is also high. In the United States in 2012, there were 129,100 writers and authors, 49,500 technical writers, 57,600 reporters and correspondents, and 63,600 interpreters and translators according to the BLS for a total of 299,800 jobs. These jobs cover most of the externally generated writing about companies, sports, local news, and other topics produced daily.
 Writers that focus on fact reporting are already under pressure in some areas, with others at risk through combining data analysis and automated report writing. The US, Philippines and India are the three largest destinations for call centres Peter Chalif Head of Structured Trading, Citi Municipal Securities Automotive reporting could increase as algorithms improve over time Writers that focus on fact reporting are already under pressure of automation January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 79 Internal reports by banks and other corporations about their financial condition, risks, credit reporting, and other topics are numerous, often produced daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly. Management, audit, regulators, and investors all require analysis and reporting. In 2012, according to the US BLS there were 61,700 budget analysts, 253,000 financial analysts, 29,200 financial examiners, and 1,275,400 accountants and auditors employed in the United States for a total of 1,620,000 jobs. While not all of these jobs are gathering data in Excel, doing analysis or review, and then writing about the results, many of them are. Corporations are under extreme pressure to improve data collection and management due to regulatory requirements, management analytics, control processes, investor analytics, and the associated costs.
 While requirements for corporations to improve data collection and reporting could lead to increases in investment, the mechanical processing and reporting of information will likely experience greater disruption going forward. Technology Is Impacting Media Employment While technological change is everywhere, the pace of change seems particularly brisk within the media and telco sectors. Indeed, over the last decade, we’ve seen dramatic changes:  In 2004, Blockbuster Entertainment employed 60,000 people across the globe. With the rise of Netflix, the firm filed for bankruptcy in 2013.  In 2002, over 700,000 Americans worked in the newspaper, book and directory publishing business. With the rise of the Internet, employment in this sector of the economy dropped to just 450,000 by 2012.
 And, the US Labor Department expects further job losses. Physical publishing will employ just under 350,000 people by 2022.  In 2002, over 840,000 Americans worked for the US Postal Service (USPS). With the rise of email and social media, USPS employment dropped to 610,000 in 2012. The US Labor Department expects employment at the USPS to drop to below 350,000 by 2022.  In 2000, US consumers purchased over 1 billion CDs.
 With the rise of iTunes, Spotify and Pandora, US consumers purchase fewer than 200 million albums today. And, with the collapse of the physical music market retailers like HMV, FYE, Sam Goody and Tower Records all but disappeared.  With the rise of mobile phone services, US consumers are increasingly terminating their landline phone service. In 2002, nearly every US household had a landline connection. By 2015, only 50% of US households paid for a home phone. In tandem, employment in the telecommunications sector has fallen from 1.
28 million in 2002 to just 860,000 in 2012. The US Labor Department expects telecommunications employment to keep falling reaching just 807,000 by 2022. While you might think that the lost employment in areas like publishing, telecommunications and the US Postal Service would migrate to newer industries like web hosting or software publishing, job gains in these digital sectors are scant. In 2002, software publishing and web hosting services employed 680,000 people. By 2022, just over 810,000 people will work in these two sectors. Indeed, between 2002 and 2012, 33 legacy jobs were lost for every new digital job that was created.

Employment in Media and Telecommunications Sector Source: Citi Research Decision Support Systems in Medicine Decision support systems have a long history in computer science. Some of the attempts at modern artificial intelligence were simple rules engines, but the origins of Artificial Intelligence (AI) go back much further, perhaps as far back as Aristotle’s syllogism. Some of the core mathematical concepts of AI were already in development by the time of Thomas Bayes (1702-1761) and Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749-1827). Bayesian methods are still one of the primary techniques for machine learning, and implementation of the probabilistic models they create are a fundamental technique of AI. Given a set of data, Bayesian methods calculate the conditional probability of an outcome.
 Many fields require deductive reasoning, and one of the most common of those is medicine, and particularly diagnostic medicine, which gathers symptoms and test data to form an opinion on a particular case. Fifty years ago there were far fewer blood and tissue tests available, and the accuracy of those tests had a large error term. For example, the resolution of the X-ray wasn’t very clear, and magnetic resonance imaging didn’t exist. Doctors had severely limited amounts of information, and often no information until the condition became acute. Medicine, like many fields, has become a field of both hard data, i.e.
 number of white blood cells of different types in a patient’s bloodstream, and soft data from the patient, i.e. “it hurts over here”. Most patients aren’t able to identify when their spleen hurts, so data from the patient might be understandably vague. With the refinement of biomarker tests, genetic testing, high-resolution X-rays, MRIs, PET scans, dual xray bone densitometers and countless other technologies, the practice of diagnostic medicine is changing. Diagnostic medicine is becoming a mechanical process of ordering tests, reviewing automatically generated results and drawing a data-driven conclusion.
 Testing laboratories typically provide acceptable ranges for results along with the result itself, making it even easier for doctors to focus on a subset of data most relevant to the case. 2002 2012 2022E Telecommunications (legacy) 1,281 858 807 + Postal Service (legacy) 842 611 442 + Newspaper, book, and directory publishing (legacy) 711 452 347 +Hosting, data processing (digital) 428 424 453 + Video and sound recording (legacy) 388 372 350 + Broadcasting (legacy) 334 285 297 + Software publishing (digital) 253 286 359 = Total information services employment ('000) 4,237 3,289 3,054 Hosting, data processing 428 424 453 + Software publishing 253 286 359 = Total 'digital' 681 710 812 + Total information services employment 4,237 3,289 3,054 = Share from digital 16% 22% 27% memo: legacy job loss to digital job gain 33.4x 3.3x Total information services employment ('000) 4,237 3,289 3,054 / Total employment ('000) 142,295 145,356 160,984 = Share from information Services 2.98% 2.26% 1.
90% Peter Chalif Head of Structured Trading, Citi Municipal Securities January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 81 Proactive scanning for potential issues would allow significantly earlier diagnosis, and in some cases determines successful or unsuccessful outcomes. Increased automation can help reduce the cost of testing, and how much human time it would take to review all the data. Moving to a higher level, systems such as IBM’s Watson for Medicine can be described as “cognitive diagnostic engines”. By accessing patient data, prior diagnoses, journal articles, and using data and natural language processing to form patterns of diagnosis, a machine with a large amount of data and the right algorithms can perform diagnoses that approach or exceed the performance of an experienced doctor. Most medical diagnoses “fit” within a recognised pattern with constraints, exactly what machines do well. Unlike humans, machines will not make mistakes because it is tired or be blinded by false bias or pre-judge a situation.
 Cognitive diagnostic engines will also be assimilating new information, and can near instantly share that information across all machines like it. A frequent complaint about decision support systems from human practitioners in medicine is that machine decisions are typically difficult to understand or in some cases interrogable. When implementing AI systems in finance we hear exactly the same complaint. One of the critical areas of development needed in these systems is to provide AI with a method to explain why it arrived at a particular conclusion. The natural language production methods described above are an important component of that. When decision support systems improve their ability to provide insight into their decision, greater acceptance is likely to come next.
 Functions employed in the medical industry will shift towards more technology and the industry will attract engineers, data scientists, and researchers. Non-specialised family physicians may find themselves marginalised by health centres staffed with a team of nurse practitioners armed with Watson Health and overseen by a single doctor. One example of commoditisation of medicine is evident with eye doctor offices in chain eyeglass stores. The impact on employment in medicine will likely be greater specialisation, more technical and engineering staff, and reduction in the number and compensation of mid-skilled participants Impact of Cloud Computing on IT Employment Technology overall is about driving automation, human productivity, and process efficiency and thus for many years has been at odds with employment growth. Examples here are countless. The manual phone operator was replaced with automated switchboards and PBX systems.
 Forms processing (highly people intensive) has been replaced by an end-to-end digital process (IT-based), reducing employment in areas such as claims processing in insurance and new customer activation in telecommunications. Floor brokers in stock exchanges and clerks in clearinghouses have been replaced with computer systems that automatically match up and clear trades. The majority of these gains that have come from adoption of IT have been in non-IT areas. IT has used technology itself to drive increased automation, productivity, and efficiencies. Over time, the incremental demand for IT, driven by price elasticity, has usurped the efficiency gains IT has found in its own organisation. Over the last 12 years, IT headcount has grown by 4% (~6x overall employment growth) in the US with total employment of approximately 4 million people (3% of workforce).
 Machines like IBM’s Watson can perform diagnoses that exceed the performance of an experienced doctor The medical industry will shift towards more technology attracting more data scientists, engineers etc. Walter H Pritchard, CFA US Software Analyst, Citi Steve Rogers US Software Associate, Citi Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions January 2016 © 2016 Citigroup 82 Figure 72. Total US Employment vs. IT Employment Figure 73. Growth in Total US Employment vs. IT Employment Source: BLS, Citi Research Source: BLS, Citi Research The mainstream adoption of cloud computing has the potential to change this dynamic.
 The disruptive trend here, in our view, is the advent of utility-like public cloud services from the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. These providers have assembled IT capacity that is several orders of magnitude greater than what the largest corporate buyers of IT run in house (banks, telecoms, and government agencies), not to mention exponentially dwarfing the scale of the average IT shop. As customers adopt Amazon’s AWS, they no longer need to manage their own servers and employ as many systems administrators to perform these duties. The public cloud players employ scale and automation that enables a very low ratio of headcount to IT capacity. For example, we believe a well-run enterprise IT organisation has “server to admin” ratio of 40:1. In the technology industry, where companies are running businesses primarily off their servers, we hear of ratios of ~150:1.
 We believe highly automated public cloud services are able to run 5,000+:1 ratios. Here, some quick math would suggest that 124 system administrators or support personnel could be eliminated for each 5,000 servers that move to the public cloud. Also, over time, as internal IT groups are pressured by the economics, they will be forced to run their operations more efficiently. This indirect pressure will likely lead to further automation and an increase in the server to admin ratio. Figure 74. US IT Employment by Category Source: BLS, Citi Research 0.

This would include job titles such as systems administrator, database administrators and IT support professional. The potential counterpoint here is whether the general efficiencies of cloud computing drive enough elasticity of demand that there is an acceleration in job creation in areas such as software programmers and generally in the technology, telecom and Internet industries. These fields/industries employ 5-6% of the US population and will likely to continue to see secular growth despite potential pressures in other areas of IT. The Increased Use of Robots in Warehouses Amazon continues to take share within retail and automate the processes within the 120 giant warehouses that it has worldwide.
 Since acquiring Kiva Systems (now Amazon Robotics) in 2012 for $775 million, Amazon employs about 30,000 Kiva robots in 13 fulfilment centres (as of Oct 2015), up from 1,400 at the end of 2013. In total it is estimated in 2015 that over 780,000 people in the US were employed in warehousing and storage centres.87 Amazon’s workers used to roam around in the warehouses searching for the products needed to fulfil each order. Now, with the help from Kiva robots, the shelves themselves glide across the floor to the workers, who then pick and pack the goods. According to Amazon, Kiva robots have significantly reduced the order processing time from 1.5 hours to as fast as 13 minutes.
 While the mobile shelves are faster and more efficient, having workers pick the items off the shelves by hand is still an expensive and tedious task. This inspired the Amazon Picking Challenge in 2015, to find ways to replace the human stock picker with robots. The winning team came from the Technical University of Berlin. Figure 76. Before the Deployment of Kiva Robots Figure 77. After the Deployment of Kiva Robots Source: Amazon, Citi Research Source: Amazon, Citi Research Beyond robotic shelves, items in Amazon warehouses are also tracked from arrival to dispatch from a computer system.
 Upon arrival, items are recognised by a sophisticated computer vision system after they are unpacked. At the packing side, computers allocate the right box for each order with its knowledge of the dimensions of each product. The computer even allocates the right amount of packing tape. 87 BLS, Fixed storage shelves Boxes to ship Staff moving around the warehouse Moving storage shelves Kiva Boxes to ship on moving shelves Staff staying in stations Nearly 50% of the 4 million IT jobs could be at risk if IT operations move to the public cloud Arthur Lai Asia Display & Touch Panel Analyst, Citi Figure 75.

While Amazon may be at the forefront of bringing the savings and scalability of robots into warehouses, logistics and distribution, we believe Alibaba and other ecommerce makers in China are also keen to develop their own robot logistic systems.
 In China, the warehouse gross floor area (GFA) per capita is only 1/10 that of US. Given strong ecommerce momentum, at a CAGR of 21% in 2014-17E, demand for warehouses should be strong, especially for modern warehouses equipped with automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS). In 2012, there were ~1,200 warehouses with ASRS in China and ~130 units were under construction. CLTA forecasts that the market size of ASRS could deliver a CAGR of 17% in 2011-15E, to Rmb32 billion ($4.9 billion). The adoption of ASRS should significantly reduce labour for transporting items into and out of inventory, allowing more accurate tracking of inventory and reducing inventory levels.
 However, it is the surging land price that is driving the application of ASRS in China, allowing for more storage space due to high-density storage with narrower aisles. On the same piece of land, warehouse with ASRS could be built as high as ~50 metres, to house more than 10 times the volume of a traditional warehouse. ASRS also ushers in Just-In-Time production, which requires sub-pallet level availability of production inputs. ASRS is a much faster way of organising the storage of smaller items next to production lines. This enables a seamless link to order processing and logistics management in order to pick, pack, and ship product out of the facility. By tracking and analysing the data of raw materials through finished goods, companies can control inventory levels, maximise the use of warehouse space, and are more prepared for the demands and supplies of the market, especially during special circumstances such as a peak season.
 Accordingly, the advanced production mode would require various hardware and software suppliers to complete the production process, creating jobs in smart equipment manufacturing, system design & integration, installation & maintenance, as well as customised transportation & delivery. Visual & Environment Processing and Cargo Transportation Many different fields use visual processing, where the extraordinary rise in the quality of optical sensors, significant reduction in their cost, and exponential increase in computing and algorithm capability is driving rapid improvements and expanded capability. Visual processing is typically used to map an environment and recognise objects. Other technologies such as LIDAR perform related tasks, also mapping the physical environment. One of the highest profile examples of visual and environment processing is in autonomous vehicles. Unlike humans, machines don't get tired, get distracted, have road rage, drink or text and drive, and they can monitor 360 degrees of visual field continuously rather than the typical human limit of about 200 degrees, not to mention the optical nerve's blind spot.
 While components might fail, sensors and machines are often developed to alert for a failure condition, and can be made redundant. On October 9th, 2015, the California Department of Motor Vehicles released its conclusions on the nine accidents to date involving self-driving cars in that State. All were determined to be human error.88 88 Other companies like Alibaba are also keen to develop robotic logistic systems Alex Chang China Industrials & Infrastructure Analyst, Citi Surging land prices are driving the application of ASRS in China Peter Chalif Head of Structured Trading, Citi Municipal Services January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 85 The adoption rate of autonomous vehicles will accelerate over the next decade due to the impact on human safety and also financial impacts through insurance industry changes. Multiple articles have described the potential economic impact of autonomous vehicles. “A World Without Work” by Derek Thompson89 cites driving as the single most common occupation for American men.
 Away from the more obvious jobs, taxi driving and trucking, there are other potential economic impacts as well. Computer vision and the development of autonomous vehicles could lead to fully autonomous transportation of goods from factory to end consumer, and disruption of the trucking, shipping, retail, and insurance industries. There are about 20,000 general cargo ships and 5,000 container ships operational at any given time in the world. Machines guided by humans already do most of the loading, transporting, unloading, and delivery of standardised units of trade due to the size and weight of the objects involved. With autonomous trucking, robotic warehouses, and self-driving delivery on the horizon there might be near zero or zero human work needed from the point of factory straight through to consumer delivery. The technology for all these functions already exists and the components are either partially or fully deployed or being tested.
 Daimler-Benz is testing autonomous trucks in its Future Truck 2025 program. Amazon repeatedly shows its brilliance and flexibility in logistics, and Bombardier's automated people movers (Bombardier.com) are one of the leaders in automated trains with over 40 years of operation. With machine vision and environmental processing as critical components the transport and shipping industries may change radically and employ far fewer people in the years ahead. Automation in Supply Chains With raw material prices stable or on the decline, labour inflation continues to be the biggest challenge to apparel & footwear manufacturers’ input costs (~15% growth year-on-year), and the industry is not seeing any meaningful offset from recent currency devaluation/a stronger US dollar. Nevertheless, the industry has been effectively mitigating higher wage costs with increased supply chain efficiencies, notably lean manufacturing, automation, and improved technology.
 New technologies include: (1) the use of 3D printing for creating rapid prototypes, drastically reducing production cycle times; and (2) systems integrating real-time POS data to inform the production process and thus reduce inventory risk. While currently only utilised by a small percentage of the industry, over time automation should enable vendors to bring manufacturing to local markets, thus drastically reducing shipping times (for example from 4+ weeks from Asia to days). Automation will also benefit the consumer by enabling new opportunities for customer personalisation/customisation. However, the majority of the industry is still several years away from investing in the systems, staff training, and adjusting their organisational structure in order to leverage these newer advances, with an estimated 85% of retail companies still operating as they did 15 years ago on manual spreadsheets and lack of real time data. Nike remains at the forefront of supply chain innovation in the industry with early automation used in its Flyknit platform. Management highlighted opportunities to eventually lower overhead and increase quality in more than 50% of Nike’s current production through automation.
 The company recently completed pilot testing on 89 Thompson, D., (2015) “A World Without Work” by Derek Thompson,The Atlantic, July/August 2015.

 The Increased Use of Robots in Factories Henry Ford II (president of Ford): Walter, how are you going to get those robots to pay your union dues? Walter Reuther (leader of the automobile workers union): Henry, how are you going to get them to buy your cars?90 The above conversation allegedly took place in the early 1950s, yet seventy years later assembly line workers still exist, especially in small parts assembly where humans have tended to trump robots on flexibility, adaptability, and the ability to visually identify and select small components hidden amongst an assortment of other parts. Is that about to change? Earlier this year, numerous press reports picked up on the rise of robots to replace production assembly workers in China. Guangdong Everwin Precision Technology commented that “by using 60 industrial robots, an assembly line that would have needed about 600 workers in the past now needs just 100.
” The investment was seemingly made to counter labour shortages in the region, but still evoked fears in the popular press that robots could finally replace labour on the assembly line. The rise of co-bots — collaborative robots that can work alongside human labour on a factory floor (rather than in a segregated area for safety reasons, as is common on an auto assembly line) — has stoked this argument further. Lights-out factories (factories that require no human presence onsite) already exist — Fanuc, a robot manufacturer, famously already has factories that can run without human intervention. Small parts assembly has (so far) been relatively more immune to robotics than in the auto industry. Human hands are more adaptable (so can switch tasks) than most robots, and small parts assembly is different to the predictive and repetitive process of welding or painting in an auto plant. Features like dexterous grippers, sensitive force control feedback, and visual identification software are changing this.
 This year’s Hannover Messe in Germany saw the commercial launch of ABB’s Yumi co-bot — as well as several from other manufacturers — with small parts assembly a key target market. A couple of recent visits to factories in southern Japan highlighted not just the scale of automation at some plants but, more importantly, the scope for more work to be automated. In northern Kyushu we visited a Unipres facility which mainly supplies pressed parts to Nissan. This plant employs 365 full-time employees but has more than 500 Fanuc robots. These robots are picking up random parts from bins delivered to their cells (taking advantage of Fanuc's 3D vision systems) and then literally handing them over to the next robot which sets them in place to be welded (again by robots), before being assembled by more robots. Some processes like loading sheet metal into the magazine of a press are still labour intensive but it seems likely that this kind of job could be easily automated.
 This plant does have one co-bot supplied by Yaskawa, and its name is Kathleen. 90 It is not known whether this conversation actually took place with Henry Ford II or a manger representative of Ford. Martin Wilkie Head of European Capital Goods Research, Citi Lights-out factories already exist with Fanuc already having factories that run without human intervention Graeme McDonald Japanese Machinery & Shipbuilding Analyst, Citi January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 87 At THK's main linear guide assembly plant in Yamaguchi prefecture there are nearly 700 full-time employees. As the products being assembled are smaller, with more customisation, the level of automation was much less. We counted less than 30 small-sized, compact robots including a number of Fanuc's parallel-link robots, Fanuc's arm sized LR mate robots and Nachi's M-207 high speed assembly robot. However, what literally stood out were the five Nextage humanoid robots supplied by Kawada.
 With bi-lateral vision, these robots are employed at two places assembling linear guides, working outside of a cage with no safety curtain. These robots have name tags and we were impressed to hear that one robot called "Katunori" is at least 30% more efficient than his human counterparts. THK said that this plant has been visited by three large Japanese auto OEMs recently who all want to see these guys at work. THK plans to increase the number of robot workers but recognises the need to balance the concerns of full-time employers in a rural area with limited alternative job opportunities. In Aichi Prefecture, we also recently toured OSG's largest cutting tool plant, which employs 450 people. With an average lot size of only 130 pieces (and monthly capacity of 1.
5 million pieces) the manufacturing process is largely already automated but most of the inspection is still done visually. This is slowly changing as advancements in high-spec vision inspection systems means that this process can now also be automated with workers moved over to packaging and loading. However, with companies like Daifuku now collaborating with robot supplier Yaskawa to automate these very unique steps in the value chain, we wonder if this is the next process to be automated. Automation 2016: 3D Printing Additive manufacturing, also known to many as 3D printing, has the long term potential to revolutionise the manufacturing landscape. The technology combined with innovations in computer design software (CAD) will digitise production and enable deeper levels of automation across the manufacturing workflow. We believe the digital factory floor has the potential to expand the limits of product design, form, and function.
 More importantly, at-scale additive manufacturing could drive manufacturing to new levels of efficiency by automating the human elements of production (both design and operations). Today’s 3D printers have yet to achieve the speed, capacity, and most importantly the price to rival traditional manufacturing processes such as injection moulding and milling. However our visits to 3D printing service bureaus revealed that a factory floor with north of a hundred machines could be operated by shifts of no more than a dozen workers. While some engineers were on site to monitor and manage the builds, a majority of the staff were simply emptying build boxes and replenishing print materials. There are several markets where 3D printing has or will make an immediate impact. We believe the medical implants market will be one of the first to convert to a fully digital manufacturing process.
 In one sub segment of this, the manual process of creating dental moulds and implants has begun shifting to 3D labs. With small commercial machines falling below the $10,000 price range we have even seen a shift towards dentists bringing those capabilities in-house and cutting out the service centre completely. Special effects departments have also shifted a lot of prop making capabilities to 3D printing. The props are more realistic and cheaper to make with 3D printing. Kantunori (a name given to a co-bot) is at least 30% more efficient than his human counterpart Ken Wong, CFA US SMID Hardware & Software Analyst, Citi Dentists are increasingly using 3D printing for medical implants and dental moulds, cutting out the service centres completely in the process Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions January 2016 © 2016 Citigroup 88 Lastly we have seen the slow demise of the traditional model makers and job shops. This is a very broad category, but many larger manufacturers employ regional workshops to create one off jigs, fixtures, prototypes, and other products.
 We believe this lesser known craftsman has seen the most immediate impact from 3D printing and has made some headlines with unions in Detroit calling out that 3D printing has driven down the value of these jobs. Some job shops have adapted by rebuilding their businesses by incorporating the 3D technology. The next big step of the 3D printing revolution will require CAD software vendors like Autodesk, PTC and Dassault to get more involved in additive manufacturing. By more tightly integrating the hardware with software, the digital production workflow process from design to production would be completely automated. Given 3D printing allows for complete freedom of design, it could enable the creation of structures previously unbuildable, including moving components within parts. The ability to print moving parts within a single build could potentially eliminate the need for factory workers to assemble the finished product.
 At this time, 3D printing is not completely absent human involvement; technicians are still needed to periodically monitor the fabrication process, empty build boxes, replenish consumables, and perform some post processing (remove excess build material and in some instances polish items). However, even these basic manual processes are likely to be eliminated as printer original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are already trying to incorporate monitoring and continuous printing capabilities into systems. In conclusion we see a number of industries that are already computerising and automating a number of their tasks. The technology is improving at a fast pace, as shown in our discussion on natural language processing and decision support systems. Costs of automation are also expected to decrease over time as highlighted in the next chapter, removing the economic barriers over time and therefore encouraging new industries which have traditionally kept away from automation to introduce such systems. January 2016 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions © 2016 Citigroup 89 What are the Barriers to Automation?
 Highlights  As technology improves, one of the biggest barriers to adoption should be the economic cost of investment. However payback periods for robots are falling fast: 1.7 years for the most popular auto robot used in China; less than half a year in metal manufacturing in Germany; less than 2 years for hospital co-bots; or 195 days for Universal Robot’s co-bot. This is positive for companies and consumers, but not for workers.  However there remain some barriers especially in SME’s which pride themselves on their fixed to variable ratio, and have additional burdens such as high installation costs for bespoke systems.  Other barriers besides costs remain such as finding the right skills for the jobs available and systems lock in with proprietary systems, even though robots using open platforms are increasing.
 As robots become faster and cheaper they will revolutionise the manufacturing and service industry. The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) have estimated that global sales of industrial robots are expected to grow 15% year on year with the number of units expected to double to around 400,000 units in 2018.91 Service robots are also expected to increase to around 35 million units with a sales value upwards of $12 billion from 2015 to 2018. Despite strong potential growth, there nevertheless still exist barriers to the widespread adoption of automation and robotics in various sectors. These include the initial capital investment required, a shortage of skills and expertise, and a lack of understanding of how companies, especially small and medium firms can produce an attractive return on their investment.92 As we will see from this chapter the costs of industrial robots are decreasing, therefore reducing the economic barriers to their adoption.
 Collaboration robots are also becoming an affordable solution for SMEs that address both the costs and flexibility needs of these companies. Industrial Robots: Manufacturing Industrial robots are not new and have been in operation since the 1960’s. They are primarily used in just four industrial sectors: (1) the auto industry, (2) computers and electronics, (3) electrical equipment and appliances; and (4) machinery. Robots are used for a number of different applications including spot and arc welding in the auto and metal manufacturing industry, material handling, palletising and various operations for metal machining and plastic moulding, assembly, and pick and place, product inspection; all accomplished with high endurance, speed, and precision. Historically they have been quite expensive to own and operate and therefore are mainly found in large factories owned by large corporations with large budgets.93 91 World Robotics Survey, Industrial Robots are Conquering the World.

Elizabeth Curmi Thematic Analyst, Citi Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions January 2016 © 2016 Citigroup 90 But robots are getting cheaper and the economic and technical barriers to their adoption are beginning to fall. In fact the Boston Consulting Group has estimated that the cost of a typical spot welding robot used in the U.S automotive industry will decrease from $133,000 in 2014 to $103,000 in 2035. Even though the cost of robots is an important factor in a company’s decision to automate, issues such as the cost of labour, labour shortages, productivity gains and quality improvements are also important.
 Figure 78 below shows the average manufacturing wages in the US, UK, Japan and China. Despite China currently having among the lowest manufacturing wages, it is currently ramping up automation and is becoming the largest and fastest growing robotics market in the world. This push towards automation is in response to the rising labour wages which have risen by over 40% between 2010 and 2013 and are predicted to continue to increase over time (Figure 79). Figure 78. Average Manufacturing Wages in Different Countries Figure 79. Wages in China are Expected to Increase over Time Source: The Conference Board94, Citi Research Source: Citi Research Due to the decreasing costs of robots and increasing labour wages over time, the payback period of a typical 165kg spot welding articulated robot used in the auto industry is expected to decrease in China from 2.
5 years in 2013 to 1.3 years in 2017 (see table below). The costs of the automation could decrease even further if components are built in China itself, rather than imported. Figure 80.
